Van Morrison,4% Pantomime,/v/van+morrison/4+pantomime_20143310.html,"The management said they were sorry
For the inconvenience you are suffering
And mr. Booking agent, please have mercy
Don't book the jobs so far apart
We went up to griffith park
With a fifth of johnny walker red
And smashed it on a rock and wept
While the old couple looked on into the dark

Oh, richard, tell me if its poker
Oh, richard, tell me, whos got the joker and is it poker

Deuces wild, like an only child
Ill see what you got. How much is in the pot
You pay the tips and Ill collect the chips
Its a full house tonight -- everybody in town is a loser
Yeah, you bet

The dealers been dealing me bad hands
From the bottom of the deck without the slightest blush
And I don't know whether to call or check
But right now I feel like I got a royal flush
And my lady didn't show from frisco
But we had to go on with the show
Everybody got stoned -- it was a gas, it was a smash
Everybody got wrecked, checked. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, belfast cowboy, lay your cards on the grade
Oh, belfast cowboy, can you call a spade a spade

Oh, richard, tell me, is the game poker
I can't understand who the fool is that holds this joker
Is it poker

Oh, belfast cowboy, lay your cards down on the table
Oh, belfast cowboy, do you think youre able"
Van Morrison,A New Kind Of Man,/v/van+morrison/a+new+kind+of+man_20142917.html,"There's a voice cryin out in the wilderness
All your trails have not been in vain
And you're doin the best you know how to do
Gaining strength in the things that remain

Youre part of the plan
For a new kind of man to come through

There's an angel that's watching right over you
All your trials have not been in vain
Wont you lift your head up to the starry night
Finding strength in the things that remain

Youre part of the plan
For a new kind of man to come through

When a man comes through
He must do what he's supposed to do
When a man comes through.
He can't do what everyone expects him

Wont you lift your head up to the mountain top
All your trials have not been in vain
There's a light that keeps shining up ahead of you
Every step of the way that you take

Its part of the plan
For a new kind of man to come through"
Van Morrison,A Sense Of Wonder,/v/van+morrison/a+sense+of+wonder_20142918.html,"I walked in my greatcoat
Down through the days of the leaves.
No before after, yes after before
We were shining our light into the days of blooming wonder
In the eternal presence, in the presence of the flame.

Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision bright
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

On and on and on and on we kept singing our song
Over newtonards and comber, gransha and the
Ballystockart road.
With boffyflow and spike
I said I could describe the leaves for samuel and felicity
Rich, red browney, half burnt orange and green.

Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision bright
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

Its easy to describe the leaves in the autumn
And its oh so easy in the spring
But down through january and february its a very different thing.

On and on and on, through the winter of our discontent.
When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too
I said I could describe the leaves for samuel and what it means to you and me
You may call my love sophia, but I call my love philosophy.

Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

Wee alfie at the
Castle picture house on the castlereagh road.

Whistling on the corner next door where
He kept johnny mack browns horse.
O solo mio by mcgimsey
And the man who played the saw
Outside the city hall.
Pastie suppers down at daveys chipper
Gravy rings, barmbracks
Wagon wheels, snowballs."

Copycats ripped off my songs
Copycats ripped off my melody
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you

Gonna take you out
Get you in my car
Were going for a long long drive
Were going down to a town called paradise
Down where we can be free
Were gonna drink that wine
Were gonna jump for joy
In a town called paradise

Were going up the mountainside
Child you can look for miles
And see the vision on the west
Were gonna swing round
And look from north to south
Swing round from east to west
And go round in a circle too
And were gonna start dancing
Like weve never done before
I'm gonna take you in my arms
I'm gonna squeeze you tight
Everything will be alright
Were gonna get that squealin feelin
Gonna take you down to a town called paradise,
Down where we can be free
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you
By the river we will linger
As we drive down to be free
Were gonna ride all night long
All along the ancient highway
Gonna be there for the mornin comes"

Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more

From the old crooner to the deep, deep blues
Muddy Waters and John Lee too
From the master of vocalese
John Hendricks sang it with ease
Ain't gonna moan no more

Satchmo Jones playing the clown
It didn't stop him laying it down
He chose to smile instead of frown
He kept playing his gigs and
Moving from town to town, alright

No time to frown, ain't gonna moan today
Gone to town, gonna make my day
Do my best to create all a better space
Ain't gonna moan no more, man
Around this place

Willie The Shake said that life is what you make it
Somebody else said, ""Fake it till you make it""
But I feel much better when my
Feet are touching the ground
I get hip to the tip
When I hear that lonesome sound

Some peoples down, someone else's upbeat
Transform the norm, try to make it sweep
When you know things are helpless
Well, just can't be beat
When you know the score
You don't have to moan no more

Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh

Ain't no wolf at my door
Ain't gonna moan no more
Sing it one more time

Oh, oh, oh
Hey, ain't gonna moan no more
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't gonna moan no more
When you know the score
Down helps to moan no more"

Therell be blue skies shining up above
When I'm cloud hidden
Cloud hidden

Well I've got to get out of the rat-race now
I'm tired of the ways of mice and men
And the empires all turning into rust again.
Out of everything nothing remains the same
That's why I'm cloud hidden
Cloud hidden
Whereabouts unknown

Sittin up on the mountain-top in my solitude
Where the morning fog comes rollin in
Just might do me some good.

Well I'm waiting in the clearing with my motor on
Well its time to get back to the town again
Where the air is sweet and fresh in the countryside
Well it wont be long before I get back here again."

Looking like the flowers that bloom in may

Follow my lead, it is no wonder, I seem to be so high
Living my dreams the way I ought to
As the days go rolling by
See me strolling through the meadow
With you baby by my side
Wont you come and see me, all saints day?

See the streamline blue horizon
With you baby by the way
Wont you come and see me, all saints day?

Makes Jack a dull chap
When it comes to the crunch
It s too much I've got to stop
No pain and no gain it s driving me insane
I d like to be somewhere else
Like to be all by myself
Like to be down at the beach
Relaxing at the sugar shack
Hot dogs coffee black
Coca cola kicking back
I'm just a wild and crazy guy
But I m tearing at the seams
Before you can say Jack Robinson
I'll be seeing you in my dreams
She's on a blanket with a book
In the shade, white suit
Happy hour at the bar
And I m jamming with some friends
We're up to the same tricks
Drinking cocktails getting our kicks
Later on by the pool
Looking good ah, be cool
There's no craic double back
Moving on down the track
Moving on down the line
Got to chill out in style
Got to ease my troubled mind
Thinking just might be a crime
All work and no play
Makes Jack a dull chap
When it comes to the crunch
It's too much I've got to stop
No pain no gain it's all going
Down the drain"

Van Morrison,Ancient Highway,/v/van+morrison/ancient+highway_20142993.html,"Theres a small cafe on the outskirts of town
Ill be there when the sun goes down
Where the roadside bends
And it twists and turns
Every new generation
And Ill be praying to my higher self
Dont let me down, keep my feet on the ground

Theres a roadside jam playin on the edge of town
In a town called paradise near the ancient highway
When the train whistle blows
All the sadness that hank williams knows
And the river flows
Call them pagan streams and it spins and turns
In a factory in a street called bread in east belfast
Where georgie knows best
What its like to be daniel in the lions den
Got so many friends only most of the time

When the grass is high and the rabbit runs
Though its talkin to you and i
And every new generation comes to pay
The dues of the organ grinder jam
And the grinders switch of the sacrifice
Everybody made to be rational with understanding
And Ill be praying to my higher self
Oh, dont let me down, keep my feet on the ground

What about all the people living in the nightmare hurt
That wont go away no matter how hard they try
Theyve got to pay time and time again, time and time again
Ill be praying to my higher self
And Ill be standin there, where the boats go by
When the sun is sinking way over the hill
On a friday evening when the sun goes down
On the outskirts of town, I wanna slip away
I wanna slip away, got to get away
And Ill be praying to my higher self
Dont let me down, keep my feet on the ground, dont let me down

Youll be cryin again, youll be cryin again, youll be cryin again
By the same wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Have to slip away in the evening when the sun goes down
Over the hill, with a sense of wonder
Everything gonna be right on a friday evening
All the cars go by all along down
The ancient highway
And Ill be praying, Ill be praying to my higher self
Dont let me down, keep my feet, keep my feet on the ground
Keep my feet on the ground

Travelling like a stranger in the night, all along the ancient highway
Got you in my sights, got you on my mind
Ill be praying in the evening when the sun goes down
Over the mountain, got to get you right in my sight
As the beams on the cars from the overpass
On the ancient highway shine like diamonds in the night
Like diamonds in the night
Ill be praying to my higher self, to my higher self
Dont let me down, dont let me down

And youll be standing there, while the boats go by
While the boats go by on a friday evening
Shining your light, shining your light on a friday evening
Got to slip away, got to slip away down that ancient highway
In a town called paradise, in a town, in a town
All along, all along that road, all along that road,
All along that road with the trancelike vision

Ill be praying to my higher self, dont let me down, dont let me down
Keep my feet on the ground, keep my feet on the ground,
Keep my feet on the ground
Friday evening got to slip away
Watching the view from a car from the overpass
And were driving down that ancient road
Shining like diamonds in the night, oh diamonds in the night
All along the ancient highway
Got you in my sight, got you in my mind
Got you in my arms and Im praying, and Im gonna pray
Im gonna pray, to my higher self, ah dont let me down
Dont let me down, give me the fire, ah give me the fire"

With a silver half a crown
Hands are full of a fishin' rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

Then the rain let up and the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road
We looked at the swim and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

Chorus

On the way back home we sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes
Well he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you
And he said Hey! There you are

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

Van Morrison,At The End Of The Day,/v/van+morrison/at+the+end+of+the+day_20143311.html,"Tell me what do you get
At the end of the day
Is it all worth the while
Can you put on a smile
Does it fill you with pride
All the feelings inside
Or do you just wanna hide
Can you still walk away
At the end of the day

At the end of the day
Are you lonely or sad
Do you think youve been had
Is your heart ever glad
Or are you afraid
cause you dont have it made
That you dont make the grade
Or of what people say
At the end of the day

Instrumental solo

At the end of the day
Is your framework intact
When you clean up your act
Do they keep coming back
Do you say follow that
Pat yourself on the back
Do you get what you lack
Do they give you respect
Or is it after the fact
At the end of the day

Tell me what do you get
Is it heartachce and pain
Does it keep coming back
Everytime that it rains
When I see you again
Will it still be the same
Am I really to blame
cause I dont play the game
At the end of the day

At the end of the day
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
At the end of the day
Got to kneel down and pray
At the end of the day
Got to kneel down and pray
At the end of the day"
Van Morrison,Autumn Song,/v/van+morrison/autumn+song_20143015.html,"Leaves of brown they fall to the ground
And its here, over there leaves around
Shut the door, dim the lights and relax
What is more, your desire or the facts

Pitter patter the rain falling down
Little glamor sun coming round
Take a walk when autumn comes to town

Little stroll past the house on the hill
Some more coal on the fire will do well
And in a week or two itll be halloween
Set the page and the stage for the scene

Little game the children will play
And as we watch them while time away
Look at me and take my breath away yeah

Youll be smiling eyes beguilding
And the song on the breeze
Will call my name out and your dream

Chestnuts roasting outside as you walk
With your love by your side
The old accordion man plays mellow and bright
And you go home in the crispness of the night

Little later friends will be along
And if you feel like joining the throng
Just might feel like singing autumn song
Just may feel like singing autumn song

Youll be smiling
Eyes beguilding
And the song on the breeze
Calls my name out in your dream

Chestnuts roasting outside
As you walk with your love by your side
And the old accordion plays mellow and bright
And you go home in the crispness of the night"

You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill
Learned my lesson and I had my fill
Learnt it all in vain
Went through it all again
Now I'm back on the top again

Always strivin, always climbing way beyond my will
Same old sensation, isolation at the top of the bill
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow
What do you do when you get to the top and theres nowhere to go

Just how I get there will be anybodys guess
With all the so called trappings of success
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill
Too busy raisin cain

Its the same old sensation, isolation at the top of the hill
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow

It brought you shame and disgrace
The world has tumbled in your face
Because they call our love a back street affair
They say you wrecked my home
I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow that we had to bear
While the one I was tied to was the first to be untrue
How can they call our love a back street affair
Well we have each other now
That's all that matters anyhow
While the judgement of gossips never fair
We'll just be brave and strong
Then someday they'll see they're wrong
So let them call our love a back street affair
We'll be free to love someday
When all the talk has died away
And the happiness we hoped for then we'll share
And I'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear me cry"

I've been setting them up, setting them up
And I've been knocking them down

Make things always better than they seem
And I stop and start, and stop and start
And stop and start again

I don't want you cause I love you honey
I don't want you to ease this memory pain
No, I want you to be my ball and chain
Yes, I want you to be my, be my ball and chain

When I see you in the garden once again
Baby you'll be standing in the summer rain
Laugh and cry and say what it's all about
You can even jump and shout
And you'll smile and say how are you again
I don't want you cause I'm so blue
I don't want you cause you know what to do
I don't want you because all my love seems in vain

I want you to be my ball and chain

On the water or stars in the sky

But green is the color of spring
And green can be cool and friendly like
And green can be big like an ocean

Out of the window, into the falling rain,
And hes right on time, right on time.
That's why broken arrow waved his finger
Down the road so dark and narrow
In the evening just before the sunday sixbells chime
And way out on the highway
All the dogs are barkin way down below
And you wander away from your hillside retreated view
Went to wanderin nordhbridge way out on the railroad
Together all the tipping trucks will unload
All the scrapbooks built together stuck with glue
And Ill stand beside you, beside you

Oh child, to never wonder why
To never, never, never, never wonder why at all
To never, never, never, never wonder why
Its gotta be, it has to be

Across the crystal pavements
Way across the country where the hillside mountains glide
The dynamo of your smile caressed the
Barefoot virgin child
To wander past your window in the nighttime cross the floor
Crying as ecstasy surrounds you
Through the night air your proud time is open
Go well against the pointed idle breeze

Past the footlights of the brazen silence easy
In the night you cry and you want spirits to tell you
Everythings alright
Go ahead and do it one more time baby
Youre satisfied I guess, youre way up and the sky comes down
Kaleidoscope

Open and just hold the lantern in the doorway,
For the freedom of it.
And you take the night air through your nostrils and you breathe
In out, in out
And you breathe just like that, just like that

How does it get you when it gets you
When it gets ya
You may not know its got you until you turn around
And Ill point a finger at you, point a finger at you
You say which way, which way
That's alright, weve gotten hip to it
Goin to do it right now.
Behind you
Beside you, beside you

Oh child to never wonder why
To never, never, never, never wonder why at all
Never never never never wonder why at all."

Of the love that no one man could hold
Oh, she wanted more than I had money to buy
So she left me sad and lonely I am told
Big diamonds, big blue diamonds
Now she'll trade them
For a love behind a little band of gold
Blue diamonds, big blue diamonds how they sparkle
But what can they do to warm your heart and soul
When you're lonesome in the moonlight and you want loving
Big blue diamonds don't they seem so reckless and bold
I gladly do my part oh, to mend a broken heart
But a love that's warmed over soon grows cold

And they tried to have me deported
Stop me from getting work
Blacklisted me all over
They were vicious and they were mean
They were bigtime operators
Baby, on the music business scene

Oh, they looked like politicians
But underneath they were thugs
And they spread malicious rumours
Threatened to have me busted for drugs
They had nothing on me
Oh man, I was really clean
But they were bigtime operators
On the music business scene

They put a bug in my apartment
To listen in on my calls
I was looking for some motivation
I couldn't find any, any motivation at all
They were very desperate people
Riding in long black limousines
But they were bigtime operators
On the music business scene

They were glorified by the media
They were heroes who had names
They said that they would bury me
If I didn't play their game
They said I didn't know the score
And that I was young and green
They were bigame operators
On the music business scene

Tried to hold me to a phoney contract
I said I didn't agree
Had to get out of the clutches
Had to go underground you see
Now I'm living in another country
But I know exactly just where I've been
Stay away from bigtime operators

When I was a little
My mama done told me, son
A woman will sweet talk
And give you the big eye
But when that sweet talk is done
A woman's a two faced
A woman's something that would leave you singing the blues in the night

Now the rain is falling
Heaven can hear you calling
Doo wee
Heaven blows the lonesome whistle
Blowing across the threshhold
Doo wee
Doo wee ta too tee
A crickety crack go wickety wack the blues in the night

Evening breeze will start
Trees that crying in the
All in the world wood haunted slide
When you get the blues in the night

So take my word
Or the mocking bird
Will sing a sadder kind of song
Maybe he knows things
He knows things can go wrong

A match is a maybe
Love is the same job
Whenever the four winds blow
I've been to some big town
Had me some big town
But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two faced
A woman's something that would leave you singing the blues in the night
Blues in the night"
Van Morrison,Boffyflow And Spike,/v/van+morrison/boffyflow+and+spike_20153019.html,"(No lyrics, but related to this text)

So let us follow Boffyflow and Spike down through the days of the leaves. Boffy is covered with leaves completely the buckijit and Spike is in hysterics. On they go, on and on up the small incline, gathering sacks of leaves for burning in the clearing and waiting on McDole.

McDole has not been seen nor heard of since Halloween and everyone is getting a trifle nervous. Spike took the sheet of paper from his inside coat pocket and tried to decipher the code, but as he glanced over the page, he realised he had not noticed the note in the margin that said It means what it means, followed by, Wee Alfie at the Castle picturehouse on the Castlereagh Road, whistling on the corner next door where he kept Johnny Mack Brown's horse. O Solo Mio by McGimsey and the man who played the saw outside the city hall. Pastie suppers down at Davy's Chipper, gravy rings, barmbracks, wagon wheels, snowballs. A Sense of Wonder.

On and on. Spike and Boffyflow tramping with sacks of leaves over the Gransha road to Ballystockart and back again. Puck up said Boffy, It means what it means and we have a windfall. If we're not daft enough to burn these leaves, we can freeze them 'til next Autumn, study them and then let them decompose. If we can get in touch with your man, I would strongly advise him to do ditto with the documents.

Just at that moment, as if by a strike of faith, McDole came round the bent on a bike. Okay lads, you're on to something, don't blow it. Go out to the Isle and have a few scoops on me. The boys drove out in the charabanc to Daft Eddies and ordered up. And so down to work putting the documents in perspective. McDole got out the accordian and started to wail When heart is open there's loads from Ballygowan to Ballyhacamore. He spun round on one leg, grabbing Spike by the lapels, You're terrible you are. You blurt. He put away six doubles of Jameson from the bar and sank into a deep apathetic slumber, mumbling Blinkin' Cowboys, Blinkin' Cowboys...

Van wrote this (originally published as part of the liner notes of the LP version of A Sense of Wonder), and included an instrumental of the same name on that album. Some of the text from this piece also appears in the lyrics for A Sense of Wonder."

With my hands behind my back
I was longtime hurt and thrown in the dirt
Shoved out on the railroad track
I've been used, abused and so confused
And I had nowhere to run
But I stood and looked
And my eyes got hooked
On that beautiful morning sun

And the sun shines down all on the ground
Yeah and the grass is oh so green
And my heart is still and I've got the will
And I don't really feel so mean
Here it comes, here it comes

And it comes right in on time
Well it eases me and it pleases me
And it satisfies my mind

Days when the rains came?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,

You, my brown-eyed girl.
Whatever happened
To tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hidin' behind a rainbowed wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah.

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing

And her batteries are corroded
And her hundred watt bulb just blew

She used to hang out at miss lucys
Every weekend they would get loose
And it was a straight clear case of
Having taken in too much juice

It was outside, and it was outside
Just the nature of the person

After all, its just show biz

And I watch you run in the crimson sun
Tear my shirt apart open up my heart
And I watch you run
Down on your bended knees
By the burnt out well
Can you tell me please
Between heaven and hell
Wont you take me down

To the burning ground, to the burning ground
To the burning ground, to the burning ground

And you fall and pray, when you hear that sound
As were walking back to the burial mound
And you shake your head and you turn it around
And you see the flames from the burning ground
And you get down on your knees and pray
And I catch my breath as were running away
And I take the jute and I throw him down

Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But Ill sing no more now till I get a drink.

I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,
A handsome rover from town to town.
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered
Come all ye young men and lay me down."

You were just trying to make a living out in Detroit
When you came back off the boats you didn't want to go anywhere
You sit down to tv in your favourite chair
You watch the big picture fade away down at Harland and Wolff
But you still kept on choppin' wood
And you came back home to Belfast
So you could be with us like
You lived your life of quiet desperation on the side
Going to the shipyard in the morning on your bike
Well the spark was gone but you carried on
You always did the best you could
You sent for us once but everything fell through

With the wrought-iron gate rows

Bought five woodbines at the shop on the corner
And went straight back to work.

Oh, sam was up on top
And I was on the bottom with the v
We went for lemonade and paris buns
At the shop and broke for tea
I collected from the lady
And I cleaned the fanlight inside-out
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend
In that down joint.

What's my line?
I'm happy cleaning windows
Take my time
Ill see you when my love grows
Baby don't let it slide

Cleaning windows (number a hundred and thirty-six)

I heard leadbelly and blind lemon
On the street where I was born

Muddy waters singin I'm a rolling stone

Curiosity killed the cat
Kerouacs dharma bums and on the road

Id like to fly away and spend a day or two
Just contemplating the fields and leaves and talking about nothing
Just layin down in shades of effervescent, effervescent odors

When you hear, hear the call

Hear the cry for home

I look down
Be less sure, sir
And take your rest

Its been much too long
Since we drifted in song
Lay it down wet
In this hide-away

Oh I travelled far
To the nearest star
And met palomar, ...mar..., mar...
And we dont care just who you know
Its who you are
And when they all go home
Down the cobblestones
You can double back (spoken this is it)
To a cul de sac
Mmm

Oh, I travelled far
The nearest star
And mount palomar, palomar, palomar, palomar
And we dont care just who dyou know who dyou know
And who you really are, really are

And when they all,
All go home
Down the cobblestones
You will double back
To a cul de sac
You know, you know you will
You will, oh, will double back
And not very far
To a cul de sac
You, you, you... will double back
To a cul de sac
You know, you know its not very far away
No, no
Its just a cul de sac

And you know, and you know, and you know... its not very very far away,

And I'm conquered in a car seat
Not a thing that I can do
I may go crazy
Before that mansion on the hill
I may go crazy
Before that mansion on the hill
But my heart keeps beating faster
And my feet can't keep still
And all the little girls rhyme something
On the way back home from school
And all the little girls rhyme something
On the way back home from school
And the leaves fall one by one by one by one
Call the autumn time a fool
Yeah baby my tongue gets tied
Every every every time I try to speak
My tongue gets tied
Every time I try to speak
And my inside shakes just like a leaf on a tree
I think Ill go on by the river with my cherry cherry wine
I believe Ill go walking by the railroad with my cherry cherry wine
If I pass the rumbling station where the lonesome engine drivers pine
And wait a minute, yonder comes my lady
Rainbow ribbons in her hair
Yonder comes my lady
Rainbow ribbons in her hair
Six white horses and a carriage
Shes returning from the fair
Baby, baby, baby
And if I'm caught one more time
Up on cyprus avenue
And if I'm caught one more time
Up on cyprus avenue
And I'm conquered in a car seat
And I'm looking straight at you
Way up on, way up on, way up on....
The avenue of trees
Keep walking down
In the wind and the rain, darling
You keep walking down when the sun shone through the trees
Nobody, no, no, no, nobody stops me from loving you baby
So young and bold, fourteen years old
Baby, baby, baby...
Ooooh-ee"

Just like the drumshanbo hustle.

They were makin' not a sound.
They were tryin' to muscle in,
An easy way to bring the money in.
You were pukin' up your guts
When you read the contract had been signed.

Prostitution on the run,
'ceptin what it was last night.
Tryin' to drain you dry,
Couldn't get too much rope.
Tryin' to take 'em down
Just to see how far it all would go.
Wasn't goin' very far
And she didn't let it bring you down.

Just remember the day,
Just like the drumshanbo hustle.
I couldn't hear no birds,
They were makin' not a sound.
They were drivin' motionless
On the recording and the publishing.
You were pukin' up your guts
When you read the contract had been signed.

New york hooker style,
And the tarot and astronomy.
Tell you every star,
Didn't even get your sign.
Well they were lookin' for a scam,
A little paperback novel or a little magazine,
But you left it all behind
When you pulled the rug from underneath her feet.

Just rememberin' the day,
Drumshanbo hustle.
Well you couldn't hear no birds,
They were makin' not a sound.
They were tryin' to muscle in,
An easy way to bring the money in.
You were pukin' up your guts
When you read the actual contract had been signed.
You were pukin' up your guts
When you heard the contract had you signed.
You were pukin' up your guts
When you heard the contract, the contract, had you signed."

Dumb, dumb george,
Who came up to boston
One sunny afternoon.
He drove up from new york city,
And he was freaky,
And he wanted to record me,
And I said,
George,
Youre dumb.
And he said, I know.
Why do you think I make so much money.
I wanna do
A record
Thatll make number one.

I have seen without perceiving
I have been another man
Let me pierce the realm of glamour
So I know just what I am

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more

Feel the angel of the present
In the mighty crystal fire
Lift me up consume my darkness
Let me travel even higher

I'm a dweller on the threshold
As I cross the burning ground
Let me go down to the water
Watch the great illusion drown

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more

I'm gonna turn and face the music
The music of the spheres
Lift me up consume my darkness
When the midnight disappears

I will walk out of the darkness
And Ill walk into the light
And Ill sing the song of ages
And the dawn will end the night

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I'm waiting at the door
And I'm standing in the darkness
I don't want to wait no more

I'm a dweller on the threshold
And I cross some burning ground
And Ill go down to the water
Let the great illusion drown

Nothing to hang your hat on, can't even get uptight

Everything you say and do
What happened to, the individual
Tell me what happened to you
Tell you up is down, not able to fight
Keep you docile and complacent, can't even get uptight
Controlled by the media and you don't know what you can do
They took away your constitution you don't even know what happened to you

Waffle is the language that they taught you, taught you to talk
But you can't even get any angle 'cause you forgot how. Keep on walking the walk

Double dealing with the banks, behind your back, just can't fight"

Of the sleepy lagoon

On the water
When I'm walking with you
On an evening in June
On an evening in June

When I'm thinking of you
And I can't think of anything
Except being with you
When the summer is through
On an evening in June
On an evening in June
Well it lifts me up
When I'm talking to you
On an evening in June
When the flowers are in bloom
And the sky is so blue
Well there's so many things
Taking place
That it's hard to keep up with it all
Keep your eye on the ball
And to make the right call
When we're longing for fall
On this evening in June

When you been on a fast train
And its goin off the rails
And you cant come back together again
You just start breakin down
In the pourin rain
Cause you been on a fast train

When your love has gone away
Dont it make you feel so sad
And you know Im returnin
Way into the land
And you start breakin down
And go into the pain
Cause you been on the fast train

You had to go on the lam
Cross into no mans land
Aint nobody here on your wavelength
And nobody gonna give you a helpin hand
You just start breakin down
And just go into the sun
When you hear that fast train

And you keep movin along
To the sound of the wheels
Deep inside your heart you really know
You know just how it feels
And you start breakin down
And the deserts reign on the fast train

Youre way over the line
This time youre out of your mind
This time youre out of your depth
And to the window you crack open
Oh but theres nowhere to go
Theres only sleet and theres snow
Keep on movin on a fast train

You hear theyre goin over the line
Oh standin on the edge of the hill
Oh nobody on their wavelength
Nobody to give you a helping hand
And you start breakin down
When you hear the sound
Keep on movin on a fast train
Im goin nowhere on a fast train
Goin nowhere
Goin nowhere on a fast train
Goin nowhere on a fast train

Going nowhere
Goin nowhere on a fast train

Inscrutably the muse selects your face
As i sit drinking famously in an irish bar
Five thousand miles and thirty years away

With the usual ceremonial you were crowned one night
King of the field where doctors nail the cows
To make of the cock's quill the rights of language
And the pricking heart a sword against the hours

Let smirking scholars writhe in their favourite bondage
And hold you plaintiff to the charge of art
Exhibit a: he falls on legendary lines
Singing mother i don't want a pain here in my heart

The judge in me sucks eggs and jerks the sacred meat
But the boy in me still dreams in milk wood town
Like two provincial bastards playing the galleries
I hold your photo to a mirror upside down

And as bacon wafts through hungry streets, your ghost pervades
Just like an old ex-boxer aged twenty two
Staged-up like falstaff or the wild welsh rimbaud
You'd laugh to see the monograms they make of you
Ah, mr. thomas let us ramble through the midnight fair
Let us throw old bottles at the ferris wheel
Let us paint library on the library let us raid the moonlight
Let us steal whatever we are supposed to steal

Let us watch while the days grow daily more mundane
That rough god go riding with his shears
Hack wide the belly of the swollen mountains
And rip molten heroes forth from their furious tears

Oh, mr. thomas, oh, mr. thomas,
Let us steal whatever we're supposed to steal

Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
Has my lover Johnny man been here?
He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.

And then to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny
Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Well Frankie lifted up her kimono dress
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little. 44
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him
And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)

Roll me over so slow,

He's the only support that I've got,
'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.

Well the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell
She would be there moanin', herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long
You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetary (graveyard)
And they ain't never coming back
Oh he was her man, oh but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well the story ain't got no moral, Lordy
But the story ain't got no end

That there ain't no damn good in men
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

And breathe while its still clear
Breathe it in all the way down
To your stomach too
And breathe it out with a radiance
Into the nightime air

Waiting for that day to come

I dig a 10-foot ditch
And ride through the jungle
Fightin lions with a switch,
Because ya know I love ya baby,
Well, you know I love you baby,
And if I dont love you baby,
Grits aint groceries,
Eggs aint poultry,

Blisters on my feet
A-tryin to find my baby,
A-bring her back to me.
If you see my baby,
I know shell be convinced.
If it dont send her back to me,
It just
Dont make no sense,
Because ya know I love ya baby,
Well, you know I love you baby.
If I dont love you baby,
Grits aint groceries and eggs aint poultry,
And mona lisa must-a been a man.

Well,
All around the world
I never will forget
I lost all my money, my woman and my pet,
But I got to have you baby,
I got to settle for nothin less,
Give up all my good time for the sake of happiness,
Because ya know I love ya baby,
You know,
You know I love you baby.
If I dont love you baby,
Grits aint groceries,
Eggs aint poultry,
And mona lisa must-a been a man.

But it's just the gypsy in my soul
Layin' out in the midday sun
Tryin' so hard not to run
Looking out at the deep blue sea
I guess it's just the gypsy in me
Jump on that train, catch that plane
Here and there and back again
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate
Keep me moving in this restless state
Sometimes it feels like I don't have any goal
It's just the gypsy?/P>
Catch that train, jump on that plane

To some little girl along the byway
That's why I sing this song to you

If you find your baby's gone
And you don't know where or when
You wonder, yes you wonder
If you'll ever see him again
Just remember, remember
These simple words I brought

Soon it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much as you thought

'cause I been up and down the highway
And I watch them as they pass by
Broken hearts and I wish that they'd go my way
I'd save them every little teardrop they cry

Won't you listen?
If you think you can't go on
And life ain't got it for you no more
You're waitin' every night
For him to come walkin' through that door

Just remember, remember
These simple words that I brought
Soon it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much
No it won't hurt half as much as you thought

Shaved head at the organ

At night we rest and go to sleep
In haunts of ancient peace.
The love and light we seek,
The words we do not need to speak,
Here in this wondrous way we keep
These haunts of ancient peace.
Let us go there again
When we need some relief
Oh, when I can't find my feet
When I need rest and sleep.
The sunday bells they chime
Around the countryside and towns
A song of harmony and rhyme
In haunts of ancient peace.
The holy grail we seek
On down by haunts of ancient peace.
We see the new jerusalem
In haunts of ancient peace.
Oh, when I can't find my feet
Oh, when I need some relief
One more time again.
You know I want to go there one more time again.
Be still in haunts of ancient peace.

It says this love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always

Bridge:
I've been accused of truth and alchemy
I've been accused of speaking out for freedom too
I gave a demonstration in front of a crowd
A man saw my hands move and he began to shout

Theres a battle for the throne
And it means to thine own self be true

And a story does unfold

Shes standing by the rhododendrons
Where the roses are in bloom
Looking out at the atlantic ocean
And in her head she hums this tune

Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again
cos high summer has got me down
Ill wait till the end of august
And get off this merry-go-round

And they shut him out of paradise
Called him lucifer and frowned
She took pride in what God made him
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground

Hes a light out of the darkness
And he wears a starry crown
If you see him, nothing will shake him
cos high summer has got him low down

High summers got him lonesome
Eyen when he makes the rounds
Theres been no two ways about it
High summers got him low down

Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside
Settled down to start a new
Far away from the politicians
And the many chosen few

Far away trom the jealousy factor
And everything that was tearing him apart
Far away from the organ grinder
And everyone that played their part

And they shut him out of paradise
Called him lucifer and frowned
cos he took pride in what God made him
Eyen before the angels shot him to the ground

Hes a light out of the darkness
And he wears a starry crown
If you see him nothings shaken
cos high summers got him low down

High summers got him low down
High summers on the rebound
High summers got him down, low down

How can a poor boy
Deliver this message to you?
How can a poor boy?

Had my rise, had my downfall
Now I’m gonna rise up again
Had my degrees, my initiations
Not speaking to the profane

How can a poor boy
Get this message to you?
How can a poor boy
When you don’t believe a thing that’s true?

I’ve been anointed, been appointed
Even been magnified
Spied the chapel, all of gold
The priest was laying down with the swine

How can a poor boy
Get a little message to you?
How can a poor boy
When you don’t believe anything is true?

How can a poor boy
Get this message through to you?
How can a poor boy
When you don’t believe a single thing that's true?

Watch the illusion of false security
Play of the shadows that move
Tell me what evil lurks in the hearts of men
Only the shadow knows

How can a poor boy
Get this message to you?
How can a poor boy
When you don’t believe a thing that’s true for you?

When you don’t believe a thing
Nothing that’s true for you
How can a poor boy

Oh sit by the clear, cool, crystal water
Get my spirit, way back to the feeling
Deep in my soul, I wanna feel
Oh so close to the one, close to the one
Close to the one, close to the one
And that's why, I keep on singing baby

(Van Morrison)
[Originally by Van Morrison]

All that trouble all that grief
That's why I had to leave
Staying away too tong is in defeat
Why I'm singing this song
Why I'm heading back home
That's what makes the Irish heart beat

I'm just like a hobo riding a train
I'm like a gangster living in Spain
Have to watch my back and I'm running out of time
When I roll the dice again
If lady luck will call my name
That's what makes the Irish heart beat

Well that's what makes it beat
When I'm standing on the street
And I'm standing underneath this Wrigley's sign
Oh so far away from home
But I know I've got to roam
That's what makes the Irish heart beat

And it was off to foreign climes
On the Piccadilly line
We were standing underneath the Wrigley's sign
So far away from home
Well I know I've got to roam
That s what makes the Irish heart beat

Just like a sailor out on the foam
Any port in a storm
Where we tend to burn the candle at both ends
Down the corridors of fame
Like the spark ignites the flame
That's what makes the Irish heart beat

But I roll the dice again
If lady luck will call my name
That s what makes the Irish heart beat
Oh, that's what makes the Irish heart beat
That's what makes the Irish heart beat"
Van Morrison,Gloria,/j/jimi+hendrix/gloria_21436735.html,"Well, I saw her...she was walkin' down the street
She was looking mighty tasty...she was looking so good to me
So I walked up to her with my very best smile on my face
She just kinda laughed and said ""are you through?
Can we get on, can we get on down to your place.""
She come to my house
She come up my stairs
She tell me she need me
She look like she cares
She make me feel good
She make me feel good all night
She make me feel good
She make me feel all right
I said ""baby...what's your name? ""
I said ""baby...what's your name? ""


And she said g...l...o...r...i-i-i-i-i-i-a
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)
G-l-o-r-i-a (gloooria)

You know, I saw her again...the very next day
She was walkin' on that same strip of road
And she was headin' my way
Now, I'll never forget the night before
In fact, I'll never forget that week
But there I sat, motionless, somber, silent, unable to speak
You see, to my sorrow, and to my shame
In all the excitement, I'd forgotten this girl's name
I said ""baby...what's your name? ""
I said ""baby...what's your name? ""
And she said g...l...o...r...i-i-i-i-i-i-a

Van Morrison,Carrickfergus,/j/joan+baez/carrickfergus_20823508.html,"I wished I had you in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean to be by your side

But the sea is wide and I can’t swim over
And neither have I wings to fly
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die

These childhood places bring sad reflections
Of happy days spent so long ago
My girlhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on like the melting snow

Now, I spend my days in endless roving
Soft is the grass and my bed is free
Oh, to be home now in Carrickfergus
On the long road down to the salty sea

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone as black as ink
With gold and silver he did support me
But I’ll sing no more now till I've had a drink

Well, I’m drunk today and I’m rarely sober
As I roam on from town to town
Oh, but I am sick now and my days are numbered
Come all you young lads and lay me down
Come all you young lads and lay me down"

Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic
And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home
And when that fog horn blows I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it
I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
Then magnificently we will float into the mystic
And when that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home

And everything looks so complete
When you're walking down on the streets
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Oooh, oo-ooh wee the wild night is calling

All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with the wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars just like thunder

And everything is so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind, it catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Oooh, oo-ooh wee
The wild night is calling

The wild --------night is calling

Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance

Crawlin' up my stair

Waltzin' through the hall

Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge

There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me
Marie and ruth but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
Counting the time, then you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh. You were so good, oh, you were so fine

And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus:]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

For the morning sun in all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter
And somehow you make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one

And have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
You fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Take away all my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Take away all my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles that's what you do"
Van Morrison,Comfortably Numb,/r/roger+waters/comfortably+numb_20170449.html,"Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease the pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Ok
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, Good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"
Van Morrison,Flamingos Fly,/s/sammy+hagar/flamingos+fly_20195916.html,"You lay by my side in the still of the night
Let morning bring forth, all that's wondrous, wondrous to light
You could have made it, made it more plain
When I hear that, hear that soft refrain
And I hear you gently sigh

Chorus:
I wanna take you where flamingos fly
(Flamingos fly)
Way over yonder in the clear blue sky,
That's where flamingos fly

As we lie in the dark and hear the sweet song of the nightingale
And we listen for the lark, and I wanna tell you babe, tell you a
Tale
With the soft wind blowin', blowin' outside
Hey I wanna take that moonlight ride
And I hear you gently sigh, babe

[Chorus:]

And I'm silently waiting
For that morning light to shine
And I'm looking at you, lookin at me, and I'm lookin' at you
And I'm anticipating with each and every sign
Yes, I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at me,
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me, lookin' back at you

And I'm findin' that road
That road that will take me, take me back home to you baby
And I'll carry the load where the deer and angels roam
Where happiness touches, touches the now
I don't where it came from, I don't how, and I,
And I hear you gently sigh, babe

[Chorus x 2]"

Well, you've been on a fast train

When your lover has gone away, don't it make you feel so sad
And you go on a journey way into the land
And you start breaking down 'cause you're under the strain
And you jump on a fast train

You had to go on the lam, you stepped into no-man's land
Ain't nobody here on your waveband
Ain't nobody gonna give you a helping hand
And you start breaking down and just go into the sound
When you hear that fast train

And you keep moving on to the sound of the wheels
And deep inside your heart you really know oh, just how it feels
And you start breaking down and go into the pain

Keep on moving on a fast train

You're way over the line, next thing you're out of your mind
And you're out of your depth, in through the window she crept
Oh, there's nowhere to go in the sleet and the snow
Just keep on moving on a fast train

You had to go on the lam, stepping in no-man's land
Ain't nobody here on your waveband
Nobody even gonna lend you a helping hand
Oh, and you're so alone, can you really make it on your own?
Keep on moving on a fast train

Oh, going nowhere, except on a fast train
Oh, trying to get away from the past
Oh, keep on moving keep on moving on a fast train
Going nowhere, across the desert sand, through the barren waste
On a fast train going nowhere

On a fast train going nowhere"

Have you dancing
In the street
And that big band
Keeps on playing
Joe henry's retreat
But only a dream
Only in my dream
Only a dream
But somebody tried to knock me down
Only a dream
Keeps on hanging around
Only a dream
We're rolling in the snow
Only a dream
We just couldn't let go
I sit outside your window
Just like romeo

Yes, only a dream
But someone tries to knock me down
To the ground
But it was only a dream
But it's just a dream
Still hanging around."

And back along the lane again,
There in the sunshine,
In the sweet summertime,
The way that young lovers do,
I kissed you on the lips once more,
And we said goodbye by the door in the night time,
Yeah, that's the right time,
To feel the way that young lovers do,

Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way, that we were and the,
Way that we were meant to be,
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way, that I was for you,
And you were for me,
And then we danced the night away,
And turned to each other, say, 'I love you, I love you',
The way that young lovers do,

Do, do, do, do...

Then we sat on our star,
And dreamed of the way that we were,
And the way that we wanted to be,
Then we sat on our own star and dreamed of the way, That I was for you,
And you were for me,
I went on to dance the night away,
And turned to each other,
And say, 'I love you, baby, I love you'

And company was right
We'd drink and talk and sing
All through the night

Morning came leisurely and bright
Downtown we'd walk
And passers by, would shudder with delight
Mmmmmm! Good times

And there was this man
All the cats were there
Just dirty enough to say, ""We don't care""
But, the management have had complaints
About some cats with long, long hair
""Look, look, look""
And the people'd stare
""Why, you won't be allowed in
anywhere!""
Barred from pubs, clubs and
dancin' halls
Made the scene at the Spanish rooms
on the falls
And man, four pints of that scrumpy was
enough to have you, outta your mind
Climbin', climbin' up the walls
Out of your mind
But it was a gas, all the same
Ummm! Good time!

Now just 'round about this time
With the help of the three J's
Started playin' at the Maritime
That's, Jerry, Jerry and Jimmy

You know they were always fine
And they helped us run the Maritime
Don't forget Kit, hittin' people on the head
An' knockin' 'em out
You know he did his best and all
Was something else, then
Ummm, Lord, good times

And people say
Who are or what are, Them?
That little one sings
And that big one plays the guitar
With a thimble on his finger
Runs it up and down the strings

The bass player don't shave much
I think they're all a little bit, touched
But the people came
And that's how we made our name
Too much it was
Umm, yeah, our good times

Wild, sweaty, crude, ugly and, and mad
And sometimes just, a little bit sad
Yeah, they sneered an' all
But up there, we just havin' a ball
It was a gas, you know
Lord, some good times

It was kinda bad for, Them
We are, Them, take it or leave it
Do you know they took it, and it kept comin'
And we worked for the people
Sweet, sweat and the misty, misty atmosphere

Gimme another drink of beer, baby
Gotta get goin' here
Because, it was a gas
We all had good times

Blues come rollin'
Down to all your avenue
Won't stop at the city hall
Just a few steps away
You can look up at, Maritime Hotel
Just a little bit sad, gotta walk away
Wish it well"

I just love to be around you, oh baby
You’ve been so good to me, oh, baby

You know, one time things got so bad until
I had to go to one of my friends and talk to him
And I told him, I said, “You know
I’m having problems with the woman that I love
It seems that I call her on the phone
And I, I just can’t get her to answer
And then I went to her house
And I saw a car parked in the driveway
I knocked on the door, but still my knocks went unanswered

And then I went home and I
I watched television until television went off
And then I played my records until
I just didn’t want to hear them anymore
And finally I went to bed, but I found myself
Waking up a few hours later
And the tears were running down my face”

And my friend told me, he said, “Lenny
You just ought to forget about her”
But I told my friend, I said, “You know
Maybe you’ve never been in love like I’ve been in love
And maybe you’ve never felt the things that I’ve felt”
But this is what I told my friend
I said, “You know, sometimes you get lonely
You get lonely, you get lonely”

And I cry, I cry
And the tears would fill up in the wells
In the wells of my eyes, oh baby
And then it got so bad, it got so bad
Till one time I thought I’d roll myself up
In a big ol’ ball and die and then I met you, darlin’
And you smiled at me
Oh, oh, it was such a pretty smile, yes, it was

And you reached out your hand
You helped me, you helped me, you helped, oh

Tropical trees and the salty air

Romance

It seems so distant, 26 miles away
Restin' in the water serene
I'd work for anyone, even the Navy
Who would float me to my island dream

26 miles, so near yet far
I'd swim with just some water-wings and my guitar
I could leave the wings but I'll need the guitar
For romance, romance, romance, romance

A tropical heaven out in the ocean
Covered with trees and girls
If I have to swim, I'll do it forever
Till I'm gazin' on those island pearls

Forty kilometers in a leaky old boat
Any old thing that'll stay afloat
When we arrive we'll all promote romance

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

Something to convince me to renew hope

Bright enough to help me find my way

One that maybe has a touch of romance
Where can it be
The chance for me?

I have one I know that very few dream
I would like to see that overdue dream
Even though it never may come true

A new love
Though I know there's no such thing as true love
Even so, although I never knew love
Still I feel that one dream is my due

A new world
This one thing I want to ask of you, world
Once, before it's time to say adieu, world
One sweet chance to prove the cynics wrong

Just to play the game and to pursue life
Just to share its pleasures and belong

You lived to die rejected and alone
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me above all

Above all powers, above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
You were here before the world began

Above all kingdoms, above all thrones
Above all wonders the world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure what You're worth

Crucified, laid behind the stone
Live to die rejected and alone
Like a rose trampled on the ground
You took the fall and thought of me above all

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looked so sad in photographs,
I absolutely love her,
When she smiles...

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope but she only found tears.
And I can be so insincere,
Making her promises never for real!
As long as she stands there waiting,
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes!
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose?
Your clothes never wear as well the next day,
And your hair never falls in quite the same way-
But you never seem to run out of things to say...

This is the story of A girl,
Who cried A river and drowned the whole world!
And while she looked so sad in photographs,
I absolutely love her,
When she smiles...

How many lovers would stay?
Just to put of with this shit day after day!
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say.
As long as we stand here waiting,
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose!
How do we get there today?
When we're walking to far for the price of our shoes!
Your clothes never wear as well the next day,
And your hair never falls in quite the same way-
But you never seem to run out of things to say!...

Keeps the galaxies and each sparrow alive

And the love that heals the wound
After the war is through
Is the knight in armor bright
Faithful and true to you

Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you

We can dance, dance, dance
Clap your hands, hands, hands all night
If you're in the mood
Do what you wanna do all night long?

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
Chorus
Chorus
Somebody once asked could you spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see

Still too numb to speak
Another night staring at the wall

Last night's conversation
Knocked me off my feet
I guess today I fall

I wish that we could agree
To look the other way
Be careful of the things we do
And watch the things we say

Maybe then we'd get somewhere
We've never been before
But what's the use in fighting
When you know you've lost the war

Walked the streets of New Orleans
Shirt soaked to my skin
Through the mess of yesterday's parade

A thousand times a day
I think of calling you again
But I come to my senses instead

Every time we walk away
We lose a little time
Pretending to each other
Everything is fine

After all the lies I use
To get myself to sleep
I still wake up to the promises
I know we'll never keep

Say you don't see what's wrong
Every night lasts so long
I know I do, you're already gone

I wonder should I get up
I would but what's the point
When something's gone
It's gone for good

Maybe I could look away
Back to where we used to be
One more time I wish I could

Never mind the reasons
That tore us all apart
We've both done things
I know we can't defend

What's the use in tracing?
It all back to the start
There'll still be something
Missing in the end

I wish that we could find
The words to look the other way
Be careful of the things we do
And watch the things we say

Maybe then we'd get somewhere
We've never been before

For now, let's call her Suki, got me booty bangin'

Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bust the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me

Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'Cause ""you gettin' played"" is not me
""Surely you jest,"" she said, ""If you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""

To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my sunshine""

Hear in songs keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm, that's right
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm

Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said

Hatin' 'cause they lustin' mine, they wanna sex me

They oppose you then, they oppose me""

Double cross you they got to triple cross me

Put that on everything? I put that on my life

Pawn your jewelery to come get me? You better know
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? Now that, I don't know

They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail?
They try to frame me, will you be there 'til the truth prevails?
But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
That you was, throwin' rocks at the roof at 12

This is the truth I shell, 'til the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you ballin', from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin' myself

Now picture me leavin' you in this cold world, rollin' for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we takin' the belt

We were all growing up on the in and the outside
We got in trouble with the police man
We got busted gettin' high in the back of my friend's van

I got a guitar on Christmas day
I dreamed that Jimmy Page would come from Santa Monica and teach me to play
Teach me to play...

There isn't any place that I need to go

So I asked god

God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there is something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they cant have my love no more
Cause my heart cant take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries

God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldnt eat, I couldnt sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin now
But you cant have it
God

God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun."

First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all the alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashin' time to retire
Then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire
Next stop as the music shop,
It only took one brick to make the window drop
Finally we got our own P. A.
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today
When we returned to the pad to unload everything,
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So once again we filled the van until it was full
Since that day my livin' room's been more comfortable
Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder and harder every year
Some kids went in a store with thief mother
When she came out she was gettin some pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the mexican
But not for the white man
But if you look at the streets it wasn't about Rodney King
It's bout this fucked up situation and the fuckin police
It's about coming up and staying on top or screamin' 187
On a mofo cop
It's not written on the papers, but its written on the wall
National guard smoke from all around"

Various Artists,At Seventeen,/v/various+artists/at+seventeen_20805102.html,"I learned the truth at seventeen, that love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired, the valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth, were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces, lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home, inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities, it isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs, whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve, they only get what they deserve""
And the rich relationed hometown queen, marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company and haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game, lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you in dull surprise
When payment due exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away, the world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free to ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare to cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone, repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities at ugly girls like me at seventeen"

And I would not lie to you because sunday mornin' soon will come

With the precision of percentages, and the collision of sedatives

Like righteous s***s with no crevices
Streets unite, we rock right over dumber beats

Forget two takes, kill y'all birds the first time
Yo' best {shit} ain't, worthy of my filler or worst rhymes
I'm better than nice, check the veteran stripes
Leave you beside yourself with fear, I kill you, and bury you twice
Despite the cover of night, trackin your flight
Like guerilla warfare, where the grass is dense
Approachin me is a quick way to get referred to in the past tense

Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie

Grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan

Before you call him a man?

Before they're forever banned?

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?

That too many people have died?

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?

With my Mac10 on the side of my hip

I bailed outside and I pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
I jumped in the fo', hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back side to side

Then I let the alpine play

Pulled to the house get her out of the pad

In a lake his tongue does rest
Jumps in and he cannot swim
Drowns himself to death

Or a frozen mountaineer
He chugs up to a stop
Catching his boot heel in a rock
Two miles from the top

An Olympic super swimmer
Whose belly doesn't flop
A super race car driver
Whose pit, it can't be stopped

A honey dripping hipster
Whose bee cannot be bopped
It's better to be rolled in oats
Than from the roll be dropped

Broken heart would satisfy
Broken in a mess
A seven eye would gratify
My soul, I must confess

I'd rather have no eyes at all
Be blind upon the floor
Than to stand upon the receivin' end
Of the right hand of the Lord

Now, girl you're more than welcome to.

Come blow your horn, start celebrating

To wipe every smile away

I used to have a girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors came to snicker
Well, that's what comes of to much pills and liquor
But when I saw her laid out like a queen
She was the happiest corpse I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I'd remember how'd she turn to me and say
""What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret""

Put down the knitting, the book and the broom
Time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret

And as for me, as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea

From cradle to tomb

I know you're not a fool

I should've known better
Than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So, I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth pain is the all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again

I know you're not a fool

Than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So, I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
With or without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could've been so good together
We could've lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

The stack the odds still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive...

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin up to the challenge of our rivals
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Risin up
Straight to the top
Had the guts got the glory
Went the distance now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin up to the challenge of our rivals
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger...
The eye of the tiger...
The eye of the tiger..."

You don't deserve it
True love doesn't cost a thing
And if you try to buy it,
You can't return it
No, no, no woah

And my friends
We Look at what you're wasting
It doesn't matter if you change their minds

And I don't care what they say anymore
Cause I'm falling (falling)
I'm finally falling (falling)

So show me something
Cause love is all I need and all I ever wanted
And now I got it
Eh, eh, eh, eh

And your friends will
Probably think the same thing
Well, It doesn't matter if we change their minds

Something's missing and I'm wishing
Wishing that you knew
How much it would mean to spend
This Christmas time with you

So if you feel it coming
On this special day
Just trust your heart
Don't let your head get in the way

Cause it's Christmas
And the start of something new
But it's Christmas
And I hope you will feel it too
Candy canes and mistletoe
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
But all of it means nothing
Without you
Without you

Just for a minute, you get a feeling.
Look up in the sky.

Santa's here, so get in the spirit.
Just give it a try.
Children beaming and I'm dreaming
Hoping that it's true.
Cause it would mean so much to spend this
Christmas time with you!

So if you feel it coming
On this special day
Just trust your heart
Cause I can't wait to hear you say

That it's Christmas
And the start of something new
Well it's Christmas
And I hope you will feel it too
Everyone together sings
Silver Bells and golden rings
But all of it means nothing

In the drop tops, Harley, Escalades too
A hundred different flavors to vary your view
There’s one for me and there’s one for you
Watching them la boys roll through

Looking so hot down in Hollywood

Lets give it up for those la boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu
They really get, get to you

Give it up, give it up, you don’t have no choice
Give it up, give it up for the la Boys

Rock stars jamming, in the promenade for free
Flipping a skateboard, on venice beach
La boys, come play with me
Turn it up, Turn it up
Come play with me.

Falling in Love with Love is playing the fool! 
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy! 
Learning to trust is just for children in school.

I fell in Love with Love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see! 
I fell in Love with Love, Love ever-lasting! 
But love fell out, with me!"

To understand her
You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought
See every dream

When she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself
Lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman you tell her
That she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her
That she's the one
Cuz she needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really really ever loved a woman?

To really love a woman
Let her hold you
Till ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her
Really taste her
Till you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children
In her eyes
Ya know ya really love a woman 

You got to give her some faith
Hold her tight
A little tenderness
Gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, 
Takin' good care of you
Ya really gotta love your woman..."

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

(Chorus - 1)
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

(Chorus - 1)

(Chorus - 2)
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

With a flimsy kind of charm

I could break her little arm! 

Oh why would a fellow want a girl like her?
So obviously unusual?
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
A usual girl like me! 

Her cheeks are a pretty shade of pink, 
But not any pinker than a rose's.
Her skin may be delicate and soft
But not any softer than a doe's is.

Her neck is no whiter than a swan's
She's only as dainty as a daisy
She's only as graceful as a bird... 
So why is the fellow going crazy?

Oh why would a fellow want a girl like her, 
A girl who's merely lovely?
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
A girl who's merely me! 

She's a frothy little bubble
With a frilly sort of air
And with very little trouble
I could pull out all her hair! Ha ha ha ha! 

Why would a fellow want a girl like her,

In spite of Fortune shall our true love be."

Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler
Keep a-busy Cinderelly

We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball
She'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly

Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'
I'll cut with these scissors
And I can do the sewing
Leave the sewing to the women

You go get some trimmin'
And we'll make a lovely dress for

Pushed aside and denied the love that- was to be

He- danced and pranced, caught her- glance and stole her heart from me
He is a lout without a doubt and she- is blind to see

Last night on lovers eve
I did receive a note
It ended in a sigh
It sounded like good bye

My true loves heart is stone
She's sitting on a throne
And now I'm all alone again on a dismal- valentine

O woe is me woe is me
I'm sad as I can be
Pushed aside and denied the love that- was to be

She- broke my heart failed to start
She'll never be my queen
Wiped my eyes and fantasized the life that could have beeen

Now I'm in her house
Awaiting for her spouse
I don't know what I'll say
But some how they will pay

He walzes through the door
And falls strait to the floor
Because he sees my knife and now he's- begging for his life

O woe is me woe is me
I'm sad as I can be
Pushed aside and denied the love that- was to be

Re-venge was sweet, took a seat
And tied him to a chair
Life was good until I stood and saw- her by the stairs

I took one look ans wept
She took one forward step
A steely gaze she set
Upon me as I wept

There was no place to run
It really wasn't fun
Because she had a gun and shot me
No this ain't no pun

O woe is me woe is me
I'm sad as I can be
Pushed aside and denied the love that- was to be

My stomach hurts it's at the worst
I lost my only bet
On the wall about to fall, and things are looking wet

Tome stone on my head
The grass above is red
And now I'm six feet under and I'm - definitely dead"

So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung,
Robin Redbreast lost his heart, for he was a gallant bird.
So he doffed his hat to Jenny Wren, requesting to be heard.

""Oh, dearest Jenny Wren, if you will but be mine,
You shall feed on cherry pie and drink new currant wine,
I'll dress you like a goldfinch or any peacock gay,
So, dearest Jen, if you'll be mine, let us appoint the day. ""

Jenny blushed behind her fan and thus declared her mind:
""Since, dearest Bob, I love you well, I'll take your offer kind.
Cherry pie is very nice and so is currant wine,
But I must wear my plain brown gown and never go too fine. """

Don't you dare start what you cannot finish

So when we face, face the adversary
No longer are we the minority

And when history repeats her hour
The pendulum will swing, swing into power
Though not in vain like our forefathers
Freedom, never had no room for cowards

For in the end, there will be equality
By any means necessary

The choice is up to you
The ballot or the bullet
Tell me what you gonna do
The sword or the pen
Can be held by the same hand

What's it gonna take to liberate?
An emancipation, a false proclamation?
All these token words that you legislate
Sound a little bit absurd. Hey! And a little too late

When a house is divided, it just will not stand
Once it's decided, a line drawn in the sand

I saw fire in the sky
I felt my heart pound in my chest
I heard an eagle cry
Now I'm alive I can breathe the air
Feel the wind, smell the earth in the air
I watch an eagle rise above the trees
Project myself into what he sees
Hey-
Take me away
Come on and fly me away
Take me up so high
Where eagles fly
I often dream I sail through the sky
I've always wished I could fly
The simple life of a bird on the wing
Oh Lord, I could sing
Take me away
Come on fly me away
Lift me up so high
Where eagles fly
Oh yeah-
I'm alive, I breathe the air
Wash the earth from my face
I catch a glimpse of another dream
I turn, I look but there's no trace
Take me away
Come on, fly me away
I want to fly away
Pick me up so high

My advice is free
There's a trick to Christian values and it's compulsory.

Stay frosty
That's what the preacher man said
Stay Frosty

Can't control your future
Can't control your friends
In a world without ends...
Stay Frosty!

I travelled to the South
The ancient Rabbi appeared to me
Voice heavy with the sands of time
He made me see
Same as Kabalah Dave but for you it's free
God guides us on our journey
But be careful where you put your feet

Stay Frosty
In a world without end
Stay Frosty
Like the ancient immortals said
Don't want em to get your goat
Don't show em where it's hid and that's just what I did

I looked to the East
I struggled to stay afloat
A solitary Buddhist Monk
Threw me a rope
Looked me in the eye and said
Don't make me say this twice
You want to be a monk, you gotta cook a lot of rice

Stay Frosty
In a world without end
Stay Frosty
Work hard at this my friends
Look beyond the Kung Fu fighting
God is love
Best get it in writing

I wandered out West
To the California Coast
Where the folks who know about frostiness stay frostiest the most
My brand new landlord
Proposed me a toast, ""My West Coast host""

Stay Frosty
Chant it like a Mantra
Stay Frosty
And there's nothing you can't handle
Far and wide far as you can handle
Trust in Allah
But tie up your camel, and remember...

Of all wrong they decide and the shotgun sings the song I'll tip my hat to the
New constitution take a bow for the new revolution smile and grin at the change
All around pick up my guitar and play just like yesterday then I'll get on my
Knees and pray we don't get fooled again the change, it had to come we knew it
All along we were liberated from the fold, that's all and the world looks just
The same and history ain't changed 'cause the banners, they are flown in the
Next war
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around pick up my guitar and play just like
Yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray we don't get fooled again no, no! I'll move
Myself and my family aside if we happen to be left half alive I'll get all my
Papers and smile at the sky though I know that the hypnotized never lie do ya?
There's nothing in the streets looks any different to me and the slogans are
Replaced, by-the-bye and the parting on the left are now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight I'll tip my hat to the new
Constitution take a bow for the new revolution smile and grin at the change all
Around pick up my guitar and play just like yesterday then I'll get on my knees
And pray we don't get fooled again don't get fooled again no, no!

I woke up to yet another day
Grown to expect, expect more of the same
Except for, for a subtle change
And that is, I'm slowly fading away

Harvest moon, soon will pass
Crop is gone, left only chaff
A bitter pill, and an overcast
A flag unfurled, at half mast
Ahhhhh...

A year to the day
Since you went away
A moment in time
When you were last mine
I'm here standing still
Yeah! With more time to kill
Hey! I barely survived
Yeah, I barely survived

Like pouring salt on an open wound
Memory filling, filling this empty room
I'm as bare, I'm as bare, as a barren womb
Still like the air, in a whitewash tomb
Ahhhhh...

A year to the day
Since you went away
A moment in time
When you were last mine
I'm here standing still
Hey! With more time to kill
I barely survived
Yes, I barely survived

But you've got so mahy choices
You can't save all the hungry
The lonely or the dying

Never for one single solitary moment did I need you more

Traveling to paradise or to anywhere we like
We live a lucky life

My home is on the road the pavement caters to to my gypsy soul
We walk the tightest rope we live in a circus circus of hope
All of the melodies and inspirations shine on me like a holy light

In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: ""my god, that's tough""
""she stood him up""
""no point in us remaining""
""we may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do?
The role I was about to play?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in his mercy
Who, if he really does exist,
Why did he desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

(instrumental interlude)

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"

Just ask the lonely
When you feel
That you can make it all alone
Remember no one is big enough
To go it all alone
Just ask the lonely
They know the hurting pain
Of losing the love
You can never regain
Just ask the lonely
The young and foolish
Who laugh at love and slowly run away
Confident and sure that fate
Will bring another love their way
But ask the lonely
How vainly a heart can yearn
For losing a love
That will never return
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
They'll tell you a story of sadness
A story too hard to believe
They'll tell you
The lonliest one is me
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely
Ask me, I'm the lonliest one of all"

And you speed down the tracks
To what you call home

You send me
Or is it I who sends them unreceived?

So diaphanous so ephemeral
And all those bad words
They never learned in school

In her black turtle neck

But we all gotta pay

I know you'd be good to me
I know you'd try to be good to me

You better be good to yourself...good to yourself

I guess I've known you before, maybe in high school
Or maybe you're just one more guy I went looking for
The boy next door
Or maybe I'm the girl with the see-through eyes
But I watch too many movies,
I get tangled in the story of someone else's life
Baby, who am I...and who are you?

Oh, sometimes I go to bed at night
And I think that I'm with you
Then I say a little prayer, 'cause I threw it all away
The other day you called up to see if I miss you
And all I could say was

I know you'd be good to me
I know you'd try to be good to me
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else
When the chips are down, I have found
You better be good to yourself...good to yourself

Night has a clever desguise
She makes me believe that I'm lonely

I can work it out

Though we've never been together
We've never been apart
No we've never met
Haven't found him yet
But I know him by heart

Am I living an illusion?
Wanting something I can't see
If I compromise, I'd be living lies
Pretending love's not meant to be
Cause I know my heart's worth saving
And I know that he'll be waiting
So I'll hold on and I'll stay strong 'till then

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm!

I don't wanna go through this life not asking why

And I believe you're already gone

Of learning to live in the world today

I guess I'm a fool to want perfection

Again from the weight of this longing?

Do you want me to read your mind?

I wonder if I'd find the same
Hopes I've been having
'Cause baby I came alive
When you caught my eye
I'm falling in love you see
And it's the kind of love
That makes me breathe

I would share all my secrets
I would tell you anything
You know I'd let you in darling
We could be so good together
I would give you the world
If only you would take it from me

Sometimes love comes quickly
Sometimes love comes slow
Let's not miss this moment... 'cause
Love will come and go

I never thought I could feel
Such emotion in me
I'm not the kinda girl who falls in love so easily
It's all so clear to me now
Ain't no shadow of a doubt
Now I understand what this mystery is all about

I would be there for you baby
In a special kind of way
If I only had the say darling
We could be so good together
I would give you the world
Baby will you take it from me

Sometimes love comes quickly
Sometimes love comes slow
Let's not miss this moment... 'cause
Love will come and go

Let's not miss this moment
Let's not take too long
I think we both know it
Our love would be that strong, be that strong, be that strong

I kick myself down the street

That made me move to New York City

About to let this magic slip away

Like clouds on a promising grey day

To a platinum mine
Santa cutie,
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby,
And fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your 'x' on the line
Santa cutie,
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Lets see if you believe in me, too

Santa Baby,
Forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa Baby,
And hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry... Tonight"

Written by William D. Hardy, Billy Moore, Jr.

Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney,
Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
When he came last year

There he was in middle of the chimney
Roly-poly, fat and round
There he was in middle of the chimney
Not quite up and not quite down

Santa please come back to my chimney
Back to my chimney, back
Santa please come back to my chimney
You can come back here.
Cause baby, made a brand new chimney
Just for you this year!
Santa, come on back!"

Every light shines on you tonight
Making a fool out of me
Why won't this love leave me alone
All of the people in this smoky room
Crowded with faces I know
I feel them watching me watch you

[Chorus:]

Say the words
Say the words
Say the words
Say the words so I can leave... It's over

Your eyes are deeper
They are worthy of many words
But none I can conjure up will do for you
I shouldn't see you
'Cause I know my own motivation
It's taking too long for this love
To leave me alone

[Chorus:]

Say the words
Say the words
Say the words
Say the words so I can leave... It's over

[Bridge:]
Oh love, you worry me
When you say you'll wait forever
I have another life
We just cannot be together

And I have made mistakes in my life

Oh I believe I am ready for what love has to bring
Got myself together, now I'm ready to sing

I've been searchin' my soul tonight
I know there's so much more to life
Now I know I can shine a light
To find my way back home

One by one, the chains around me unwind
Every day now I feel that I can leave those years behind

Oh I've been thinking of you for a long time
There's a side of my life where I've been blind and so...

I've been searchin' my soul tonight
I know there's so much more to life
Now I know I can shine a light
Everything gonna be alright

Don't wanna be alone in life

I've decided to move on now
Gonna leave all my worries behind

Why do you think the whole world is after you
Well you're probably right and it's probably true about me too

'cause sometimes the world ain't sweet
Oh these days when was it ever
Maybe it's just this city hurts
Oh richard I love you worse

Serious richard
I often recall the time in the doorway in paris
The time of the broken sinks and the broken hearts
And the broken weeds that we tore apart
Thinking they were flowers thinking they were art

We were so smart richard
We liked our love we loved to live
Out in the streets we knew how to give
We were alive happy to be alive

You don't know my memory lingers
Or the message of your fingers

Serious richard where did you go
I never thought an ending we would ever know
Now it's so cold without your love"

Dressed in holiday style.
In the air there's a feeling of christmas.
Children laughing, people passing,
Meeting smile after smile.
And on ev'ry street corner you hear:

Silver bells, silver bells
It's christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be christmas day

Strings of street lights, even stoplights,
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch,
This is santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear:

Silver bells, silver bells
It's christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be christmas day.

At The Sunset Marquis

Resting on my knee
It was one of the few times
I didn't want to change a thing

And the way the light hit your face just right
Was like a movie, a movie
And the way you laughed
Well it warmed the draft
Running through me, through me
And I wanna go back to try and unwind

A couple is snapping at each other
Like dirty old rubber bands
While a waitress in a cat suit
Is starting to expand
I draw a line around your finger
Like a wedding band

Then I scribble down some poetry
On a book of matches
Cause I realise I am sitting with
One of the finest catches
And suddenly in the background it was you

Playing on that radio
Burning on that stereo
In the bar at The Sunset Marquis

There was a party in my head
Where did everybody go?
One night in the blue light
I sat there all alone
And I tried to remember
The smell of your coat

Then I touched my hand and I
Whispered into my own ear, my own ear
In the background something familiar
Something was so clear, so clear
And I realised that it was me

Playing on that radio
Burning on that stereo
In the bar at The Sunset Marquis singing 'bout
All the laughs we once had darling
Oh the way it felt to me
In the bar at The Sunset Marquis"

For closing books, and long last looks must end

And weak from strong

What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I, would rather let me give my heart
To you, with love

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone, yeah
But in my mind
I know that they live on and on and on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
Well it's not easy
But I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To you, with love
Those awkward years have hurried by
Why did they fly, fly away
Why is it sir children, grow up to be people one day?
What takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside?
What, what is there that I can buy?

Words/music: don mclean

Starry, starry night.
Paint your palette blue and grey,
Look out on a summer's day,
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
Shadows on the hills,
Sketch the trees and the daffodils,
Catch the breeze and the winter chills,
In colors on the snowy linen land.
Now I understand what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they did not know how.
Perhaps they'll listen now.

Starry, starry night.
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze,
Swirling clouds in violet haze,
Reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue.
Colors changing hue, morning field of amber grain,
Weathered faces lined in pain,
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.

Now I understand what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they did not know how.
Perhaps they'll listen now.

For they could not love you,
But still your love was true.
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night,
You took your life, as lovers often do.
But I could have told you, vincent,
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you.

Starry, starry night.
Portraits hung in empty halls,
Frameless head on nameless walls,
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
Like the strangers that you've met,
The ragged men in the ragged clothes,
The silver thorn of bloody rose,
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.

Now I think I know what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they're not listening still.
Perhaps they never will."

Paint your palette blue and grey,
Look out on a summer's day,
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
Shadows on the hills,
Sketch the trees and the daffodils,
Catch the breeze and the winter chills,
In colors on the snowy linen land. 
Now I understand what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they did not know how.
Perhaps they'll listen now. 
Starry, starry night.
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze,
Swirling clouds in violet haze,
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
Colors changing hue, morning field of amber grain,
Weathered faces lined in pain,
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand. 
Now I understand what you tried to say to me,
How you suffered for your sanity,
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen, they did not know how.
Perhaps they'll listen now. 
For they could not love you,
But still your love was true.
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night,
You took your life, as lovers often do.
But I could have told you, Vincent,
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you.

I seem to walk on ice
Some things make me think twice
When I get that resistance
Like having freedom with my hands tied

I've censored what's inside way too long
I can't live so black and white
Somebody listen
Somebody say what's on your mind

I've got the wheels of the reckless
I'm gonna scream on the edges

Wake up the house start the clock work
Turn on the lights anybody home
Break all the glass on my windows
Wake up the house so I'm not alone
Disturb this neighborhood
Maybe it'll do some good
You know what I'm missing
When everybody's asleep at night

Somebody's got to tlak
Might as well be my job yeah
Maybe somebody's listening
You know I've censored this heart too long

I've got the wheels of the restless
I'm gonna scream on the edges

Wake up the house start the clock work
Turn on all the lights anybody home
Break all the glass on my windows
Wake up the house so I'm not alone

I can't live so black and white
You know what I'm missing
Something's making me think twice
Is anybody listening?

The lot we used to pass by every day
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame
From deep inside the tears I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall
Still find a way to haunt me though they're so small
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries
Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home

Welcoming in the new year

Vonda Shepard,What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted,/v/vonda+shepard/what+becomes+of+the+brokenhearted_20144759.html,"Lyrics and Music by James Dean, Paul Riser and William Weatherspoon

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Love's happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe
The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying or someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, baby

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
Oh he is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking every day
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I will find a way somehow"

Once in a lifetime you find
Someone to show you the way
Someone to make your decisions
And I let you lead me astray.
Who did you think you were fooling
Said you were missing me blind
But the truth is I knew you were lying
You were using me time after time.

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

Time to move on with my life now
Leaving the past all behind
I can make my own decisions
It was only a matter of time
Sometimes I look back in anger
Thinking about all the pain
But I know that I'm stronger without you
And that I'll never need you again

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you
Won't look over my shoulder
'cause I know that I can live without you

I will lose you,

When I open up my eyes
I will lose you.

I guess you sunk in
Oh yeah you made it in
Now I'm fumbling somewhere deep within
Will I raise my glass
Or will you kick my ass?
Will we fall down laughing, laughing?
I know love is pain
I know your life's insane
I want you anyway
I'll probably complain

Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster?
A respectable ball and chain is all you're really after

I'm tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me
Will you ever decide? So unrevealing...
Wil you marry me?

Strange behavior from my savior

You yank me up and down
Just like a yo-yo
Do you love me?
You're an anomaly
Or maybe you are just
Unbelievably ordinary

Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster?
A respectable ball and chain is all you're really after

I'm tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me
Will you ever decide? So unrevealing...
Will you marry me?
I'm tumbling inside, I'm happiest when you are next to me
But I'm still on the outside...
Am I obsessed or
Will you marry me?"

Here to stay, is a new bird.
He sings a love song, as we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he is parson brown.
He'll say are you married? We'll say ""no man,
But you can do the job when you're in town. ""

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown.
We'll have lots of fun with mr. Snowman.
Until the other kids come knock him down.

When it's cold, ain't it thrilling
When your nose, gets to chilling.
We'll frolic and play, the eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

A sad sad story
About a girl
Who met a boy
About her mother
Whose vision saw her
Daughter to marry
Another boy
(Nooo nooo nooo...)
They made a plan
To get away
To run away
And though it be hard
To make that day
Freely to live
Without the mother
They'd send a postcard
(Nooo nooo nooo...)
Out on the interstate
That's where they made their mistake
That's where they met their fate
Out on the interstate
They met a monster
The monster of the interstate
Who will not hesitate
Who eats teenagers
Like a shark eats little fishes
Who eats bad kids disobeying parents wishes
An interloper against the elopers
A troll at the pay toll
They stopped at the toll booth
And reached for a quarter
The monster filled the whole booth
He gave them no quarter
""Don't eat me""
Chirped the girl
Clutching to her purse
""Don't eat me""
Croaked the boy
""Or eat her first
I'll turn right around
And take her back to her mother's
We repent of being out of wedlock lovers""
""You should have thought of that before""
And a scaly horny hand
Ripped the car lock door
And the boy
Tried to drive
But oh boy
He was eaten alive
And the girl
Tried to scream
But she was swirled
In the giant's vanilla ice cream
And the boy was yummy
And the girl was yummy
As they slid down the throat
To the monster's yellow tummy
He said:
""Hmm hmm good
Didn't do like they should
Hmm hmm good
Didn't do like they should""
The mother sold the
Rights to the story
It was so scary
This gory story
They made a movie
A horror movie
The mother made a million
And the producers made a billion
""And that other sweet boy
That my daughter has shunned
Now I'm his wife and he's my husband""
The moral of this story
Is clear for all to see
And if clearly all can see
Then it isn't clear to me"

Mo my my my my my mo my mum
Take a look now
Look what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
You went downtown and got him a gun.

Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me

Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs
Can I mix in with your affairs?
Share a smoke, Make a joke
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope
Words to memorize, words hypnotize
Words make my mouth exercise.
Words all fail the magic prize
Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs

Oh my my my my my mo my mother
I would love to love you lover
City's restless
It's ready to pounce
Here in your bed from ounce to ounce
Sayin' oh my my my my my mo my mother
I would love to love you lover
The city's restless
It's ready to pounce
Here in your bed from ounce to ounce

I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says
Wait a minute honey I'm gonna add it up
Add it up (x8)
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I take a bow and say goodnight
(""add it up"" continues being chanted under this until guitar solo)"

Before your face will pace many a peer

And reappear oh my dear

Do you really want to make me cry?
No I don t really want to hurt you then
Lovers always asked me:
Why why why why
In my mind my memory's burning
What's your favorite color of your favorite car?
I took a step the step was learning
That that's a step beyond a step too far
Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
No I don't really want to hurt you
I told the truth but it was still a lie
The words are few some are unspoken
I could sleep four thousand years
Man of sorrows
Word unbroken
His sweat like blood came down like tears
I've been talking but believe me
I know that it's true
Now that there's no more
I don't know
I'm in love and love's the reason
I'm not prepared to let you let me go so
If it's love you want
Then take all of me
It's this love I want I can finally see
Do I really want to hurt you?
Do I really want to make you cry?
Yes I suppose I want to hurt you
You told the truth but it was still a lie"

On this long cold lonely night of fright
Followed by a lonely day
'Til there's nothing left I can say
Except I didn't know I was sick
And so I got sicker
He's a low down lying
Peckerwood cotton picker
Don't start me on the liquor
I got nothing more to say
I had a little money
But it all flown away
And I said oh man
Oh, ain't that a shame
Oh, I keep manin', I keep manin'

So delicately over the sea
And when it comes down
It comes down on me
Well it used to want to hump you
I used to want to rock and roll
I was attracted to your gracefulness
But your surprise sure took it's toll
Now I guess I'd better go out now
Gonna try to find something new
And all I'm left with is this craving
For some flamingo stew
Now the beauty's in the gutter
The loveliness is off her throne
In the eyes of the beholder it's gone
And now he feels kind of alone
But this feeling it's the kind that will shortly pass
I'm gonna find myself another bird
And roll on down the grass

Turns towards all the whistles and bells

I'm in a resort town at the Hotel Last Resort

Who did I not call?
What did I not write?
Blue spring, gold fall
Green summer, winter white
Someone's singing in another language
I think it might be English

The ship is leaking tonnage and tankage
They sink, lightly sing fish
Message says: ""Ship's flag flies at half mast, report""
But no message can be sent from the Hotel Last Resort

You wrote me so many letters
I keep them in a bag
New hope, so many ""feel betters""
But jets aren't the only things that lag

Bodies in motion tend to stay in motion
Bodies at rest
That's inertia, inertia, inertia

""Did I win a million bucks?"" Yes you did
And now you go to where the lodgings are deluxe
And join me in my bed where we will blaze, blast, contort
Alive or dead, laying in the Hotel Last Resort

I don't like to snorkel
I don't want to swim
I don't laugh but I chortle
When I pass by the gym
I don't take a tour
I don't take on a guide
My fields I rake with manure
I'm fertilizing for pride
But the mission has been pulled
All agents must abort
And I am losing my patience
At the Hotel Lust Resort

I've become invisible
Because 1 is not divisible
I wander like the Jews
I ponder on my muse
I pander to the few
I divide myself by 2
Half of half is still half
And a chortle is still not a real laugh

""Yo bro, where the hoes at?"" asked a sport
Nobody knows that at the Hotel Last Resort

In my tomorrows I got here
I checked out before I checked in
Vaclav Havel likes beer
And sorrows for things Slovakian
He could've been my best friend
Of human wrongs, I wished we had spoke
Fine weather in the west wind
My Cuban songs I sing for the Pope
I'm still tryin' to get some rest in this castle, this social fort
Wishing you all the best, from the Hotel Last Resort

Got to kill the pain.

Burry me out on a lone prarie.
Prarie water washin' over me.
Burry me out on a lone prarie.
A friend who calls a coyote.

Burry me out in the lone city.
Sewer water color of my tea.
Burry me out in the lone city.
Sewer water wash we all down to sea.


She use to sit and watch and wait.
Now I think I'll go and sit."

That I have been burnt
And I'm learning things that I
Should've already learnt
Everyone I ever knew
Was so kind and coy
I was with a girl
But it felt like I was with a boy
I can't even remember
If we were lovers
Or if I just wanted to
But I held her in my arms
I held her in my arms
I held her in my arms
But it wasn't you
I will not kill
The one thing that I love
In this world of wreckage
I look above
Help me Lord
Help me understand
What it means to be a boy
What it means to be a man"

Ain't that a fact.

I know it's late, but I'd like to stay a while, see you smile.

Will you meet me in the morning, with sun fresh on the dew?
Will you meet me in the afternoon, made just for me and you?
Will you meet me in the evening, when the nighttime starts to crawl?
Will you meet me in the hall?
Will you meet me on the wall?
Will you meet me at all?

One more time, one more time.
Shaking up and down my spine.
Jump a rope or skip a line or two.
What can I do?

One more time, one more time.
Color flashing neon signs.
Advertising a friend of my distraction, latest attraction.

Oh my body has been punished.
Lord, I think I've had enough.
Oh my body has been punished
With too much and not enough.
Oh my body has been punished
And my mind can no longer bluff.
My mind is so unkind, my mind is so unkind.
It keeps me crying all the time.

Something real loud

Screams were all that I heard

I saw her eyes
I saw His grace
In the dark'ning skies
I saw you raise your hand
Stretching out to the band
You reach exceeding your grasp
On the beach from the whale
Comes one last gasp
Meet me in my hotel room
Meet me just for fun
And I will not be boring

Some things I been storing
Inside to show someone like you
A few friends just stopped by
I think they wanted to get high
But it wasn't you
Who they led me to
So I bid them all good-bye
I probably would forget
This episode of regret
So I wrote this song
So when you sing along
I hope my message you will get
Meet me in my hotel room
Oh, meet me just for fun
And you will not be boring
Something you been storing
Inside to show someone like me"

I can learn to keep my promises, I swear it
Open up my heart and I will tear it
Any minute now, I swear, I'll share it

Oh it's strange, yes, it's strange
Though I guess it's quite clear
I killed the antelope, the deer
And there's no home on my range
Yes, I'm a little de-arranged but I can change

It's not my fault that I'm so evil
It's society, sobriety
You know my momma picked cotton
And my daddy, boll weevil
It was history, it wasn't me

But I can change, I can change
I can learn to keep my promises, I know it
Open up my heart and I will show it
Any minute passed 'til I outgrow it

You'll never change, you'll never change
You'll always be a dog with me

Yes, but don't be such a boob
Manna from Heaven shall be my food
My acts of past were misconstrued
And God above will watch me change
And while I'm changing, I'll be changing, while I change
Soon

But I can change, I can change
I can learn to keep my promises, I swear it
Open up my heart and I will tear it

His race is won and is completed too

Rio de Janeiro, Rio
Where they held a summit to save the world
And to mark the time when development
As traditionally understood-had failed
And the affluent North raping the South
Investment from the North means
Economic bondage for the South
Under the burden of debt payments
I was with a whore in Copenhagan
Drinking eight hundred dollars worth of
Champagne in kroner
She came from Rio
We were trying to save the world
We did not get what we wanted
She wanted money--
She did not get what she wanted
I missed my wife--
I did not get what I wanted
Death sat on my lap
Death sits on all our laps
While Christ the Redeemer
Towers high over Rio

I've lived a life that's full.
I traveled ewach and every highway.
And more, much more than this:  I did it my way.

Regrets--I've had a few.
But then again, too few to mention.
I did what I had to do.
I saw it through without exemption.
I plan each charted course,
Each careful step along the byway.
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Yes there were times,
I'm sure you knew,
When I bit off
More than I could chew.
But through it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up and spit it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried.
I had my fill, my share of losing.
And now as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.
To think I did all that,
And may I say, not in a sly way.
Oh no, oh no not me, I did it my way.

Over the classicism of clean shoes
But who today still knows a button stick
Well, that's the new times
That's the new times

First one went dancing, then behind the bushes
Today you have to run through twenty places
Get drunk on saccharin and methyl
And then you still don't get them that far

Who arrives but the brethren from the press
If somewhere there lies a cadaver
Or something is foul in the state
You can be sure that a writer is not far behind
With his excellency I only say:
Hands off the literature
The laurel wreath one gets today
Second hand so to speak

Sold underhand at the alexanderplatz
With all the wigs and costumes
Twitching from the shoulder one is informed

Floating so grandly above the trees
Why is everybody so hollow
So I kill everything.

Stroll down a street or two.

And to love our neighbor with all that we have
And keep our tongues from saying things we have not seen

Oh, break our hearts with the things that break yours
If we sow in tears, we will reap in joy
That we might pass through your refining fire
Where brokeness awaits on the other side (2x)

Raise up an army like Joel saw,
Your church that is stronger that ever before
They do not break ranks,
When they plunge through defenses
But the fear of the Lord will be their wisdom

That they might weep as Jesus wept
A fountain of tears for the wounded and lost
Who ever heard of an army of God
That conquered the earth
By weeping and mourning and brokeness?

But there will be a day when the nations will bow
And our Lord will be King over all the earth
And he will be the only one,
And also his name will be the only one"

The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of your servant, David,
Rebuilding the temple of praise.

Free me from these binds, Lord
I am choking on the gifts this world gives, Jesus
I am waiting on Your love

I must clearly choose
To lose my life and gain Your love
Or love my life and lose

You were poor when you were born
You could see Your Father clearly
Through the nothing that You owned

Free me from these binds, Lord
I am choking on the gifts this world gives, Jesus

Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars

Looking gray in the rain, as they stand disarrayed
oh, but people look well in the dark

And if you close the door

Leave the sunshine out

If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here things were a bit askew

Well you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains bolder after you?

If I could be anyone of the things in this world that bite
Instead of an ocelot on a leash, I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air, babe, at night
Cause ou know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear

And all the balls are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

Yesterday, daisy mae and biff were grooving on the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Wich meant she tasted what she'd speak

But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now when people say her feet they mean her nose

And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you
And all the roman noblemen for you
And kingdom's christian soldiers dear for you
And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
And knights in flamming silver robes for you
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you
Swoop, swoop
Oh baby,
Rock rock
Swoop, swoop, rock, rock"

And all that it requires in this world
Candy says I'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly talk about

(Chorus)
I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

(Verse)
Candy says I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be
Candy says I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind

(Chorus)
I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me"

Velvet Underground,Lady Godivas Operation,/v/velvet+underground/lady+godivas+operation_20143921.html,"Lady Godiva, dressed so demurely,
Pats the head of another curly-haired boy,
Just another toy.
Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely,
Saying words that have oh so clearly been said
So long ago.
Draperies wrapped gently around her shoulder,
Life has made her that much bolder now
That she [has] found out how.
Dressed in silk, latin lace and envy,
Pride and joy of the latest penny-fare,
Pretty passing care.
Hair today now dipped in the water,
Making love to every poor daughter's son,
Isn't it fun?
Now today, propping grace with envy,
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
And hasn't a care.
""Doctor is coming,"" the nurse thinks sweetly,
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air.
The body lies bare.
Shaved and hairless, what once was screaming,
Now lies silent and almost sleeping.
The rain must have gone away.
Strapped securely to the white table,
Ether causes the body to wither and writhe,
Underneath the white light.
The doctor arrives with A knife and baggage
Sees the growth, just so much cabbage
That must now be cut away.
Now comes the moment of great, great decision.
The doctor is making his first incision.
One goes here,
And one goes there.
""The ether tube's leaking,"" says someone who's sloppy.
The patient, it seems, is not so well sleeping.
The screams echo off the walls.
Don't panic -- someone give him pentathol instantly.
The doctor removes his blade cagily slow from the brain.
By my count of ten.
The head won't move!

The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliet Bell

And Romeo wanted Juliet
And Juliet wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliet
And Juliet wanted Romeo

Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell

Outside the street were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz
Brother give me another toke
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin?
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street

And Romeo had Juliet
And Juliet had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliet
And Juliette had her Romeo

I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
""it's hard to give a shit these days""
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome

The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone"

Between thought and expression lies a lifetime
Situations arise because of the weather
And no kinds of love
Are better than others
Some kinds of love
Margueirta told Tom
Like a dirty French novel
The absured courts the vulgar
And some kinds of love
The possibilites are endless
And for me to miss one
Would seem to be groundless
I head what you said
Margueritat told Tom
And of course you're a bore
But at that you're not charmless
For a bore is a straight line
That finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love
Are mistaken for vision
Put jelly on your shoulder
Let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil
But which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder
Lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression
Let us now kiss the culprit
I don't know just what it's all about
Put on your red pajamas and find out."

The myriad choices of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate
For him to choose
What had he to lose

Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of G. T.

The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell

Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again

Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again

And Roberman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on

If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse
Don't scream, try between

For the loss of remain come and start

Velvet Underground,The Gift,/v/velvet+underground/the+gift_20143923.html,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. It was now Mid-August which meant he had
Been separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had
To show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone
Calls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to
Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would
Date occasionally, but merely as amusement. She would remain faithful.

But lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when
He did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning
Underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he
Pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of
Some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
It was more than the human mind could bear.

Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual
Abandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how
She really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped
Every nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and
He wasn't there (Awww...).

The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled
To appear. He'd just finished mowing and etching the Edelsons lawn for a dollar
Fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from
Marsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company
Of America inquiring into his awing needs. At least they cared enough to write.

It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck
Him. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
True, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself
Parcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to
Purchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a
Medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that
With a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,
Some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as
Going tourist.

By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the post
Office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package
""Fragile"", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber
Cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and
Happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the
Deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She
Would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of
This before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne
Up. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.

Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough
Weekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about
It though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,
It was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no he didn't love her, he
Did feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what
Bill could teach Waldo - but that seemed many years ago.

Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen
Door and into the kitchen. ""Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside."" ""Ach, I
Know what you mean, I feel all icky!"" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton
Robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on
The kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. ""I'm supposed to be
Taking these salt pills, but,"" she wrinkled her nose, ""they make me feel like
Throwing up."" Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd
Seen on television. ""God, don't even talk about that."" She got up from the
Table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue
Vitamins. ""Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"" and then attempted to
Touch her knees. ""I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again.""

She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the
Telephone. ""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on
A cuticle. ""After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him."" ""I
Know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place.""
She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. ""The thing is, after a
While, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't
Really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know
What I mean."" She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over
Her mouth. ""I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,"" here
She bent forward in a whisper, ""I wanted to!"" Now she was laughing very loudly.

It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang
The doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson
Opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his
Green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had
Gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. ""What do you
Think it is?"" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living
Room. ""I dunno.""

Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the
Muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down
The center of the carton. ""Why don't you look at the return address and see who
It's from?"" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the
Vibrating footsteps. It would be soon.

Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. ""Ah, god,
It's from Waldo!"" ""That schmuck!"" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.
""Well, you might as well open it,"" said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the
Staple flap. ""Ah sst,"" said Marsha, groaning, ""he must have nailed it shut.""
They tugged on the flap again. ""My God, you need a power drill to get this
Thing open!"" They pulled again. ""You can't get a grip."" They both stood still,
Breathing heavily.

""Why don't you get a scissor,"" said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but
All she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
Father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when
She came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter
In her hand. ""This is the best I could find."" She was very out of breath.
""Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die."" She sank into a large fluffy couch and
Exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the
End of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough
Room. ""God damn this thing!"" she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,
""I got an idea."" ""What?"" said Marsha. ""Just watch,"" said Sheila, touching her
Finger to her head.

Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could
Barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his
Heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and
Walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her
Knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the
Long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through
The cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of
Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
To pulsate gently in the morning sun."

Here comes the ocean
And the waves
Down by the sea
Here comes the Ocean
And the waves
Where have they been?

Silver and black with night
Heres to a summers night
An empty splendid castle
Glowering alone at night
The princess has had a fright
Madness seeks out the lover

And here come the waves down by the shore
Washing the soul of the body
That comes from the depths of the sea

Here comes the ocean
And the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
And the waves, where have they been
Don't swim tonight my love
The tide is out my love
Malcom's curse haunts our family
Oh yes, loud in which, ruler of filthy seas, revelling heavans justice

And here come the waves
And save for a scream
There's much like a song
To be heard, in the wind, that blows by the sea.

Like the wind

Here come the waves,
Here come the waves,
Here come the waves"

Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay

Speak not of your woes
Just steal yourself for holy death
Crouching by the door

Writhe and sway to music's pain
Searing with asides
Caress death with a lover's touch
For it shall be your bride

Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay

Purple is to yellow
As sunlight is to rain
Happiness and death you'll find
Loveliness in pain

Slash the golden whip it snaps
'Cross the lovers' sides
The earth trembles without remorse
Preparing for to die

Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay

Salty ocean waves and sprays
Come crashing to the shore
Bullies kick and kill young loves
Down on barroom floors

The gleaming knife cuts early
Through the midnight air
Cutting entrails in it's path
Blood runs without care

Violence echoes through the land
And the heart of every man
The knife stabs existent wounds
Pus runs through matted hair

Excrements filters through the brain
Hatred bends the spine
Filth covers the body pores
To be cleansed by dying time

Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay"

A letter to my mama from the bottom of my heart
""I'm sorry"" is a real good place to start

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry I was selfish, let's chalk it up to youth
I got too old to need you, that's just running from the truth
I'm sorry things didn't work out for you and my old man
Sometimes life don't turn out like you planned

[Verse 3]
Lookin' back, I wonder how you ever pulled us through
I can't imagine walking in your shoes
If I could stop this pen from shaking, I'd write these words down too
There's no one in this world I love like you

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've written down the memories of these sixty-some odd years
Trying hard to just say ""Thank you"" as I wipe away the tears
I hear my grandson calling, so I guess I better go
Could never pay you back the love I owe

If my bills are paid my plans are made
And everything's alright
Put on my ropers and them wranglers fittin' tight

Why do your eyes look so sad?
There's something in the way he sat there
Made me think about my dad

To the love between a father and a son

Bring it over here by my side
Buy me a glass of wine

Fishin' for souls along the way
You kind of remind me of my only son
I lost him 33 years ago today

I'm looking for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and a son

There's somethin' I'd sure like to give you
It's a compass that my Father made
He told me it'd point you in the right direction
In case you ever lose your way
You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket
This little silver cross
I think my son would want you to have it
When you think all the hope is lost

We're looking for the answer

I wanna hold you close to me and show you
All our love can be
I won't let go too easily
There will never be another you and me

I know love can hurt us, and love can make us fly
I know I was born to love you
Until the day I die

A little understanding

She won't be a Cinderella no more

On her face
Where that smile always was
It seemed out of place
And when I held her
Like a friend
I could feel a sweet beginning
But taste a bitter end

She's just tired
Of bein' Cinderella
She can't live that way no more
She needs a little affection
A little understanding
And you better be careful
'Cause the next time she comes to my door
You'll be sorry

'Cause it seems like
It's always something with you
And everybody's always wrong
One of these nights
You'll reach for the pillow she sleeps on
And she's gonna be gone

Of bein' Cinderella
She can't live that way no more

The hose was deathly quiet, I knew something was wrong
Then suddenly it dawned on me
The cold gray light of gone

[Chorus:]
No there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone
Waking up and finding out she's never coming home
The note that said it's over
Lord it chills me to the bone
No there's nothin' quite as lonely
As the cold gray light of gone

I cried and cried for hours and I tried to clear my head
I even went and laid back down on her side of the bed
Her perfume lingered on the sheets
Our love once laid upon
Her memory's destroying me
In the cold gray light of gone

Who lived just to labor his whole life away

Lonely has known me for the last time

For granted not ever

You put your hands where they don't belong

Too afraid to tell someone
Well‚  you might as well just used a gun
She  cries for Jesus to ease the pain
Because of you‚ she's forever changed

I can hear the angels in Heaven moan
God was watching and He knows your name
Because of you, she's forever changed

There'll come a day you face that Judge
You can beg for mercy, but the truth remains
Because of you‚ she's forever changed

To hear the angels sing.

Come swiftly on the wing;
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing!

And head on out for christmas holiday,
I'll fall apart when I pull in the driveway,

His favorite time of year was always christmas,
We'll reminisce about the days gone by,
Oh how I wish that he was still here with us,
My memories with him will never die,

And silent night has been sung,
And christmas is finally here,

And everyone telling you ""Be of good cheer!""

It's the happiest season of all
With those holiday meetings
And gay, happy greetings
When friends come to call
It's the happiest season of all

Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near

When Jenny was a little girl she only dreamed of trains
She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of countin' sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep

All she ever talked about was gettin' on to ride
She was livin' in another time you could see it in her eyes
Everyday after school she'd head down to the tracks
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rush
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust
No one believed her when she said she heard the train
She was just a little girl actin' kinda strange

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

Jenny laid a penny on the track one day
In God we trust she walked away
The very next mornin' all that she could find
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains
Nobody knew how she made it come true

Wind up all messed up
Where have those years all gone

Best keep your radio on
Cause I might get lucky, sing in the Opry
And I'll dedicate you this song

You stayed here in our old hometown
You married a sweet girl down around Austin
Had nine kids whose eyes are all brown

I hit every barroom from Bakersfield to Boston
Seeking whiskey, fortune, and fame
Countin' these white lines sure gets lonely
Someday they'll all know my name

Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain

Seemed like minutes all in vane

As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while

She's got a body that was built for sin
My baby's tellin' lies again

Sometimes, she's not a lady
And I knew that, comin' in
I can't help it, all I wanna do is love her
She's crazy but she's my best friend

She thinks that money
Grows on a tree
Says she never, ever
Been in love with me

My baby's tellin' lies again
That's the way it's always been
She's got a body that was built for sin
There goes my baby tellin' lies again

She loves me,
But she never lets me know
She's mean, she's not evil
And I just can't let her go

My baby's tellin' lies again
That's the way it's always been
She's got a body that was built for sin
My baby tellin' lies again"

The warmth of your skin
Kiss me again

Time won't stand still
This memory will

When you're in my arms
And you're in my bed
You're my favorite movie
That runs through my head

I see lovers on those Hollywood screens
They're pretending on that boulevard of dreams
This is real love like I've never seen
It's the sweetest thing

As we're dancing slow
The credits will roll
You're my best friend

Tonight he'll wrap you in his arms

Pretty is as pretty does
That's how it is and always was
Pretty words are all he's givin' you
And when he whispers int he dark
Watch out he's gonna break your heart
'cause pretty words won't make your dreams come true
They're just pretty words
Just pretty words

In the morning you will find
That you were just the next in line
There's nothing I can do that's gonna stop you
Before you go just let me say
I'd never treat your love that way
I'll be here long after he's forgot you

Oh the taste of wine and liquor and a woman's tender kiss
Sure paints the perfect picture that's so hard to resist
Though the lure of the old night life has always tempted fools
It can't compare with what you stand to lose

Remember the Promise you wear on your left hand
Cheatin's no companion for a real lady's man

If only I had listened to my own words of advice
And turned down the invitation in another woman's eyes
For the softness of a stranger, I threw good love away
Friend there ain't no higher price to pay

Cheatin's no companion for a real lady's man"

When that baby smiles up at you
Man there's some things that never get old

Makin' sweet love to that gal of mine
My first taste of bluebird wine
Eatin' watermelon down to the rind
Any old song by brother John Prine

Sometimes that face looking back in the mirror
Make that mirror, make that mirror cold
But in my heart, oh I'm a hundred years younger
Man there's some things that never get old

Ridin' into town with some friends of mine
It's a two-tone Chevy, she's a '59
Ice cold beer in the summertime
Pickin' on the back porch with brother John Prine

I'm bettin' Heaven is at the end of the road

Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows
Take your memory with you when you go

I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong

He's knocking at my door
He's out tryin' to save all the sinners
He's been here so many times before

I love the easy conversation
Man that preacher sure can talk
Brings up my need for salvation
Even though he knows I'm stubborn to a fault

Tell me one more time about Jesus
All about forgiveness and grace
Tell me one more time about Jesus
Lord I need just a little more faith

I walked by the church Sunday mornin'
Slipped on in the back door
Sure been a long time coming
Tell preacher what I need to know

His words were like a cool drink of water
He said sinners come on down the aisle
So I went runnin' for the alter
Should have seen my old friend the preacher smile

Was that old man of mine

Kept us all in line
Well, my poor mama lived in fear
Damn near all the time

That old man was mine

It didn't take much to piss him off
And he'd be on the tear
I'm still haunted by the bruises
We all had to wear
Well, late one evenin' on a cold dark night
I heard my mama cry
Everything inside me
Just wanted him to die

Well, I called him out and said, ""I've had enough
Let's settle this outside""
He said, ""Son, you think you're tough
Had this comin' for a long, long time""
He got both hands around my throat
Was chokin' me to death
Well, I saw evil in his eyes
And smelled the devil's breath

And one thing he never thought about
That pistol in my jeans
I put every bullet in him
That night in Abilene
My mama lied and said she did it
But on the Bible, she came clean
And every night she prays for me
From cell block seventeen

And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow,
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone

But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me

You try to love your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Way back up in the pines
It's where I hold the sweetest memories
In the hills of Caroline

My daddy wasn't much of nothin'
He spent his life doin' time
Mama learned me about Jesus
In the hills of Caroline

I met a girl her name was Hattie
Fair and tender, sweet and kind
She showed me how to love a woman
In the hills of Caroline

I always thought that we would marry
One sweet day she would be mine
But Hattie's gone, to live with Jesus
In the hills of Caroline

If I should die before tomorrow
Just one request if you don't mind
Just bury me right next to Hattie

Bury me right next to Hattie

John Henry, Ol' Shep and Faded Love
I Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A Dove

Just a few chords on the banjo that was all he knew
But in the eyes of a child, man his fingers flew
I practiced and I practiced 'til I got it right
Packed up everything and just took off one night

I made it from the beer joints to the Opry stage
He said the only difference is what you're gettin' paid
He didn't care that everybody knew my name
He said it's all for nothin' if you don't stay the same

And when he died the preacher cried and said he's the lucky one
He's walkin' hand in hand with God's only son
My faith and common sense tell me the preacher's right
But I'd love to hear the banjo ring for me tonight

I will honor my father with these words I write down
And as long as I remember him he'll always be around
And the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife
I learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life
Yeah the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knife

And take bar maid home
One night stands for breakfast

We'd wake up in the morning
And both feel a little used

Well, home was just a highway
We'd roam from town to town
Just me and that old flattop
Not caring where we're bound

With a five piece travelin' band
Singin' songs about the hard times
That face the common man

And one a piece of wood

From easing the pain
Of coming apart at the seams

Was your very own

While yours are safely sleeping

Than to spend one day without you by my side

If you're ever lonely, I wanna be lonely too, Woah.
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.

Where you may go

My love's inside you, even more than you know.

And I can't remember life without you
The way it used to be
Feels like a million years away.

Well Hold me 'til the angels sing.

Tell me every little thing.

Promise me forever from this day

If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?

I can't help myself
Can't help myself, falling in love

Billy was a friend of mine
We used to walk down by the river
And he'd hold my hand

We were only ten or twelve years old
Didn't know about love
I found out that it could hurt you so

Can't help myself, falling in love
I can't help myself
Can't help myself, falling in love

Jimmie was the one in high school days
We used to drive around the city
Thinking we'd grown up

Must've been just about sweet sixteen
I found a brand new world
Brand new love that I had never seen

Can't help myself, falling in love
I can't help myself
Can't help myself, falling in love

No matter how hard I try
I just can't leave it alone
No use in wonderin' why
'Cause my heart has a mind of its own

Can't help myself, falling in love
I can't help myself
Can't help myself, falling in love

But I keep on falling

Can't help myself, falling in love
I can't help myself
I keep on falling
Can't help myself, falling in love

I keep right on falling

Can't help myself, falling in love

Can't help myself, falling in love

Someone to get you through the nights, someone to start your morning coffee

Vg: You need a man that you can count on
Someone who'll finish what he started
Not a restless soul who comes and goes and leaves you open-hearted

It leaves our home so lonely and drear
And then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

When he comes down from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion

Coloring your face so dreamily.

But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

Chorus

I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight

All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place Id dearly love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee

It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee"

I was cryin' at the Andy Griffith show and I was snappin' and the dog
I was startin' to fear for my sanity
I could not find my ego with both hands

So I decided professional help was the only hope for me
So I called up this number which I'd gotten of T. V.
They said ""Are you havin' marital problems Are you emotionally impaired
Are you sure you're bein' followed or Are you just scared of bein' scared?
Well if so you better come on in have a little talk with the doc""

So I did

I said doctor good doctor I got trouble on my mind
Listen to me doc I don't have too much time
I got a feelin' down inside me and it will not go away
You know it hangs on and bangs on my soul every day
Doctor good doctor I'm grabbin' at loose ends
And I haven't felt like I used to since I don't know when
Yesterday go past me today is all the same
And tomorrow really scares me I just can't play the game

He said quit whinin'
He said straighten up and fly right
He said life is not a piece of cake
He wanted to know if my insurance was paid up

I walked on through the door and she just smiled
In a long pony tail and a pretty white dress
She said hi bull riders do it best
I said oh my God what's your name
My name's lyle

Take your boots and walk out of my life
Ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
I can't be no cowgirl paradise

I looked at her and she looked at me

And we went out together for a walk
Her eyes were bright just like the stars
But she drove a pickup said she hated cars
But loved to ride around out after dark

And I said ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman
Take your boots and walk out of my life
Ooh give back my heart chipkicker-redneck woman

All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky"

The little load jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky, look down where he lay
The little load jesus, asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little load jesaus, no crying he makes
I love thee load jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh

Be near me, load jesus, I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care
And take us to heaven, to live with thee there

And takes us to heaven, to live with thee there"

Looking back over the years
Of All the things I've always meant to say
But words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all of the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Chorus:
Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

No, it's not too hard to tell
The walls are closin' in

Oh, it's time to say goodbye
And put this in the past
Even though I know we tried
To save the best for last

[Chorus:]
I guess nothin' stays the same
Still the memories remain
We need all the sweet forgiveness we can find
There's a sadness in the wind
Oh, I wish you well my friend
Only time will mend these broken hearts again

I don't know what's left to say
I don't know where we went wrong
When I watch you walk away
I'll miss you when you're gone

Baby, shed a tear for me
And I'll she da tear for you
Oh, let's set this heartache free
And in time we'll make it through, well

One step beyond the flame

The thread of life
The finely woven pattern
Reveals designs in silent laughter and rhyme
One picture at a time

There ain't nothing left behind us
Not a doubt inside us
If the angel calls tomorrow
There's nothing we haven't said
There ain't nothing left behind us
Nothing but a blind trust
I would beg, steal or borrow
To never lose you again.

It's down to us to figure out the secret
It's not enough to wait for pieces to fall
The writing isn't on the wall
Take my hand,
We'll face the fire together
To distant lands, but we can weather the storm
Keeping each other warm

Everybody is bound to make mistakes
You just do what you think is right
Then laugh till you cry
Till you scream at the night.

Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are,

Lonely minds or two stubborn hearts
Nothing short of God above
Could turn me away from your love

'cause it seems to me I've found
The perfect man of all for me to choose
Used to dream of such a man like you
Never thought it would come true
Boy you are the answer to my prayers

I never felt like this before and
You have opened up the door
Into a space that I would never dare

'cause you give my life a meaning
And this love we have together
Is lifting my heart to a higher ground
I was searching, seeking, finding
Love came out from it's hiding
And baby, I'm so pleased at what I found

The way you seem to be, the only one for me
This love is truly special, we're 2 of a kind
I've got you on my mind, we're 2 of a kind

This heart of mine is beating inside my chest
And baby, it's you that I adore
The nights we spend together are by far the best
That any woman could be wishing for
We're lucky baby it's like that
This ain't no opposites atract
You make up for all the bad in me

So when days of trouble come around
You know I'd never let you down
Right by your side is where I want to be

And this love we have together
Is lifting my heart to a higher ground

Love came out from it's hiding

(Reporters asking questions-spoken)
Reporter 1: How does Conrad feel about going into the army?
Ja: How does he feel? You ask how he feels. He's much too shy to tell you so I'll tell you how he feels. He feels brave and eager, strangely humble. Proud to be a plain G. I.
Vw: He would gladly, face those bullets, for he's not afraid to die.
Ch: For he's a fine abstanding patriotic, healthy normal American boy.
Ja (spoken): And that's why he volunteered.
Reporter 2 (spoken): Volunteered? I heard he appealed 3 times!
Vw (spoken): Sing!
Ch: We love you Conrad, oh yes we do, we love you Conrad, and we'll be true. When you're not near us, we're blue/ oh Conrad we love you.
Reporter 3 (spoken): What's the picture on you and that Hollywood star? Are you two engaged?
Vw (spoken): Is he engaged? Is Conrad engaged? There's absolutely nothing to the rumor he's engaged.
Ja: She's a real pal., like a sister, but it doens't mean a thing. And that 18 karat diamond, it was just a friendship ring.
Ch: For he's a fine abstanding patriotic, healthy normal American boy.
Reporter 4 (spoken): Then why was her husband so mad?
Ja (spoken): Sing!
Ch: We love you Conrad, oh yes we do, we love you Conrad, and we'll be true.
Ja (spoken): Why, I'll never forget Conrad's first word's when he heard he'd been accepted into the armed forces. 'Gee Mr. Peterson' he cried eagerly, 'Do you think they'll assign me to one of those frontline trenches (army talk here I don't know what they're saying)
Reporter 5 (spoken): Is it true you found Conrad in a reform school?
Vw & ja: That is a lie. A lie through and through. I'll tell you where he
Came from here's the story and it's true.
Vw: He was born in Indo-China.
Ja: He was born in old Virginia
Vw: Son of missionaries there.
Ja: On a thousand acre farm.
Vw: Very poor and very hungry
Ja: From a line of wealthy planters.
Vw: What a cruel life to bear.
Ja: (I can't understand this part but it's something to do with being rich I'm guessing)
Vw: Then he drifted down to Hong Kong
Ja: (More stuff I don't get)
Vw: In a waterfront saloon.
Ja: In the moonlight he would croon.
Vw: That is where we heard him singing.
Ja: That's where Conrad started singing.
Vw: 'neath that diry Hong Kong moon
Ja: 'neath that old plantation moon.
(while vw and ja sing ""America"", chorus sings the conrad theme song-it's all
One big integrated mess)
Ch: We love you conrad, oh yes we do, we love you Conrad, and we'll be true. When you're not near us, we're blue. Oh Conrad we love you.

So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
My your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half-a-drink more
Never such a blizzard before.

I've got to get home
But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt,
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

It's cold out side.
It's cold out side."
Vanessa Williams,Be A Man,/v/vanessa+williams/be+a+man_20143544.html,"Be a man about it!
My heart's ringing like a telephone
Pick it up and dial in the answer
Oh I'm sick and tired of being alone
Let me know if love is what you're after

Just be a man about it
You don't have to worry
I won't turn you down
Just be a man about it
Oh don't complicate it
Let me know you'll be around

I took you from the number one
When you said you'd be with me forever
But I don't appreciate the cost that I am paying
For your being clever

So be a man about it
Oh don't complicate it
You don't have to lead me on
Just be a man about it
Just want you to love me right
You can't go wrong

If you just be a man about it
You don't have to worry
I won't turn you down
Just be a man about it
Oh don't complicate it
Let me know you'll be around

We could really have a good thing going
Though we don't know where it will lead
But we, we've got to keep the communication flowing
But that's not all I need
So won'tcha

Just be a man about it
You don't have to worry
I won't turn you down
Just be a man about it
Oh don't complicate it
Let me know you'll be around

The both of you were making eyes
You did it right in front of my face
As if I had no pride
And now you're always working late
You never have much time for me
And you're expecting me to believe
That ou're not out with she ...please!
Tonight I give you my surprise
I hope that you won't mind
I'm giving you an eye for an eye
Baby I've found another
And he is my lover
And I'm going out for the rest of your life

I betcha never thought I'd go that far
I betch never thought I'd break your heart
I betcha never even thought at all
I betcha never, no you never

I know that everybody lies, that I know I can't deny
But what if they're intentional, the intention of your crime
Cause I know how much I can take, I know my heart demands a change
If I can't have my way, then all I have to say
Tonight, I give you my surprise
In return for all the lies
I'm giving you an eye for an eye
Baby I've found another
And he is my lover
And we're going out for the rest of your life

Don't be sad 'cause we gave the best we had
We're better off now, better off now

Better off now, better off now
Maybe this time
We're better off saying goodbye

I know I'll never feel the same
After loving you this way
I'd do it all again
Though I know my heart would break
Once you've loved like this how do you admit

We're better off now, better off now
Maybe we just don't know it
Better off now, better off now
Maybe this time
We're better off saying goodbye

Maybe we just don't know it

Haven't we both been here before
Slight trace no more
You're with me somehow
Your touch, my hand
Softspoken words I understand
Nights spent, days planned
I'm asking you how
Can this be real
Can this be love I'm feelin'
Can this be a dream that fades in morning light
Can this be real
Can this be love I'm feelin'
Are you what you seem
Will you be real tonight
Quick turn, long stares
Is that a shadow, or are you there
You feel so near
What is this confusion
Ooo your voice soft and low
Blends in my ear with breezes that blow
No choice I know
I ask my illusions
Can this be real
Can this be love I'm feelin'
Can this be a dream that fades in morning light
Can this be real
Can this be love I'm feelin'
Are you what you seem
Will you be real tonight
Night goes, and day's here
I can still remember the taste of a tear
I still face a cold stare
The essence of someone is constantly here
Can this be real
I can almost feel your touch
But you're not there
This, I need you in the end
Can this be real
Can this be love I'm feelin'
Can this be a dream that fades in morning light
Can this be real
Can this be love I'm feelin'
Are you what you seem
Will you be real tonight
Your face, my door
Haven't we both been here before"

You're taking too much time
To make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't
And all the other girls
In your crazy mixed up world
You said you'd drop them
But you know you won't
Sometimes I think about forgetting you
But it's so, so hard to make that choice
'Cause boy with you
I go to to seventh heaven
Just by the sound of your voice

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

Outta my head
That's where I'm going
Tryin' so hard to deal with you
It's not so easy tryin' to bare these changes
That you're puttin' me through
In my head there's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out just what to do
I guess my life will keep on going round and round
Until I get away from you"
Vanessa Williams,Colors Of The Wind,/v/vanessa+williams/colors+of+the+wind_20143556.html,"You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other,
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let teh eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind"

Tearing me apart

Constantly, you're on my mind
Thinking about you all the time
I can't sleep no matter what I do

Should I play this game
Of just being your friend
When I know that's not where I want it to end

How could this be wrong
When the feeling's so strong
Tearing me apart

So what could you do to assure me
That you won't go astray and hurt me some day

She would blow, and they would dance, don't you know?
It was an uptown kind a show

Cool notes and melodies, harmonies
She sang the song of the universe
She can make a joyful noise up to heaven
And call the angels down to the earth

From jazz, to swing, to be-bop
She kept the spirit alive
For bo, duke, dizzy, and miles
She spoke her mind
She's ellamental to the art
She spoke her mind
She's ellamental to the art

Too hot, until the dawn she sang on
When joints were jumpin' and jive was in
Bodies movin' back and forth to the rhythm
Ever since ella first did her thing

From jazz, to swing to be-bop
She brought emotions and moves
She kept the spirit alive.
She spoke her mind

Act like ya know, oh!
Was it the smooth tones that was so much like butter
Oh ella was singin' just like no other singer
Cause you know I be the funky bringer of the new style
Because I be the wild child.
Listenin' to hip-hop, listening to be-bop and jazz

Sensation for the people, insperation for the sisters and brothers
Smooth jazz for the midnight lovers

Got the joint jumpin', remembering you 'til the dawn

I was never crazy for flowers
I confess that nothing left me colder.
I could watch a daisy for hours
And all I'd feel was several hours older.

Lilacs or lilies,
Anything you please
All that they did was make me shrug or sneeze.

But now I love each blossom that I see
For a lovely little rose loves me.

Now my life is Rosie,
Since I found my Rosie.
With a girl like rosie
How could I be blue?

Hand in hand we'll mosey
Me and little Rosie.
We will be so cozy
By a fire built for two.

Oh I once heard a poem that goes
A rose is a rose is a rose.
But I don't agree
Take it from me,
There's one rose sweeter than any that grows

That's my Rosie.
I'm so glad you chose me.
Life is one, sweet, beautiful song

So look across the ocean
See those on distant corners
Or see the one beside you
Look in their eyes and you'll know that it's true

This one
That one
Each one
Is God's Gift to the world

We are
They are
Each one
Is God's Gift to the world

And all the lonely people
The first ones are the last ones
All the great and small ones
The ones that win and lose

All of the remembered
Even the forgotten
From every single nation
You know it's true. .. True for me and you

This one
That one
Each one
Is God's Gift to the world

They are
We are
Each one
Is God's Gift to the world"

Look at your heart ache as you try to tell me
The love we made is not enough for you
You're walking away from all that we dreamed of
The things you say are leading to...

Goodbye, goodbye
You made your mind up but your heart can't say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye

You wait at the door and turn 'round to see me
The look in your eyes says you really want to stay
And then we touch, your hands are a whisper
They tell my heart that you can't say

Goodbye, goodbye
You made your mind up but your heart can't say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Say anything but darling don't say goodbye

Oh baby with or without you
I'll always love what we both knew

Say anything but darling don't say goodbye

Without you

If you just hold me tight, just once more
Just for tonight

Was built on solid ground
And it would just grow stronger
Crazy as it may seem
I need to dream that dream
For just, just a little longer


So for the sake of all that magic we made together
Open your heart to mine just one more time

Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her Child
Not a single room in sight
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day

By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little Boy was born

And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day. ""

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!

O night, hear the angel sing

Oh and how can you just walk away
Is it something that I said
I see only black and white
You see green and red
You believe in the miracles
Water into wine
I believe it when it makes the new york times

Does the moonlight shine on paris
After the sun goes down
If the london bridge is falling
Will anybody hear a sound
If you follow the sunset will it ever end
Does the moonlight shine on paris

We only had ourselves
Nobody else
No one was there to save us
We had to save ourselves

And when the storms came through
They found me and you
Back together
And when the sun would shine
It was yours and mine
Yours and mine forever


Chorus:
Oh how the years go by
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes
All through the changes, the soul never dies
We fight, we laugh, we cry
As the years go by


There were times we stumbled
They thought they had us down
We came around
How we rolled and rambled
We got lost and we got found
Now we're back on solid ground


We took everything
All our times would bring
In this world of danger
'cause when your heart is strong
You know you're not alone
In this world of strangers


Chorus

If we lose our way
Any night or day
Well, we'll always be
I'm there for you
And I know you're there for me


As the years go by
You know you're not alone
In this world of strangers

You go and save the best for last

When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

And share your dreams with me

No one around but I fell someone watching me
I look around, the street is bare nobody there
I wonder what it could be
As I turned to walk away
Suddenly I saw his face
Never minding that we were alone
Didn't care about the time, at the moment I was felling fine

I was looking into stranger's eyes
(he caught me by surprise)
They looked right through me
(he looking into my eyes)
Never knew
Never, ever thought that love could be
(that's when he came)
He came and captured me

Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it
Kind of strange and familiar
But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feeling
I get the feeling he knows me
Maybe I could stay a while, maybe I could make you smile
I don't have much to do
Maybe we could walk awhile
Maybe, maybe we could talk awhile

Can't help looking into stranger's eyes
I was looking into stranger's eyes
(he caught me by surprise)
They looked right through me
(he looked into my eyes)
Never knew
Never, ever thought that love could be
(that's when he came)
He came and captured me

How was I to know this would happen
Thought I didn't know I would meet this stranger
It's the kind of thing that dreams are made of
And I keep thinking about stranger's eyes
I was looking into stranger's eyes
(he caught me by surprise)
They looked right through me

Never knew
Never, ever thought that love could be

After a hard day's work
There's one thing to be certain of
This ol' familiar love
It's not unusual to find that it's sensual
It's all you need to let go

There's no need to try
Or compromise
Or settle for another outside of my love
The thing to do
When you get through
Heed the message seek the comfort of my zone

Hey welcome to the comfort zone
When you need to be loved like you need to be loved
Welcome to the comfort zone
Do whatever feels right and turns you on

Hey let me make you comfortable
Let me take control
And give your mind a break from the day you made
Let's turn the lights down low
And oh the rest you know

Breathing out and breathing in
Yes the easiest thing is loving you


Suddenly I'm weightless
Feel I could fly or walk on
With my feet never touching the ground
And I know I'm not crazy
And now I know I'm not sleeping
No the searching is over
And baby I've found


This is the easiest thing to do
It's the easiest thing to do
It's as simple and as natural as
Breathing out and breathing in
Yes the easiest thing is loving you


Suddenly the sadness is gone
And I don't have to tell myself
To struggle through
To carry on

It's as simple and as natural as
Breathing out and breathing in

Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth, it gave great light
And so it continued both day, and night

Warm against life's bitter cold

The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me
Were rattle the house like a wind
Both of ours so unbending
We battle the fear within

All the while, life is rushing by us
Hold it now and don't let go
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

So we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars till they're gone
And then even the memories have all faded away

Counting every minute, every hour till you're with me
'cause I know just what's in store
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door

Why waste another minute, ooh let's get right to it
Baby turn the lights down, and we don't have to say a word
Unspoken pleasure there's no way to measure
How you make me feel when you're near me and whisper softly...
So don't stop...

And it seems time flies whenever I'm in your arms
I like to savor every second, you thrill me with your charm
Now I'm lost in the passion (moment, feelings, magic) we share
And when I look into your eyes, I know how much you care

Don't wanna rush the feeling, cause loving you's so real and
I like the way you set the mood with a little wine and candlelight
It's more than emotion, let's keep this fire going
Now we're lost inside our love (now we're drifting into love),
Sweet surrender is so tender

Ooh, you know me oh so well
You always take your time, and you always get it right
(you know just what I like)
Ooh, you set my soul on fire, and I know you've got my rhythm
Cause then you take me higher

I love the winter weather
Because I've got my love to keep me warm

Take the summer you can have a ball
Take the springtime even the fall
But I guess I like the winter most of all

Oh, I love winter"
Vanessa Williams,With You I'm Born Again,/v/vanessa+williams/with+you+im+born+again_20547120.html,"Come bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again

Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again

I was half, not whole
In step with none
Reaching through this world
In need of one

Come show me your kindness
In your arms I know I'll find this
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again

Come bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again

Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again

I was half, not whole
In step with none
Reaching through this world
In need of one

Come show me your kindness
In your arms I know I'll find this
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again"

Everything, everything
Oh
You are, you are
Everything, everything
Oh
You are, you are
Everything, everything
Everything is you

Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
He walked like you do
I thought it was you
As he turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
Oh you are everything
And everything is you
Everything is you

How can I forget
When each face
That I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each man
With you
Knowing
They just won't do
They're not you

Oh you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
Everything is you

You are, you are
Everything, everything

Vanessa Williams,You Are My Home,/v/vanessa+williams/you+are+my+home_20534366.html,"All of my life
I been searching
For someone to find me
I have been looking
Waiting for your arms
To pull Me

You took Me
In from the cold
And out of the dark
You have taken Me
Into your heart

Chorus

You are my home
You are the one that I come to
You are the shelter I run to
To keep Me safe from the cold
You are my home
You are the love
That completes me
You are the touch
That has freed Me
I look in your eyes
And I know
You are my home

You were the light in the window
When I couldn't find my way
You led my heart to
Want them to place me
Here besides you

You are where I always will be
You are where I belong
I've been looking for you
For so long

You are my home
You are the one that I come to
You are the shelter I run to
To keep Me safe from the cold
You are my home
You are the love
That completes me
You are the touch
That has freed Me
I look in your eyes
And I know
You are my home

And I'll never be alone

Chorus

Baby, baby
Baby, You are my home

I look in your eyes
Te miro a los ojos
Y me haces sentir
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
You are my home
You are my home"
Vanessa Williams,You Can't Run,/v/vanessa+williams/you+cant+run_20143567.html,"Show me a heart that's got no passion
I'll show you a heart that's got no life
Show me a man that doesn't give his heart
I'll show you a man that tells you lies
Ooo you can try to run, but there's nowhere to hide
Love is stronger than your lies
Oh and ooo, you can deny it all you want
But love will win, it's just a matter of time
You know you can't run from love
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Ain't nowhere to hide
You know, you can't run you know
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Love is stronger than your lies


Show me a heart that's not committed
I'll show you a man that doesn't try
Show me a heart that doesn't die for love
I'll show you an empty man inside
Ooo you can run, but you won't find no place to hide
Love don't want your heart to die
Oh and ooo, you can deny love all you want
But love is strong and love won't be denied

You know you can't run from love
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Ain't nowhere to hide
You know, you can't run you know
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Love is stronger than your lies

Vanessa Williams,You Don't Have To Say You're Sorry,/v/vanessa+williams/you+dont+have+to+say+youre+sorry_20143568.html,"We all make mistakes, I've made my share, oh
You don't have to say you're sorry
I don't need those words to know you care
Explanations aren't required even though you think you should
I don't need to know the reasons, No, not even if they're good
You don't have to say you're sorry, But I sure do wish you would

You don't have to say you're sorry
And that's a silly game that children play, oh
You don't have to say you're sorry, no
No, you shouldn't have to live that way

You don't have to say you're sorry
Cause we're both too old it's true
Well they say when you love someone, forgiveness is the rule
You don't have to say you're sorry, But I sure do wish you would

Explanations aren't required, even though you think you should
I don't need to know your reasons
No, not even if they're good
You don't have to say you're sorry
But I sure do wish you would, I wish you would

Vanessa Williams,You Gotta Go,/v/vanessa+williams/you+gotta+go_10169788.html,"I never know why
Why we can't see eye to eye
And like a fool I believed
We would find a way to survive

I wish we could be more than just a memory
'cause we loved, we laughed, we cried
And there's no good in goobye

You tell me you need some time
Some time to be on my own
Right now when I need you so
Don't know how long it will take
Do you expect me to wait
But baby I gotta go

Then you gotta go

If you must go, you ought to know
I will get along, I will live without you
And if you should leave I hope you see
I won't be around baby if you shoud leave
You're gonna need me

You might think that leaving is easy
I had no right to lead you on
I should have told you the moment the feeling was gone
What I'm trying to say is that I need some space,
I need to be sure

No, you'll never find another love like me
All around this world
Still you tell me

You tell me you need some time
Some time to be on my own
Right now when I need you so
Don't now how long it will take
But baby I gotta go

Then you gotta go

You said you'll always be mine
I need to be on my own
I gotta be on my own
Not gotta beg you to stay
But I'll be back boy I know
Baby I gotta go

Then you gotta go"
Vanessa Williams,You Would Be My Baby,/v/vanessa+williams/you+would+be+my+baby_20355518.html,"From ""The Mask"" soundtrack

If I have a secret resepy
You would be my baby
If I have the perfect fantasy
You would be my baby
If the world was mine to redesign
Then suddenly you would find
That you'd be my baby

If I wrote you poems that made you cry
Would you be my baby?
If I say the sweetest lullaby
Would you be my baby?
If I promise you the moon and stars
With heaven waiting in my heart
Would you be my baby?

But if I only have
True love to offer you
Would that be enough
To make you want me to?

I would kiss and talk you then each night
You would be my baby
Then had watch you're sleep and hold you tight
You would be my baby
I would make you mine for rich upon
And never need to ask for more
If you'd be my baby

You would be my baby

If I had a chance that we'll romance
If I can chose my circumstance
Then you'd be my baby

But if I only have
True love to offer you
Would that be enough
To make you want me to?

If I have a secret resepy
You would be my baby
If I have the perfect fantasy
You would be my baby
If the world was mine to redesign
Then suddenly you would find
That you'd be my
You would be my baby-would be my baby"
