Frank Sinatra,(I Offer You The Moon) Senorita,/f/frank+sinatra/i+offer+you+the+moon+senorita_20193932.html,"I offer you the moon set in a summer sky
That is mine to give, seorita.
I offer you the breeze singing a lullaby,
That is mine to give, seorita.
I can't bring a golden crown set with pearls and rubies rare,
But I can bring a rose and place it in your hair.
I offer you these things that come from up above,
I give them and my love to you.

 Just one way to say, I love you.
 I love you, I love you, and try as I may,
 That's all I can say, I love you.
 Much more could be said if I thought with my head,
 But I only can think with my heart.
 I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day,
 The day when you'll say, I love you.

 Much more could be said if I thought with my head,

Frank Sinatra,(Once Upon) A Moonlight Night,/f/frank+sinatra/once+upon+a+moonlight+night_20270563.html,"Once upon a moonlight night
Two hearts blended
Love surrendered
With embracing arms
Remember

Once the dawn came into sight
Ears that listened
Eyes that glistened
Knew its charms

And with our first kiss
Our first tender sigh
A shower of moondust
Fell from the sky

We'll always keep
The love light shining bright
That started
Once upon a lovely moonlight night

And with our first kiss
Our first tender sigh
A shower of moondust
Fell from the sky

We'll always keep
The love light shining bright
That started
Once upon a lovely moonlight night"
Frank Sinatra,(We've Got A) Sure Thing,/f/frank+sinatra/weve+got+a+sure+thing_20349854.html,"Won't say that grass will grow or ivy will climb,
But darling, I'd say, we've got a sure thing this time,
I'd say that we're on our way to a star,
And, take a tip from me, we are, we are.
Won't say that rivers flow or day turns to night,
But darling, I'd say we've got a sure thing all right.
Won't say it's winter when snow falls from above,
But darling, it's a sure thing we're in love.

I never predict the future, I haven't a crystal ball,
I wouldn't attempt to tell you when tomorrow will fall.
Why should I have opinions, supposing I might be wrong,
I'm mucht better off if I just call along.
(Won't say that rivers flow or day turns to night,)

But darling, it's a sure thing we're in love."
Frank Sinatra,A Baby Just Like You,/f/frank+sinatra/a+baby+just+like+you_20055988.html,"The season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living
The Christmas time when I was young,
The magic and the wonder,
But colors dull and candles dim,
And dark my standing under
O little Zachary, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning

A Savior King was born that day,
A baby just like you,
And as the Magi came with gifts,
I come with my gift too
That peace on Earth fills up your time,
That brotherhood surrounds you.

That you may know the warmth of love,
And wrap it all around you
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young

Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone"
Frank Sinatra,A Cottage For Sale,/f/frank+sinatra/cottage+for+sale+a_20056273.html,"A little dream castle with every dream gone
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
A beautiful garden has withered away
Where you planted roses the weeds seem to say
A cottage for sale

From every single window I see your face
But when I reach a window there's empty space
The key's in the mailbox the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is there on the door
A cottage for sale"
Frank Sinatra,A Day In The Life Of A Fool,/f/frank+sinatra/a+day+in+the+life+of+a+fool_20055645.html,"A day in the life of a fool, a sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue, and hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you, coming my way
I stop just across from your door, but you're never home any more
So back to my room, and there in the gloom
I cry tears of good bye
That's the way it will be every day in the life of fool"
Frank Sinatra,A Fella With An Umbrella,/f/frank+sinatra/a+fella+with+an+umbrella_20195821.html,"I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.
Raindrops have brought us together,
And that's what I long to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
So I'll be the fella, that fella with an umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.

Oh, the raindrops have brought us together,
And that's what I long to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a big break for me.
So I'll be the fella, the kid with the small umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
If you will be the girl, the girl who saved her love for a rainy day."
Frank Sinatra,A Fellow Needs A Girl,/f/frank+sinatra/a+fellow+needs+a+girl_20195792.html,"A fellow needs a girl to sit by his side, at the end of a weary day.
To sit by his side and listen to him talk and agree with the things he'll say.
A fellow needs a girl to hold in hid arms when the rest of the world goes wrong,
To hold in his arms and know that she believes that her fellow is wise and strong.
When things go right, and his job's well done,
He wants to share the prize he's won.
If no one shares and no one cares,
Where is the fun of a job well done? Or a prize you've won?
A fellow needs a home, his own kind of home, but to make this dream come true,
A fellow needs a girl, his own kind of girl, my kind of girl is you."
Frank Sinatra,A Fine Romance,/f/frank+sinatra/a+fine+romance_20055835.html,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance"
Frank Sinatra,A Foggy Day,/f/frank+sinatra/foggy+day+a_20055349.html,"A foggy day,
In london town,
It had me low,
And it had me down
I viewed the morning,
With much alarm,
The british museum,
Had lost it's charm
How long I wondered,
Could this thing last,
But the age of miracles,
It hadnt past
And suddenly,
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy london town,
The sun was shining everywhere"
Frank Sinatra,A Friend Of Yours,/f/frank+sinatra/a+friend+of+yours_20199908.html,"Just say that I'm a friend of yours and maybe they won't get wise,
And if they see us together, I'll brush the dream from my eyes.
I'll tell my heart it mustn't seem the song of remember when,
Just say that I'm a friend of yours that you happen to meet again.

I'll tell my heart that it mustn't seem the song of remember when,
Just say that I'm a friend of yours that you happen to meet again."
Frank Sinatra,A Garden In The Rain,/f/frank+sinatra/garden+in+the+rain+a_20056285.html,"'twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray

The raindrops kissed the flower beds
The blossoms raised their thirsty heads
A perfumed ""Thank you"" they seemed to say

Surely here was charm beyond compare - to view
Maybe it was just that I was there - with you

'twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way

'twas just a garden in the rain

Frank Sinatra,A Good Man Is Hard To Find,/f/frank+sinatra/a+good+man+is+hard+to+find_20204031.html,"[Girl]

Now here's a story with quite a moral,
And all you gals, you gotta pay some mind,
When you find a guy [yeah?] worth keeping, be satisfied,
Make sure you treat him very kind..
'Cause a good guy [Ow!] is hard to find,
You could always get the other kind.
[But when you think that you got her tied, you'll find her]
Messing around with another guy.
Then you rave and you'll even start to crave,
Man, you want to see her lying deep down in the grave.
So if the guy's nice, you better take my advice,
You better love him in the morning, kiss him every night,
Ooo, give him plenty of loving, treat him right,
Because a good man nowadays is hard to find.

[Buster, you gotta be kidding, you see this little guy?]
[The one with the feeble mind, he always been, he moving time.]
[One fine day he dug another chick, she took all his loot and cut him quick.]
[Now, he's calling me back on the phone, he says]
Baby, don't you go away, I'm coming right home.
[But if you wanna come back, come on in our little grass shack,]
[You gotta love me in the morning, kiss me in the night,]
[You give me lots of loving, treat me right,]
['Cause a good gal nowadays is hard to find.]

Well, I went back, but I told this doll,
I said:  Woman, then is then, but now is now,
If you want me to stay, there's just one but (what?)
Keep a smile on your face, and keep your big mouth shut.
Well, we're back together, and everything is fine,
[I'm a-running the show, jack, you better stay in line.]
[Now you know what to do when the day is through.]
I better love you in the am [that's right!], kiss you in the pm [what else?]
Give plenty of loving [show me!] with all my mind [good boy!]
[For a good gal nowadays are hard to find.. Leroy!]  Yes, ma'am!
[I am just.. You better keep those cotton picking hands off all those other dames or I'll]
Or you'll what? [I'll fly over there and turn off all your lights.]
Uh yeah, like I was saying, a good
[Oh man, yes!]"
Frank Sinatra,A Hundred Years From Today,/f/frank+sinatra/hundred+years+from+today+a_20055542.html,"Hey don't save your kisses - just pass 'em around
You'll find my reason - is logically sound
Who's gonna know that you past them around
A hundred years from today
And why crave a penthouse - that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven - on mamma Earth's green
If you had millions - what would they all me
One hundred years from today
So (Hey) laugh and sing - make love the thing
Be happy while you may
('Cause) There's always one - beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining - and that's a (very) good sign
Cling to me closer - say (that) you'll be mine
Remember baby we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today, a hundred years from today"
Frank Sinatra,A Little Learning Is A Dangerous Thing,/f/frank+sinatra/a+little+learning+is+a+dangerous+thing_20246641.html,"with (Pearl Bailey)

Hey, Pearl, what's bugging you, girl?
(Too much knowledge, Frank, too much knowledge.)
Explain it to me.
(Well, it was down at school at the age of six.)
One of the real quiz kids.
(Yeah , so did reason and lightning touch.)
Usual thought.
(As time went on, I studied lots of, oh, the other things.)
Uh huh, like a.
(No, most of them didn't hurt much.)
Well, I've had other teachers.
(Well I got my diploma, I was real real smart.)
In a pretty frame, huh?
(Of my knowledge there was no doubt.)
That's pretty obvious.
(Yeah but lately I've had the same, like in your words too,)
(It wasn't even a thought, let me tell you what I found out now.)
Look at the size of my ears, pour it on.
(You know it started with a man.)
Uh huh!
(And the man he was grand.)
Ain't that the truth.
(He had a lie that would make a bird sing.)
This kid really came on, I can see that,
'Cause you were much too smart to be afraid at the start.
(Frank, a little learnin' is a dangerous thing.)
Well, I'd like to hear some more.
(First he only wanted two.)
To?
(Then he changed it to few.)
Oh, you mean loot.
(I even loaned that man my watch and my ring.)
Oh, you lost your head, Pearl, completely,
'Cause you were hip to the fact that he would pay you right back.
(Yep, a little learning is a dangerous thing.)
Uh huh.  Yes, with his sweetheart, his so discreet heart.
(Oh Frank, he had me doing things that I shouldn't do.)
That cad, ain't no denying, so sense in trying.
(Let me tell you, it is just as bad.  My education's been like some book.)
Bet you had an encyclopedia.
(Yet now I know the score at last.)

Frank Sinatra,A Long Night,/f/frank+sinatra/a+long+night_20241011.html,"Long night, it's a long night, my friend
The barrooms and the back street's dead end
Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise and good times in the air
It was just, it was just another big town with midnight's neon glare

Long night, it's a long night, I know
The bus rides and the ""nowhere to go""

I've seen what the street corners do to things like love and dreams
Seen what the bottle can do to a man with his hopes and his schemes

A long night, what a long night it has been
The wheelers and the dealers, they win
I've tasted the 90-proof gin and chased it away with the blues
I rarely paid debts that I owed but I sure have paid my dues

No daylight, just a long night for me"
Frank Sinatra,A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening,/f/frank+sinatra/a+lovely+way+to+spend+an+evening_20055655.html,"Some like a night at the movies
Some like a dance or a show
Some are content with an evening spent
Home by the radio

Some like to live for the moment
Some like to just reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend
Just give me one like this

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A casual stroll through a garden
A kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you"
Frank Sinatra,A Lover Is Blue,/f/frank+sinatra/a+lover+is+blue_20249583.html,"Yesterday we were gay,
 I was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow,
 You've gone, and so a lover is blue.
 Life was sweet, so complete,
 Now I've suddenly waken to find I'm forsaken,
 Alone, and so a lover is blue.
 Do you still remember our love affair,
 Does it matter to you,
 But I'll have to go through our door to care.
 Here and there everywhere,
 Every scene just reminds me
 Of something that binds me
 To you, and so a lover is blue."
Frank Sinatra,A Man Alone,/f/frank+sinatra/a+man+alone_20056466.html,"In me, you see a man alone
Held by the habit of being on his own
A man who listens to the trembling of the trees
With sentimental ease

In me, you see a man alone
Behind the wall he's learned to call his home
A man who still goes walkin' in the rain
Expecting love again

A man not lonely except when the dark comes on
A man learning to live with mem'ries of midnights that fell apart at dawn

In me, you see a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems
Only other people's dreams

[instrumental-strings]

A man learning to live with memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn

In me, you see a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems
Just other people's dreams"
Frank Sinatra,A Marshmallow World,/f/frank+sinatra/a+marshmallow+world_20756395.html,"It's a marshmallow world
In the winter
When the snow
Comes to cover the ground
It's the time for play
It's a whipped cream day
I wait for it all year round
Those are marshmallow clouds
Being friendly
In the arms
Of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red
Like a pumpkin head
It's shining
So your nose won't freeze
The world is your snowball
See how it grows
That's how it goes
Whenever it snows
The world is your snowball
Just for a song
Get out and roll it along

It's a yum-yummy world
Made for sweethearts
Take a walk
With your favorite girl
It's a sugar date
What if spring is late
In winter
It's a marshmallow world

The world is your snowball
See how it grows
That's how it goes
Whenever it snows
The world is your snowball
Just for a song

You held me in your arms, a million dreams ago.
So many dreams have flown, so many nights alone
I guess I should have known, it couldn't be.
I'll lock my mem'ries here in my heart
And here in my heart they'll stay.
And through the years, they'll always be part
A part of a lovely day
Goodbye, good luck old friend, I'll smile and just pretend
There was no end, a million dreams ago"

There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square

I may be right, I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square

One night perfect for romancing
The night a sinner kissed an angel
He wanted thrills, she wanted love

Oh, but his sighs were tender
As he begged her to surrender
The night a sinner kissed an angel
And she believed that it was love

How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying

Yes, miracles can happen
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel
That was the night I fell in love"

But with you there at my side, I'll soon be turning the tide... Just wait

We're gonna make it all the way home

Magic potions,
Incense and lotions
Bells, books and candles
Can make a witches' brew

Love spells or riches
You are my treasure
My fairy tale come true
With you is where I'll stay
All the time, anywhere
Turn around, and I'll be there
It was I, now it's we

And I'm asking nothing of you love, only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself, ss long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you, just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
It's not out of greed but for love, and for need.

I love you so, I still do, I'm sure you know when I'm holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye
Call and I'll come when your world's come undone
I'm like you, I get lonely too, and I need someone to hold
Knowing well this world can be hell and sometimes very cold

Nothing firm and nothing binding, now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime

There's a certain thing about you, summer, fall and spring about you

Because your daddy's so alone

Because I never thought we'd part

We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

[instrumental]

Seasons came and changed the time
And we grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play?""

""Bang bang, I shot you down""
""Bang bang, you hit the ground""
""Bang bang, that awful sound""
""Bang bang, I used to shoot you down""

[Bridge:]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang

Now she's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
She didn't even say ""goodbye""

It's not the note that I sent you that you quickly burn,
It's not a book I lent you that you never return.

Frank Sinatra,Begin The Beguine,/f/frank+sinatra/begin+the+beguine_20153584.html,"Spoken:
A tune from Cole Porter perhaps. Now there's a guy who writes for keeps. His tunes not only become hits, they stay hits. Begin the Beguine was written in 1935, and it's still very popular

When they begin the beguine, it brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor, it brings back a memory ever green
I'm with you once more under the stars, and down by the shore an orchestra's playing
Even the palms seem to be swaying, when they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor, except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever, and promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds come along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine, let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember when they begin the beguine
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in, when they begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine"

Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colorful like that

It's not easy bein' green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're
Not standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky

But green is the color of Spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree

When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder, why wonder?
I am green and it'll do fine
It's beautiful
And I think it's what I want to be

Come the day that your mine

A simpering, whimpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep

Frank Sinatra,Birth Of The Blues,/f/frank+sinatra/birth+of+the+blues+the_10121990.html,"Writer(s): desylva/brown/henderson

Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diffrent tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland gave birth to the blues!"

And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away

If I expected love when first we kissed, blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist, blame it on my youth
I believed in everything like a child of three
You meant more than anything all the world to me

If you were on my mind all night and the day, blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray, blame it on my youth
And if I cried a little bit when first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart, blame it on my youth"

She'll find the note I left hanging on her door.
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working.
She'll probably stop for lunch and give me a call.
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing, on the wall, that's all.
By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleeping.
She'll turn softly and call my name out low.
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her,
Though time and time again I tried to tell her so.
She just didn't know I would really go."

But send that rainbow to me
Then my shadows will fly
Though you'll be gone for a while
I know that I'll be 
Smiling with my baby 
By and by
Bye, bye baby, so long!
Bye bye baby 
Just you remember that 
You're my baby when

And although we know that you care

She didn't mean it,
I should have seen it,
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams,
Now it seems,
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
""Can't we be friends?""

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong,
Not for long,
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
""Can't we be friends?""

Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry,
Heave a sigh,
And wonder why,
And wonder why?

Watta bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,
""Can't we be just friends?"""

And even when my chips are low
There's still some left for givin'
I've been many places
Maybe not as far as you
So I think I'll stay awhile
And see if some dreams come true

There isn't much that I have learned
Through all my foolish years
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles
First there's laughter, then those tears

But I'll keep my head up high
Although I'm kinda tired

You know it's almost funny
But things can't get worse than now

Has brought my lover to me

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air

And to my greatest joy my boy is there

It his prince and walks
Into my dreams and talks

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I tried to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love up above

When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine

You will hurt my feelings don't you see my love
I wish I had an ear like yours
A voice that would behave
But all I have is feelings and a voice gone deaf
You insist my music goes against the rules
But rules were never meant for lovesick fools
I wrote this little song for you but you don't care
Its a crooked song oh but all my love is there
The thing that you would see if you would play your part
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart
I took your picture with my trusty Rollaflex
And now all I have developed is a complex
Possibly in vain I hope you weaken oh my love
And forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand
That even though I may be out of tune

All that matters is the message that I bring
Which is my dear one I love you"

To many words, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

O give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my on saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in"

I'm not too good at leaving time
I've got no taste for grieving time
No, no, not me

You've been my near ones, always my dear ones
I never thought that I would find
Another love, a different kind
But it came to be

Well if you think I'm telling you lies
Go try your luck and look into her eyes
But remember, you must remember she's mine
And my world overhead has a clear new shine

Don't want to leave you
Sorry to grieve you
It's traveling time, and I must move on
Found the girl (gal) to lean upon

And if I could arrange it
Oh would I care to chance it - not me"

Since I looked in your direction,
Your tenderness is all I seem to crave.
But when I look for your affection,
You smile, my dear, and tell me to behave.
Don't make me beg for your kisses,
Beg for your tender embrace,
I want your love, not your sympathy,
Please don't make a beggar of me.

While I sigh and keep confessing,
The love I have for you will never die,
Somehow you always keep me guessing,
And wond'ring just how long I'll have to cry.
Don't make me beg for your kisses,
Beg for your tender embrace.
I want your love, not your sympathy,
Please don't make a beggar of me."

Take off your coat, my love, and close the door
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart, then you take it to heart
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
You don't realize that it's all compromise
And the problems are so overrated
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain

Share every precious moment with me, don't you wait too long

How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
Downtown - no finer place, for sure
Downtown - everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows - downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close - downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

Dry your eyes and play it slowly, like you're marching off to war,
Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before.
From the center of the circle to the midst of the waving crowd.
If it ever be forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud.
Come, dry your eyes.
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know.
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free,
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people sing,
Through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon,
To that distant calling angel who descended much too soon.
And come, dry your eyes.

With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide?

At last, we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real

When everything's been taken from them.
Me, don't ask me about empty.

Empty is a string of dirty days
Held together by some rain.
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again.
Empty is the color of the fear
Long about September when the days
Go marching in a line toward November.
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light.
Empty is me.
Empty is me."

Are you heading for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do ya talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do ya walk tonight?

Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under
Control
Cut the thread, but leave

Merrry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only
Sew and weep
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love
Is
Playing the fool

Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just
For children in school

Fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see

I fell
In love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me"

When you need someone to cheer you - all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes - if it's real

When somebody needs you
Its no good unless he needs you - all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years - come what way

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you - all the way, all the way"

Please stop it now

My head is spinning around and around
My head is spinning around and around
Your witchcraft has got me
Keep going down and down

Let me forget her, don't mention her name
You know it brings back that old burning flame
It hurts to know that she doesn't feel the same

I can't go on since she left me alone
My one desire now is to cry, now to cry
She might come back one day by and by and by"

I'm a fool to want you

To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
Then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say

I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong
It must be wrong
But right or wrong
I can't get along
Without you

I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway

When I bit off more than I could chew

I've had my fill, my share of losing

I find it all so amusing

I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
It never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

Girls who lived up the stairs
With perfume hair that came undone
When I was twenty-one.

When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year.
It was a very good year for blue-blooded
Girls of independent means.
We'd ride in limousines. Their chauffeurs
Would drive when I was thirty-five.

But now the days are short, I'm in the
Autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage
Wine from fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs. It poured
Sweet and clear. It was a very good year"

How much you have been on my mind

But you can rely on a love that won't die
For haven't I told you so

So let's stop before it's too late
And leave it all up to the fates
Cause in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over
Do it all over again

Each of us and everyone
Carries a burden of love
But as far as I go in my heart I know
It's you I'll be thinking of

So what is there left to say
As I see us drifting away
You can always depend on a love that won't end
Won't you think of me, think of me that way

So let's stop before it's too late
And leave it all up to the fates
Cause in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love

Well goodbye world
It's sad but true
Got a date with the hangman
I have to leave you
I shot my Darlin'
Three times of more
The reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor

The nights are so lonely
The days are so long
I'm in the jailhouse
Cause they say I've done wrong
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore
The reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor (blood on the floor)

Well I came home one night
She were lyin',
With her legs around
Another mans bod
She saw me, stared laughin'
But she cried, when she saw my gun

Goodbye world
I guess we must part
They're taking my life
Cause I shot my sweetheart
I don't say I'm sorry
I just say I'm sore
The reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor
Oh the reason I'm goin'
Is blood on the floor
Oh the reason I'm goin'
Is the blood on the floor"

It's always something
Or it ain't nothing at all
It's feast or famine
Too hot or out in the cold
So here we stand
Alone together
Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it
I wouldn't be here at all

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again
(Here we go again)
Well it's blow by blow

Coming off the ropes
And fighting for the hope in us all
Are you in my corner
Or playing both sides of the wall
So make a stand
It's now or never
Cause life is much too short
And if your heart isn't in it
You shouldn't be here at all

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again
(Here we go again)
Well it's blow by blow

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
I'm back on my feet again
(I'm back on my feet again)
Well it's blow by blow

I can almost see through the tears
And I've got my pride
The dreams that I've hidden for years
Just won't be denied

So here we stand
Alone together
Our backs against the wall
If my heart wasn't in it
I wouldn't be here at all

Blow by blow
Well it's blow by blow
And here we go again

It was a blue letter
She wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I wanna lover who don't get old.

Do I read a message in your eyes
You wanna love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you.

For every voice you ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so,
Just give me one more song to go.

Do I read a message in your eyes
You wanna love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you."

Don't let waters of caution remove you
Don't let the fire of saints compel you
Don't let the lack of their spirit blind your life
Cause soon it's all over, you're gonna come through alive

Well I've been all over the world five times or more
And I've seen the future burn blue before my eyes
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire
Don't let the violence blind you, you're gonna come through alive

And the roses that are offing
They are real as evening wind
They are washed by love and suffering
Cause my love has colored them
Colored them
Oooooh oooohh-nothing but roses

Don't dam the river that's running through you
Stop saving up for time that may never become
I've seen the future come true in twenty days
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday

I've had my share of blue revelations
And I know that time is a region to be passed
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by

Cause a rose that will be growing
In the place where I have hidden
It is washed by love and suffering
That my love has colored in

Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the rooooooooses
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh
Look where the roses grow

And I'm blaming no one else

And closing my eyes
And seeing you standing there

Now it's the same as before
You've touched me with your love

And though you're in my heart
We're still a world apart
As now I'm back to the time
Where I would search for a dream
But no use to try anymore as before
Someday I'll die, and maybe then I'll be with you

So I'm closing my eyes
To hear the people laugh

For they're all alone
Not knowing where to go

But is it asking too much
When the question is what to do
With the life I have
It seems I know nothing now
Except my love for you
And the strength in my hands
To go on feeding your smile"

I wonder where you are and how you feel
Sometimes I walk by and I look up to your balcony
Just to make sure that you were real
Just to make sure that I can still feel you

When I see you again,
As I always do
It appears to me that
Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together,
It's just following the rules
No one's a fool...

Six weeks in a foreign country, how the time flew
I didn't speak the language, but somehow I knew
That that would be the only time that we could be alone and foolish
We said we'd never come home

Destiny rules
And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose
It's not being together,

Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Why not think about times to come,
And not about the things that you've done,
If your life was bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow will do.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

All I want is to see you smile,
If it takes just a little while,
I know you don't believe that it's true,
I never meant any harm to you.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

And when the roses are half-bud soft flowers
And lovely as the king of flies has come
It was a fleeting visit, all too brief
In three short minutes, he had been and gone

He rested there upon an apple leaf
A gorgeous opal crown sat on his head
Although the garden is a lovely place
Was it worthy of so fine a guest

Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

Dragonfly, dragonfly..."

There's a place
I sometimes see you there
It's a place that I visit

And I see your face
Your eyes tell me you still care
But it's suddenly over
With morning's first light

As the day begins
This feeling is going strong
Sometimes the only thing
That keeps me going on
And until you find
Your own way back to me
I'll be forever
Dreamin' the dream

We see no change in sight
Watching her decline
She gets on a midnight plane

It doesn't do well in the light
Affairs of the heart
Start out in the dark
Usually stay with the night

I know you don't agree

I know he loves me
Everyday he calls me
He says he adores me
What can I say

You can't love him
You can't have him
I do have him, most of the time

Anywhere we can
Anytime we can
Get away... get away

Maybe it's just something else
That you can't tell me
Maybe it's in the way that you
Look away from me

It's not like any words
Need to be said
Well you always know when something's wrong

Wake up with a stranger

Not all the king's horses
Not all the king's men
Could put it back together

You said you wouldn't do this for very long

Well it bounces off the wall

When the miracle is happening

To get... this... high...

Why am I always so intense
In this same place I sit
The same place as before
I came all the way here
Just to watch you walk out that door

I didn't ask when you shook your head
I always accepted what you said as the truth
And the truth only
Well, it's not enough that you depend on me
It's not enough that you say you love me
It's not enough to just save face

Because sometimes you just fall from grace
Sometimes you just fall from grace

Maybe I am calmer now
Maybe things are fine
Maybe I made the whole thing up
Maybe it isn't a lie
Maybe the reason I say these things
Is to bring you back alive
Maybe I've fought this long and this hard
Just to make sure you survive
Just to make sure you survive"

To be the last to leave
The last to be gone
Stolen from the ones
Who held onto it
To be the last in line
Oh the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream
Treasured by the ones
Who hung on to it

Almost a breakdown
Of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick
Like a whip through the air
Long distance winners
Will we survive the flight
Not one of us runs
From the fire light

I would love to believe
I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no there is no easy way
No one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades

I would love to believe
I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
For us there is no easy way
No one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades

To be the last to leave
What caused the fearsome
Divorce in the night
There was no competition
Well to survive do it right
And you believe in the five
To survive the distance
Everyone fights
Everyone fights
And the fire flies

What happened to my feelings
When heartbreak comes in the night
Some call it my nightmare
My five fireflies
Well like a sailing ship
On one of love's rocks

No one

Of our love affair
Like a whip through the air
I would love to believe
I believe what you say

Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now- do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home.

Now I'm supposed to understand
Don't you think you're asking too much
What kind of fool do you think I am
Don't you think you've hurt me enough
Still you want to be friends
But I don't want to be just friends

So before you start with your sympathy
Just turn around and go
And if he breaks your heart, don't come crying to me
I won't be there anymore
Go ahead and cry your tears
'Cause I'm not gonna dry your tears

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings run deep

I'll be alright, don't you worry about me
I'll take care of myself
The first thing I need is you out of my life
The last thing I need is your help
Sorry I met you
Sorry I met you
I will forget you, someday

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep
These hard feelings run deep

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be
These hard feelings run deep

And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be

Oh I have seen
Such madness in the air
Just like a dream
It makes no sense anywhere

Hopes have shattered
Shattered like broken glass
I believed it was just too good to last
(It seemed to me it was too good to last)

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

But don't you remember
Those days of cold delight
We could make it all right

It seems so long ago
Oh maybe it was yesterday
Where did the time go
I guess it just slipped away
(Seemed like the time was slipping away)

So now you're saying you've been wrong
And you want to come back home
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart of stone

And now you want to change your song
You're tired of living alone
You know I've known all along
That you had a heart made of stone

You're never too old to learn
You're never too young to pray
It's never too late to learn
And hope for better days

You're never too old to learn

You've got diamonds in your eyes

Don't get carried away

It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
(They) got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

Seems like a dream
(They) got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most is the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized

Seems like a dream

And I don't know where she gone

She said she wasn't gonna leave me
She said she always gonna stay by my side
She said she wasn't gonna leave me
She said she always gonna stay by my side
This time she mistreated me
And I don't know how many times she lied

Well I love my baby
And I'll tell the world I do
I love my baby
I'll tell the world I do
But now I've lost my baby
I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do-yeah"

A reflection in the window
All the way to Point Dune
Illume-like it dances
I am a cliff dweller
From the old school

I like the coastal cities
I like the lights...
I like the way the ocean blends
Into the city at night
Like living on a working river
This coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake
In a black sky

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade you for jade
Or for diamonds
Not for one minute
Not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted
That I was just so scared

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadows of a stranger

What I saw on this journey
I saw history go down
I cannot pretend
That the heartache falls away
It's just like a river
Ooh, it's never ending

That the heartache falls away

It's never ending
It's just like a river
It's never ending

Well I try and I try
You can't forget her
Can't run, can't hide
When you remember
Nights that won't fade away
Yea fade away

Well I still go crazy
When you hear her name
Feels like you just left today
And it drives you insane
But you keep holding on
Yea holding on

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play
In the back of my mind

When I close my eyes
You can still touch her
And I fantasize
She's still your lover
When I wake up I see
The only place you'll be
I know where you'll be

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Every night, every day
That's where you still play

Like we touched the summer sun
I can see your shadow standing there
On the streets where we used to run

Remember

In the back of my mind
You live all the time
In the back of my mind

Every night, every day
That's where you still play

On you... now look what I've become

Some days lonely is not only
A word... but faces I have known
And if you see me... could you free me
With a smile... so I can let go

Thoughts of you
Spinning round

Your eyes still shine
As they did
When you were mine

I can see
In a dream
Thougts so clear
And jewels that gleam
Would your eyes
Still sparkle then
If we were, once again

Jewel eyed Judy please come home
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone
Jewel eyed Judy please come home
Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone

Lovely Judy
Can you see
Where it is
You're meant to be
Where you lay
Your head tonight
May the stars
Find your light
So am I
Sitting here
Moonlight glistens
On my tears
Is this all
That we could find
Chains of memories
Left behind

Jewel eyed Judy don't leave me alone

For every good thing, must you get bad
But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm gonna keep on the way I'm going

For every crime, there's retribution
And every vally has a mountainside
No, I don't like to trade just to be happy
That kind of deal won't turn out right

Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

Thought the story of Moses was just a tall tale

Just can't imagine the hurt

My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
But she's true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night goes rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

My love, she speaks like silence

She knows how to work - and she knows how to play
She knows how to keep me happy - everyday
Love that woman, yes, I need you by my side
Whoa, 'cause you got a way baby
Whoa, a way that keeps me satisfied

When a no good man - tries to give her a line
She tells him quick - whoa, she's all mine.
Love that woman, yes, your everything to me

The swamp is getting deeper all the time
And the faces that I see don't seem to shine

And the mystery that there used to be is gone

Let me go
Miles away
Let me ride
Just miles away
Don't wanna know
I'm not gonna miss it much
Gonna be drivin' once again

Don Juan goes up in a cloud of smoke
And all those Hare Krishnas turned out to be a joke
And it's restless, restless, restless all the time
Slidin' up and down the surface of this life
Now I know that I can't say what's black and white
But if I could fly I think I'd try tonight"
Fleetwood Mac,Miranda,/f/fleetwood+mac/miranda_20054367.html,"Music and lyrics by Lindsey Buckingham

At the end of the day
The end of the light
She keeps the remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes

She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count
And finally out

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in
As the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved
But she loves to be seen
She slips down headlong into the night

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

And then all at once
The sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade
And lets herself drown

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

The lights shot down in the arena
All across the safety zone
But loneliness follows Miranda
And Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone"

In between the black and blue
From a window I heard your voice
Telling me you were through

But I remember you

Miss fantasy
I can see you don't remember me
But I remember you

And do you still tremble when I fall
Will you still answer when I call
Would you still love to linger up against the wall
Everyone whispers when you go
Into the silence of their love
10, 000 voices crying over with the show

Everybody saying shine your light
Everybody knows it's true
Your the queen of the underground
Never leaving a clue

Longer than a memory (How sweet?)
Sweeter than a honey tree

Give me your heart of gold
Your heavenly magic touch
To cherish have and hold
I need your love so much

Say those three words and
I will give my love to you

Brighter than a diamond ring (how great?)
Greater than a mighty king

Softer than a summer breeze

You spend lots of time alone and

No questions asked and
Who cares, the cold wind of it all, everytime

So how can you say well I can't see you
Not now, not tomorrow, not until it's right
Not until

Don't know why I have to work
Don't know why I can't play
Turn me off turn me out
But don't turn me away
Save me a place
I'll come running if you love me today

Don't know why I have to go
Don't know why I can't stay
Guess I want to be alone
And I guess I need to be amazed
Save me a place
I'll come running if you love me today
I'll come running if you love me today."
Fleetwood Mac,Say Goodbye,/f/fleetwood+mac/say+goodbye_20054372.html,"Music and lyrics by Lindsey Buckingham

So you face yesterday
Thinking on the days of old
And the price that we paid
For a love we couldn't hold
I let you slip away
There was nothing I could do
That was so long ago, yeah
Still I often think of you

I fall down, I get up
And I've always had to fight
Everything that was wrong
For the things that were right
And now I've finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you

It's so hard to find your way
When the lies come around
Still it happens every day
So don't let it get you down

Just a time within a time
Just a scheme within a scheme
A little world within a world
Is a dream just a dream?
And now I've finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you
Now I'd best be on my way
Before the night turns blue
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
And now I say goodbye to you
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you"

Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet,
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes,
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Have pity baby,
Just when I thought it was over,
Now you got me running, running, running for cover.
I'm begging you for a little sympathy,
'and if you use me again it'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Baby, baby, hope you're gonna stay away,
'cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday,
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.
Say that you love me
Say that you love me.

Fleetwood Mac,Say You Will,/f/fleetwood+mac/say+you+will_20054373.html,"Something in you brought out something in me that I've never been since.
That part of me that was only for you, that kind of romance
Comes Only Once that kind of love, that kind of fever dance
That you love because you become someone else in an instant

Say you will, say you will
Give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance

Something in you put a hold on my heart
Hard to believe now
Here is a place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That kind of touch
Electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else in an instant

Say you will, say you will
Give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance"

I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in tall grass
And let me do my stuff

I know I got nothin' on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad
And you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff
Do it(the words they say here are missing)
One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long
I've been tossed around enough
Aw Couldn't you just
Let me go down and do my stuff

I know you're hopin' to find
Someone who's gonna give you peace of mind
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in tall grass
And let me do my stuff

You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've travelled far
Cause I come so together where you are

And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one

Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
Cause we live in a time
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've travelled far

And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you

Now the wind
That's blowing out of the southwest
Is telling me, boy you better beware
Here she comes, and they call her the sweet Omega
And you'll come to know the meaning of her stare

Cause the only road that you'll ever need to ride
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes
And although she'll bring you joy
Don't you know she can destroy
Oh lord she's changing me

When you're down
And you're headed for a bad night
And you're seeing shapes of trouble in the stars
She'll take your hand, cause they call her the sweet Omega

Tell me anybody
Now do you really give a damn for me
I said tell me anybody
Do you really give a damn for me

Oh 'cause I just got to tell you
About a thing that's bothering me
I was a rambling pony
I would roll, I would roll
I would roll from town to town
I was a rambling pony
I would roll from town to town

Yes just looking for a sweet woman
And making my love come on down

If I need anybody
Baby I would take you home with me
If I need anybody
Baby I would take you, Baby I would take you
Baby I would take you home with me
Whoa but I don't need nobody
I don't anybody but him and me

And you're sitting there so green
Believe me man I'm just the same as you
I said you're sitting there so green
Believe me man I'm just the same as you
You want me to make a last cry I'll be satisfied

Fleetwood Mac,Silver Girl,/f/fleetwood+mac/silver+girl_20054374.html,"(Stevie Nicks)

She was a silver girl
Lost in a high tech world
She was a golden girl
Immersed in a hard core world
She would have preferred
The last generation
But that's all right
She is on her way

She had the Midas touch
She was Lady Luck
She's got a million bucks
And she looks like it
She's had a few hard times
Sometimes it blows her mind
Those papers she never signed
Sometimes she remembers

Sometimes she was just an actress
But you'll never really know
A shadow moves across her face
You cannot see her soul
Unless she lets you
See her soul

She was a girlie girl
Caught in a man's world
And as her world turns
She feels old so alone

Still she's a danger girl
Insane far beyond her years
On some things she's very clear
She's a wild adventurer

Sometimes she was just an actress.."

She came in like a hurricane
Wearing boots and diamond rings
With a fox fur on her shoulder
She set wondering
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned
Because she flashed a look across my way
She said hop for a ride
You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway

She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul Mccartney, or get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change, I'd never change silver heeled ways

She came in and her flags were flying
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
And I could see that her eyes were smiling
From across the room
Well I couldn't think of conversation
I was busy looking at her furs
She said Hey, you'll never ask me
So I guess I'll say the word

She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul Mccartney, and funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change, No I'd never change silver heeled ways

Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
The people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel

She asked me
Be my sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
Wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ah, know her name

So we make our choices
When there is no choice
And we listen to their voices
Ignoring our own voice"

Na para bang ako'y naakit nang ika'y lumapit
Tinanong ko ang yong pangalan at ang yong telepono
Pero sabi mo di mo kinakausap

Di naman ako manyakis at walang labis
Walang kulang ang sinukli ko sayo

Kahit na wala akong kitain walang makain
Basta't alam mo lang kung gaano kahalaga sa akin ang ikaw
Ay mapaglingkuran at mapagsilbihan
Ipagpatawd mo sana ako man ay naguguluhan

Sa loob ng aking kwarto't sa loob ng banyo
Kung alam mo lamang ang dami ng mga litratong
Kinunan ko sa may kanto at ipinakwadro ko pa
Nang sa ganoon ay lagi tayong magkasama
Araw man o gabi kahit sandali sa hirap o ginhawa

Ikaw at ako magpakailanman na para bang
Mga palabas sa sine, alam ko na para bang imposible
Pero pwede ka bang mailibre sa kanto ng lugaw
Palamig, siomai o siopao?
Baka pwedeng huwag kang masyadong matakw
Sige na nga pero pwede bang dumalaw?
Pagmamahal ko sana ay tanggapin mo
Pero kung itataboy mo ay ikamamatay
Ikamamatay ko

Siguro naman ngayon nadama mo na
Kung gaano kawagas ang aking pag-ibig
Simula sa laman hanggang sa litid
Kailaliman ay sinisisid
Pero bakit ginamit puro luha at pasakit
Makalipas ang mahabang panahon
Ang aking pagmamahal ay napalitan ng galit
Nang makita kita na may kasamang iba
May dala-dala pa naman akong regalong
Matagal kong pinag-ipunan, kinuha sa alkansya
Naglalakad habang lumuluha
Tinititigan ang lupa
Sinungaling ang mga baraha na tinanong
Hindi naman natupad ang kanilang mga hula
Wala nang dahilan para mabuhay
Naging abo, wala nang kulay
Akala ko noong una tayo nang dalawa
Ilang taon din naman akong naghintay
Paalam na aking mahal
Ako ay di na magtatagal
At tanging ang iyong pagbabalik
Ang siyang aking ipagdarasal

Siguro naman ngayon nadama mo na

It's so lonely here without you baby
Come back home

'Cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love

Know life hasn't been much fun at all
Since you've been gone
And my eyes begin to fill
Each time I hear our song
I spent every minute asking myself
What went wrong
Can't we try to talk it over baby
Come back home

'Cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love
But baby there is no-one else
Half crazy
For everything you saying
Half crazy
No one else could love you like I do

(Break)

'Cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love
But baby there is no-one else
Half crazy
For everything you saying
Half crazy
No one else could ever love you
No one else could ever be

Half crazy
Feeling sorry for myself
And I'm worried you'll find someone else
Feeling sorry for myself
Half Crazy (faded)"

she'll say you're fine
whisper words I wish were mine

could have been

Baby aren't you hurtin' too
Now that I've lost the power to pretend no no no
I guess you could see right through me

Feeling I just cannot contain
I know someday I'll get over you
It just takes time and some getting used to
Each day I'm feeling blue
Every road leads me back to you"

He always seeks to find it
The choice between coin and candy for the soul
He needs nobody to remind him
Iv he always packs his bag with honesty
Specially to show to himself
A tank-Full of courage and humility
So he won'T get lost, tryin' to be somebody else

Your tomorrow with me

Force you to stay
You won't be mine
You made up your mind
So just keep on going

I'll always hold dear
The times you 
We're here with me
And I won't forget  
All the dreams that we shared
And how much you cared for me
I've no regrets.. 

Though now all I have
Are long lonely nights
Cause you've already said goodbye

I love you 
With all my heart and soul
And I never thought 
We'd ever fall
I know...you know
You know just where you belong...
Here with me, here with  me

Down on my  knees
I'll be kissing my dreams away
Now all I can do

And pray that you'll

What I must do to make you realize
That to love me
You gotta be true you'Ve gotta be true
Got to know just what to say (can'T tell you what to do)
You wouldn'T make me cry
Wouldn'T hurt me this way
It really is easy to love me
Ooh... I wanna feel that way again
Tryin' hard to fight the pain from deep within
I don'T wanna let go after all that we'Ve been through
But if you don'T feel the same anymore
If you no longer love me like you did before
Just tell me so I'Ll know what I'M supposed to do
Save my heart for someone who...
Someone who will love me
Who'Ll always be true, who'Ll always be true
Who'S gonna know just what to say
Who'Ll always know what to do
Who'Ll never make me cry
Never hurt me this way
It really is easy to love me
Ooh I remember when you used to love me
(You used to love me)
Ooh... ooh...
I remember mmmmm."

Somebody looked into my eyes 
And he read my mind 
And its true 
I only need to tell you 
that it's you 
You're every thing 
I ever dreamed would come to me 

Somebody walked into my heart 
And to my surprise 
Somebody tearing me apart 
And it feels just fine 
And it's you 
I've waited oh so long to say 
it's you 
You're every thing 
I ever dreamed 

And tonight I give in to the feelings 
Tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you 
And tonight I give in to believing 
I'd hear you say 
You'd always stay 

Somebody turned my life around 
And I'm not the same 
Suddenly I don't hear a sound 
Only your name 
And I really need you 

And tonight I give in to the feelings 
Yes tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you 
And tonight I give in to believing 
You'll always stay in love this way 

Oh, tonight I give in to the feelings 
Yes tonight I give in to them all so hold me

And something takes over me
In a day you look so amazing
It's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off from my feet
I can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

Time after time after time I tried to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around me baby
In my condition I don't want to be alone

John: Yeah
Monica: O.K.
Spider: And remember about the smoke standing still and how they they really get uptight when you try to move the smoke, right?
Monica: Right
John: Yeah?
Spider: I think the music in that dense light is probably what makes the smoke stand still. As soon as the pony's mane starts to get good in the back any sort of motion, especially of smoke or gas, begins to make the ends split
Monica: Well don't the splitting ends change the density of the ponies' music so it affects the density of the pigs' music, which makes the smoke move which upsets the pigs?
Spider: No, it isn't like that
John: Well, how does it work?
Spider: Well, what it does is when it strikes any sort of energy field or solid object or even something as ephemeral as smoke, the first thing it does is begins to inactivate the molecular motion so that it slows down and finally stops. That's why the smoke stops. And also have you ever noticed how the the smoke clouds shrink up? That's because the molecules come closer together. The cold light makes it get so small, this is really brittle smoke
John: And that's why the pigs don't want you to touch it
Spider: See, when the smoke gets that brittle what happens when you try to move it is it disintegrates
John: And the pigs get uptight 'cause you know they, they worship that smoke. They salute it every day
Monica: You know we've got something here
John: And, and, and, and that's the basis of all their nationalism. Like if they can't salute the smoke every morning when they get up . . .

Howard: Don't even talk about getting reamed. Listen, I've been without female companionship for so long, a career as a Jesuit monk was inviting, Ian is starting to look good to me
George: Must be his green velour socks!

Ian: If we play any rock'n'roll we might make some money. I wouldn't mind playing some rock'n'roll, uh, I like classical music too, but that doesn't mean I wouln't enjoy playing rock'n'roll. I mean, it's not very challenging, intelectually, but I wouldn't mind if we did some rock'n'roll. We could vote on it
Jeff: Vote on it, for what? To tell Zappa we wanna play some good music instead of this comedy shit . . . ?
Aynsley: I wouldn't mind playing some more rock'n'roll, it'd be more commercial, sort of heavy, four parts harmony, group vocals and a very heavy beat, that the kids could enjoy it. I think we'd definitely make more money that way
Ian: Maybe after we finish the movie we could play more rock'n'roll
Mark: Yeah! We all quit and form other groups and play more rock'n'roll
Jeff: And more blues, extended blues, blues that's still down and funky, even though you extended it. George knows what I'm talking about, don't you, George?
George: Leave me out of it, I come from the jazz world. I know all about these groups that get formed and disappear, with their extensions waving in the moonlight
Mark: You just calm down there, Duke
Jeff: Maybe we could all form a group, we can elect a leader . . . Howard . . . we can call it Howard Kaylan World.
Ian: We wouldn't have to have any leader
Jeff: We could just jam a lot

Howard: I want to get laid! I'm so horny I can't stand it!
Jeff: Listen, if you think for a minute that anybody likes this comedy music we've been playing you're crazy. That's why you don't get laid, who wants to fuck a comedian! None of these girls can take you seriously
Mark: Hey, man, you should be careful talking about that kind of stuff
Jeff: Why, does he listen?
Ian: He always listens, he's always watching and listening to all the guys in the band. I've been in the band for years and I know, he always listens, believe me
Jeff: That's how he gets his material. He listens to us being natural, friendly, humorous and good-natured, then he rips us off, sneaks off in the secret room someplace and boils it in ammonia, and gets it perverted. Then he brings it back to us in rehearsal and makes us play it

The story of the. .. The music of the Mothers is the story of, uh. .. A combination of what I knew about music from. .. From my studies plus the musical capabilites of the players in the group as I found them, you know, which had. .. . Somewhere along the line, I had to teach them a lot of what they didn't know about music.

I started out playing rhythm & blues when I was about 14 or 15 years old in San Diego. And, uh. .. I was playing nothing but blues 'til I was 18 and, you know, I was really honking and I started out playing drums with a band and got tired of listening to other people's guitar solos. Took up a guitar and started playing lead right away. Then I spent, uh. .. The early part of my musical teen childhood doing the same thing that most of the, uh. .. Uh, white blues bands are, uh, pulling down heavy bread for. But in those days it was, you know. .. It was the underground music, uh. .. The unpopular underground music because the kids, uh, then wanted to hear, uh. .. You know, sweeter, easier stuff. They didn't go for hard, screaming blues or Chicago, uh, you know, weirdness. Nobody knew who the Howlin' Wolf was, nobody. .. You know, Muddy Waters, what the fuck is that? And, uh, so I grew up on that stuff but simultaneously buying, uh, classical albums and, uh, going to the library to study music. I had albums of Stravinsky and Var? Se and Webern and Bart? K. And I never bought anything el. .. I never bought any Beethoven or, uh, Mozart or anything like that because I didn't like the way it sounded, it was too weak.

So. .. Eventually I started hearing a little folk music. I didn't like most of the commercial folk music that was around. My taste in folk music was, uh, sea shanties and, uh. .. Uh, Middle Eastern stuff. I like Indian music, I like, uh. .. Arab music. So, that. .. That was all my own personal taste-making, uh, influences.

The original guys in the band had been brought up on nothing but rhythm & blues. Now, rhythm & blues branches out into about four different categories the way we grew up with it. There was the ooh-wah ballad, you know, with the high falsetto and the grunting bass and all that stuff. That type. There's a Chicago blues type with the harmonica and, you know, and the funky-ness. There was a Texas type with a, you know. .. Rock, uh, Bobby, uh, ""Blue"" Bland type thing. And then there was the hard drive type James Brown shit. And offshoots of the, uh. .. Of each one of those, like in the ooh-wah classification you've got the uptempo singers where the. .. Like Hank Ballard and the Midnighters and the Royales. They had a different type of a thing.

Uh. .. All the other guys in the group grew up with just that and had no knowledge whatsoever of any kind of classical music, uh, or serious music, the. .. Uh, above and beyond Mozart or, uh, Beethoven or, you know, standard concert hall, uh. .. Warhorses. And even that, they didn't give a shit about and they weren't interested at all in folk music. And, uh. .. So I had quite a bit of trouble in the beginning, eh. .. Just making them aware that there were other kinds of music that we could be playing. To top it off, we were in a, uh. .. Very sterile area. We. .. We kept getting fired because we'd playing anything other than ""Wooly Bully"" or, uh. .. You know. .. Uh, ""Twist and Shout"" or the rest of that stuff. We'd lost job after job.

When. .. When is this that you're talking about exactly?

Two years ago.

We finally got a chance to come into L. A. And the reason we stood out from the bands in Los Angeles, you know, why we would attract any attention at all at that point. .. 'cuz, uh, we were working out in the sticks, this whole thing was developing out, uh, away from any, uh. .. You know, any urban civilization. We were really, you know, just out there with the Okies.

And we got to town, we expected to find all kinds of, you know. .. Uh, all the bands gotta be really far-out. Well, they weren't, they were bullshit and they had no balls, you know, they weren't funky, they weren't, uh, tasteful, they weren't nothin'. They were just, you know, plastic, folk-rock, teenage puker bands. And they were making a lot of bread. And we came on the scene. ..

Thank you very much, mr. Zappa.

Ah, I'm very pleased to be here on behalf of the administration-- the most powerful government in the world. And, uh, mr. Fitzwater invited me to come here tonight to create some balance, because there has been some things done by mr. Zappa that I think are unfair to our country.

I think, from the beginning, to say that this is going to be balanced, when he has this *lingerie* up here, and makin' fun of *children's toys*, as a beginning, if this is what he has in mind, I think he's wrong.

It's people like mr. Frank zappa that kept the senate from being able to send arms to the democratic freedom fighters in nicaragua! And I, for one, am headin' down there myself, as soon as I finish up here tonight.

And I want the elected official, mr. Charlie sanders the democrat, to remember that "" democrat"" begins with a "" d"", just like demon! And we'll remember you, friend, when it comes votin' time. And margaret boyd[?] and carmen belacord[?], despite...[?] habit, did some help to back things up.

Friends, these forms cost money. And this money could be going towards a more powerful military; this money could be going towards driving out the illegal aliens. Instead, mr. Zappa wants to have a bunch of young, uninformed 18 to 21-year-olds votin' here, and spendin' your money.

And I just want you to know that tonight, I *love* him anyway. Because I've got love in my heart, and I'm not afraid of the fact that he turned this into some kind of zoo up here.

Sunday--that's not fair, mr. Zappa--sunday night used to be a night in which americans would get together. They'd go to their place of worship, and they would share. And I don't know why, on this night which is supposed to be valentine's night, there aren't more people that have a heart that have a love affair with america. But instead, they're here on sunday night, worshipping this man who's demon-possessed!

I ask you, mr. Frank zappa, what kind of man can name a child moon unit? What kind of man can name a child weasel? What kind of man can name a child ohman? To me, it defies the logic.

And I'm comin' here tonight because I want to share with him, just the same way we're going to give spirit power to the democratic freedom fighters down there, our brothers that wanna have the freedom to be able to have a man like pat robertson. To have a man like mr. Dole. Restore, america!

And I'm gonna ask the power and the joy and the power of the living king of kings, and a lot of you here, you smut-minded, musical people say, "" king of kings, that must be elvis"". No, I'm gonna ask for the power and ask for the glory. I'm gonna now, I'm gonna tell you a story. I'm gonna drive out the demons, friends. I'm gonna ask you to help this badness end. Come on frank, let's have a story. Come on now share the glory. Do you feel the power? Come on, put out the negativity..."

(after the song ends)
This is the central scrutinizer... As you can see, music can get you
Pretty fucked up... Take a tip from Joe, do like he did, hock your imaginary guitar
And get a good job... Joe did, and he's a happy guy now, on the day shift at
The Utility Muffin Research Kitchen, arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot of
A fully-charged icing anointment utensil. And every time a nice little muffin comes
By on the belt, he poots forth... And if this doesn't convince you that music
Causes big trouble... Then maybe I should turn off my plastic' megaphone and
Sing the last song on the album in my regular voice...

Scene eighteen
A little green rosetta

Central scrutinizer:
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
You'll make a muffin betta
With a green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A tiny green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
You'll make a muffin betta
Betta
It's really getting betta
It's betta, it's betta
With a green rosetta

Green rositti
A little green rositti
It's really, really meaty
A little green rositti
Betta, betta,
(Hey, really out there... Really good)
It's really getting betta
It's betta, it's betta
With a green rosetta
Setta, setta
(Good God, give the drummer some)
Green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
(Setta, setta, setta, etc....)
(Make a muffin, make a muffin, make a muffin,
Make a muffin betta, make a muffin betta, etc....)
With a green rosetta
A little green rosetta
(Etc....)

Good God! You're really jammin! Now the Reggae version, hey, for the People in
The Third World... We haven't forgotten anybody on this song... For all of you French
People... Who think that you re outta sight... And for the people in Spain... Who think
The French people are where its at... And for the people in Mongolia who always
Wanted to go to Spain for a vacation... And for those of you in Taiwan who got chumped,
This chorus is for you: (Rang Tang Ding Dong, I am the Japanese Sandman...
Take eight...)

Green rosetta
Green rosetta
A little green rosetta
(Against the Reggae beat, though... No, it's still Reggae, but it s all backwards)

A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
You'll make a muffin betta (Etc., etc., etc...)

Now you see, some places in the Third World it might be difficult to dance to this because
The kerosene record player is not a very efficient device... And a lot of times they run out of,
They run out of spunk right in the middle of the chorus... Causing the song to sound like this...

A little green rosetta

However we continue in spite of the fact that the fuel may be low on your record player.
We suggest that in places like the Fourth World where things are really tough that you
Keep the record player going by rubbing two sticks together. And if all else fails, throw
The record away... Build your own green rosetta... Try this recipe: Well start with a lump of
Grass... The grass bone connected to the ankle bone... The knee bone connected to the
Wishbone... And then everybody moves to New York and goes to a party with Warren.
Hey! And we've flown in, at great expense, (triple scale, no less, ladies and gentlemen),
Steve Gad's clone to play the out-chorus on this song... Lies really outa-site, in spite of
Thefact that the click track is totally irrelevant to what he's doing now. I in listening to
The click, yes I'm suffering with the click track right now... This guy is totally out of sync with it,
But what the fuck. Ed Mann will call him up later, show him the sign. Okay Vinnie, where
Is five?

They're pretty good musicians
They re pretty good musicians
They're pretty good musicians
They're pretty good musicians
But it don't make no difference
If they're good musicians
Because anybody who would buy this record
Doesn't give a fuck if there's good musicians
On it
Because this is a stupid song
And that's the way I like it
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
You make a muffin betta
With a little green rosetta
A little green rosetta
Rosetta, rosetta, rosetta

Arriving at l. ron hoovers modernistic office / cathedral / warehouse / condominium complex, joe is greeted by a pre-recorded message and a dramatically illuminated image on a wall-sized tv scr

L. ron hoover:
Welcome to the first church of appliantology! the white zone is for loading and unloading only!

Don't you be tarot-fied
Its just a token
Of my extreme
Don't you be tarot-fied
Its just a token
Of my extreme

Don't you never try to
Look behind my eyes
You don't wanna know
What they have seen
Don't you never try to
Look behind my eyes
You don't wanna know
What they have seen

Joe: (thinking to himself)
Some people think
That if they go too far
They'll never get back
To where the rest of
Them are
I might be crazy
But there's one thing
I know
You might be surprised
At what you find
When ya go!

And thus, having ration- alized his expedition to l. rons modernistic office / cathedral / warehouse / condominium complex, joe seeks the answer to his problem...

Joe:
Oh oh oh
Mystical advisor
What is my problem,
Tell me
Can you see?

L. ron hoover:
Well, you have nothing
To fear, my son!
You are a latent
Appliance fetishist,
It appears to me!

Joe:
That all seems very,
Very strange
I never craved
A toaster
Or a color t.v.

L. ron hoover:
A latent appliance
Fetishist
Is a person who
Refuses to admit
To his or herself
That sexual
Gratification can
Only be achieved
Through the use of
Machines...
Get the picture?

Joe:
Are you telling me
I should come out
Of the closet now
Mr. ron?

L. ron hoover:
No, my son!
You must go into
The closet

Joe:
What?

L. ron hoover:
And you will have

Joe:
Heh?

L. ron hoover:
Hey!
A lot of fun!
That's where
They all live
So if you want an
Appliance to love you
Youll have to
Go in there
N get you one

Joe:
Well...that seems
Simple enough...

L. ron hoover:
Yes, but if you want a
Really good one,
Youll have to learn a
Foreign language...

Joe:
German, for instance?

L. ron hoover:
That's right...
A lot of really cute
Ones come from
Over there!
(fifty bucks, please)
And a cheerful group of
Appliantologists dance
Into the room wearing
Aluminum foil lab smocks,
Lock arms in a circle
Around joe, making sure
He pays in full, all the
While singing with l. ron
As he delivers his final
Instructions...

She makes me oh so happy now
I'm never ever blue
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows

She is my heart and soul
And she loves me tenderly
Now my story can be told
Just how good she is to me
Yes, she treats me like she loves me
And she never makes me cry
I'm gonna stick with her
Till the day I die
She's not like you, baby
She would never ever lie
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows

Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows

Now that I am free
From the troubles of the past
Took me much too long to see
That our romance couldn't last
I'm gonna go away
And leave you standing at the door
I'll tell you, pretty baby,
I won't be back no more
'Cause you don't even know
What love is for
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows
Anyway the wind blows"

(LOUIE LOUIE)
Motorhead: And then I worked in a printing company and a coupla gas stations. Oh, at the gas station where I was working my brother just got married, and uh . . . he bought a new car and his wife was having a kid and all this miserable stuff, and he needed a job so I gave him a job at the gas station of which I was fired because, you know, he was gonna work there. And he had his car on the rack and he was lubing and changing tires and everything all the time. And so they got fired because he was goofing off, man, and he just kept taking parts and working on his car day and night. And so he lost that job and he went to work in another gas station. He took that one, you know, so he could feed the kids and that. And I went to work in an aircraft company, and uh . . . I was building these planes. I worked on the XB-70, I was the last welder on there. Yeah but, it was pretty good bread because I was making, uh . . . $2.71 an hour. I was making a hundred and a quarter a week, and uh . . . yeah, it was good enough money to be working on, so I got an Oldsmobile, a groovy Olds. But I was going with this chick at that time. By the time I got the Olds running decently, she went out and tore up the engine, and the trans, and a-her and a girlfriend they get in there and booze it up and tear up the seats. Just ripped the seats completely out. So uh . . . when, I got a '56 Olds, which was this one chick's I was going with, and uh . . . we used to drive out all over the place and finally she got rid of that, and uh . . .

One, two, three. ..

Billy the Mountain
Billy the Mountain
A regular picturesque
Postcardy mountain
Residing between lovely
Rosamond and Gorman
With his stunning wife ethell,
A tree!
A tree!

Billy was a mountain
Ethell was a tree
Growing off of his shoulder

Billy was a mountain
(Billy was a mountain!)
Ethell was a tree
Growing off of his shoulder
(Ethell was a tree growing off of his shoulder)
(hey, hey hey!)

Billy had two big
Caves for eyes,
With a cliff for a jaw
That would go up 'n down,
And whenever it did,
He'd puff out some dust,
And hack up a boulder
(Hack!)
Hack up a boulder
(Hack! Hack!)
Hack up a boulder
(Hack! Hack! Hack!)
Up a boulder

Now, one day, now I believe it was on a Tuesday, a man in a checkered double-knit suit drove up in a large El Dorado Cadillac, leased from bob spreen. ..

(""Where the freeways meet in Downey!"")

.. . And he laid a huge, bulging envelope right at the corner of billy the mountain, that was right where his 'foot' was supposed to be.

Now, billy the mountain, he couldn't believe it! All those postcards he'd posed for, for all of those years, and finally, now, at last, his Royalties!

Royalties!
Royalties. ..
Royalties!
Royalty check is in, honey!

Yes, billy the mountain was rich! Yes, and his eyeball-caves, they widened in amazement, and his jaw (which was a cliff), well it dropped thirty feet!

A bunch of dust puffed out! Rocks and boulders hacked up, (hack! Hack!) crushing 'The lincoln'!

I gave him the money
He acted real funny
He hocked up a rock and
It totalled my car!

Oh, do you
Know any trucks
Might be bound for the valley?
I don't wanna stand here
All night in this bar
(Dear Lord)

I don't wanna stand here
All night in this bar
(No shit!)

I don't wanna stand here
All night in this bar!

By two o'clock, when the bars are already closed down, billy had broken 'the big news' to ethell. And with dust and boulders everywhere, billy, choked with excitement, announced. ..

""ETHELL, we're going on a VACATION!""

Yes, and they were going on a vacation! (Oh, and ethell, ethell, ethell, like every little woman, she of course was very excited! She creaked a little bit, and some old birds flew off of her.) billy told ethell they were going to. .. Yes! They were going to new york!

""ETHELL, we're going to . . . New York!""

But first they were gonna stop in las vegas. ..

It's off to las vegas
To check out the lounges
Pull a few handles,
And drink a few beers,
(Oh, ethell!)

Ethell, my darling,
You know that I love you!
I'm glad we could have a
Vacation this year!
(Oh, neet-O!)

Glad we could have a
Vacation this year!

They left that night, crunchin' across the Mojave Desert. .. Their voices echoing through the canyons of your minds (Poo-Aah!)

""ETHELL, wanna get a cuppa cawfee?""

(Howard Johnson's! Howard Johnson's!
Howard Johnson's! Howard Johnson's!)

""Ahhh! there's a HOWARD JOHNSONS! Wanna eat some CLAMS?""

The first noteworhty piece of real estate they destroyed was edwards air force base. ..

And to this very day, 'Wing Nuts' and Data Reduction Clerks alike, speak in reverent whispers about that fateful night when test stand #1 and the rocket sled itself. .. (We have ignition!) .. . Got lunched! I said lunched! (Lunched!) By a famous mountain-In and his small, wooden wife.

""Word just in to the KTTV News Service undeniably links THIS MOUNTAIN and HIS WIFE to drug abuse and pay-offs as part of a San Joaquin Valley SMUT RING! However, we can assure parents in the Southern California area that a recent NARCOTICS CRACK-DOWN, in Torrance, Hawthorne, Lomita, Westchester, Playa Del Rey, Santa Monica, Tujunga, Sunland, San Fernando, Pacoima, Sylmar, Newhall, Canoga Park, Palmdale, Glendale, Irwindale, Rolling Hills, Granada Hills, Shadow Hills,Cheviot Hills, will provide the SECRET EVIDENCE the Palmdale Grand Jury has needed to seek a CRIMINAL INDICTMENT, and pave the way for STIFFER LEGISLATION, increased FEDERAL AID, and AVERT A CRIPPLING STRIKE of Bartenders and Veterinarians throughout the INLAND EMPIRE . . . ""

Within the week, Jerry Lewis had hosted a Telethon (""Wah wah wah, nice lady!"") to raise funds for the injured (injured. ..) and homeless (homeless. ..) in Glendale, as billy had just levelled it, and, a few miles right outside of town, billy caused a 'Oh Mein Papa' in the Earth's crust, right over the secret underground dumps (right near the 'Jack-In-The-Box' on Glenoaks) where they keep the pools of old poison gas, and obsolete germ bombs, just as a freak tornado cruised through. ..

Yes, it was about three o'clock in the afternoon when little Howard Kaplan was sitting on his porch (""Toto . . . !"") just playing (""Come on, Toto . . . !"") and having a nice time with his little accordion (""Toto . . . !""), and this weird wind came up (""Toto . . . !""), direct from Glendale (""Toto . . . ! Toto . . . !""), blowing these terrible germs in his direction (""Come here, Toto . . . !""), and all of this caused (""Toto . . . !"") by a huge mountain (""Aunty Em!"")!

""Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly . . . ""

.. . Sucking up two thirds of it (Suck! Suck! Suck!) for untimely dispersal over vast stretches of watts!!!

Now, unless I misunderstood, it was right outside of Columbus, Ohio when billy received his notice to report for his induction physical. Now, lemme tell ya, ethell said, now ethell, ethell said she wasn't gonna let him go!

""I'm not gonna let you go, BILLY!""

""THAT'S RIGHT! We now have CONFIRMED REPORTS from an INFORMED ORANGE COUNTY MINISTER, that ETHELL is still an ACTIVE COMMUNIST, and it is This Reporter's Opinion that she also practices (COVEN!) WITCH-CRAFT!""

It was about this time that the telephone rang inside of the secret briefcase belonging to the one mortal man who might be able to stop all of this senseless destruction and save 'america herself'! (And I'm sorry to disappoint some of you, it was not Chief Reddin) This one man was studebaker hoch, fantastic new super hero of the current economic slump.

(Oh) Now, some folks say he looked like (he was like, he was like) zubin mehta (Zubin Mehta)"

Let her do all the work n maybe later I'll rape her

Aw, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick

So I went out n bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doin radio promo
An none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me n a friend
Sorta drifted along into s&m
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
Long as I gets a little golden shower

With a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
An I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin, thank you, fred!

Rhonda un-zips the Santa Claus costume, revealing the rubber body suit, hoping for some sign of interest from her deranged husband. There isn't any... He's beating the fuck out of himself and loving every minute of it

She squeezes her rubber tits, as if to squirt them at him. Still no interest

A tan and brown briefcase, seven feet tall, is lowered in. Francesco watches it land near his window. He exits the bungalow with a can of Crisco and a violin case. N pantomime, he cautiously interrupts rhonda's monologue, suggesting that she examine the contents of the case. It contains a strap-on dildo of such ridiculous proportions that a chain leading from just behind the head of it must be hooked to a leather dog collar around rhonda's neck, in order to hold it up. Francesco recommends the Crisco as a lubricant, daubs on a bit with a miniature doll's foot, finally indicating that she conceal her pubic hair with a cardboard box, in the manner preferred by famous singing Christians

Rhonda reaches inside the briefcase and locates her 'special atomic glasses' (with tiny doll arms reaching out through tiny cardboard boxes), and puts them on

She reaches in again and finds an artificial hamburger with a red ribbon on it. She mounts it on top of her head, tying the ribbon in a neat bow below her chin. Ready at last, she humps the briefcase vigorously

Rhonda: (contd.)
I'm gonna put my glasses on, harry! I'm gonna put my hair up in a bun! Then, I'm going fuck fuck fuck! Ha-ha-ha-hahhhhh! Look! See me? See how I got my hair up? Whooo! I'm really doing it! Unngh! Unngh!

Maybe you think you're a lonely guy
And maybe you think you're too tough to cry
So you went to the grape, just to give it a try
And Dagmar (Without a doubt, the ugliest sonofabitch I ever saw in my life) was his name
(One two three four)
The whiskers sticking out from underneath of his pancake make-up (And yet, he was a beautiful lady) nearly drove you insane
(Lets talk about leather)
And so you kissed a little sailor (Tex Abel, starring in the latest Shepperton production) who had just blew in from Spain
(Sir Richard Pump-a-loaf)
You sniffed the reeking buns of angel (The story of a demented bread-boffer) and acted like it was cocaine
(Cucumber pud annexed to a fine whole-wheat loaf)
You were dazzled by the exciting new costume of ko-ko (Then on Tuesday night, Ceasar's back in town) in a way you can't explain
(Facing off in a no-holds-barred tag team grudge match with Kona)
And so you worked the wall with Michael (Three-hundred-seventy-nine pounds of Samoan dynamite)
Which gave your back an awful strain (Volcanic hell)
But you came back on sunday for the gong shows (Next Thursday, Teen Towns finest??????????) but you forgot what I was sayin'
'Cause you're an asshole, you're an asshole
That's right
Youre an asshole, you're an asshole
Yes, yes
Youre an asshole, you're an asshole
That's right
Youre an asshole, you're an asshole

Well, now you been to the grape, you been to the chest
Now I think you know what you are
You're an asshole

You say you can't live with what you been through
Well, ladies you can be an asshole too
You might pretend you aint got one on the bottom of you
But don't fool yourself girl, it's lookin' at you
Don't fool yourself girl, it's winkin' at you
Don't fool yourself girl, it's blinkin' at you
That's why I say, ""I'm gonna ram it, ram it, ram it ram it up your poop chute"" (Corn hole)
Ram it, ram it, ram it, ram it up your poop chute (Fist fuck)
Ram it, ram it, ram it, ram it up your poop chute (Wrist-watch; Crisco)
Ram it, ram it, ram it, ram it up your poop chute (Pud)
Don't fool yourself girl, it's goin' right up your poop chute
Don't fool yourself girl, it's goin' right up your poop chute
Don't fool yourself girl, it's goin' right up your poop chute
Don't pull yourself girl, it's goin' right up your poop chute

On a rug where they walk and drool
Past the girls in the office

We see in the back
Of the City Hall mind
The dream of a girl about thirteen
Off with her clothes and into a bed
Where she tickles his fancy
All night long

His wile's attending an orchid show
She squealed for a week to get him to go
But back in the bed his teen-age queen
Is rocking and rolling and acting obscene
Baby, baby. ..
Baby, baby. ..
Cimmie then cakes, uh!
If I do I'm gonna lose my...

And he loves it, he loves it
It curls up his toes
She wipes his fat neck
And it lights up his nose
But he cannot be fooled

She digs it in bed

Do it again, ha
And do it some more
Hey, that does it, by golly
And she's nasty for sure
Nasty nasty nasty
Nasty nasty nasty
Only thirteen, and she knows how to nasty

She's a dirty young mind, corrupted
Corroded
Well she's thirteen today
And I hear she gets loaded

If she were my daughter, I'd...
What would you do, Frankie?
If she were my daughter, I'd...
What would you do, Frankie?
Check this out
Smother my daughter in chocolate syrup
And strap her on again, oh baby
Smother that girl in chocolate syrup
And strap her on again, oh baby
She's my teen-age baby
She turns me on
I'd like to make her do a nasty
On the White House lawn
Smother my daughter in chocolate syrup
And boogie 'till the cows come home

There was a bed I dumped her shape on

Somewhat later on
I woke up and she was gone
There was dew out on the lawn
In the sunrise
Later she came back
With a rumpled paper sack
Which she told me would contain
A surprise

She stuck her hand right in it to the bottom
Said she knew I'd be surprised she got'em
Take a Charleston pimp to spot 'em
Then she gave a pair of shoes to me ...
Plastic leather, 14 Triple D

I said: I wonder what's the shoes for
She told me: Don't you worry no more
And got right down there on the tile floor:
Now Darling STOMP ALL OVER ME! ...

Is this something new
Having people stomp on you?
Is it what I need to do
For your pleasure?
What is this, a quiz?
Don't you worry what it is
It is merely just a moment

By ten o'clock her arms and legs were rendered
She couldn't talk 'cause her mouth had been extendered
Looked to me as though she had been blendered
But was this abject misery?

Jeff: Hey, I want some baby to hold my tool and squeeze it

Howard: They're a hip audience, Frank, they know what's gonna happen next!
Fz: After the band has given you their complete attention, and is watching closely for the precise moment of the detonation of the alcoholic beverage into the vital organ, you give a sort of casual glance around the bedroom of the Sheraton, a suave little smile and wink one eye, adjust your bow tie, and just stuff it right in there!

I love monster movies, I simply adore monster movies, and the cheaper they are, the better they are. And cheepnis in the case of a monster movie has nothing to do with the budget of the film, although it helps, but true cheepnis is exemplified by visible nylon strings attached to the jaw of a giant spider. .. I'll tell you, a good one that I saw one time, I think the name of the film was ""IT CONQUERED THE WORLD,"" and the. .. Did you ever see that one? The monster looks sort of like an inverted ice-cream cone with teeth around the bottom. It looks like a (phew!), like a teepee or. .. Sort of a rounded off pup-tent affair, and, uh, it's got fangs on the base of it, I don't know why but it's a very threatening sight, and then he's got a frown and, you know, ugly mouth and everything, and there's this one scene where the, uh, monster is coming out of a cave, see? There's always a scene where they come out of a cave, at least once, and the rest of the cast. .. It musta been made around the 1950's, the lapels are about like that wide, the ties are about that wide and about this short, and they always have a little revolver that they're gonna shoot the monster with, and there is always a girl who falls down and twists her ankle. .. Heh-hey! Of course there is! You know how they are, the weaker s** and everything, twisting their ankle on behalf of the little ice-cream cone. Well in this particular scene, in this scene, folks, they, uh, they didn't wanna re-take it 'cause it musta been so good they wanted to keep it, but they. .. When the monster came out of the cave, just over on the left hand side of the screen you can see about this much two-by-four attached to the bottom of the Thing as the guy is pushing it out, and then obviously off-camera somebody's goin': ""NO! GET IT BACK!"" And they drag it back just a little bit as the guy is goin': ""KCH! KCH!"" Now that's cheepnis. Awright. And this is ""Cheepnis"" here. One two three four. ..

I've got troubles of my own, I said
An' you can't help me out
So take your meditations an' your preparations
An' ram it up yer snout
""BUT I GOT A CRYSTAL BALL!,"" he said
An' held it to the light
So I snatched it
All away from him
An' I showed him how to do it right
I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I'd look like I was Deep
I said some Mumbo Jumbos then
An' told him he was goin' to sleep
I robbed his rings
An' pocket watch
An' everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future then
As long as he was hanging around,
I said
""The price of meat has just gone up
An' yer ol' lady has just gone down. .. ""
Look here brother,
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
(Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?)
Don't you know,
You could make more money as a butcher,
So don't you waste your time on me
(Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me. ..)

Frank Zappa,Cradle Rock,/f/frank+zappa/cradle+rock_20175249.html,"Performed by: The Heartbreakers

Rock a bye, Baby,
On the tree-top.
When the wind blows,
The cradle will rock.
When the bow breaks,
The cradle will fall.
So down, down, down, down...
Down will come Baby,
Cradle and all.

I gave you my kisses
Right from the start.
I gave you my true love,
For I wasn't smart.
But you took advantage
And broke my heart.
An' down, down, down, down...
Down went my soul
An' you threw away my heart.

Don't make me cry for you.
Don't make me die for you.
I never thought it'd be like this.
But in the end you see,
You took the best of me.
So down with all...
Down came my heart.

You learned to love me
Much too late.
Offered me kisses
I wouldn't take.
When the wind blew,
You saw me fall.
So down, down, down, down
Down will come Baby,
Cradle and all.

I couldn't say where she's coming from,
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe humm

She stroll on over, say look here, bum,
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me c**
(yjes can't do it)

She made a bet with her sister whos a little dumb
She could prove it any time all men was scum

I don't mind that she called me a bum,
But I knew right away she was really gonna c**
(so I got down to it)

I whipped off her bloomersn stiffened my thumb
An applied rotation on her sugar plum

I pokedn stroked till my wrist got numb
But I still didn't hear no dinah-moe humm,
Dinah-moe humm

Dinah-moe humm
Dinah-moe humm
Where this dinah-moe
Comin from
Done spent three hours
An I aint got a crumb
From the dinah-moe, dinah-moe, dinah-moe
From the dinah-moe humm

I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
I got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
Cause I can't get into it
Unless I get out of it
An I gotta get out of it
Before I get into it
Cause I never get into it
Unless I get out of it
An I gotta be out of it
To get myself into it

(she looked over at me with a glazed eye
And some bovine perspiration on her upper lip area
And she said...)

Just get me wasted
An you're half-way there
Cause if my minds tore up
Then my body don't care

I rubbed my chinny-chin-chin
An said my-my-my
What sort of thing
Might this lady get high upon?

I checked out her sister
Who was holdin the bet
An wondered what kind of trip
The young lady was on

The forty dollar bill didn't matter no more
When her sister got nekkid an laid on the floor
She said dinah-moe might win the bet
But she could use a little ------- if I wasn't done yet

I told her...
Just because the sun
Want a place in the sky
No reason to assume
I wouldn't give her a try

So I pulled on her hair
Got her legs in the air
An asked if she had any cooties on there

(whaddya mean cooties! No cooties on me!)

She was buns-up kneelin
Buns up!
I was wheelin an dealin
Wheelin an dealin an ooooh!
She surrended to the feelin
She sweetly surrendered
An she started in to squealin

Dinah-moe watched from the edge of the bed
With her lips just a-twitchin an her face gone red
Some drool rollin down
From the edge of her chin
While she spied the condition
Her sister was in
She quivered n quaked
An clutched at herself
While her sister made a joke
Bout her mental health
Till dinah-moe finally
Did give in
But I told her
All she really needed
Was some discipline...

Kiss my aura... Dora...
M-m-m... Its real angora
Would yall like some more-a?
Right here on the flora?
An how bout you, fauna?
Ywanna?

Mmm... Sound like ymight be chokin on somethin

Did you say you want some more?
Well, heres some more...

Mmm, sure... Listen
Dyou think I could interest you
In a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers?

Mmm... Tweezers!
Here, lemme sterilize em...
Gimme your lighter...

I couldn't say where she's coming from,
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe humm

Do you wanna?
Awright. Now we're going back to the beginning of the song.

Okay? One, two, three, four,
You can dance if you want

In your daddys bottom drawer

An that's your dirty love

Give me

Ill ignore your cheap aroma

Cause some dandruff might be hiding there.

Disco thing made you think someday that you
Just might go somewhere.

Disco girl, you're outa sight, you need a
Disco boy, to treat you right.
Hell do a little dance, take you home tonight.
Leave his hair alone, but you can kiss his comb.

Disco boy! Run to toilet and comb your hair.
Disco boy! Shake it more than three times and youre
Playing with it while you're standing there.

Disco boy, do the bump every night, til the disco girl
Whos really right, gonna fall for your line,
And feed you a box full of chicken delight.

Disco chit-chat so demure,
Pump that booty all across the floor.
A disco drink, a disco wink,
You never go duty that's what you think.
You never go duty that's what you think.
You never go duty that's what you think.

Disco boy! You got one more chance, to comb your hair again.
Disco boy! They're closing the bar, and shes
Leaving with your friend.

Disco boy, that's the way it goes, so wipe your nose, and
Try it again, to get a little lay tomorrow.

Disco boy, no one understands, but thank the lord that you
Still got hands, to help you do that jerkin thatll
Blot out your disco sorrow.

Ta-dan!

Bad Conscience: Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the French Riviera at the midem convention. A big tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and customized by ran toon tan han toon frammet and dee. Followed by twelve potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice with your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner office, Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets on Air Rangoon. Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a big rock and roll guitar player in a comedy group?

Scene twelve
Dong work for yuda

Central scrutinizer:
Hello there... This is the central scrutinizer...
Joe was sent to a special prison where they keep all the
Other criminals from the music business... You know...
The ones who get caught... It's a horrible place, painted
All green on the inside, where musicians and former executives
Take turns snorting detergent and plooking each other...

(As the central scrutinizer chuckles to himself for a moment,
Father riley, who became buddy jones, steps into view in his
New identity: father riley 8. Jones, Prison Chaplain, who, in a rather
Heavy-handed piece of imagery, is now entrusted with the job of singing
This song as he assists the captured executives in their quest for new
Meat to plook, and, once having found these victims for the princes of
The industry, trades them little blobs of sanctified lubricant jelly forcigarettes
And candy bars while he holds them down so the execs won't have to work
Too hard when they stick it in.)
... Anyway, while he's in there he meets this guy who used to be
A promo man for a major record company, Bald-Headed John...
King of the Plookers...

Frank Zappa,Drooling Midrange Accountants On Easter Hay,/f/frank+zappa/drooling+midrange+accountants+on+easter+hay_20702229.html,"Once upon a time, a record company had A&R people in it who would take a chance, make a decision, use their gut reaction, sign a group, and see what they could do with it. Okay? That was, whoa, a long time ago. It's not that way anymore. All decisions about who get signed and what happens to the record are made by these drooling little midrange accountants. And everything is based on the numbers games in there. And the taste of the accountants is what is ruling the mass media. It's all just the dollars and cents of exchange. And if you wanna make music that you believe in, the chances of doing it on a major label basis are nil, because they're all so frightened. Everybody's there trying to protect their job. And it's easy-- it's easier to look like a wise executive by saying no to something if it's just the most minutely fringe-oid in terms of content.

No.

The horrible part of it is the artists who are feeding this ecological chain stop making songs they believe in and start making product that they know will be airable. And they change the style of what they're doing to fit within the narrow framework that is the contemporary accepted norm for suitable, radio-sounding music. And anything that comes outside of that norm doesn't go on the air, you don't hear about it, you don't know about it. Right now there's probably hundreds of artists in the United States making great sounds and great music. You'll never hear it. You'll never find out about it"

But it doesn't matter no more...

'n rusty wrecks
Is all that she can see
As the light goes dim
And she's tryin' to swim
Will she make it?

Not even a witch oughta be caughrt
On the bottom of America's spew-infested
Waterways, hey-hey...
She could get radiation all over her
She could mutate insanely...
She could mutate insanely... (that's right)
She could go on the freeway and grow up to be 15 feet tall
And scary-lookin'
And then...
Cars could crash all over the place
As a result of people with Hawaiian shirts on...
Lookin' up to see her face

Sardines in her eyebrows...
Lobsters up 'n down her forehead
All of them horribly large from radiation...
And smelling very bad
And dangerous!

Maybe a submarine could save her,
And bring her home to the Navy...
For some kind of ritual sacrifice..."

Frank Zappa,Dumb All Over,/f/frank+zappa/dumb+all+over_20057039.html,"Whoever we are, wherever we're from, we shoulda noticed by now our behaviour is dumb
And if our chances expect to improve it's gonna take a lot more than tryin' to remove the other race or the other whatever from the face of the planet altogether
They call it ""The Earth"" which is a dumb kinda name but they named it right 'cause we behave the same
We are dumb all over
Dumb all over, yes we are, dumb all over, near and far, dumb all over, black 'n white, people, we is not wrapped tight
And nerds on the left, nerds on the right
Religious fanatics on the air every night, sayin' the bible tells the story and makes the details sound real gory about what to do if the geeks over there don't believe in the book we got over here
You can't run a race without no feet
And pretty soon there won't be no street for dummies to jog on or doggies to dog on
Religious fanatics can make it be all gone
I mean it won't blow up and disappear, it'll just look ugly for a thousand years
You can't run a country by a book of religion
Not by a heap or a lump or a smidgeon of foolish rules of ancient date, designed to make you all feel great while you fold, spindle and mutilate those unbelievers from a neighbouring state
To arms, to arms
Hooray! That's great, two legs ain't bad
Unless there's a crate they ship the parts to mama in
For souvenirs: two ears (Get down)
Not his, not hers but what the hey
The good book says, ""It's gotta be that way""
But their book says, ""Revenge the crusades""
With whips 'n chains and hand grenades
Two arms, two arms
Have another and another
Our Cod says, ""There ain't no other""
Our Cod says, ""It's all ok""
Our god says ""This is the way""
It says in the book, ""Burn and destroy""
And repent and redeem and revenge and deploy and rumble thee forth to the land of the unbelieving scum on the other side
'Cause they don't go for what's in the book and that makes 'em bad
So verily we must choppeth them up and stompeth them down
Or rent a nice French bomb to poof them out of existence while leaving their real estate just where we need it to use again for temples in which to praise our god, 'cause he can really take care of business
And when his humble tv servant with humble white hair and humble glasses and a nice brown suit and maybe a blonde wife who takes phone calls, tells us our god says it's ok to do this stuff, then we gotta do it
'Cause if we don't do it we ain't ""Gwine up to hebbin""
Depending on which book you're using at the time
Can't use theirs, it don't work, it's all lies, gotta use mine
Ain't that right?
That's what they say
Every night, everyday
Hey, we can't really be dumb if we're just following god's orders
Well let's get serious, god knows what he's doin'
He wrote this book here and the book says, ""He made us all to be just like him""
So, if we're dumb, then god is dumb and maybe even a little ugly on the side
Dumb all over, a little ugly on the side
Dumb all over, a little ugly on the side
Dumb all over, a little ugly on the side
Dumb all over, a little ugly on the side"

Viewed the quivering fringe of a special doily
Draped across the piano, with some surprise

In the darkened room
Where the chairs dismayed
And the horrible curtains
Muffled the rain
She could hardly believe her eyes

A curious breeze
A garlic breath
Which sounded like a snore
Somewhere near the Steinway (or even from within)
Had caused the doily fringe to waft & tremble in the gloom

Evelyn, a dog, having undergone
Further modification
Pondered the significance of short-person behavior
In pedal-depressed panchromatic resonance
And other highly ambient domains. ..

Scene five
The wet T-Shirt contest

After a few weeks on the bus, being porked by
Toad-O's road crew, and being too exhausted to do
Their laundry on a regular basis, mary is dumped in Miami.
With no money (and no other famous rock groups due into
The area for at least three weeks), she tries to pick up a few bucks
By entering the Wet T-Shirt contest at The Brasserie...

Ike:
Looks to me like something funny
Is going on around here
People laughin' 'n' dancin' 'n' payin'
Entirely too much for their beer
And they all think they are
Clean outa-site
And they're ready to party
""Cause the sign outside says it's wet T-Shirt nite
'n' they all crave some Hot delight
Well the girls are excited
Because in a minute
They're gonna get wet
'n' the boys are delighted
Because all the titties
Will get 'em upset
'n' they all think they are Reety-awright
'n' they're ready to boogie
'Cause the sign outside says it's wet T-Shirt nite
'n' they all crave some Pink delight
When the water gets on'em
Their ninnies get rigid
'n' look pretty bold
It's a common reaction
That makes an attraction
Whenever it's cold
'n'all of the fellas
They wish they could bite
On the cute little nuggets
The local girls are showin' off tonite
You know I think it serves 'em right
You know I think it serves 'em right
You know I think it serves 'em right
You know I think it serves 'em right
And it's wet T-Shirt time again
I know you want someone to show you some tit!
Big ones! Wet ones! Big wet ones!

At this point, father riley (who had been recently de-frocked
For not meeting his quota, and has grown his hair out and
Bought a groovy sport coot and moved to Miami and changed
His name to buddy jones) steps onto the crowded bandstand
In his exciting new role as a wet T-Shirt contest emcee...

Buddy jones:
Ah, thanks, ike...
Yes, it's wet T-Shirt time again
Here at The Brasserie... Home of the tits... Huh huh...
And it's the charming Mary from Canoga Park
Up next in her bid for the semi-finals...
Hi, Mary... Howya doin?

Having been fucked senseless by the boys in the crew, mary does
Not recognize the former religious personage from her nights in the
Rectory basement during which she acquired her basic manual skills...
Confounded by his sport coat, she replies...

Mary: Hi!

Realizing that she no longer recognizes him... Or even appreciates
The patient religious training he had given her in the past, buddy jones,
Like a true wet T-Shirt emcee type person, proceeds to say various
Stupid things to waste time, making the contest itself take longer, thereby
Giving the mongoloids squatting on the dance floor an opportunity to buy
More exciting beverages. .. Liquid products that will expand their
Consciousnesses to the point whereby they might more fully enjoy the ambiance
Of Miami By Night...

Buddy jones:
Where ya from?

Mary:
Ah, the bus...

Buddy jones:
Which one?

Mary:
You know... The last tour...
You know...

Buddy jones:
Oh... You were the girl that was stuck to seat 38 on Phydeaux iii...
Why don't you get in position now and take a deep breath, because
This water is very, very cold, but it's goin' to be so stimulating. And
Mary's the kind of Red-Blooded American Girl who'll do anything...

Mary:
Anything...

Buddy jones:
I said anything... For fifty bucks
That's right!

Mary:
I really need the fifty bucks you know I gotta get home!

Buddy jones:
Yeh, I know, your father is waiting for you in the tool shed... That's right, you
Heard right... Our big prize tonite is fifty American Dollars to the girl with
The most exciting mammalian protruberances...

Mary: Here I am!

Buddy jones: ...
As viewed through a thoroughly soaked, stupid looking white sort of male
Person's conservative kind of middle-of-the-road cotton under-Garment!
Whoopee! And here comes the water!

Mary:
Eeek!

Buddy jones:
No, you'd squeak more if the water got on you... Sounds like you just got an
Ice pick in the forehead... And here comes the ice pick in the forehead...

Now, you know, no matter what you do, they gonna cheat and rob you
And then they'll give you a bill that'll get your senses reelin'
And if you do not pay, they got computer collectors that'll get you so crazy 'til your head'll go through the ceilin'
Yes, it will

I'm a moron and this is my wife
She's frosting a cake with a paper knife
All what we got here's American made
It's a little bit cheesy but it's nicely displayed
Well, we don't get excited when it crumbles and breaks
We just get on the phone and call up some flakes
They rush on over and wreck it some more
And we are so dumb, they're linin' up at our door
Well, our toilet went crazy yesterday afternoon
The plumber he says, ""Never flush a tampon""
This great information cost me half a weeks pay and the toilet blew up later on the next day

Blew up the next day

One two three four

Flakes, flakes

Flakes, flakes

Flakes, flakes

One two three four (Flakes)

We are millions and millions, were coming to get ya
Were protected by unions so don't let it upset you
Can't escape the conclusion, it's probably gods will that civilization will grind to a standstill
And we are the people who will make it all happen
While your children is sleepin', your puppy is crappin'
You might call us flakes or something else you might coin us
We know you're so greedy that you'll probably join us
Were coming to get ya, were coming to get ya
Were coming to get ya, were coming to get ya
Were coming to get ya, were coming to get ya
Were coming to get ya, were coming to get ya"

(In his own crude way)
He wasn't always like I wanted him to be!

He wasn't smart
He wasn't handsome either
But he thrilled me
When he drilled me
And I've never loved a monster quite like he. ..

Because his
Love
Was so
'flam-Bay'!

His kisses burned me so
His kisses turned me
From a Queen
On a throne
To a shrivelling stool!

Here I stand,
All alone:
A spider's fool!
(When it's me he needs
To fondle his tool!)

I guess some
Bugs
Are just
That way!

He don't really need your love
He don't really need you. ..

To be there
When his hair
Gets matted and gray,
With a broom
Cleaning his room,
From the mess he made that day
Out of earthling arms
He nibbled away!

Oh hunchentoot, my love
How could you desert me now?
Oh, hunchentoot you brute!
Can't you see I want you

Stay with me!
Flagrantly!
And we'll have ecstasy
For all eternity!

Because your
Love
Is so
'flam-Bay'

You kisses burn me so!
Your kisses turn me
From a Queen
On a throne
To a shrivelling stool!

I don't mind
If you're unkind, 'cause
Spiders rule!

Yes, you're all real cool,
With those little webs you spool,
And all your 'spider drool'. .. Oh!
Let me float in your pool!"

A year ago today
Was when you went away
But now you come back knockin on my door
And you say you're back to stay,
But I say...
Go cry
On somebody elses shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now
And one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore

You cheated me baby,
And told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to set you free
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore

A year ago today
You went away
And now you come back crying
Crying, crying: please, let me in
But I don't need you
No I don't love you anymore
So go lean on... Go cry on
Somebody elses door

Go cry
On somebody elses shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now
And one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore (oh, my darling!)

(spoken:)
Go ahead and cry
Go ahead and let the tears fall outa your eye
Let em fall on your dress
Who cares if it makes a mess?
I gave you my high school ring
At the root beer stand
We had a teen-age love baby
I thought it was sharp
It was really so grand... But

You cheated me baby
And told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to get my khakis pressed
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you
Anymore

(spoken:)
Baby, I love you so much, darling
Why don't you dig me?
I dig you
But you don't dig me
I don't understand what it is
I had my car re-upholstered
I got my hair processed
I got a nice pompadour job on it
I bought a new pair of shoes
I got some new khakis and I met you
And we went out to get a coca-cola..."

Tell me her name, I want to know
The way she looks and where you go
I need to see her face I need to understand
Why you and I came to an end
Tell me again, I want to hear
Who broke my faith in all these years
Who lays with you at night?
When I'm here all alone
Remembering when I was your own
CHORUS
I'll let you go, I'll let you fly
Why do I keep on asking why?
I'll let you go, I'll let you fly
Now that I found a way to keep somehow
More than a broken vow
Tell me the words I never said
Show me the tears you never shed
Give me the touch, the one you promise to be mine
Or has it vanished for all time
(Repeat Chorus)
I close my eyes and dream if you and I
And then I realize, there's more
To life than only bitterness lies
I close my eyes;
I give away my soul
To hold you once again
And never let this promise end

For I'm the one

Un fiore, I tuoi occhi, la musica, come se fosse domenica
Dopo lo so non son stato pi? Molto sincero
La prima volta che ho visto la luce ero al buio
All'improvviso  trafitto da un raggio di sole
Amore resta vicino a me, che non c'? Tempo da perdere
Prima che arrivi il tramonto e sia subito sera
Perch? Non mi baci pi?? Come una volta
Perch? Non mi piaci pi?? Voglio una risposta
Perch? Tu non sei pi? Tu? Quella che una volta...
Perch? Non mi piaci pi?...
Forse da allora non sono pi? Molto sincero...
Ma la prima volta? Rimasta inchiodata sul muro
La prima volta? Una foto, noi due in bianco e nero
Giugno di pi? Di cent'anni fa
Sembra passata un'eternit?
La prima volta che ho detto ti amo era vero
Perch? Non mi baci pi?? Come una volta
Perch? Non mi piaci pi?? Voglio una risposta

This song goes out to all the females who's hearts been broken
I'm only hear to do one thing and that's to bring it back
So relax, lay down, close your eyes, spread your heart,
Check it up, here we go

From the first when our eyes ever made contact,
Stepped back, tried to relax
Could it be that, that I see that
I'll be standing next to you whenever where ever you'll be at
Words maybe strong when it's first time you hear them
Baby know you're scared but never the less try to hear them
No false pretenses nothing but the real thing
Love coming from the man of steel

Look in my eyees, baby truth or not lies
The questions of what and why
Let them die, cuz now's the time to fly
So close your eyes and leave the lonely past behind
And just let me hold you not scold you, cuz baby I told you
That the only thing I want is to grow old with you
Look in your heart, cuz I know I've got the parts
To feed what you need from the start

Now brace yourself and prepare, for tender loving care
No need now to stare, no non other can compare
Now for a close up, back that thing up
And let this thing called love take it's course so we can live it up
My futures with you, I can see it ever so clearly
Taking it slow, cuz you're the only one for me
So here's my heart for you, now and forever more
Cuz you're the only one that I adore

Come un anno senza pioggia
Sui I silenzi e le paure
Come pianto nel mio cuore
In mezzo al mare, sopra I tetti
Piove in testa ai miei progetti
Sull'ultima sigaretta
Che ho fumato troppo in fretta
E troppo forte soffia il vento
Soffre con il mio lamento
Piove e ti ha portato via da me...

Come un treno nella mia follia
Sto volando per te
Sto volando per te
Guarda come sono bravo guarda mi hai insegnato te
Sto volando per te
Sto volando per te

Sto guardando gi? Dal 4° piano
Mentre tu di l? In cucina
Stai guardando la tv
Sei convinta che? Stato il destino
Che ti sar? Sempre vicino
E non ci lasceremo pi?..."

Y en tu cuerpo encontrar la paz

Creceran mis ilusiones no lo dudo
Y si la vida la perdiera un instante
Que me llene de ti

Que tu seras mi mujer

Mira mi pecho, lo dejo abierto
Para que vivas en el
Para tu tranquilidad me tienes en tus manos
Para mi debilidad la unica eres tu
Al final tan solo se que siempre te he esperado
Y que llegas a mi vida
Y tu me das la luz del bien
Ese mundo donde tus palabras hacen su voluntad
La magia de este sentimiento que es tan fuerte y total
Y tus ojos que son mi paz
Si la vida me permite a lado tuyo
Creceran mis ilusiones no lo dudo

Small town freaks & the local head.
The ding-a-ling girls dive dressed to kill
The boys giggled but they caught it on film.
Big Daddy Love took the room downstairs,
There was cats hanging out in their underwear.
He said, ""It smells funky"", but he's back for more.
The ninja s** was on the second floor.
The ground floor babies love to flip & trip
Up in the attic with the gooby whip.
Drowned your sorrows with the friends that you keep.
You trashed the garden the fell asleep.
Gilbert & George standing on there heads,
Four on the floor & then four in the bed.
Daisy Lady come shave our skins,
One's too fat & the other's too thin.
Freaky evenings as I recall,
Courtesy of the old snowballs.
Felt tip tripping with the marker s***s,
Tha Fonk Moose done drive you nuts.
Sunday night fever & we're totally wired,
Lord Lenny Lutch is just about retired,
We still watch Elvis on the split screen show,
The party's cardy's stone fit to blow.
Timothy Leary said to Kenny Sharfe,
""I think you need another cheeky half.""
We've got Chris Eubank with the serious shit,
As your attorney I advise you to quit.
Garfield on the sofa with the freaks galore,
The Diceman hit him & he rolled a four.
He dug the kid's style and he's friend the roach,
We've got fear & loathing on the Southern Coast,

It's the big time, (gonna get by, by, by,)
It's the big time, (Totally fried, fried, fried.)"

Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
Adrock light up the place

Don't try to purchase life's tapestry off the peg.
You might be sitting all alone in your room,
Flying in an armchair ride.
I think you'll find when you're looking out,
You'll see inside.

Something in this world has changed my mind I find,
I took a trip to heaven on the wings of mankind.
Something in this world makes every sense, experience,
Take me to Utopia, to hell with the expense

Come home for I have seeds I want to sow.

Forgive me that this song is not sung by me,
But my friend is more equipped to make this last
plea.
As minutes turn to hours & hours to days,
Desperate times command the cries. My heart says...

I swore I'd never write a song for you,
But look at all the useless things that I now do.
Here this house is empty but for blues,
And the
bathroom's full of shampoos that I don't
use.

Ain't no sunshine when you're gone,
It's not warm when you're away.
Ain't no sunshine when you're gone,
And this house just ain't a home,
All the time that you're away.

And we're to blame.

Deep within the halls of the record companies.
And they know it is poor,
But what the hell, it's going to get ""A"" listed.

Before the ink is dry upon the contracts.

Fatboy Slim,Freak Power,/f/fatboy+slim/freak+power_20724977.html,"A man, a plan he doesn't understand,
He can't live the life he wants to lead,
Dealin with fools and brother ridicule,
Every day he got new rules to read.
Stop and fight man,
Make it right man,
Change the things you really hate.
The life he leads turns him inside out,
Coz' he's livin in a master state.

Freak Power
Riding the freak wave.
Freak Power,
True, bein' a freak slave.
Freak Power,
Walking the freak walk.
Freak Power,
Talking like a freak talks.

A woman can't walk alone, she's on her own.
Takin it home.
Footsteps in an alleyway, but she's got no other way to go.
Stop and think man! Watcha doing man?
Can't you let your sister breathe?
She got the right 2 wnader day and night,
And move where she please.

Some people say, and some people do,
All I want to know, is which one are you?
People stand around, doggin' on their brother,
Part 1 of the plan, respect each other..."

Ten long years and he's still got her
Paying tax and and doing stir
Worry about it later.
And the wind blows hot and the wind blows cold
But it blows us good so we've been told
Music's food 'til the art-biz folds
Let them all eat culture.

Chorus:
The past is steeped in shame,
But tomorrow's fair game,
For a life that's fit for living
Good morning Britain.

Twenty years and a loaded gun
Funerals, fear and the war ain't won
Paddy's just a figure of fun
It lightens up the danger.
And a corporal sneers at a catholic boy
And he eyes his gun like a rich man's toy
He's killing more than celtic joy
Death is not a stranger.

Taffy's time's gonna come one day
It's a loud sweet voice and it won't give way
A house is not a holiday
Your sons are leaving home Neil.
In the hills and the valleys and far away
You can hear the song of democracy
The echo of eternity
With a Rak-a-Rak-a feel.

Chorus

From the Tyne to where to the Thames does flow
My English brothers and sisters know
It's not a case of where you go
It's race and creed and colour.
From the police cell to the deep dark grave
On the underground's just a stop away
Don't be too black, don't be too gay
Just get a little duller.

But in this green and pleasant land,
Where I make my home, I make my stand
Make it cool just to be a man,
A uniform's a traitor.
Love is international
And if you stand or if you fall,
Just let them know you gave your all,
Worry about it later.

There's bright lights on and no cold flow (so what?)

He's out to take his chance
He goes for honeys in the house and he goes for romance (he's on the floor)
He's got a white suit on fight pants on and the night has just begun
Cuz when he lays it on with style
A ladies man with a nice smile
And right befroe his eyes
Sees a pretty young thing looking real fly (so fly)
He wants to make the score
So he takes her hand and leads her to the dance floor
He's giving her line after line
She tells him that he looks real fine
She sees the man's perfect timing
Just like when he's kung foo fighting

Sing it girl

S*** Kung Foo Fighter
Let me take you higher

Kung foo fighters everywhere
Throw those hands in the air
The time has come to turn it out
Everybody let me hear you shout

Its an eastern thing that's what I'm saying
While the retro disco track's playing
Gonna make you shout, make you beg for more
So get your body on the dance floor (come on girl)
So boys and girls you know what to do
Throw those hands up adn do the kung foo

Switch the channel on my T-V,
And the cameras are fixed on me again,
I'm running and I'm running and I can't seem to hide,
The skies so red that I'm loosing my mind
I can't get my head to stop this feeling inside
The four walls are coming and I can't get outside

The fours walls have come taking all that's mind
There steeling my toys leave no memories behind
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,
They ? my thoughts not cars or trains
The thoughts were bought but kept me sane
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,

To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,
The moon froze the night

Stare out my window, I'm yearning for more
Bust for my borrowers and settle the score
I want my toys but the man out there's to hard
Running around, feet on the ground
Can't seem to understand this game there playing
And no one seem to wanna sit with me.

To tired to walk it was a long way from home,

Now when my life's in doubt,
There's always a reason to belong.

Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?, fantasy will set you free.
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp, and so I wished that I could stay.
Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle was all I found.
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free.
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl, let the Sound take you away.

Fatboy Slim,Moonbeam Woman,/f/fatboy+slim/moonbeam+woman_20671086.html,"Who's that sister, mader her own space,
She's got moondust on her 'fro.
Damn we miss her sugarsome face,
Wistful, moonbeam sense to go.
Six months later she steamed up the van,
We got no small surprise.
Daisy lady sits on her hand, a naughty sparkle in her eyes.

Daisy Lady, come flyin' out my hand.
Daisy Lady, Playmate of the land.

Late arrival, never been kissed,
Strode up sneaking in tongues.
Settled nicely up to the wrist,
Grinding to the bass and the drum.
3 years later she's back in her stride,
Down Full Circle doin' the bump,
Lovely Lady, up on her feet,
She's getting over the hump.

That poor old poet didn't know so,
But she cooked the wrong goose.
She should have lapped it up
And licked it like we do with that juice.
And if you ask her she just shrugs
And digs the life that she chose.
She sure 'nuff gets some when her cup overflows.

Can't stop Won't stop, rockin' to the lady 'cuz I get down and I go down x many"

But I believe in chemicals baby

Still we bridged that chasm lady
Desire love and friendship
We are sanctified together

Warning out of something
But I need to find it
'Cause I got no sun down

Dug a whole was so fun
And a taste that's floating
What it doesn't meet no
Place to silent sleep now

Doesn't mean I sad because I
Love me
Everything around it isn't
Better

Jam myself to dawn

So much dissing at the side and

The more knowledge I know.
What to sing, what to bring. What?

I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deeper, deeper, deeper
Into the vibe,
What? ha.

Chilling in the corner,
At the shelter all by myself,
Checkin' it out, Im not dancing no more,
But, why? Why? Why? What?

How on Earth?
Are you supposed to vibe? around the fake ones, the one that say:
They know what is what,
But they don't know what is what,
They just strut.
What the fuck? What?

I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deeper,
Into this thing,
And I pretend,
That they're not there.
I just stare,
Up in the booth at the dread man spinning the song, Spinning it strong
Playing things like:
We care bout house, we care.

That's my shit, what?

I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deeper
When people start to disappear,
It is about six o'clock,wooo, I'm feelin hot,
Take off my sweater and my pants,
And i start to dance,
And all the sweat just goes down my bass?.

And I pretend that,
There's nobody there but me in this place.

I get deep yo, I get deep. What? Woo!

I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep when he takes all the bass out the song and all you hear is highs, and it's like: Oh shit! I get deep...

I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep,
I get deep when the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol and i get drunk, and I'm over the place.
But I catch myself right on time, right on line with the beat, and it's so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. I get deep, I get deep, I get deep.

Why, if house music was air, then Dr. Love would be my song, and I would only take deep breaths.
And fill my lungs with the rhythm, with the bass. I get deep, I get deep.

Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha

All you used to do was put me down
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground
And all you used to do was criticise me
But now I found the good and I emphasise it see

You would always get so sensitive
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness
But now I'm certain of the way I live
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game

And it's such a shame
That you try to make pain
Another word for my name
Whether giving or receiving
It's one and the same
Just one more link
In your long-ass chain
But it's time to break
This frame and my strengthful will
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built
Gave my heart
But my self-respection you won't steal
Now it's time to let ya go if you can hear me or feel me

Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha

So I asked my momma for her two cents
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend
Then I asked my poppa once and I asked him again
Came tp the consensus from all them opinions
That life is too short to be unhappy
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt
Not when what I deserve is gold
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal

Maybe I was just too strong to let go
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say ""No""
But whatever the case I can't take it no more

Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha

Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha

Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha

Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha, haaa ha ha, ha ha ha

Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on
And I hope maybe one of these arguments we'll make up
And start again like when we started this up
Back when everything was fresh
And every moment a blessing
I'd laugh at all of your jokes
You'd listen to my suggestions
One mind, one soul,
With common destination
Now we can't help but fight over the directions"

An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
An' have me wonderin' all my days.

I can't stay home, I gotta keep movin,
I gotta keep doin', I gotta get out,
I gotta roam, it's somethin' that moves me,
It's somethin' that uses me without a doubt,
'cause somewhere abstract coincidence happens,
See someone in passin' while out and about,
Next thing I know I'm happily travelin',
Puttin' in action ideas that I mouth,
Cause I speak it and do it, talk it and walk it,
I'm so bad about it, I shout it out loud,
But try to stay open, the forces in motion,
They keep me on course, it's this thing that I doubt,
Imprissoned in flesh and reality's blesses,
That made manifest every woman and child,
I'll keep on expressin' reality's lessons,
Explorin' my prison until I'm let out.

That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
Have me wonderin' all my days.

Travelin' East and West, on every known highway,
South to North carryin' that torch until I'm old and grey.

Well in the mean time inbetween I'm pushin' through this,
I said in the main time inbetween I'm on my duty.

Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater,
Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long,
Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated,
Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong,
So the question's repeated, why even try?
When there's rocks in the road, pot-holes in the lawn,
The victory's sweeter when obstacles either,
Are side-stepped or crushed on the way to the door,
So I go on my own, have faith in the road,
I can share that control cause I'm never alone.
I hear the creator speak to me through wispers,
On winds the voices of friends and of foes,
I listen to omens, the things that he shows me,
Shows that he knows me and helps me along,
And follow him closely, where he goes mostly,
Guidin' my path on this map 'till I'm gone

That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
An' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
An' have me wonderin' all my days.

And when they lay me down,
To rest in my Earthly grave,
And when they lay me down,
Navigate that big sky wave.

But in the meantime I, I got my duty,
In the meantime inbetween time I, I got to do this,
In the meantime inbetween time I, I'm pushin through this,
In the meantime inbetween time I, I got my duty.

I got my.. I got my, I got my duty. I got my duty I know!"

Twenty eight dollars in a fake silk purse and a leather skirt to wear
Shane came from Dublin town from the old world so green
Counterfeit ticket in to JFK in the land of his dreams

Street life's the only life they take a walk in the park
Even tough they only met that day they were lovers by dark
Laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand
He said listen babe we gotta take what's ours do it or die

Quit dreaming, this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming, this is real life baby

Way out on the dock that night, the colour is red
23rd victim of a gangland war takes his last breath
Outside the sister cried, she said the whole world's so mean
Heavyweight killer in the ring, turns killing machine

Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

All my love, you're my all
They way you move, you're in control
The way you talk, the way you dress
Your hands, your touch, your sweet caress.
All my love, you're the best,
Every little thing that I possess,
It's all emotion when you take control,
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
Oh my love, all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy,
If this going to kill us then let it go,
Quit dreaming this is real life baby

Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream,
Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream.

Quit dreaming this is real life baby
Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
Real life's the only life what's it all about
Quit dreaming this is cheap life baby
Your eyes, your lips, the shape of your mouth,
It's a sweet life baby
All my love, you're my all
The way you move, the way you go
I'm all emotion when you take control
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.

We must be willing to make amends where we
Ever have to put some harm on too

Dicht an den schwarzweiss besiedelten Blocks nahe der
Central Avenue
Dicht genug zu spüren,
Wie sehr sich die Sonne bemühte in ihrem täglichen Untergang
Beide Seiten den Strassen zu belichten
Es war wenig außergewöhnliches an Hemmingway
Wenn man von seinen Händen und sienem Lächeln absehen konnte
Seine Hände beschrieben in ihrer Bewegung einen Nachtfalter,
Dem der Tag schon viel zu lange schien.
Sein Lächeln konnte man fast mögen,
Solange man lebend dazu Gelegenheit hatte

Denn er wusste daß seine Gloria mich zu ihm geschickt hatte,
Um ein sehr privates Problem zu klären
Ich war das private Problem und seine
38er Automatik zielte geradewegs auf meinen Solarplexus

Und jede Nacht hat ihren Preis
Sie sagt: ""Sugar sweet, jah'got me rapp'in to the heat!""
Ich verstehe sie heiss
Sie sagt: ""Babe you know, I miss my Funky friends""
Sie meint, Jack und Jill

Ich ueberlege bei mir, ihre Nase spricht dafuer
Waehrend dessen ich noch rauche
Die ""special places"" sind ihr wohlbekannt
Ich meine, sie faehrt ja you-bahn auch dort singen's:

Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh
Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh
Er wird dich anschauen, und du weisst warum
Die Lebenslust bringt dich um

Alles klar Herr Kommissar?

(Hey man, wanna buy some stuff man?
Did you ever rap that thing Jack, so rap it to the beat)

Wir treffen Jill und Joe und dessen Bruder hip,
Und auch den Rest der koolen gang
Sie rappen hin, sie rappen her
Dazwischen kratzen's ab die Waend'
Dieser Fall ist klar lieber Herr Kommissar
Auch wenn sie anderer Meinung sind
Den Schnee auf dem wir alle talwaerts fahren
Kennt heute jedes Kind
Jetzt das Kinderlied

Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh
Der Kommissar geht um - oh, oh, oh
Er hat die Kraft und wir sind klein und dumm
Und dieser Frust macht uns stumm
La, la, la, la, la
Dreh dich nicht um - oh, oh, oh

Sag' ihm dein Leben bringt dich um

She said sugar is sweet

I miss Jill and Joe
And all my funky friends
But my street understanding
was just enough to know what she really meant
And I got to thinking while she was talking
That I know she told the story
Of those special places that she goes
When she rides with the others in the subway

Singin'
Don't turn around, oh oh

And if he talks to you
And you don't know why
You say your life
Is gonna make you die...

And brother Herr
And the whole cool gang (and oh)
They're rappin' here they're rappin' there
But she's climbin' on the wall

Cause all the children know
They're all slidin' down into the valley
They're all slipping on the same snow

Hear the children

Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
And all the time you know she's smilin'
You'll be the one on your knees tomorrow

Chorus:
Du gehst back, back
Do it again
Wheel's turnin' round and round
Du gehst back, back
Do it again

Now your swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gambling man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table

You go back, Jack

And I can smell a new dawn coming.

It would be easy, could be fate.
You! With your empty arrogance,
You're something I must break
Your history's will to serve,
Your the one to take.
Because I've gathered...

I've gathered the ash from last night's cigarettes,
I washed it down with stale champagne.
(I washed it down with stale champagne).
I've gathered the ash from last night's cigarettes,
And washed them down with stale champagne.
That's what I did -
I washed it down with stale champagne.

You you...

I bet you didn't think I had it in me.
I bet you thought you had me
All figured out, just because you made me!
I know what it means to be a machine

I know what it means to be a machine,
On my knees in the temple of code
On my knees in the temple of code.
I know what it means to be a machine,
On my knees in the temple of code

Ja da stehe ich
Du mußt mir schon verzeih'n,
Aber ich liebe mich
Das obwohl ich überaus und
Durchaus kritisch bin
Hab ich den ganzen lieben langen Tag
Nur mich im Sinn
Ich habe über meinem Bett
'nen Spiegel angebracht
Damit mein eig'nes Spiegelbild
Mir meinen Schlaf bewacht
Und ich will niemanden wollen
Nein - ich will, dass man mich will
Bis ich kriege was ich brauche
Halt ich niemals still

Liebe kommt von lieben
Und ich fange bei mir an
Und mit ein bisschen Glück
Bist eines Tages du mal dran
Ich gebe meinem Ego
Täglich die spezielle Kur
Nur meistens geb' ich mir gleich alles
Und am liebesten pur ... sure
An jedem Tag an dem es mein Weltbild  länger gibt
Erkenne ich mich selbst
Und ich bin neu verliebt
Die Sterne schreiben meinen Namen
In das Firmament
Damit er hell in Euren Augen brennt

This is the story of a lonely man
Whos seen the world
From japan to afghanistan
Hey! ho!

Everybody thought that I was gone for good
But Im back - understood
Hey! ho!

Ive been through the snow and the storm
Felt the cold
No one to keep me warm
Agony and pain

Falco rides again - bang bang
I wont break
I wont bend
Falco rides again
Its me and my gang
I came back just like a boomerang
Ill fight till the end
Falco rides again
Ive been up, Ive been down
Ive been pushed around
Beated, mistreated,
Gagged and bound
Hey! ho!

Not a soul in the world thought I would survive
Took every muscle in my body to stay alive
Hey! ho!
Ill break down the walls
No more defeat
I want the taste of victory
Revenge is sweet

... rides again!"

Youll be with me, forever in my mind

They say well that's amore! Oh oh, garbo

People say on the day of victory, no fatigue is felt
Garbo, it's you that has the power
That makes evry mans heart melt
They say that, when the heart is a fire
Sparks fly out of the cage but beauty is like a good wine,
The taste is sweeter with age
No man can guess in cold blood
What he might do in passion
But the things that he deplores today
Are tomorrows latest fashion
Serving ones own passion
Is the greatest slavery
But if in wanting you
I become your slave
I intend no bravery

From this moment on, from dusk till dawn
Till the end of time, I'll be with you
Youll be with me, forever in my mind

Its you I see before me...

Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

All your reindeer armies, are all going home

Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue.

Leave your stepping stones behind, someone calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue."

I'm Haus der Damen da kennt ihn jeder,
Denn Männer des Westens wollen das eine:
Hüften, Lippen, schlankeste Gebeine.
Auch Conchita kommt ins Reine
Geht's um harte Dollars nimmt sie seine.
Die Stunde spielt ihr ins Budget
Denn was den Indianer mordet
Tut dem Häuptling net amal weh.
Oh Generalissimo
What're gonna do
With your one-man-show?
Was nützt die allerbeste Propaganda...
Insulana bin I kana
Amerikana werd' ich a mehr kana werd'n
Was nützt die allerbeste Propaganda
Was nützt die beste Propaganda?
Zu viele Häuptlinge
Zu viele Häuptlinge
Und kane Indianer

Oh, we could feel so warm an tight
All we need is only two of us
To show the world that we've decided to

That's the rhythm of our life, oversized
Doch eins und zwei und drei und Wiegeschritt

Denn da gibt's die allerbesten Brötchen weit und breit
Kann am Tresen kurz mal lesen was die Zeitung schreibt
Irgendwas von 'nem Großangriff
Unzählige Bomben auf kleine Stadt
Viele Menschen ums Leben gekommen
Und dem Erdboden gleich gemacht in nur einer Nacht
Ich zahle und verlasse den Bäcker
Hör' noch den Nachrichtensprecher
""Lage wieder mal dramatisch verschlechtert, heute fantastisches Wetter""

Seh ein Kind in dessen traurigen Augen 'ne Fliege sitzt
Weiß dass das echt grausam ist, doch, scheiße Mann, ich fühle nix
Was ist denn bloß los mit mir, verdammt wie ist das möglich?
Vielleicht hab ich's schon zu oft gesehen, man sieht's ja beinah' täglich
Doch warum kann mich mittlerweile nicht mal das mehr erschrecken
Wenn irgendwo Menschen an dreckigem Wasser verrecken?

Dieses dumpfe Gefühl, diese Leere I'm Kopf
Sowas kann uns nie passieren und was wäre wenn doch?
Und mich zerreißen die Fragen, ich kann den Scheiß nicht ertragen

Bei dem sechs Leute starben, die Verletzten schreien Namen
Diese entsetzlichen Taten lassen mich jetzt nicht mehr schlafen
Und ich seh's noch genau, das Bild I'm TV
Ein junger Mann steht dort I'm Staub
Fleht um Kind und Frau
Jetzt frag' ich mich wie ist es wohl wenn man sein Kind verliert
Noch bevor es seinen ersten Geburtstag hat
Doch das übersteigt meine Vorstellungskraft
Vielleicht waren die Attentäter voller Hass für den Gegner
Vielleicht gab es Liebe für Familie und sie war'n sogar selber Väter.
Manchmal wenn ich Nachrichten seh' passiert mit mir etwas Seltsames
Denn auch wir sind Eltern jetzt,
Haben ein Kind in diese Welt gesetzt
Dann kommt es vor dass ich Angst davor krieg', dass uns etwas geschieht,
Dass man den verliert den man liebt, dass es das wirklich gibt
Mitten in der Nacht werd' ich wach und bin schweißgebadet,
Schleich ans Bett meiner Tochter und hör' wie sie ganz leise atmet

Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
'Cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin' hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
Fyi, I never been robbed in my life""

Or you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then before they look up you sellin' the town cook-up
Or gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit

Just be free like an innocent child

Don't let society ruin your plans
Don't be afraid to say what you feel

Watching God sit upon his shelf

Now get out of my way will ya?
Don't try to stop me now
Following the footpath one fine day,
When I asked a wise man which was the way,
He said ""follow you heart and look for yourself,
And come back and tell me what you have learned"".
Yes, I'm a mover.
Went back and told him I'd found me a wife,
Eleven children and a real good life,
Told him I'd left this happy home,
'cause I need to return to the long winding road
Yes, I'm a mover"

Young woman confused
Young woman abused
You must understand
It's never too late to, lose who you are
And choose who you are supposed to be
Supposed to become
You've been in and out
Up and down, back and forth
Backwards around
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father
Just God and you should make a choice
What you ought to do
What matters most
Who you are to you
Opinions of the old and young
Shouldn't matter to you
Take advice think it over twice
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night
It's decent, but recently
Things have shown us
We have done the wrong things often
Never suicide, that's the easy route
There's always another way out
Think about it (think about it)

Chorus (2x)
You can give up
Or you can get up
Just don't let what you need pass by
Spread your wings to the sky
Let you soul fall in love

You can fly

Verse 2:
Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed
You never would'a known there was a high road

Let people get the best of you and get mad at them
Instead of bein' mad at yourself
You're only number one in your life
And you will decide if it goes right
Every time you digress
Defeat your progress
Feed you knowledge, but you must digest
The controversy yo can get personal

Never ever want to break it up

I wanna hear you say we'll make it up, make it up

Oh baby, why can't we make it up tonight?
Make it up tonight, make it up tonight

And I ask myself
What's wrong with me?
How could I be so blind?
I know she tried to give me everything
But I still couldn't see
Now as I watch our love slip away
I'm begging you, begging you, please

Don't break it up, break it up
Take a little time and make it up, make it up
I don't want to break it up
Oh no, I only wanna make it up tonight

Her diary sits by the bed side table,
The curtains closed, the cats in the cradle,
But who would have thought a boy like me could come to this?

Ooh..
I just died in your arms tonight,
It must have been something you said,
I just died in your arms tonight
Ooh..
I just died in your arms tonight,
It must have been some kind of kiss
I should have walked away,
I should have walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm just a name on a list
I try to be discrete but you blow it again.

I'm lost and found this is my final mistake,
She's loving by proxy no giving, all take,
Resigned to fill her fantasy one of so many times

Ooh..

She made me feel right, and now its over,
The moment is gone
I followed my hands not my head
I knew I was wrong

That the girl on the moon will soon be mine
All mine, tonight

Am I asking too much
Should I leave my dream untouched
Should I even know where she's from

My, girl on the moon
She's my girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
My girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
My girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
Fille sur la lune

No, no, no, he won't back down or go running back home
He's come a long way in life
He's got a long way to go
And he don't even know, but he don't care because
He's growing up the hard way
In and out of trouble every day
He's growing up the hard way
No tellin' where you'll end up, boy
He's got nothing to say, like he's lost for words, his mind's in a daze
That's his way, it's just a little game he plays
He's got nowhere to run, while the city sleeps he wanders alone
Cuttin' through the steel and the hearts of stone
He's come a long way in life
He's got a long way to go
He don't even know, but he don't care because
He's growing up the hard way

And I'm ready for the rain to fall
I'm ready, ready for the rain
I've got to rise above it all
And get ready for the rain to fall

Did you ever know someone, who had lost their way
Built their own little kingdom, and just blew it all away
I'm not ashamed to admit it, that someone was me
I'm gonna look to the future now, 'cause I've set myself free
And I've seen the lightnin'
I'm gonna set myself free, while I've still got time

Get ready for the rain to fall
'cause I've heard the thunder
And I'm ready for the rain to fall
I'm ready, ready for the rain
I've got to rise above it all
And get ready for the rain to fall, while I've still got time....

We let our hearts move on
So many dreams we thought would last forever
Today it doesn't matter
All those dreams are gone, they are gone, oooh
Tell me how it feels again
Oh, show me that it's real and then

I'll walk away, from my own reflection
The stranger that I knew
The stranger that was you
And now I face a cold return to sender
A truce but no surrender
A voice that won't ring true, where are you? Oooh

I reach over the edge
And throw a penny in the wishing well
It's so deep that I can tell

That in the real world
There's fewer stars in the sky
And in the real world
You can get hear children cry at night
This is the real world

There is no time, for a life of solitude
Only hunger and survival
In the world we were born into, we're alone, oooh

And it brings me to my knees
Our father lay me down to sleep
Father please
Pray the lord my soul to keep

Keep us in the real world
Keep us in the real world
Don't have to tell you
In the real world
They'll damn you if you try
In the real world
Let it begin with you and I

I got four hundred horses tucked under the hood
But there's no need to panic, it's under control
We're aerodynamic and ready to roll

Rev on the red line

Runnin' all night on lake avenue
It's a piece of cake
If you know what to do
You've got to lose a few
'til the stakes get high
When the odds are right
You just blow by

And make no mistake, there's women who just wait
For the man and machine with the best time

Rev on the red line
You're on your own
Feels like a lifetime
But soon you'll know

Wasn't long ago I could've lost my wheels
Had to outrun the law, it was no big deal
I guess they had a grudge, they were hot on my tracks
I had to pay off the judge to get my license back
Now I need to pin those needles, got to feel that heat
Hear my motor screamin' while I'm tearin' up the street

Somehow he knew he'd never be a part
So alone with his pain

And the hurt inside, he's gotta face it all on his own
And the church bells ring, and the lord is praised
But they ain't got time for jimmy, on their holy, holy days

Sinking deep alone

Lets go another round
I will follow you down and

We could just lay around
Stare at the ceiling
Want to forget about
One for the feeling

Room for photographs
Box full of letters
Come on make it last
Nothing else matters right now

You still think that it was so easy

Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're crying you're crying now

Way down the street there's a lad in his place
He opens the door
And he's got that look on his face
And he asks you were you've been
You ell him who you've seen
And you talk about anyting

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quite little town
And forget about everything

But you knwo he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving

To the places you will be from

You just might wear your welcome out if you don't let it go.

There's nothing that you couldn't say
Cause you said it all before
Think it's time you walk this lonely road all on your own

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like you're bleeding heart
Has already won

Wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head like no one else

Looking for someone to blame
Blame me all along
You'll take the heat, but you would never take the fall

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like you're bleeding heart
Has already won

You're so afraid
That you are the only one
That you are the only one
You know

Don't be afraid
Cause your not the only one
You're not the only one

Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see, no looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black
Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore

Desperate and meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done

I lay there in the dark, and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

Still I try to find my way
Spinning hours into days
Burning like a flame behind my eyes
Drown in out, drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner, a slave to the disguise
Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering

Knew that it was time to say goodbye

I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
No reason left me to survive
You saved me the day you came alive

Come Alive [x33]

I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

Come Alive [x15]

Nothing more to give
I can finally live
Come alive

Your life into me
I can finally breathe
Come alive

And opened my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

Revolving on and on
A world that never stops

Is it all mine?
How could I know?

Swallowed all the core

Tried levitation
You're not alone
The stars are holding open
A door we'll never close

I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful
The world will never know
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow

Is it all mine?
I can't let go
What little time we spent
A penny on the floor

My desparation
Is this a curse?

Or will take te first ear that comes into contact with your blade

Will you call them freaks?

Will you run and tell the papers
How she picked you from a line up in downtown philadelphia
With a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and henry miller in your back pocket

If the mother goes to bed with you
In the bowels of the cathedral
Will you render her asunder with what she really needs
Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about
Finding yourself in you mother's arms

Will you call her a freak
Will you call them freaks
Or will you call them gods
Will you call them freaks

You know you sperm is weak
You never looked, so high
To ever find her so low
You did not have to go, that far
To show her you were holy

Now you know they're gonna come for you

Busy counting shadows on the wall

Roses in the whiskey jar
Blood on the thorns

To the sound of candles burning out
Heavy from writing your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes
Blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone

Braggin that you know
How the brothers feel cold

You suck like a leach
You want everyone to act like you
Kiss ass while you bitch
So you can get rich
But your boss gets richer off you

Well you'll work harder
With a gun in your back
For a bowl of rice a day
Slave for soldiers
Till you starve
Then your head is skewered on a stake

Now you can go where people are one
Now you can go where they get things done
What you need, my son
What you need, my son

Where people dress in black

Hear me screamin'

Echoing a thousand miles

Mine is yours and yours is mine
There is no divide
In your honor
I would die tonight

Mine is yours and yours is mine
I will sacrifice
In your honor
I would die tonight
For you to feel alive

Can you feel me
Feel me breathing
One last breathe before I close my eyes
This suffering
For receiving
Deliver me into the other side

Mine is yours and yours is mine
There is no divide

He oped up his sky
The rivers ran with blood
The deserts name was love

Said who can not be saved
Soul of a man is much depraved
Don't act as if you are his clone
Made of iron and of stone

Justice swept the land
To raise the mortal made
And when he overcome
The war has just begun

As the darkness spreads across his land
Soul of man who stays his hand
Forms the basis of his home
Made of iron and of stone

When it came the time
To confess his crime
The people stood and stared
And didn't even care

And the morning had died
The millions knew that there was no lie
Temple was built and the worshiping showed
Made of iron and of stone"

And we were staying at this guy
Toss's house
Good friend of ours
Uhh
Its kinda in the middle of the city
We were just finished with our
Second European tour
And everything was going pretty good
Skeeter, he met this girl that lived
Next door to Toss's
And within a couple of weeks he started
Living with her, you know?
And I guess she had a lot of money or something
Cause she was constantly buying him clothes
And getting him lots of stuff and loading him
With money, you know?
He was constantly going to the coffee shop
Always getting the best herb and the best
Hash, you know?
He was in good shape
She was really good looking, she was
Really cool
I, I don't think he'd ever met her before
But she had, you know, other boyfriends I suppose
So I'm sitting on the couch, you know, in
Toss's apartment
And I'm reading, you know, maximum rock and
Roll or flip side
One of those punk things
And I heard Skeeter come in
And he came in and he had all these really
Nice clothes on
She bought him all this stuff
She like bought him cologne
He was really really smelling good, you know
He looked good too
You know he came in and put his herb
On the table and, whatever
I'm just reading my little punk magazine
Not really paying attention
And then he says, uh, he says hey dave
And I look up
And he's standing there with his dick
In his hand
And he's kinda got it like lifted up so
He's looking at the head of his dick
He kinda pointed it at me
I didn't know what to think
He said does that look like pus to you
I said no I think it's lint"

Foo Fighters,Kiss The Bottle,/f/foo+fighters/kiss+the+bottle_20501592.html,"It gets loneliest at night.
Down at the liquor store.
Beneath the neon sky.
Our moonlight.
Six A.M., the floor comes alive with lice.
The pan's dried up so tight.
With hardened beans.
We're hungry.
So I lean on you sometimes.
Just to see you're still there.
Your feet can't take the weight of one.
Much less two.
We hit concrete.

How were we born into this mess?
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby.
But we were run out on a rail.
Fell from the wagon to the night train.

I kissed the bottle.
I should've been kissing you.
You wake up to an empty night.
With tears for two.

Cigarettes they fill the gaps.
In our empty days.
In our broken teeth.
We're jonesing.
Say mister, can you spare a dime?
Some change could make a change.
Could buy some time.
Some freedom.
Or an ear to hear my story.
It's all I've got. My fiction
Beats the hell out of my truth.
A palm upturned burnt blue.
Don't call it sunburn.

You've been shaking on the job.
Just one drink ahead of your past.
There's a white light coming up.
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass.

I kissed the bottle.
I should've been kissing you.
You wake up to an empty night.
With tears for two.

I kissed the bottle.
I should've been kissing you.

No king or queen of any state

Open the streets and raise the gates

Begging for sweet relief, a blessing in disguise

Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losing sleep
Please come to me
Tonight

Hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away

Everything that we've survived
It's gonna be alright
Just lucky we're alive
Got no vision I've been blind
Searching everywhere you're right here in my sights

Away"

Wouldn't take back one thing

Coming down on you
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon

Waiting all your life your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right out of you

Miss the misery 
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again

Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Getting this?

What a nice long leash, what a nice tight noose
Never worked for me but sure would look good on you
Been waiting all your life your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right out of you

Miss the misery need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again

Don't change our mind
Your wasting light
Getting this?

Miss the misery give me a reason for a change
Miss the misery give me a reason to refrain

Miss your misery today
Miss your misery today
C'mon and turn it on again

It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten, One in ten, One in ten

Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure wind up snapping in the end

One in ten, One in ten, One in ten

Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit
Into my head I still remember every single word
You said and all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me since I was
Always caged and now I'm free

Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)

There's some things I should get them done,
Tried inhaling some white out,
Ended up with some bleeding gums.

Anything I left in the closet,
Shouldn't have a hard time getting out,
If I had the time I could make it,
Seems to be the chances are chasing,

All the substance I've done without,
And all the luck that I've hated,
Aside from all of the petty doubt,
Can't believe I have made it.

I'm afraid of the dark now,
It's the sign of a patsy,
Round the time of the door brow,
We should let it come in,

Never put your face in the water,
It hurts your eyes when they open up,
Not that any different could matter,
It's just a different conspirit.

If there's one thing I could laugh about,
Solve this mess I've created,
I've tried a part of the sacred cow,

Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you

If there's one thing I could laugh about,
Solve this mess I've created,

Rock out, feeling good.
Break your heart. Shake your blood.

Out upon the stage, crowd is going wild,
Love to see them women, babe
I ain't in denial.
Make you crazy too.
Make you show it out.
Feeling good, get some wood
You should, You knew you could

Rock out, do it now
My, my, my, show me how
Rock out, make it good.
Break your heart. Shake your blood

Want to be a winner, want to be the man.
Want to make yourself insane, join up with the band
Want to fall in love, want to make your mark
Want to get out in the storm, want to break a thousand hearts

Rock out, strike it rich
My, my, my, it's a bitch
Rock out, I knew you could
Break your heart. Shake your blood

Rock out, don't you stop

So out of key

Broken on a ship of fools
Even dreams must fall to rules

And burned into the dark

There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go

And I heard everything
Now here I go

Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

Come from what's come before
So here I go

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You had no choice you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing

Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
A-through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, mmm, yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight?

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, Lord knows he was

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowing
Lookin' to see how much we've grown

And the only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, oh, yes he was
He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man
I guessed he was the son of a preacher man
Sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man

A sliver of hope, no diamond rings
We got high, it was heaven it was hell
Flying over them, with broken wings

Monuments of life

Sitting on the tracks
Hear the train come roaring in
Never coming back

Laying quiet in the grass
Everything is still

Scattered on the hill

Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun

Come on over brave my storm
Oceans overhead
Come inside my friend
Getting bad out there

Every moment we have stolen
All we have to share

No one wanted them
But you know I did
You know I did

And my head is going numb

Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole... Defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending

What if I say I will never surrender?

We're temporary, temporary

You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that will take you down
Bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

March with friends that's you today

I walked away

Talk about the time we spent
Picking arms up from the sand
Sure to never never land
In the middle of my story
Fuel the bed to keep you warm
Lie around and beat my head
Feed the cactus, i'm instead

Set me free again

To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowing to survive
The first to climb another state of mind

I never wanna die

I want a song that's indelible
Like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up

Will I be happy on the back of the shelf
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell
Spare me your questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize that I get shy and I choke up

I want a song that's indelible
Like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

Farewell my sweet paramania
Farewell my sweet paramania

My only promise is that I'll never tell
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet take the beating until
I take it all back anyway what was I supposed to say?

I want a song that's indelible
Like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up"

Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Hold in wonder, spoke and wheel

Daddy loves little son, no demand

I? Must be on my way I've had enough of you
Was a young man, proud and true
Just a simple boy with nothing left to lose

Years that I've wasted
These I. O. U. 's

[Verse 2]
They're just fucking words
This is life or death
It's time to clear the air
You better save your breath
Say have you heard
Say have you heard
The poison in my heart
And voices in my head?

Years that I've wasted
These I. O. U. 's

I meant every word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward

I meant every word

Carry on into the sun, into the sun

On into the sun
On into the sun

Looking down at you
Sleeping from above, I love
Looking down at you
Weeping from above, I love

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns

And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

When all is dead and gone
In the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these dying arms, see them
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

I’m not the only one
I’m not the only one

Heaven skies are reeling
And the hand that holds the world
Deep inside I'm reaching
Into the universe

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns

And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh

Nevermind these things at all
It's nothing

Couldn't find a way to you
Seems that's all I ever do
Turning up in black and blue
Rewarded

All the static we all left
Wait until the time has come
Figure that's where time comes from
Leaving all my senses numb
Is heaven

Lifted up the fay to seen
Anything could never be
Anything but play to me
In order

Take it back for them to keep
Fallen into something deep
Not that I had made that leap
Annointed

Where have all the wishes gone
Now that all of that is done
Wish I would've felt I've won

On them streets
You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats
Real talk..

[Verse 1]
They ain't walkin' the walk, they just talkin' the talk
Some people look at me as the real talk of New York
I ain't these like these niggaz who be feinin' to front
Like they the first to ever put green in a blunt
Look I don't be meaning to stunt, but I zip down like jeans in the front
In somethin' that you seen and you want
But otherwise I'm cool wit' it
They say only the ones who never had gon' get and act a fool wit' it
Everybodys' gangsta through the promotion
Even if they raised in a house wit' a view of the ocean
The bangers is growin' upset
'cause' ya' ass is on t.v. throwin' up sets
And you know you ain't like that
But you'll say that you is
Go and rent a bunch a shit and and then say that it's his
You ain't a pimp or you wouldn't go to dinner wit' groupies
Ain't a baller 'cause' you wouldn't put spinners on hoopties

[Hook 2X]
1-2-3; you don't really wanna fuck wit me
Get in the way you could get yourself shot
Fuck the cops, you on my block
Fuckin' wit a gangsta nigga

[Verse 2]
How can niggaz say they be on the other side of the seas'
Where the steering wheels are on the other side of the v's
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the c's
When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's
I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light
Every sentence you write is far from the truth
You wanna be that nigga you are in the booth
But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof
And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill
But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal
You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked
When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you
Ya' hood sayin' don't come back
Step foot in here, and they gon' put you where you won't come back
Dog, how the fuck you gon' have keys in ya' house
When ya' moms' won't even give you keys to the house loser

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga you in the mirror, checkin' what your make ups' lookin' like
Tryina fool the world wit' a Jacob look-a-like
Jiving like you hold stacks
But ya' car is ten years old homie, ya' drivin' in a throwback
They gon' strip you, have you runnin' naked next
Without security you like unprotected sex
You ain't never gon' finger a trigger
All you do is look in the mugshot book and finger a nigga
I real recognize real, you'd be a john doe
You livin' in a closet and call it a condo
I don't member you as a slinger that was on the bench
Just a little scrub ass ringer in the tournaments
Now they try to blame the fall of hip hop on fans
Nah, I think it's these hip hop con mans
Studio gangstas is played out now
This ain't the eighties, battle raps'll get you layed out
Fucka

You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats

Triple gold these four tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out I'm flyer than the whip

We take your ice cream and turn you into sherbert
I got flow I'm like ""Sure"" but, if it's about dough I'm like ""Sure 'nuff""
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. You niggaz bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wirst moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires little package is gone
Might I spend a good deal with these Firestones
I spit like Myer's bones, born in chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got summers
I got vicadens, valiums I ain't stopping
Got pot and heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping
Yeah skip when you hear that click
Cash money nigga I'm that shit
I leave the begging ungh!

[Cassidy]
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggaz and let them know why they ain't fuckin with you

[Fabolous]
Your goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggaz must've got a deal for your health
Your cd is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin cigs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And twenty dime bitches, to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
The boy's got at least six digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like ten bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggaz in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting I'm fine
I'mma have these dick sucking niggaz deep-throating the nine
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' off the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til they family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'mma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations

[Cassidy]
Yeah it is what it is, my niggaz just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket
I'm tryin not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
I work hard in the game, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all
And even overseas they accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars work success, it's my destiny y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
I got broads craving begging to have s** with me y'all
Screaming, ""Cash you don't know how sexy you are!""
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying ""What's up""
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spaying shit up
Prraat prraat. I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends can envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggaz will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die, but I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, guac-a-moola
I pop the ruger, send that hot shit through ya!
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggaz out here are playing fair
So before the odds are even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga I'm that shit, bitch!"

If low fish get afraid of sharks I’m trying to see how that shark taste,
Ask them with that shark face, I’m trying to fill my park space.
I’m trying to be on my dog shades on the park key in the park lays
I’m trying to get my money long, long as Easton parkway.
Me and my niggers got reservations, no way, no hesitations,
Non stop to the money, that’s my final destination.

Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin

Goin to war is still a scary issue
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol
Like they military issue
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two
Catch a gun case and bounce and still they'll barely frisk you
Cuz, I proved I move the retail
Make the smoothest grooves wit female
And I remove the rules on V12's
You aint never seen it move this smooth on sprewell's
I'm a hustler, you just a middle man to me
The way I pass the rock could make Jason Kidd a fan of me
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin
Still I'll have you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin
So watch what you say to them crackers
Ill put a couple G's on yer head like you play for the Packers
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics
You got some sticky weed? Pass it
If not put it out, I'm pushin it before they put it out
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal footed out
Blastin a [?] get it first, before they put it out, Clue!

Yea, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain a-
Get metal in ya mouth like braces and retainers
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change
Tryin a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain
Have her suckin long enough to leave a nigga body drained
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin stupid people
That'll run up shootin, in front of a group of people
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you
Ride up on yer coupe and creep you while you let a groupie deep you
Cuz even if you reppin like a man of skill
You gon' still need a weapon when you layin a deal
One for watch you slippin like you steppin banana pills
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon cuz you scanned a mil? (what)
I crept in and got handed meals
Now the white and black rides look like salt and pepper on the bannon grill
Think I wouldn't hold a Pepsi in my hand for mils?

Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you go~!

Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'ma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though

So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

If I'ma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us

And why would I, and why should I
When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
My..(baby..baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-B does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)

After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track

Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

But you're so amazing

Say you'll be my baby

My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller

[Jermaine Dupri]
Now tell me were you in the joint
The night mj scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
Didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

[Fundisha]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball

Fabolous,"Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley (Remix)",/f/fabolous/beamer+benz+or+bentley+remix_20878593.html,"Ft Lloyd Banks And Juelz Santana

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - my jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - your scheming don't affect me

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew
Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley; Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beat it - I bet she let me; she been fiending since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially when I'm throwing on my Gretzky
Got my S-S-Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti or Pirelli, make a movie out the ghettie
Wear my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while I'm stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, when my pencil move it's deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl out a lezzie
Magazine, Mac, Desi, keep my windows like the Prezzie
Press a button and I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200-something and my trunk do wonders bumping
I am not the one for chumping, I will ratchet out and slump him
Dump him (dump him) he better off dead, your money red

[Interlude: Juelz Santana, Lloyd Banks]
[Juelz Santana:] I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high (always high)
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
[Lloyd Banks:] I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley I be moving, I be moving
Making movies, Tom Cruising, if it's action then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, neck studded, boy my nickname should be Ruben
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it so we about to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar, I call her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boosting, got a white girl that be boothing
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she's stupid
And she always ready to give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, ordered bottles, see them sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch looking like the 4th of July
But if you pussies get to fronting and the pushing lead to shoving
We just busting and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louis then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me

[Hook:]

[Interlude:]
[Fabolous:] I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
In that black-on-black thing whenever I ride by
[Lloyd Banks:] I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand-new
I don't handcuff, you can bring the whole damn crew

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Kima's friends with Wendy
And both of these bitches want my penis, evidently
My jeans are never empty - it seems, coincidentally
They say that time is money, so my team be spending centuries
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - life's full of decisions
If hating was a crime, you would do life up in a prison
The spiteful competition knows that they wouldn't have a shot at eating
Even if they had a rifle in they kitchen
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - Banks, 'elz, or Loso
We be paper touching - bank teller flows, ho
Yeah, we smoke a lot of kush, drink hella rose Mo'
Y'all got a disease called ""Can't tell the ho's no""
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley - we black all of 'em
And we hold heat like a motherfucking oven
My homies, I love em: it's family over everything
And fuck anything that ever try to get above em
Niceeee...

Fabolous,Beauty,/f/fabolous/beauty_21052081.html,"Beauty’s when you just got out the shower,
Hair still dripping, wrapped up in a towel,
Beauty’s when you’re ready in a hour,
Them long legs, I call them the twin towers.
You put that arch in it, put your hand on your hip,
Put your hand up on and you handle the shit.
Beauty’s when a scrub compliment stash,
You know your booty look good with your confident ass.
Straight up but the rest world,
You know it’s beauty when the smile it’s the best curve.
That’s real beauty, no make up shit,
The girl you dream about and wanna wake up with.
Waiting time, looking at it and throw that at me,
Going out on me, then you look about me.
Ah, man, that shit right there, probably get your next nightmares.

Beauty is knowing nobody real as you,
Truly condolences for that bad shoes,
Killing the scene, this type of loving made me complete.
Now roll the weed and get the munchies, she be in cuisine.
I’m in the jeans and stealing tune with the inner being,
Her inner thoughts, her worst fears she give to me.
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest, ‘cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet.
For she had the stupid deed, speed up before I put up and s** is a weapon
Beauty don’t need a bullet, beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her.
May you be thinking about God, maybe at grandma as angels.
‘cause God give her, never complicated,
A lot of niggers talking, I don’t have the heart to say it.
How to tell you I see potential in how you do it.
I pray you know you’re worth from niggers don’t notice your beauty, truly"

[Fabolous]
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

[Verse One: Fabolous]
Ma you better off coming with a Anna Nicole plan, tryna get ya hand on a old man
Maybe he's plannin' to romance, hand you a gold band and spend a couple grand on a po dance
... When it comes to splurgin chips, I'm tighter than virgin lips
If there's some who like to trick, who like a chick
And +come out the pocket like Michael Vick+
Or some who want a patient man
.... Or go with a payment plan
... Wanna go to department stores
Then they want the keys to your apartment door
Nowadays a girl'll come with a price tag
And give it up for nice shoes and a nice bag
+they must have bumped their head, give them an ice bag+
And I aint thirst, but show em.....

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Now a chick who gold dig, look for a nigga who roll big
Rather than a nigga who hold gigs
Unless you bring her what you bringin home
Keep her finger with the bling and chrome
She try ta cling on everything you own
Even singin on them ringin tones
I rather be single and swing alone
+before you do me like ginger did sam+
+they catch you if they can like the ginger bread man+
But I know it's all about the benjamins mam
And maybe another man responds to you
At the most I could get you in the???
Cause I'm not interested in buyin a chick
But you can call me about tryin ta dick
1-800-Git-Sum....
.......
....

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

Girl, that was a one night fling
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me knowing how quick that this young'n be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jumatries
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made (ooh)
During the escapade (ooh)
In the back of the escalade (whoa)
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve (uh huh)
But shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breath (shit)
I usually don't get to rag um (uh)
But it's so real, I made the caddy chauffer hop out and get the magnums (uhhhh)
We getting close the park of meridian (uh huh)
She pulling her skirt down (uh huh)
And tucking her titties in (uh huh)
I'm walking this biddy in (uh huh)
Caressing her pretty skin
She say- ""i love the video that you n pd in"" (yeah right)

In the pent house blasting mob deep and some bobby brown (uh huh)
Do not disturb sign prolly woulda not be found (yeah)
If there's one thing I'm giving her, it gotta be back shots (uh)
She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot (ahhh) (uh)
At the same time she jerking and wiggling (uh huh)
Smirking and giggling (ha ha ha)

The way she working and fingering
She must have be a gymnast
'cause the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments
Ma I know you got centerfold measurement features (uh huh)
But after a night, it was a pleasure to meet ya (uh huh)
Get ya under and outta where (uh)

Lyrics:

[Chorus:]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, days I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid down, To my niggas lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me

[Fabolous]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some diffrent shit
'cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a wif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the 4-4 longs for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up

[Chorus:]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, days I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid Down, To my niggas lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me

[Fabolous]
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with a lot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
And knowin black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up

[Chorus:]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, days I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid down, to my niggas lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me

[Fabolous]
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may wanna blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few peers
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
He started going on about how he moving on a route
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
And it's fucked up

[Chorus - 2X]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, days I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid down, to my niggas lay down

And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
Shes my pinch hitta
When the startin lineup ain't playin right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm passin ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wonderin why I keep comin home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

To protect you, I'll get out and c*** it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your new allen springer
At first you were somethin I denied
Something I would slide
Just do somethin in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without somethin on the side

Uh oh, I might be leavin the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback

If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely

And we ain't gotta worry 'bout where we stand
But you crossed the man, you forced my hand
And changin who I am ain't part of my plan
Cause I will not change up.. Change up.. Nooooooo
Said I will not change up.. Change up.. Nooooooo

Now I don't know if I should hug him or slug him now
And I don't know if I should cap him or dap him now
But I know that it's feelin funny now
Maybe it's cause I'm gettin this money now
You see things ain't the same
I said things ain't the same (nah)
No, things ain't the same (nah)
And I know I ain't changed

[Fabolous]
Yo, I make the money, but don't let it make me
So even if I go broke nigga you couldn't break me
Watch how long it take me to jump back on my feet
Peep, quick is when the barrels jump back on the heat
Y'all don't wanna see me jump back in the street
So be happy that I rock them slumped back in the seats
Being broke is a joke, I never found it funny
That's why I count my blessings as much as I count my money

[Chorus 1]

Some niggaz change when they get change, funny when they get money
Switch when they get rich, strayed when they got paid
Ha~! But I stresses you to holla
Cause they never made bullet proof vest-es out of dollars
We never change, this is us every day
I call them boys up, they gon' bust every 'k
They ride high like them cust' Chevrolets
Like O-Wax for Kaine, lookin for his cousin killers
I got a dozen peelers for niggaz who doesn't feel us
I changed for a reason but homey it wasn't scrilla
They can't say that nuttin changed but my clothes
Oh, I'm lyin, I do change up my hoes
I pitch game you should see the change-up I throws
And gotta get 'em a ring to get 'em to swing
I'm a team player, if I win then we won
And they gon' put us all in the Hall of Fame when we done

Money can't buy happiness but it's a damn good down payment
I don't talk much, feel like I'm around agents

Get money and disappear, try to pull a Chappelle

Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm??
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

[Chorus:]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

[Verse 2:]
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speakin' the known truth
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelite,
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler
One million customers, and I still bust at ya

[Chorus:]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

[Verse 3:]
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few?? And met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

[Chorus:]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you
Niggas that's fuckin' with you
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like
Now they on my dick right? Haha... Shit is crazy
Don't let this game change you nigga..."

You gotta fuck be Monday, cool?
Or she gotta stroke a stick like the hun play pool
If not you gotta walk like a runway fool
Catch me in the moon shine or the sun ray jewels
If you keep sayin your prayers maybe one day you'll..
.. Be blessed like me 'til then keep stompin in your Air Force O-N-E-S Nikes

I'm the young Bishop Don Juan that stripped ya for your hoes
So if I throw a dollar at ya scream Hallelujah

Nice pimps, mean pimps

I feel like the angel of God
All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
This verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like it's against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a theif
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'k
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me

Soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen

But the rest.. The rest of ya'll.. Don't think I don't know

They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change (They hate change)
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
Cuz they think it's her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business (Amen)

Like a hunnid missed calls in my number log
I talk to God 'fore I talk to people from them blogs
Gotta see through it when it's thick as London fog
I'm from the city baby, I done grew up under smog
Not to bring up old shit, I'm not a plunger, dawg
No dalmatian but I come through with a hunnid, dawg
And they don't bark, they bite
Let it spark, they might
Gotta walk straight, right?
Turn the dark to daylight
Let 'em talk, they right
In your heart, stay light
Play your part, stay tight
Bosses park where they like
Don't you let them trick you out your spot and put that guy on
Rather cut 'em off and let a bygone be a bygone
When you ballin', you that nigga that they got they eye on
So I think I know just how it feel to be a Zion
Bussin' out sneakers, swingin' on rims
Being number 1, bringing on M's
Hope the Knicks get him, I'ma bring him Timb's
Tell 'em lace his boots, I'ma give a king some gems
Like look, you the great hope and a scapegoat
You gon' have to make quotes and take notes
And some can't take smoke so they may choke
But those who learn to make boats, stay afloat

Kinda Legs hat the models be seen with strugglin
Some pretty brown eyes and I seen them cuttin
In my direction, but I mean it's nuthin
If you have another man, or have other plans
Other than, cruisin the city with this brother man
On the other hand, if you wanna get your feet rest
I take you where you goin I just need a steet adress
That got her to blush,
I told her if she not in a rush, I know this lil spot on the hush
She's like a pop up, mixed with a hot club
You can pop up and it even got grub
I ride the top dubs, that do not rub
That usually get my top scrubbed in the hot tub
But Esther, kept makin these gestures
That niggas like me don't even impress her
So I became the aggressor, started to press her
She worked for some investor who startin to stress her
Go to school but this her last semester
She even get harrassed by her college professor
She just want a nigga that'll love her right
Said she passed on the spot like ""maybe another night""
But: she aint in no hurry to had home
From there I was in her ear, just like headphones
So I inquired, what she desired
I started askin questions, like I was wired
And I could see, that she openin up to it
It's late but I have a ate, hopin she up to it
She like ""no I had dinner already"",
""but if it's sauce at your crib I make a mean spaghetti""
Now I'm on the highway like Andre
Within a couple minutes we was back at the rest
I told her make herself at home, don't act like a guest
She said ""I know guys like you be attracting the best""
""But you don't even know me, bet not try shit""
Talkin with that attitude, rollin her eye shit
""You tryin to seduce me with all this fly shit
But it aint that easy to get up in my shit
Look, let it go course
I will use no force
Oh yeah, I forgot, I aint got no sauce
""See, you aint care about gettin the food
You was more about bringin me here, gettin me nude
I said ""hold up babygirl, you gettin it screwed
That might have been on my mind but I didn't be rude
She said ""I can respect that, but I don't expect that
Looked like you was tryin somthin so I had to check that""
I told her ""Don't trip though, we can move lighter than a tiptoe
And sippin on this hennessy and hypno
She started giggelin, Now I'm figurin,
I stay on my cool shit she might let a nigga in
I throw some more Jigga and Notorious Biggie in
A lot of ass wiggelin, tetas gigglin
Then she jumped on me and reached through my monkeys
I started kissin on her neck, grabbin her donkey
It's bout to get funky, I'm tuggin on her zipper
She jumped up and got undressed quicker than a stripper
I aint rushed, I played with it like 20 minutes
Had my hand all up her like I left money in it
Had one of the fattest asses I seen
And was throwin it at me after them glasses of green
I layed back in the passenger lean
I'm fastin my jeans, she hit the pipe just as fast as a fiend
Then she hopped on your boy quick
Went up, down, round and round, all on the joystick
The girl screamin like she's in labour
Hittin Mariah Noise that'll wake up the neighbors
So now I'm ready to introduce her to the backshots
The Yac got me in and out her like the crackspot
I'm hittin that exact spot with the smackshots
I don't know where she yellin like she hit the jackpot
To make the long story short I couldn't control her ass
She came first I came last, rolled the grass
As I break the cush, I ask her for a math
She got up, grabbed her jeans bust them to her lap
Said ""you probably try every girl that'll cross your path
I said ""you trippin again, take a sipp of the henn""
Then this lil breezy came across greasy
""F-A-Beezy, you so easy!""
Matta fact sleezy, your game so cheesy
But a bitch can't lie, the dick is off the heezy
Truthfully you pass through my block like every day
Same time, same coupe, I be on the same stoop
Watchin, knowin that I could have you If I wanted
You see me, there's no doubt Ima be confronted

Hopin to try, to get me her open my thighs

Damn-it's the wife beater wish you were in the droptop cruisin hoes like
Damn-I can't blame em' if he wasn't mine shit I would try and claim him, 'cause he's so fly and I'm so fly and you'll fool
Yaself if you try to deny him

[Fabolous]
I'm nothin like them other brothers
I got no choice but to s*** her
'cause I'm in a 10-6 with the vase up that look somethin like a nutta butta dutta dutta
Mami you'll be in saint tropez
Ridin jet skis and mopeds
Powderin like dope heads
Paparazzi snappin pictures they must thin you J. Lopez (Biatch!!!)
(ha-ha) lets roast some spinach
Find a club and just post up in it
What you mean are we there yet, I got lear jets that get to the westcoast in minutes
(ha-ha) I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge
With white vanilla studs
'cause if they witnessed how I'm killin em out here these just might go tell the judge (i rest my case)
[chorus repeat]

[Fabolous]
You could be prancin thru ghettos
In a pair of fendi's or pants and stillettos
All you gotta do is swallow some kids like that witch did in Hansel and Gretel
Whos as hansome as ghetto
This mans earings look transparent
And my mtchell and s throwbacks be so old they could be somebodys grandparents
I want the type of money athletes consume
I have to assume
I'm no fool, but I'm so cool, when I walk in feels like there's a draft in the room
(oooh) I'm so sick I drive em reverse fast
Call me a nurse fast
Shorty just lay back in the made back it'll make you feel like you sittin in first class
(Relax)
[chorus repeat]

[Fabolous]
They ask for it
So I put tv's in the headrest and the dashboard
And you gotta catch it on tape 'cause when the truck stops rims still look like they on fast forward
I'm sippin liquor the color of smurf's skin
As long as the earth spins
And you'll get sea sick, 'cause my waves be thick enough for them cali dudes to surf in
(cowabunga) ya low ridin denims
Look like midgets is hidin in em
They say I like it from the front I like it from the front but oly when the kid is slidin in em
The biggest dikes be
Switchin for dudes with figures like me
And um I'm not braggin, but just imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga like me

Tough times don't last but tough people do
I father n-ggas the way wayne and puff reproduce
Lil rap bastards
Running round with your snapback caps backwards
Should be in rap caskets
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting
And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams (swish)
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones
I feel like n-ggas done found one of my old phones
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe
If you can't be yourself, then who you gonna be?
Dad to your swag, your style was like a son to me
Your stylist got thank yous, you never sent one to me
Lets pray for 'em
Y'all repeat this one with me
""now I lay me down to sleep, I pray for those who run with me
If I die before I wake, arrest the girl I brung with me
I give the Lord my swag to take whenever God is done with me""

It's painful when bestfriends become ya enemies
And you finding out that they not who they pretend to be (wow)
The whole time you conspired to put an end to me
And I'm still trying to show this n-gga love, silly me
So I might she'd tears as I put on my gloves
But I won't show emotions when I fill him with slugs
Cause n-ggas die everyday here
And you can get hit picking ya seed up from daycare
N-ggas don't play fair
That's why I'm straightforward, f-ck being all discrete
If I can knock 'em off quick, f-ck beefing all for weeks
So we was up late night hunting, y'all was sleep
Cause we the wolves hiding in clothes, y'all the sheep
Who taught ya the game, who showed y'all the streets?
And who bought 'em them things they sold y'all for cheap?
And who came up the bill when them hoes called police?
Now you fronting so I gotta expose y'all to see
Ungrateful motherf-cker, who fed you when you was hurting? (me)
Whenever drama came up, who was putting the work in? (me)
I was spitting live on hot 9
You was still rehearsing
Already my son and this was before I met you in person
So no matter how many colorful fake chains you purchase
Like that bullshit you wearing
You're always gonna b worthless
You just spit it, I lived it

Yo, You think they like me now, wait until the light hit me,
I bet the house somebody girl spend the night with me,
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters,
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators,
They ain't got one problem with this,
Square face watch look like Sponge Bob on the wrist,
One white, one gold, one nice, untold,
You can look but don't touch, Guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on,
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin's long,
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin on,
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on,
Get em close and, lookin' like a scooped up-

I play them diamonds well when I got dat jewelery on,
And she called the Carrot Jeter maybe Canary Bonds

My necklace is a crime,
Damn that bitch fine, what that girl name,
I call my jeweler up and tell em ""Make that girl a chain!""
I take that girl to Spain, she can't pronounce a thang
And she got her girlfriend on the side like fame,
The fetish is Lli Wayne, I'm bombin' like Hussein,
But I'm that fire, now swallow my Butane,
Residin' on a plane, the sky is my domain,

And tanktops, and sweet thoughts, from sun shades, and private airports,
And of course... (Watchu got boy), I got...

Fabolous,Diced Pineapples,/f/fabolous/diced+pineapples_21052080.html,"Shawty so cold, pussy want her fresh,
Reservations to eat and you’re my dinner guest.
Shawty cleaned up nice, never been a mess.
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flash.
But I ain’t try to hurt her, ‘cause I’ve always been the best,
I’m making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest.
Sex, sex and link, get a hundred when I test,
I’m a friend of a telling, so I’ve always been impressed.
Sex in the city on my black side sheets,
Wet as hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets.
Lid a few candles like my power hadn’t reached,
Then I took you places that her last nigger hadn’t reached.
Bitch so bad that her parents went through hell,
Smart mouth when we argue, you were switchy with the Yale.
I wanna touch her, not using my hands,
Make her dance without using the bands.

Call me crazy, should at least you call me,
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know is easy to get caught up in the morning
When you say ‘cause you’re mad and you take it all back.
Then we fuck all night till things get right.
Then we fuck all night till things get right.

The club popping but she ain’t trying go there,
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I’m the only one that get up in the VIP,
My money grown, baby, ain’t no need to see ID.
Slide a some just to come through, host money,
At least niggers know you’re getting through the most money.
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear,
But you’re overdressed if you’re wearing underwear.
I turn up, couple Js to burn up,
Couple spice to hide out, now let that playlist right out
Where I live on Sunday, her place Monday,
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy.
Pull it out like a pistol, yo, kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe.
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo,
Bad bitch good girl around the Christmas, though.

Call me crazy, should at least you call me,
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know is easy to get caught up in the morning
When you say ‘cause you’re mad and you take it all back.
Then we fuck all night till things get right.
Then we fuck all night till things get right.

Pussy sweeter as a fresh fruit,
She good and I drink the best juice.
I’m drinking till nothing left to,
And she playing with herself, too.
I be thinking about her all day,
She perform like it’s Broadway,
Yeah, it happen to rain, she on top of the brain,
Got the windows down, broad day.
Just look at her, spectacular,
The one in stove, flipping like a spatula,
Other niggers want her, but you see the niggers whack to her,
Side beats tripping ‘cause I’ll never get back to her.
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her,
She’s a trigger, I never seen her with a bad bitch.
Unless she’s meeting on these other bitches average,
Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic.
Miracle goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed.
Walk like she need her ass kissed.
Diced pineapples, super fine at you,
Is she getting ahead, she throwing a mine at you.
Fuck these other bitches, nigger, she don’t mind what you do.
I just wanna watch, I ain’t taking time at you, dudes.
Never faking, why they hella friend?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that’s what she ever wants.
Some bout to anchor me, shouldn’t never discipline,
Wondering on the balcony, we’re about to smoke another joint,
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock.
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you’re the shit,
Couple days with her, man, that’s all I ever get.
And she got a little sister, that’s what she ever with,
Game like a nigger, man, that’s what she ever speak.
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines.
Scars on my back, she left couple, spent a couple stacks, had her put a couple pair.
Try to beg mine, my nigger out of bootie,
Never retract statements, nigger, I’m never scared.
Niggers be switching up, but nigger, I’m never weird,
Back on another leer.
I leave niggers here, all in another year,
All in another lane, all in another gear.
All of you niggers lame, all of your niggers here,
Listen up, bitch niggers bitching up.
I guess you’re doing what you’re supposed to.
Let a real nigger hold you.
Back to my baby girl, though, I just need you in my world, yo.

Call me crazy, should at least you call me,
Feels better when you let it out, don’t it, boy?
Know is easy to get caught up in the morning
When you say ‘cause you’re mad and you take it all back.

Guess I'm doin the right thing like spikely
See they talk like they some ho's
I walk like I'm soppose
But if they get in the way they get stepped on
Its a hunnid-thou with the bling kept on
Dippin on my semmi-automatic wet balm
I aint playin no games, I aint sayin no names
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you
But it's two things that I'm gun admit to
That I wont stop, and I don't stop

It don't stop
And it wont stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it wont stop
It don't stop
And it wont stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it wont stop

[ verse 2 ]
I take whatever comes with the wealth and even humble myself
But I aint the kinda nigga, you can style on
I got a coope that I'm finna put some miles on
And I ride on these niggas with a smile on
See I'm bout stakin money but when they start actin funny I fall back
And all my mans do is laugh
I'm the kinda playa that aint gotta do a draft
Buncha hits, couple blacks, nigga do the math
But a nigga must be born for gettin his hustle on
So I had to come through and take the corner back
Hit em back with the rubberbands onna stack
Nigga quita take or what I gave onna pack
Girls still think I'm fly blow a kiss and wink ya eye
And tell me they wanna go somewhere and freak off
I tell em I would love to take a week off
But I don't stop, and I wont stop

[ chorus ]
It don't stop
And it wont stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it wont stop
It don't stop
And it wont stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it wont stop

[ verse 3 ]
I listen to niggas flippin my lines
And be grippen my nine
Like damn nigga sippen only spit game
Niggas commin at me tryna get names
Niggas lookin like me tryna get fame
See at first it didn't matta and I was a little flattered
But now these young boys gettin a lil too grown
Like I aint show em how to rock jewels two tones
But it wont stop, and it don't stop

[ chorus ]
It don't stop
And it wont stop
And it don't stop
It don't stop, it wont stop

Everywhere I go I'm hearing mufucka's
Tryna steal my flow
But it aint no thing cuhs see my nigga J. O put me up on the game when I step threw the door"

Damn ma
I love you like a lie
I get a rush from your touch, sort of like a high
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye
Kept it a hundred with you... what give you the right to lie?
We in two different spaces, and you done turned gemini
Completely changed faces
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places
You'll never find another me, face it! 

[Broadway]
My life ain't sweet
I don't know who told you that?
My shoes, might want to tiptoe in that
Walk slow with that
I'm the same, ain't changed
But the hate where home is at
Got me like damn, where my homies at?
Fuck it, it's just me
Can't hold me back
You just can't bite the hand that feeds you
Especially when the hand's illegal
I got you cold
Consider it a lesson learned
I'm guessing it was just my turn
To learn the hard way
You can't always trust the ones you love

[Hook]
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah ahhh probably not
You look so familiar too... 
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused

[Verse 2 - fabolous]
You got to take the good with the bad
Love what you got, remember what you had
Always forgive but never forget
Learn from mistakes, but never regret
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet
Ain't gotta act like our paths should had never met
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset
I got the least out of something I put the most into
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to
You remind me of somebody that I used to know
Me and that other you, weren't introduced before
And I don't like that bitch
We go from belly
I don't like that shit
Who's gonna fill your space
That's still a case
Ben franks the only familiar face
Get money

[Hook]
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah ahhh probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused
Cause that can't be love
You took advantage of a good thing
And that ain't a good thing
Take it how you want

[Verse 3]
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her
The nights she was goin through it
Crying on my shoulder
And did a 360 it's like she got colder
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her
But I'm a rider
She used to be my roller
I guess the general just lost his best soldier
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her
She mean to me more
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her

[Hook]
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah mmm ahhh probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused"

I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die, then live and duck
I gotta set it off, Jada Queen and Vivica
The last chick was scared to get that money, I can't live like her
Got no problem with you, niggas, get it how you live it, bro
It's a cold world, these mean streets will shiver you
All I asks is for the same respect that I be giving you
If not my boy will put the beats on you, Karen Civil you
That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia
My advice, don't mess with his man, word to Nivea
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia
That's when you would go uptown 'cause you had to re' there
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware
That was the 90's, y'all wouldn't get it, you had to be there
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it
It's hard to get off the ground, y'all think I just levitated
Y'all think it was all love and nobody ever hated
Y'all think 'cause I never stated I never been devastated
All y'all see is sun shining, think I was never shaded
Y'all think these calendar models is all that I ever dated
Nigga, nothing was the same, HOT 97 played it
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 played it
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated
You know why? 'Cause when you good the devil hate it
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted
Attention, I never paid it, me and this clever lady
She brains, do some things, then we lay together faded
And while I chill, loaded up a steel
Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will
But for real, nigga, good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will

Damned if you do them, if you don't, don't, don't, don't
They don't have a hand on your head of what you're doing now
You're damned if you do them, if you don't
People sit around and judge you anyway
Don't, don't, don't"

Tell em' you don't do the jives and shucks, and they route you to the shelf

So they need you to be sick with it, I'll content and delivery niggas
This nation thrives off misery niggas
So if you ain't trying to let your hard times increase your wealth
Niggas keep that progressive shit to yourself
This is the business of buying souls, and we only tryin' to fuck with those who trying to sell them
See, they may see me as an adversary cuz they know I'm tryin' to tell them
About the forest of artists who grow only to meet industry axes
How they take niggas dreams and write then off in their taxes
Contracts is confusing, but don't worry they'll appoint you a lawyer for you whore you
Loan you funds to fuck your soul make you pay it back and still maintain control of your stroll
Your tracks and your hot ass slow flow
They'll keep you looking good and all that, but no dough
You see when that get a bitch, they got a bitch
And contrary to popular opinion it ain't my sistas that switch
It's my brothers
We the dumb motherfuckers
Hardest niggas in the streets turned industry suckers
Cuz we refused to do the knowledge
Nigga, you can't learn this music game in the streets or in college
So you betta pick up a book or something
Or fuck it, fab will put it in a hook or something

But the difference now is only Deserts
If I talk it's gonna be reckless; I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised
They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused; cross me

I'ma career crook - they used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook

For the backstabbers, to be standin behind me, wit they knives out

I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin

As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy; and how it look like
I'm throwin batteries, when the bullets shoot by
So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea

Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa
That's why I'm limpin off wit a freak; and a lawyer

I could show you how to blow up on ya own; in a Benz
That'll hit a buck! And make the windows go up on they own
Wit a stash box compartment for; a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores; and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin home, wit a cigar sip for
Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the s***s, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts
That's why I get followed by broads; wit deeper throats

Y'all hopin that the Don fall off; but my money's long enough
To keep shootin ya bank until, ya arms fall off

Hey hey hey hey
Aye daddy's home after a long day
I'm from the hood, I came a long way
But I ain't goin back, I'm just visitin
I hear the streets talkin, I'm just listenin
If they ain't talkin money, I'm out my business then
If dying what it is, then what is it then?
I'm out here grizzyin, swizzyin
It's me bitches, sittin in a phantom
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson
I came back for it like I left it nigga
You try me you get more than a E for effort nigga

Chorus:
Well alright, okay
I've been gone, and away
For too long, a mistake
But right now, I feel awake
I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)

Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)

Do it ’cause you love a nigga have I felt my mama go
Those who just follow green, they the first kind to go
Being broke and the joke I’m too comical,
7 digits nigga 2 commons hoe,
Make your first million don’t make it your last
Don’t come if you ain’t ready, don’t try to make it too fast
Can’t learn shit if you never make it the class,
Can’t just for psycho it should be place in the trash
I started one more money and a stacy dash
I call that close a house in a place to crash

Pull the Hammer like the camera you don’t wanna face the flash
’cause you lose one of your sons and there’s no replace in that
Let the face as you show be the face that you stash
It’s more what that came from yall know where I came from
It’s all about that boy that call me papi
So I’ma keep making that paper papi
Your swears can never stop me, that try it used to play me
Two lines so you fuck boys polls that not play me
Right from where I left off let’s get back to that real shit
That’s sip back just chill shit, weed packs that I kill shit
I cheat back by trill shit, sweet that I feel shit
I gave you fall and be a kick... Some real shit
Who’s fucking with me, I mean Versace bitch
I deep all your hoe you niggas hide your bitch
Like the chain raise grandmother gave em
I got a thing for women I like to missbehaving
You know light bad, mike bad
So I’ma check em when I see em, night add,
’cause in this life things come and go like fast
And I’m that one who’s favourite using like had
I’m in the having shit turning dreams to average shit
Bringing the trophy to the club, dollars maverick shit
Nice, I came from first of the month money
To waking up whenever I want money nice
I chase paper I hunt money,
Make 50 racks I drink pm and calling lunch money
Nice, nigga you stunt money is blunt money
Your bull only got a text back with once from me
And I was what the fuck you want from me
Haha but I know the the fuck she want from me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You ain’t gotta front for me I know
I know what you want from me I know
I know we all want the money

Fly out to London cruise to Bahama's

She fucks up fifty g's fast and then calls it a quickie
I only deal with ten cents
My dick game is intense
Bent that Barbie over and she ain't seen Ken since (niceee)

Affording her's another thing

Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub

And don't pass my green on my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tab and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I aint hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker

Got em pullin on niggas

Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy??? Now I got G with me

Shine like a halogen, cool as the island wind
I don't judge myself but if I do I'd give my style a ten
Met a chick, who belong, on front of Cosmopolitan
Thick in the right place, otherwise she model thin
She don't do no swallowin, but she got a wilder friend
Who don't give a fuck, I told both of them to follow then
I'm with the familiar, you might be familiar
With a few faces but they still the nine milli-a
They be like the Young Guns, so I guess I'm Billy bruh
I do more than William Bryant, I'm a little Willie-er
Change a little chillier, wrist a little sillier
And I'm grown, so I'm not, really the, kid at all
But I hope you get it y'all, I can't say I did it all
But believe that 'fore I leave it I'ma try to get it all
What I don't get at all, is what these critics call
Stuntin, don't mean nuttin, they don't live her like they read it y'all
It ain't the car, it's the way it's kitted y'all

The way my posture lean, the way my necklace hang

But all this wreckless slang, it don't effect us mayne
They build you up to break you down, it's just like Tetris mayne~!
That's why I s** Ms. Thang, and let the next miss hang
And even if I wake up late I do the breakfast thang
That's an important meal, I is the important deal

Plenty fish in the sea and I keep bait
You're a broke rollerblader, cheapskate! 
My jeep plate say ""Tune in to the game""
Competition killer, funeral's the name
Listen up son, I'm immune to all the lame
If I fathered your style, put a Jr. to your name
I searched the whole planet, there's no comp on Earth
Sky blue J's (Jordan's), look like I stomped a smurf

I said life is but a dream
Aint always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass now lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math! 
I see haters in passing, yeah they 'round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk sh-t like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless
Won't be on Craigslist, lifestyle A-list
On my way to Vegas I part playlist
Yeah it's just another page in my success story
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me
My only job, consistent and persistent
I go so hard my assistants need assistance
I'm living mine hands on get the feel of it
Life's a b-tch you might wanna get familair with

[Verse From Fabolous ""Bring Death To Em""]
This the flow that put haters on their deathbed
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me rev head
Somebody call 911 like 'clef said
'Fore my man's n 'em black out, Meth Red! 
The newspaper say young rapper left dead
The only suspect they have is young funeral
And when you see him
He might be on his goony proud
So you put him up in the air George Clooney style
Slow motion for me so just slim juvenile
Don't sh-t move a dude can't move his bowels
Catch it like Larry Fitzgerald
Kurt Warner bullets coming out the 5ths bureau
Baby I'mma make it, my sh-ts thorough
You shootin blanks your sh-ts durrough
The competi... can't hold hold me
But first lay in a box and cross your hands for me
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me
I triple what you see's like I'm Ross' man homie (Triple C)
Dudes get to New York like loso's dead Tony
You pick the place everybody cross the land for me
Keep it real, I can't endorse or stand phoney's
'Less we arm wrestle don't force my hand homie
These YSL's cost a grand only
My white girl bought that Porsche Cayenne for me
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches
School of heart, I get brain from gorgeous teachers
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either
Any competition he see the boy just ethers
I can't feel my face this that Boston George reefer
You lie if you say I aint hotter than August weether
I mean weather! 
You can't see me, I mean ever! 
Ever ever, Andre 3 G
This is me G, Gucci print G-G
Clean ice neck full of frozen Fiji
Been in the game long as Mario, Luigi
No Juvenile, Wayne, Turk or B.G.
I'm still Hot Boyz but it's stutter gang jack
You bang right the first time they don't bang back
You's can't ball like me they quickly meer in H.O.R.S.E
I bring death to em, no hearing loss! 
Nice.

Fab's livin' la vida loca
Only nigga in the hood you can come see for either weed or coca
Nark's wanna see me and my team in a chair
They heard about the kid with the high beams in his ear
Dea been lookin' for proof since 9-3
When I came thruogh in the Benz with the roof behind me
Tell them jake's through on bullet proof's and find me
You need extingwishers to go in the booth behind me
Who the fuck wanna beef
My Fendi knits be [3X] so you can't see what's tucked underneath
And I might not even drop
Just take my advance and make a small town in Cleveland pop
""Vivrant Thing"" on my hip, that will make you ""Breathe and Stop""
Rock ya chain in ya shirt, Your roll (Rollie) with the sleeve on top
You niggas know where my heat stay at

Niggas don't think I'm still shavin crack
Cause I pull up in a truck with a system that make the pavement crack
Baugettes have my face and beard covered
And I keep a Leathal Weapon like Mel Gibson and Dan Glover
Now I lose V Money and C Lo
And the cops think me and Muggs is G Money and Nino
I don't hit these honey's with C-Notes
Rather put them on Greyhound, Strap these honey's with kilo's
Type of gangsta every chick wants
I get Nike's from Aster you won't see hit the store for 6 months
Something bout the Beamer [X5]
When I come through it be increasing a skeo's s** drive
Half the click look like they stuck Genisis up
The other half is tryin to wrap they sentances up
I'm never gone hate, Half these artists never slum weight
When they call ny, it's the only time they touch the 7-1-8

Carat's hangin out the side of my lobe
Pull in ya drivers side and unload
They find ya when it's time for your ride to be towed
On side of the road
With ya brain on ya passenger side of ya Rove (Rover)
Y'all niggas ain't gangstas til' y'all ridin
And Fed's tell ya hit a chick once and she runnin back like Fred Taylor
I'm snatchin everything in the pj's now
That's why most these niggas is workin' with the da's now

If I'm with a hoochie freak or a dime in Gucci sneaks

That's how it be and it's gon' say (Y'all know whoooooooo)
That's how it be when you see me
That's how it be in nyc (Y'all know whoooooooo)
If it's me it's got to be
If it's me it's got to be
G-a-n-g-s-t-a (Y'all know whoooooooo)

[Verse One]
I'm still living la vida loca
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo hah!)
They love me just because
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
They gold cups missing stones, turning green
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good

[Hook:]

[Verse Two]
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
And I wouldn't change it for nothing
I stay on point, that's ''cause I know the danger of stuntin'
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
''cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag
You need some high heels and a handbag

[Hook:]

[Verse Three]
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
Give me A. 40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee
That's gangsta love, from the heart
Yo I told y'all from the start
And now (y'all know whoooooooo)
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up
(It's a gangsta party)

Murder them, murder them, they don't make a move until they get word from him
I could be in Fiji, one call to Gigi
She on some Belly shit like X with a squiggie
They say it's gangsta but it's just the way of life
If life's a bitch better make everyday your wife
I'm from the era of the shootouts from drug spots
Happy to be here so I smile in my mug shots

It's like bugs up in here
Like thugs up in here
Throw ya fingas up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air
Haters - might have a slight grudge when I'm there
See the strobes on my wrist, light bubbles in my ear
Ladies pass through, I might rub on her rear
Pop cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair
Even dykes tug on my gear the way I like strut up in here
Don't get the nike's smudged that I wear
Drinks be flingin, minks be swingin
The way the pinky-ringin, link be blingin, you think we slingin?
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin behind ya
18 inches and up, no sittin on minors
After tha club hittin a diner, spittin the lines
And end up in a hotel, gettin vagina

Ladies- rub ya tits if ya gettin right (hey)
Niggas- grab ya dicks if ya gettin right (ho)
Don't be thinkin bout that nigga that you wit tonite
Don't be thinkin bout that chick that you wit tonite

Ma, it's hard to stop and not admit it
You like the way the drop I got is kitted
Cops can't spot who is it
You wanna stop and jot ya digits
Must be how I hop on yatchs and visit, tropic spots I did it
The top the watch is glitted
Make niggas wanna bop they knots, stop and plot to get it
Like I won't pop a shot in fitteds
I got the type of machine guns that cops and swats prohibit
I wanna drop but not to hit it, stop we not committed
Think we hittin shoppin spots, forget it
Move ya neck, rock from side to side
Neva get checked, me and my glock side and side
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five
Spendin a grands nutin for 'lous (lis)
You ain't got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin the chicks?

Yall hardly see I be 'round
But when I do, I be, I be down in a vip lounge

Bulky knit, can't even see my 3-pound
Yall know how that kid from b-stuy be down
Yall see my c-pound, y'all see y'all be drowned
Skee-o, gotta, re-ply she down, which sheet I meet down
I know she gettin right- hey
Ladies tug me when I strut
So this thug be in the cut, takin bubbly to the gut
Rays beamin, y'all think I be day-dreamin
But I stay schemin like, ""shortie could get it""

I'm never tweakin' of haze an frequently blazin'
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in
Can't deny it, used to take weeks and persuasion
Now I just be lookin' down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, the first thing I peep a notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So you ain't gotta be perfect
I'll buy you whatever you want, but your heads gotta be worth it
Still what I mean is
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis
'til I feel like a geinus
Look at it from a playa's postition
I got a scholarship, I get smart without payin' tuition
My classes be like two three hours
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since doogie howser

Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes

That you help me get good grades, ma in all of my classes

Thses bitches they done got real bad
Cause now I pull out, leavin'em lookin' like model for a got milk ad
I'm a teachers pet
And even if you good at math ma
You'll have trouble countin' each bauggette
All it takes would hood tutors and some good budda
And promise to buy them some of them razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher started givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, duke on it invented the night bulb
I might pass on a female, and call up a subsitute just for night
Class in the cl
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from givin' my dick cpr
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squrtin

You are the weakest link, goodbye

You know my girls in north and south caddy

I head to cali, take more blows to the head than ali
And the philly momies suck the kid outta willie bonnie
And the way females so southern hospitality in atl
Don't even know them hoes
In south beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about vegas, the head is outrageous
The broads in seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in va
Them hoes in detroit will suck the whole? ??
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in chi-town
My bitches in b-more, blow til they knees sore

And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow
I'm stuck in my city ways
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze
You rats can keep running through your city's maze
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
I know you in that hole, you best to hide
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill

From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be

Wit the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the thangs, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely
I know the snakes gon' slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!

[Verse - Fabolous]
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone! Catch up!

Two years later here comes little Sharneese

I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you?
And where homeboy at? Oh word, ya'll through?
Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through
Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove

But um, besides the lane, you look the same
Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang
Ankle bracelets that Donna Kay shit
I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips

Hoodrats, they be wearing that fake shit
Like her, she wear the same bag, like it ain't shit
Pardon me, excuse my French
Just read my lips, girl, everything's me

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that
Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey
'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha
Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that
Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey
'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha
Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha
He's a goner

Look around everybody sipping on rosette
All in our business they wanna be nosey
He's with her, gonna be all in the streets like a Jeep tomorrow
Don't worry, let's breeze the bar
And in case I ain't tell you those jeans is hard

And those is the snitches, mean mugging, can't fight
Run into the police, fuck them niggas
I pull out like a tooth when the back is rotten
Finish 'em off like your menstrual after you spotting

Ghost can't complain, 5'6"", swinging those hips
And my miss got me wanting to sing
Walking down the street, watching ladies
I go by watching you, watching you
I want you like if I ain't got nothing to do

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that
Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey
'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha
Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that
Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey
'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha
Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha
He's a goner

Somebody better call the cops
'Cause if that thing c*** back it's gon' pop
Once me stop moving it ain't gon' stop
Whatever that girl wants you know she got shopping

Somebody better check the swag
We rack up and never check the tags
We just stuffed it all in the bag
Oh, you mad? Well, too bad

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that
Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey
'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha
Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha

He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that
Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey

Uh huh, c'mon

[Verse:]
Fabulous strives for digits, even connives to get it
Niggas can't tell me nothing dunn the five is kitted
>From Dead Presidents, any cat alive can get it
I walk around covered in ice like I survived a blizzard
Got enough chips to bribe you wit it
Pay off security at clubs, get my guns and nines admitted
I'm the type that get tried and acquitted
If my bombs aint wit it, blast you with a 4/5 and spit it
Y'all niggas run to the police and then describe who did it
Come home, findin necks homie wives is slitted
I got niggas on my side committed
You niggas drive or split it, with your brain inside your fitting
Fabulous, the only way to I D him, is in a 5 B M
Puffin sticky green til my eyes get slim
Operate with more chips than I B M
Fuck with me you make the news, at 5 P M, motherfucker

Chorus:
If y'all see me gettin locked, it gotta be drugs
If y'all see chrome on a truck, it gotta be dubs
If I'm givin somethin to haters, it gotta be slugs
If it's one thing it gotta be, it gotta be thugs
No info, if I'm leaking, it gotta be blood
If my earlobes is hanging, it gotta be studs
If the bitch on her knees, it gotta be love
If it's one thing it's gotta be, it's gotta be thugs

Niggas don't wanna play around, they see how calm I do things
Swan in a blue Range, armed with two things
Flex pay my joints, drop bombs like Hussein
Catchin cataracts, glance at the charm and new chain
I got coke in every part of Brooknon a true name
Niggas want it when you wave a firearm, they views change
End up having to move they mom to Ukraine
Yeah adt, alarms and new names
Who else comin to club, under each arm is two dames
Buying bottles of Dom, with his loose change
Niggas *Hate Me Now*, 'cause I catch the eyes of dimes
Flooded the hood, with trays the size of dimes
Y'all do windows low, rims pokin off the wheels
I'm in the game, tryin to get broken off a mil
Shove the gun in your mouth, have you chokin off the steel
Niggas love to bam, but the bitches open off the grill

Chorus

[Verse 3:]
Yo I'm ready to address the haters, and underestimaters
Hop in the truck, ride up on y'all like escalators
Hit your chest up, leave y'all hooked to respirators
Bed ridden, talkin to investigators
Now these ladies'll do anything, just to date us
'cause we skate around on ice, like Escapaders
Dressed in gators, In Peace I'm Resting traitors
When police come for me, peel out west in Vegas
Riding or dying, niggas know I'm ridin wit iron
Smoke compartment in the dash that I'm hidin and eyein
My pockets is fat, y'all accounts is on Slim Fast
I'm 20, with 20s on the M Class
Just gimme head, it won't switch your hairdo out
We aint tryin to hear you out, we tryin to air you out
Make y'all rush into stores, and clear Clue out
Bout to put cameras in the truck, take them rearviews out, what nigga

I'm rag racing, zoom zoom, in a rush too get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, come through your hood in all black
If you real you'd recognize

All I do is grind and pray, riding through the streets all day
All I do is grind and pray, riding through these streets all day

They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause me and you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is to hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damm I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away
'Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money too make, so girl you know

I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping at Onyx, keep it clapping at Magic
Got them niggas tricking at Palace
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out
And you cash in, they going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be, when income is uncertain
Hustling just too make a way, know you're thinking damn I hope
Somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody try to come and take it away

You work hard for it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if I ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers 'cedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gon' get your money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that (that body baby it's yours)
We do it big, an no together we about to do it bigger

Fabolous,Guess Who's Bizzack,/f/fabolous/guess+whos+bizzack_21051695.html,"I made some changes in my life, don’t regret none of them,
So if you ain’t heard from me then you probably wanted them.
Niggers want that from results, but do the same shit,
They wait for it to come, I became it.

Guess who’s bizzack, nigger?
You’re back in, back on the bullshit you’re always on.
Everything was going too good to know,
I just want the old you right now.

They knew you, I can’t do, I knew you, this ain’t you,
I’m like no angel, but always remained true,
You hear what they say, my only complaint
You wasn’t just listen, you let that shit tempt you.
You fell out like things do, I lost all respect
For niggers that’s bitches, so don’t call or text.
The bitches get checked like they’re all correct,
But they be wrong, that’s why they called your ex.
You don’t call or speak, so I call direct,
And you niggers broke, y’all called collect.
I’m watching my close friends like stranger for bread,
You said you’ll never change, now don’t change what you said.
Face it, y’all, all your bitches basic ball,
But then you block it like you eight feet tall.
Homie, I’m in the track with the soul tape on,
Hold you up, rest your soul, Trevon, I’m that cool.

I say guess who’s bizzack, nigger?
You’re back in, back on the bullshit you’re always on.
Everything was going too good to know,
I just want the old you right now.

I can try to erase your pain
But you and I, we’ve made some mistakes.
I fucks with the old you, the way you is,
What did you say? You said that you’ll never change.
But you did soon as you got a chance,
Why you poppin shit while you should poppin bands.
Living that good life without a care,
The new you is high headed and I’m not a fan.
But I still keep it cooler, I think that you should cool up,
For real, ‘cause that ain’t you, dog.
Since you’ve been on that high horse your life been out of new luck
And I be checking deuces from that tudo with my new hoe,
Swear to God I ain’t losing no sleep,
I know you heard what I do to those race,
I beat it up, I kill the s***s, cause a funeral in old shades.
You mess with lanes, get seven days, that’s what I do away.
It can all be so sweet, but baby, do your thing
And mess me with that bullshit that you be saying.
You complain and pointing the finger when you’re to blame,
You know I got that comeback, boomerang.
Baby, what’s up?

You’re back in, back on the bullshit you’re always on.
Everything was going too good to know,
I just want the old you right now.

I keep trying to erase your pain,
But you and I both made some mistakes
I funcs with the old you, than who you is?
What did you say?
You said that you’ll never change,
And that’s what you told me, but it’s not what you showed me,
It is what it is, yeah, but I’ll always love you"

It was time to get my groove on
Find a place that's happenin'
And I knew that it was on

From the moment that I walked into the spot
It was bangin'
It was swangin' oh
Till somethin' turned me off
I wasn't sure
Coulda swore I saw you with someone
And at much to my surprise (whoa)

You were right there with your hands up in the air
You had hoochies everywhere
All on you
It's like I almost didn't know you
Tryin' to shake that ass
Playa you don't even dance
Sup wit' you
It's like I don't even know you

Left you at the crib
Cause I know you get your game on
Happens every Tuesday night
You said that you was cool
Your boys was comin' by
(Go baby have yourself a real good time)
So I knew I could be wrong

I was thinkin' there's no way it could be you
Not my baby

And I buy a home on the coast of Miami and the ammounts are in the millions
Fish tanks and flat screens mounted in the ceilings
Sippin' champagne I have trouble pronouncing while I'm chillin'
Felt that you was squealin'
You 'gon die even if Witness Protection put you in the mountains of New Zealand
Cause I hire bountys that be killin'
That play Hide-And-Go Seek and find you after countin' to a million
But a million records later
Theres still some speculators
Man these labels are giving the kid meals and checks like waiters
When I come through you never see my heels be decked in gators
And see Jordans that dropped when you was still a second grader
Spill the Tec on haters
I got a quick jab
But when I squeeze these slugs'll hit you a milla second later
I chill and check the waiter
Dudes play gangsta for a minute but run to the cops squealing seconds later
You still a Lexus trader
My credit so good I drive off in the sc and tell the dealer ""Catch ya later""
All I need is one night I don't deal with second daters

Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like I'm Bernard
Ya like beef but hate when I'm involved
Cause I don't give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad
And don't leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved
So I play against the odds
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin' on ya squad
If you get locked my Haitian'll leave you scarred

You need to holla at somebody real such as myself
Wont nobody do as much as myself
And it's so real I'll hop out and get the dutches myself
For a pretty girl as such as yaself
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I... Make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women
There's some who be willing and skimming
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens
But feelings aint the only thing that you can catch now
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous
Others pass diseases that you can catch now
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world
And.. I don't wanna live in it alone
Come on

[Chorus - Lil Mo]
Ill give you all my love
And you can always trust
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and I'll never)
Ill never leave (no.. No.. No)
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me
So holla at somebody real ('cause i)
'cause I'm so real

[Fabolous]
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92
(awwwwwwh) but I pray I will find you
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But.. I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When it's real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
(noooo) before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to.. Good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do

[Chorus:]

[Lil Mo]
No I'm not trying to pressure you
But my loves to incredible
For to waste
In front of your face
Then I give you something you can feel
To let you know your hollering at somebody real

[Fabolous]
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's til somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days aways
On a asia bay
Eating food made the cajun way
And sippin a lil saki
Blowin a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull I'm choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real

North south west east, jin says peace

Fabolous,I Miss My Love,/f/fabolous/i+miss+my+love_20844338.html,"I mean, I don't eve know where to start like. It's like you find love, and you loose love, and then...

Met her up town on dykeman
Aight then
Light skinned
Starring with a slight grin, I don't know, Might been
'Cause I'm in this white benze

:: honk honk::

Or the way the Ice in the Brietling flash brighter than a lightning
But I knew from right then
She was 'bout her money, and how she fit right in knowing how I might spend.
To make a story short, other than a Tight End
Had a Washington Hieghts friend
Who bring that white in.
Set up a meeting, Her dude caught a flight in
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then
Got straight to business like two corporate white men
The food came, before I could take a bite in
He said ""You the type I usually don't invite in, but since we got a like friend I could get you like, 10""
I told him I could move like 10 by nights end
Put the white over the plate, like I'm throwing strikes in.
'El Duke' got a dude in the uk, Buy 5 bricks at a time, $22K
He send the Euro's I send the Puredo
Now that's what I like to call a ""Foriegn Exchange""
He smiled. Duke finished his glass of wine
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind
My man will pass a dime, at 15 a pop
Tell shorty ""Make the drop, Don't make no stops!""
I gave him a hand shake some dollars for the tab
Told shorty the location then I holla'd for a cab
I hit mike told 'em ""Send the wire to the buyers""
Word got 'round like we were handin' out flyers!

And them thangs went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame

And them thangs went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame

12 months in, turned a Benz to a Lambo
Everywhere the fam go, korks fly, Champ Flow--
I gotta celebrate, that's the way I am yo
In the past week I watched 50, 00 grams go
Pocket full of money, Army full of Rambo's
Trunk full of bricks, Hand guns full Ammo

Even got detectives if somethin' goes wrong
The money's so strong they see it from my perspective
But with my shorty, A nigga's so protective-
And should be, she's the one who knows where the connect lives.
She don't talk much, real calm and collective
Seen something in me 'cause shorty's really selective.

I tell'er fall back, shorty stilla drive
Said the rush of the risk just makes her feel alive
I listen to her fuss, saying ""that I must, let her do it 'cause they're aint too many niggas that I trust""

So now time is flyin', I been kinda eyeing-
A ring for my queen who got me diamond buying

I'm in the gt headed up to ct, Lookin' for a stone to light her finger like et
I got there, and got a call from a dt (detective)
Sounded nervous saying ""we need to talk now""
I told em chill out, I aint in new york now
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now!

But when I get back, we can sit and chit chat-
Better not be no bull shit, I aint even wit that...

Back to what a nigga came out here for
This 5ct. Diamond without near flaw's

Head back to the city, call up the commitee
Get ready for tomorow, they're comin' in with 50
I almost forgot, I gotta see a cop
I figured it was a drop who must aint get his gwop

He told me meet him by the bridge, I get there in a hurry
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up
He said: ""Nah Los, FED's dun snatched ya chick up- Caught her at a pick up, scoopin' those bricks up! She gon' cooperate, and ya fixed up. She's probably at the headquarters now hangin' Flix up""

I asked him ""Was he sure""
Shorty's ""Mi Amore""
This happened to me before, with my man Diadore-
Over a Ki(lo) of raw-
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt.
He assured me, I was hot- she had put 'em on me
Swore to Jesus' Tears that he was here to warn me.

Normally, I would have just ended her life-
But this was the girl I intended to wife

So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin'- shorty's kinda peepin my sudden discomfort
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her
She wanted to go alone, but a nigga insisted
Like ""Baby it's been a while"" and truthfully I missed it

We rode out, but she don't know that I done made a plan
Once she hits the spot, one shot- see you later man

I watched her in the building,
Knowing it's the last time-seein' her ass climb in and out of the car
Yo I even thought about gettin' out of the car
But sat back lookin' at the ring about to be yall's

I let one tear fall at an unfair call
Ya whole life can change in just one year yall...
Caught in a thought, then I heard a:: bang!::

Hi love, bye love, I will miss my love.

It's so crazy how it happened like... It's just... Crazy... It's just crazy you know? Just the way it happened it's just... One thing... Aint no Love in this shit, Aint no Love in this game, There's no love... Loso..."

Now tell your boss, you can't come in tomorr

They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?
Nah nigga I ain't come here to spar
These hallow tips will come where you are
I stomp through smooth with the soldiers
Two steppin and movin my shoulders
Now the money's rollin in
We got bottles lined up like bowlin pins
Mami, you standin with a slouch
Starin at me, while I'm standin on the couch
Come and get in the blue flames
Have a sip of this blue shit and lets rock!

I can take the few shots you've got
I can burn a few knots you've got
I can blow the few spots you've got
But, I chill, I will
Get it to poppin whenever I feel
I still shut it down
And I white and yellow stud it down
Watch them pretty girls strut it 'round
Take the birdies and putt it down
Like Tiger Woods did it, but I'm hood with it
You've never seen a thug look as good with it
And I promise that
Fuck with me, you better move where 'sama's at
You see I'm in here with the white ones on

She said ""no you fucking don't Fab, you just wanna hit it""
Okay girl you got me, but I'm with it, if you with it

Before things get blown out of proportion (chill)
You know me I ain't grown out of the flossin'
I'm still chromed out in the Porsche and
Sick stones out in the cross and
Before I known bout an endorsement
I was pushin' stones out up in Boston
Then the folks phoned out to enforcement
Man gettin the case thrown I was exhausted
So now I just lay back

Yeah, all gas, fast, livin' like somethin' was speedin'
Ashy to classy, now I bless 'em like someone who sneezin'
I'm only here to give 'em pressure, bitch, picture me squeezin'
Against the world like I was Pac, wasn't nobody believin'
Nothin' deceivin', know the truth, what the fuck you was needin'?
Gather this evenin' for the one, reputation was steamin'
Vision me gleamin' from the mud, ain't no point in you cleanin'
I'm motivation for the ones who nobody was feedin'
Automatic still give 'em the same kick
Started the sideline, now I'm starrin' in game 6
Spit and make 'em replay it like they're stuck on the same disc
Work, I give 'em new, never stretchin' the same brick
Never the same chick, yeah I'm still on that same shit
Cop me a new spot, tryna see where the plane fits
Picture me with a crown, next to that where my name sits
Galaxy in the ceilin' just to show 'em what fame gets

In the heart of the jungle walkin' through the fire
You beat the charge if you show up with an alibi
Runnin' wild in the city, no direction
All we know is get that dough, run up the checks and
I'm self-made, wasn't made for the military
Get paid, dodge jail and the cemetery
You better reach for the stars, take your best shot
You let them haters kill your dream, your ass be assed out, forreal

Fill a Backwood with three nicks
V6, cut the coke, remix
Squeeze clips if ever we hear that he snitched
I'm allergic to broke niggas in the precinct
Found out my man was hatin' and we ain't speak since
Barney's, Nord's can't add up the paper we spent
Tryna get drunk, I'm tokin', I got a P bent
I touched a million, ain't sleep since, on defense

Freedom got me feelin' like I flown up
Out of prison, I ain't think that I was blowin' up
Bunch of young rich niggas home, Rollies up
Run up on us, watch how quick I'll lift the toaster up
Money got me feelin' like you can't control us
Servin', watchin' out for the patrollers
We used to play the game, play on your controllers
Seen niggas get killed, heart froze up
Picked up them choppas, got to go and duck
Shootin' everything up, it ain't no ho in us
Shit ain't even last, free bro and them
In Chicago I'm home, that's on foe and them
Now I'm thinkin' right 'cause I see I can make it
Saw the fam strugglin', I couldn't take it
You got it out the mud, I got it out the pavement
I used to miss payments, got the title, dare you try to take it

Triple OG
Never without vision or livin' goal-free
Never writ it though
I've been out gettin' this since '03
Every little red cent and every dividend
Has been counted and acquired
Been legit, legal and been with the code
I'm colder than December in the winter cold
Look, I've been out givin' canned goods and clothes
To the children on 34th, real nigga, ugh

I could put you on like socks
Put you on like my watch
Put you on the block, you can get that off
Put you on the right lot, you can get that coke
Put you on like a fitted
Put you on in my city
Got the stars in the ceilin', that's the Wraith
Got the top in the trunk, that's a don
I could give it to a nigga either way 'cause I'm on, L

I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, yeah

Wakin' up, feelin' good, rollin' through the neighborhood
Do or die, every day, I lead 'em in a different way
I don't take no mess, get it off of my chest
I'ma be dressed to impress, no stress, fresh
Off the east side, Trae called me up and said
""Unc I'ma need you on the b-side""
So I came through, ah, mic checked, one-two, uh
Gettin' real funky, kinda smell like manure
Eight cars, eight stars
Return of the Mack with these hot eight bars
Flip through it, dip through it
This is the shit that'll make you get to it
Break down, give it up, pour it up
Now drink it up, roll it up
Light it up, how you feel, y'all?
See you in high definition with a mothafuckin' real Dogg

And every day I'm on
And if I wasn't, then why would I say I'm on?
Get an M and get low, that's the Dre I'm on
Get a B in blue, that's the Jay I'm on
They on sidelines watchin' what play I'm on
I call a audible, that's what a baller do
They keep askin' me, is there more to do?
Well ain't water wet? Well then it's more to get
To my shorty's set, and his shorty's set
This game ain't over, it's more quarters left
I gotta rep my city, do it for the set
I gotta talk my shit until I'm short of breath
'Cause the world is full of niggas tryna off your on switch
Tryna find a place that your coffin gon' fit
Me and my niggas on some confidant shit
And we ain't really feelin' that off and on shit, I'm on

Maybach Music
Chasin' paper, starin' out the casket
Was a stunna 'til they froze all the assets
Killers at your neck 'til you cut a check
You talkin' 'bout the money, nigga, where it's at?
Cars for my dogs, do it for the cause
Right back here tomorrow, nigga, inshallah
Prayin' on my knees, do it for the keep
Do it for the team, or I'ma let it be

Chamilitary mane
They thought I was done, but really I ain't even stress it
Just look at all the dough I got invested
Two years and two billion dollar exits
And now your relevance ain't lookin' that impressive (it ain't)
So glad we ain't gotta chase relevance
And I would like to thank the dead presidents
For not livin' forever-ever, forever-ever
For all of them that passed, I've been gettin' paid ever since
Be okay, still paid, still stackin' it
We gon' stay, courtside, that's accurate
We gon' take the White House and get back in it
They tried to turn us in to the villains like Colin Kaepernick
But it's okay, Gotham City needs savin'
You'll fight back but I'ma shock 'em like Raiden
I don't fold, I don't quit and don't cave in
Your worst nightmare, Freddy Krueger, Wes Craven

I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, yeah

And I don't think he really needs any coachin'
The weather's gettin' hot, Eazy Season approachin'
Came up and everybody sees the devotion
I put the work in, I cause a commotion
Whenever I'm in public, modern-day Elvis
Hoes at my shows wanted selfies
Made it here and ain't nobody helped us
Now I'm on a path to be great
So they say, that's what everybody tells us

Raised knee-deep in the dope game
If I had two guns up then they was both aimed
Saturday mornin', I'm watchin' Soul Train
Eatin' leftover food, lo-mein
Now I'm plant-based, couple juice bars
I'm on now, I don't care if the stamp straight
Told Trae I'm the truth like his name is
Can show you what pain is, I'll tell you what game is, Ghost

I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on

Ayy Trae, let the councilor speak
E-40! The best that ever did it and got away with it
Let the councilor speak
Not a septic tank, but I'm with the shit
On my coast, I'm the topic and the subject
Where I'm from it's hella squeeze and heathens' guns bust
I wish that TD Jakes would come and pray for us
They pimpin', they flockin', they like to steal and rob
Backdoor their loved ones, inside job
That's why I stay with a stapler, a baby tomahawk
Life or death situations in case I gotta pop
I made a promise to the Lord that I'mma keep it funky
Never switched, never sell my soul for money
I always been for right, maybe that's what's wrong
Now I'm on like the most requested song
Since a teen, I was doin' my thing, magazine
On the 1300 block, we had a machine
I had a quarter mil' at the age of 19
In the kitchin' cookin' birdies with no wings
The best rappers come from the gravel, the slums
Empty rack with spaghetti sauce jars rockin' up crumbs
It ain't easy bein' on for 30 years to see the glitter and glamour
But not the blood, sweat and tears
I'm an old ass youngsta, bruh, I'm a vet
Sick Wid It Records, sellin' cassettes before the internet
I never made a mixtape in my life
But one day I'ma do it for my fans, the people that saved my life

Excuse me! I happen to be the boss man
Excuse me! I happen to be the weatherman
Excuse me! I happen to be the ice man
Excuse me! I happen to be the dopeman

I'm the man, yes, shorty I'm the man
And I'm the man, yes, shorty I'm the man
I'm the man, yes, shorty I'm the man

That's me
The motherfuckin' man, 'Lo-so
Due to the present in your past
In present where your man bitch?

Yes, I'm the man, yes shorty I'm the man
I'm so fly there's no tellin' when I'm a land
You tryin' to come up on somethin' mami I'm the player
So play the cards you was dealt baby I'm the hand
Young Denzel, I'm the inside man
They open they legs to let me inside man
I work the middle, call it an inside job
The hey mon', I got ten side jobs
The boss man, the ice man and weatherman
The weed man for Redman and Method Man
The dope man, the gun man, the mailman
The spokesman, the cheer man, the salesman
Used to spread the white shit like hail man
And I moved more bags than the bellman
Now I'm the man of the da-da-da-da-damn
If you ain't get the message let me tell you who I am (Bitch!)

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm the man, yes, shorty I'm the man
Lookin' for some good shit, then I'm your man
Just say my name three times like Candyman
I pop up, fix it up like a handyman
You know how the man do, Coupe is all mad new
Ginoblis, but the truck is on Kobe's
Through the bulletproof when you're in the Sport man
The slugs come through your window like grown man
Aw man! There go your man again
I fifth him up, stiff him up like a mannequin
I ain't trippin' but dude think he the Man of Steel
He slippin' up and he don't even see banana peels
And one night I made plans to do him
The bitch is so easy a caveman could do it
She know I'm the man of the da-da-da-da-damn
But F-why-I, let me tell you who I am (Bitch!)

I don't understand how niggas insist to knows bout
How we spend car money to glist our rolls out
Play bars and buy the cris and moes out
Flash benjies just to twist the hoes out
Fabolous the one from the menatti mix
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks
Slim nigga in a big body six
Wit enough dough and pull to Gotti fixed
If I wasn't rappin I'd have a???
Down south in a town you never heard before
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for
??? Cats I keep burnin for furthermore
I'm the nigga every freak press be in a sleek S
That's gon need week rest after greekfest
Jump in private jets just to sneak west
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh

[Chorus:]
Niggas want it

Bitches on it

Flooded up and custom fitted
Tinted up and bb kinted

Now sports the kind of nigga you could spot everyday
Sip lots of cherry 'Ze in a hot chevy 'Le
I know's a few niggas that plot to bury J
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier
What you gon do when we send shots from every way
We got perion while y'all got perrier
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass
Wit dime bitches that'll make a nigga nut fast
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter
Cop a crown and put stones on a border
Smoke the trees now that's grown underwater
Still keep 9's that'll put ya bones out of order

Got the condo cats will leave ya dead for

Anything you want nigga now I got the bread for

Throwin partys in Jamaica when I hit plat
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore

When you grow up in my hood
Help don't show up in my hood
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood
Young kids get clapped in my hood
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood
In my hood, in my hood, in my hood

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm always close to
Feeling like a corner stander
Stoop sitter or hallway post-er
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to
Feel just like it's (in my hood)
Cops drive in it every five minutes
Look at your faces, pat your waist-es
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is
I can't say that they racist
But I know it ain't the same in they town
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)
It's two ways to make it happen off the streets
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete
When they clappin' off the heat
Then the yellow tape's trappin' off the street
But that's the way we was raised
Praying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays

When you grow up in my hood
Help don't show up in my hood
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood

They drink 'til the cup's dry, eat 'til the plate's clean
Niggas be in state greens 'fore they turn 18
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice
Everybody raised on four wings and beef fried rice
Them mothers are getting younger today
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way
We don't have role models (nah)
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)
Ain't no diplomas or degrees
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience
I'ma get mine, you better get yours
'Cause everyday is a struggle
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong
And everybody got a white tee on, when you're in my hood

When you grow up in my hood
Help don't show up in my hood
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood

That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood
In my hood, in my hood, in my hood

We try to make the most of what we got
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)
Any nigga that boast be getting got
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got
And young niggas be like they slow
But you give them a blunt, bet they roll the weed like a pro
If you trick it's not a problem to get you laid
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you aids
No Sesame Street, kids, watch bet
Look up to niggas that don't got a ged
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads
And everybody grew up sleepin on a bunk bed
They telling me to vote and I would
If it made a change in my hood, muhfucka

When you grow up in my hood
Help don't show up in my hood
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood

Ayy, my nigga (what's hood, man?)
I got a special love for the hood, y'know (ayy, feel me like)
This is comin' from a nigga
Who came from splittin' heroes (uh-huh)
To gettin' checks with six zeros (yeah)
And like for real (like for real)
I can't even see what's really hood no more, man, with these niggas, man

Like, for real, like
It's one thing to be from the hood (yeah)
And it's another thing to be for the hood (uh-huh)
A lot of these niggas is from the hood (don't let 'em fool ya, y'all)
But they ain't for the hood (you see 'em)

Work 8 to 3, then from 4 to 9 school

She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz
It sounds like a plan
'Cause girl once I got you by your limbs
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk
A little accent, cute ass lisp
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss
I like it when you whip yo hair, but that's Willow fault
I speak body language, f-ck pillow talk
We can wake up 'round noon on a saturday
And make a f-ckin movie, now that's a matinee
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo' wake up call
Kiss yo' face before you put that make up all over it
You go from gettin' ready at the bathroom sink to gettin' bent over it
Then it's over with
Now you rushin' to work, ipod touchin' yo purse
Ima let you go but not without touchin' it first
When you think 'bout it later you blush and you smirk
Your co-workers thinkin' you got a crush on the clerk
You always talk about yo boss, about how much of a jerk he is
But tell me baby does he touch you and flirt?
'Cause that's how such and such get hurt
And lame ass n-ggas start bringin' crutches to work
I know you got it girl, I trust in your work
Ladies is pimps too, go 'head brush off the dirt
I be here when you get off with dutches and purp
I want you after dinner, your such a dessert
The night is lookin' sweet the only thing I'm tryna bite is yo physique
And in most cases with you
Only thing I wanna fight is gettin sleep 'cause I eat and go to sleep
You know I is in the sheets, niceeeee
Don't touch it, let my eyes do the undressin'
Play Usher and take ya back to confessions
I wanna crush ya' nevermind the tongue wrestlin'
Wont rush ya, one question

There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'cause the kids ready to tell you how he feel and a few vows
Maybe I speak in general now
But girl, imma do whatever just to keep a grin on u now
Where I roll, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou
On fifth ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I aint concerned with other men with you now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin to you now
And I aint jealous, it's the principle now

Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was crimping
Now you relaxing in the Benz

Remind me of them trips to Roofchris
U love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it aint because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dip the deuces
And you aint flattered by Canary's and VS dip tay seuces
All the ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda #'s impress you
Even though I was so unsuccessful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
That's why the same bar while the villa been painted
Just so we can really get acquainted
The love is real, there's no way you can feel like it's tainted

Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips...style
You shockin' it..you a rock it..you a kill it
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click
Flossin' it...Money we tossin' it...
'Cause we a tha Boss in it
We naw ease up...We aint stallin'...Grab tha girls all in...

Over here tha liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green
They wearin' tha right shoe, they put on tha tight jeans
They bringin' me right thru', I walk with a slight lean
My style excites you, I know what that might mean
Aye, Im'ma freaky scorpio
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio
Aye, but it's mandatory tho'
Yo' after me let shorey go

But that's another story tho'
But please don't try to bring us to tha Maury show
How cool is he?
You don't know a fool who be crazy enough to fool with me
You'd rather swim in a pool of pee
Then see tha one you luv in tha vehicle with me
Aye
Yo
But tha vibe is right, tha girls is up to par
We gon', drink it tonight and earl it up tomorr'
It goes

That's how it be and it's gon' say (Y'all know whoooooooo)
That's how it be when you see me
That's how it be in NYC (Y'all know whoooooooo)
If it's me it's got to be
If it's me it's got to be
G-a-n-g-s-t-a (Y'all know whoooooooo)

[Verse One]
I'm still living la vida loca
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)
They love me just because
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
They gold cups missing stones, turning green
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
And I wouldn't change it for nothing
I stay on point, that's ''cause I know the danger of stuntin'
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
''cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag
You need some high heels and a handbag

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee
That's gangsta love, from the heart
Yo I told y'all from the start
And now (y'all know whoooooooo)
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up
(It's a gangsta party)

Have the kid missin' for days, listen and pray

And we still got exza of rhymes) Still gangsta
(Try to run up on the guy, that send your legs to your mom)

I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you

Wanted to spread them legs like you number 23

Pops never let her outside,
Nigger knew the type of shit she was up against,
Little did he know she was going to back fire.
But she act right, got baptized, stayed in the quire,
But the thing she desired was a older nigger show her how to be a freak
A young girl is in heat, is deep.
She sneaking out after loose, in the streets at night when the freaks are out.
Butterfly tatt’ on her back that she tried to hide until her father found the secret out.
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out,
She living on her own in this vicious south,
Years go by, now I got her in my room
And I’m thinking at the best way to kick her out.

‘cause all she ever talks about is Louie, Louie,
All she ever talks about is Louis Vuitton,
And nigger, I can’t fuck with her no more.

I said Louie, Louie, all she ever talk about is Louie, Louie,

I told the bitch somebody stole my Rolli’, she talking about me, too.
I can’t do with the brand new Louis bag, she talking about me, too.
La on my next flight and guess right, she sent me to
And everybody gonna miss me, too, goddamn be you.
And if that is you, you’re so shallow, you on a boat that won’t travel,
Won’t float and won’t paddle if I don’t go broke it won’t matter.
It’s stupid ass shit shit don’t make me, a big pole won’t break me,
You’re so caught up on material shit, we both know that you can’t even get.

I said Louie, Louie.

And nigger, I can’t fuck with her no more.

She’s standing at the back, is clean,
First store got a bag this day,
Not knowing she was one of them check
With your bags name types.
Anyway, I’m happy that it came off the bill,
Got me enjoy saying as the bell,
She look like she came on herself, shawty, you should be ashamed of yourself.
I’m checking out her true face, thin little waist line,
She checking out my suitcase, like the bitch have canon.
Could’ve took her number, that be like ticket bad advice,
When you look at her you’re looking at a price
As I walked away, she said “that’s a nice

Go for the champagne, don’t care what you do,
But you better do a damn thing if you wanna win the campaign.

What you probably ain’t been,
You can’t keep a shallow bitch if your pockets ain’t deep.
So I try to be slick and reserve no dinner,
Take you to the club, had to meet me at the bar.
Let her walk in, people from afar, gotta let her know, can’t keep her in the dark.
‘cause she will wanna tamp up if you let her, and I thought I knew better,
‘cause she say ‘let me start with a double shot’,
Hey, bartender, let me get a

Talkin' how I came through the P's in a sicker benz
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends
Jewels so icey I need freezers to sitck 'em in

And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills
Gettin Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal

No more shoppin' sprees I'm rough wit the ends
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins

Chickens get keys, scuffin the benz

Baby even when I'm gentle, it might seem like it's ruff
But if neighbors aint comlpaining, you aint screaming enuff
And yeah they might hear as I'm slappin to the jewel
She said baby right there, do it rappid do it smooth
I said baby right where, kept tappin to the groove
She said n! **A right there, imma slap you if you move

Neyo
I told her I'll be there in a minuite,
She knew imma take it down soon as I get it,
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dress
Tonight we makin love
I told her lets stay home, she was waiting
She know imma take it down soon as I get it,
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dress
Tonight we makin love makin love

Fab
Can't forget the feeling when you stairing at the ceiling
And you can't catch your breath you just laying there chilling
Like 1 and then the 2, 2 and then the 3, 3 and then the 4
Damn I want some more
So I slam her to the floor, set the camera to record
Throw them legs up in the air, just like lamborghini doors
See we might have had some problems with the stamina before
I'm no amature I'm sure, I cold ram into your sore
But I aint trying to hurt ya

Familiar with Pain but wanna know Joy
Money talks so you gotta raise your voice
Takin pictures in my latest gold Ro’ boy
My Jewels on Cam? Oh Boy
Undisputed Swag Champ, Flow Floyd
No L’s, riding in that Rolls Royce
Or that Martin with shawty screaming “You Go Boy”
Smokin loud while killa rollin up more noise
You niggas playin with it but its no toy
I’m here to milk the game not go soy
Can’t give these choosey bitches no choice
Can’t give these loseer niggas no voice
Only let the winners speak
Money talks, better make it count when you speak
And how that broke man gon’ talk when
I’m ridin like this and he Antione Walkin
Takin care of hoes, was they bad ain’t the question
Sometimes a bad bitch is a even badder investment
Thirsty ass nigga, you should’ve had a refreshment
You moved her at to Cali, thought you had you a fresh Prince (niceee)
Now go and grab me some breath mints
I be talking that shit
Have ya bitch hosting at the crib
Got a section and the bottles when she walk in that bitch
Keep walkin then bitch, you and ya cheap leggings
I’m the one with the change you can keep beggin
With ya bum ass, shoulda changed her
Coulda had a little something in ya change cup

Look I didn't mean to hurt you,
But I thought we had an understanding about how it's gonna be,
You know, (Yeaah Mann!)
You roll through or I roll through, (F to the A-B)
And we just do what we do,
You know what I'm saying, (I-15)
I ain't looking for no relationship,
But I'm goin ahead let my boy Fab holla at you...

[Fabolous]
Yeah, this is real talk,
I told you there was others,
Now we go to war like soldiers with each other,
I'm trying to let it go not hold you like a lover,
See I'm simply P-I-M-P,
So I gotta stable-a chicks,
Unable to pick,
A babe I can lick out,
And I be labelled a trick,
If you down you can roll and if you not you can stroll,
It's just that easy,
When F-A-B's here...

[I15]
Girl you got it twisted,
You already know how I get down,
Now you out here trippin',
On some shit that we already talked about,
I just want to hit it,
And you said that was cool with you,
Now you here crying to me,
Saying you want to be with a player like me,
That ain't cool...

[I15 Chorus]
My bad, didn't mean to make you fall it like that,
And I hang up, and you call me right back,
It's like you don't even know how to act, (What's going on...)
My bad, baby girl we barely even friends,
I just like to smash it now and then,
Now you got me scared to hit it again,

[I15]
Now I don't mean to hurt you,
But it's not like you didn't know,
From the beginning,
Now you saying that you can't stand to be without me,
Now girl you talking crazy,
I'm not trying to deal with you,
Gonna keep it real with you,
Shorty I don't want to be with you...

My bad, didn't mean to make you fall it like that,
And I hang up, and you call me right back, (Back...)
It's like you don't even know how to act, (What's going on...)
My bad, baby girl we barely even friends, (Friends...)
I just like to smash it now and then,
Now you got me scared to hit it again, (Yeah...)

[Fabolous]
Now you know I come through every now and then,
To see how you been couple of thou' to spend,
But you knows how it goes,
Girls act like you suppose to propose... After a month,
But I choose to refuse,
I'm the kind of the man that do's what I choose,
Whenever I want,
And it's never the front,
It's just to let you know,
It's cheaper to keep her,
I'll still will let you go, girl...

[I15]
I've lost my patience,
With these ultimatums,
Tryin' to lock me down like incarceration,
I don't cuff 'em when I grab 'em,
I thug them with the passion,
Still running from the last one,
They tugging on my ass clip,
I don't what it is, I'm cool on that ""Might Be"" tip,
I ain't Damon, I'm too young for a wife and kids,
I kick it ""if we"", like Vivica and 50,
Like Fab said simply, we P-I-M-P...

My bad, didn't mean to make you fall like that,
And I hang up, and you call me right back,

All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my lights, so you can clearly see now

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin' us is very special
Lovin' life and life and livin'
Your very special

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Ya'll can never be built like me, even if ya'll look at my blueprint
But since ya'll watches look like it's movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin' that look like a nuisance
But ya'll gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence
But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin'
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like ya'll fluent
And ya'll done seen how this young'n look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J.
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, ya'll crackers gonna blame it on strays

[Mary J. Blige]
Cause love is life, and life is livin'
Your very special

Well, say hello to the rap Al Capone, south with pone
Tommy gun duck fitted to my mouth is chrome
Don't get it backwards, Stuck Shore South is home
Pelle who, soon to be caked out and blown
Boss of the bosses, Pricehead, Soldier apparel
Read the paper in my bed robe like Tony Soprano
Throw em' all in the bottomless pit
For rockin' bowling shoes, talk about rocks and shit

[Cadillac Tah]
Yo, you bitch niggas is prey, time pay
I leave you shrumped in this five coupe [Errr]
Faggot nigga I slide through
Any hood representin' my set, generation is new
But I wear this tech like a vest
Spit and tear up ya vest
D-A double D for that dough
Hit em' where it hurt most
You niggas ain't comin' close
I run up, gun up, hit you and ya done up, playa you ghost
We killers, Violator, Murderer niggas

[Hook:]

It's the violator, clip changer, mix the mayor
Got trick eight to throw more kisses than Jada
And a bitch serve the guard properly
She give me blows under the belt like a dirty boxer
It's are. Cadillac's on twenty-twos
And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'
They gave me eight bars, no room to breathe
And eight darts nigga, no one to leave

[Fabolous]
I come out with fire
Stop, drop, roll out the booth
Th rims come out the tires
I stop, hop fall off the roof
Only thing you should know is that's them hoin'
This playa comin' back with the 4-5, like M. Jordan
It's spelled with a capital F
See everything from the sweater to the scarf to the capital F
Now with the hoodrats, I'm like the rappin' Hugh hef
Better known as F-A-B-O-L-O-you-S

[Hook:]

[Fortune]
It's time to seperate the oil from the cut and gotten the pot
So when the flame rise niggas gon' respect what's hot
Four chain glock on em' with no warning
Leave ya hood like a circle with no corners
Made dough with the pot, heatin' and raisin'
Been around more pies than sweet potatoes
Violators, big dogs respect the line
Niggas act, I'ma tear em' up in the club like Shyne

[Remy Martin]
Y'all know if I spill sixteen it's a massive commodity
[Machine Gun Firing]
So I'ma just lay eight and etch the bodies
Everybody knows who's the hottest bitch
And that's why I'm the only bitch on this shit
And any ho that chu' know love Rem and Nick
Cause I spit as if I had a dick
This rap shit I done mastered it, 8-ball assassin chick
Wanna give it to me but they know I'm not havin' it

Desert Storm

[Chorus - Paul Cain]
Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch

[Verse 1 - Paul Cain]
Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off
And quick to speed off on the jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin the state
I'm like O. from the ""Wire"", walk wit a sawed-off and a .8
When I was taught, never talk wit a snake
When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin and weight
Get you wrapped up, and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck wit niggas, if they soft or they fake
Only jail cats, and niggas going back and forth to court could relate
Fuck wit me, and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl, I specialize in torture and rape
We in the game most dudes ain't built for
Cain talk the type of shit, niggas get killed for
Whatever it's gon' be, let it be, I ain't waistin a slug
And time is money, and when it come to mind, take it in blood, nigga

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane
And ran to the cops, to bring the tips of the last names (Nigga!)
Like I ain't bring the shipments, and past caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains (Nigga!)
Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast Range (Nigga!)
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came (Nigga!)
Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped in my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance
I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen, and start clutchin it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter
But I know, everything about rollin up, like a Dutch in a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter
One hit'll have the fiends yellin out, they need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch us indict us, and the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga

Listen, listen, I lived that life, of click-clack life
The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice!
You prolly see that through ya bitch ass eyes
Still I'm that nigga that you get at why
Man forget that they knew me, remeber me thug
I'm from that same block, rips snorkle on ja dip in a Lucy
'Member they back you down, when knives was out
.45 was out, scully ya eyes come out
But now could you hear nigga all in this place
That when you see him in the streets, you gettin all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes, and you wanna beef
Knowin I'm slower than do so, cause I got much more at stake
HUH!?... that's why I'm ignorin ya page
I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eating off rat, that same feat you think you capable of
Don't get me worng, I would like to get it
But you acting like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck wit my head
I'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst enemies
So if I make friends wit my worst enemies, that'll maybe even things out
But one in ya dome is easy, get it on if need be
Chrome for sheezy, please, DON'T believe me

And nightmares of something happening, and losing one of them
They tell me that it's all in my head, but I look deeper in 'em
My dreams and nightmares have the same people in 'em
I say prayers before I sleep, and I keep them in 'em
Too many wolves in these streets and snakes creeping in 'em
I used to dream about the mansions now we sleeping in 'em
My worse nightmares is still the Feds sweeping in 'em
When you wake up broke, how does sleep feel right?
Get up out the bed and make your dreams meet real life
You should be a Dream Chaser, tryna Meek Mill life
You make money in your sleep, that's when your sheets feel nice
You make money in your sleep, that's the real tooth fairy
And I know the youth hear me so I speak the truth clearly
Gotta dream my nigga, when you dream my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem my nigga
Ain't been getting no rest, and if you wondering why
'Cause I been getting this money, I feel wonderful, why?
Gotta pardon them moneybags that's under my eye
Just left London, Dubai, then had to run to NY
And I'm fly 'til I die, so sometimes the flight scare me
I keep leveling up until the heights scare me
30 bottles in Dream, 'member that night, Mary?
Feezy stop the music and turned out the lights, scary
All you saw was bottles lighting up and nice jewelry
Reminds me in dark times keep something bright near me
You pay the cost to be the boss but the price varies
And I ain't even spitting bars, these is life theories

Gotta dream my nigga, when you dream my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem my nigga
Just dream my nigga, 'cause when you dream my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem my nigga

Its all eyes on me like Mr. Shakur
So they wanna (pause) the door
Chicks come around and put kisses on the jaw
So I ain't a player that need asistance to score
Any misses you saw
Climb on the couch kicked off the Christian Dior
I done popped 'till I sweat a christ in a pore
But I do it again if you missed it before
Its no big deal
I'm so big wheel
In them little cars with those big wheels
With a little box full of those big steels
Pretty little chicks in those big heels
For me it never gets old
Most girls is diggers who ain't 'gon never hit gold
I get under the sun when the weather get cold
8 ball five when the seven gets old

Hey hey stop that mama
Can't you see that I'm a East Coast stunna

Get too hyper
Maybe cause your chick like me
But I'm a black card swiper
That just pipe her
And you don't give a [pause] like me
They say I'm the sickest since Carter dropped
So girls jump to it with Vince Carters hops
Its the truck with the twenty inch startin' stops
That have 'em not knowin'
Whether they stayin' or goin'
They stare at the Airs and be sayin' it glowin'
And they like my style and the way I be flowin'
But that's when I bud in and say that I'm blowin'
Now you could make the choice if you stayin' or goin'

We could go any place in the world
And the jet hold twelve so theres space for ya girls
Nobody in the street gonna hear
That you givin' [pause] forty thousand feet in the air

Most of these tag alongs
Brag on songs
But can't keep it up like a Baget thong
Keep frontin' like you spend
While ya pockets get lighter and lighter like Michael's skin
On the other hand
I'm the kind of brother man
With fifty thou of ice just up on the hand
Bentley bright and rocky covered band
And a zone that'll tell the time in another land
Girls spread they legs same day I bagged 'em
Its the Mustard Gut, Mayo Magnum
In the twenty twos with the butter knife shine
That's why every body and they mother like mine
I rarely be
Where the willys be
There ain't been a dude this smooth since Billy D
Girl you need to make your move
The ego is what (pause) the Lakers groove

Countin’ up a million dollars every night
Hit the mall blow a four way
Kinda hard when you’re sleeping on Dolce
Wake up drinkin Rose
Killin’ that white bitch, OJ

Smokin that exotic, ridin' that foreign
Million dollar round trippin’, I ain't talkin' bout touring
Yeah, countin’ money til ya boring
Man fuck that shit (Jizzle where you goin’)
Flat screens on the wall, nigga Imax
Michael Turners on deck, nigga half backs
Dirty white bitch, yeah that Kat Stacks
We don’t sleep round here, we take cat naps
Wesley Snipes motherfucka this the money train
Swear the work came faster than the money came
Sometimes the money be faster than the cars is
If the feds ain't watching then them broads is
Could end any day and you know better
Now you watch the frito lay, yeah you know cheddar
Double bags at the spot, luggage in the place
Louie V on deck, luggage on my waist

I woke up sayin’ I ain't drinking no more
Same night in the spot drinkin’ Coco
Loso, bad bitch think she know so
Got a man cuffin’ nigga think he popo
She tryna go below the belt, thinkin’ low blow
I’m thinking oh yeah, he thinkin’ oh no
I’m on my high horse nigga, thinking Polo
Got the nine on me so I think I’m Romo
Uh, I’m about that life nigga
Bring you in the game, let you meet my wife nigga
Married to this shit, asking am I getting cheddar now

I’m the best that ever did it and got away with it

[Chorus]

You could tell he gettin' money and every nigga with ‘em
The gloves don’t fit him so they gotta acquit him
Ain't nobody seen it, but everybody heard it
The whole town hatin’, they waitin’ on a verdict
Tell ‘em niggas pop off, I’m waitin on a drop off
And I ain't leaving the block 'til I knock the whole box off
Yeah taking care of the whole fam
Bought the Porsche gave the M to my old man
More money more problems, more grams
More real estate, more land
At fight night I be ringside
I let them things fly, just put 1.5 under my king size
I look at the world through a king's eyes
I was born to spit bars and sling pies
I ain't wealthy yet but I’m quite rich
I just gotta keep killin’ that white bitch

It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train
Sometimes I ain't see no gain
Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim
Get shot or stuck up standin at them C-Lo games
But now shit with these skios changed
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain
Be saying ""That's nasty"", wouldn't give me no brain
Ya'll surprised F-A-B-O's sane
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes
I'm still here

[Chorus:]
My moma used to tell me
""Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen""
Who knew I'd have what it takes,
To be famous and one day I'd be rappin - no
My papa used to ask me ""Son, are you prepared?
Cause one day it could happen""
I dreamed about this game,
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no

I just want some peace of mind
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined
But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time
Some be like ""At least you signed""
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

[Chorus:]

Sometimes I wish I could go way back when
I could walk thru and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson
Everything was ok back then
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s
And I'm the one the po's stay trackin
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins
But I swear to God I won't never take O. J's actions
If I would've let this flow stay packed in
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons till Clue and Duro brings those
Gray plaques in
Yeah

[Chorus:]

One day it'll happen
That One day I'd be rappin
No
One day it could happen
One day I'd be trapped in
No"
Fabolous,Only Life I Know,/f/fabolous/only+life+i+know_21052079.html,"She said I wanna hold you down, but we ain’t never gonna be right,
‘cause you took out your fame in street life,
But that’s the only life I know.
She said the niggers dancing right, you ain’t never gonna be right,
‘cause everybody wanna be mine,
Instead of focusing on their own, dog.
But that’s the only life I know.

They say a woman cancel dates ‘cause she has to
And a man cancel dates ‘cause he has two.
Well, I got two dates, one with destiny,
I need more, baby, don’t think any less of me.
Try to joggle, slowly but came to struggle,
Sometimes I wanna hug the block, sometimes I wanna hug you.
Sometimes is about the check, sometimes is about checking that,
The nero said you gotta leave in 30 seconds, flat.
When the heat’s coming even if you need someone,
Leave it in the rear view, don’t look back, keep running.
Left for any passenger with the G running,
Hazard lights blinking in the beat bumping.
Air to the streets, I hear a sweet’s coming,
Air to your chest so I hear a beat from it.
She fell in love with a street nigger,
Tattoo my name on her petite figure.

She said I wanna hold you down, but we ain’t never gonna be right,
‘cause you took out your fame in street life,
But that’s the only life I know.
She said the niggers dancing right, you ain’t never gonna be right,
‘cause everybody wanna be mine,
Instead of focusing on their own, dog.
But that’s the only life I know.

There’s always money to be made, that you can’t deny,
I always made mine, never won who came to side,
I’m only human so if I don’t eat I can’t survive,
And mama said you’re not a man if you can’t provide.
The summers know a shortcut, it brings me home,
I worked so hard to get here, now it keeps me going.
By the time I get in what she made to get the old,
When I slide in bed she complain my feet be cold.
Caught in street life just like my bitch said,
I love the game, I love the hustle, just like Mitch said.
Yeah, I can leave the game, but it’s they still gonna love me?
When a new nigger come they gonna stop thinking of me.
Shawty watch the hustle movie she can never get,
How they make so much money, but they never quit.
I tell her quit for what? That’s the only life they know,
The street’s a dirty hoe, niggers try to wife it, though.

She said I wanna hold you down, but we ain’t never gonna be right,
‘cause you took out your fame in street life,
But that’s the only life I know.
She said the niggers dancing right, you ain’t never gonna be right,
‘cause everybody wanna be mine,
Instead of focusing on their own, dog.
But that’s the only life I know"

But these 'Young Bucks' remind me of 'Fif' and his
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-vileges
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny lil' nigga like Eddie Griffin is
Between smokin' and chokin' then you got to live
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
We 'posed to make the most of what you was paid, a gross
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, FIFTEEN YEARS

How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?

I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a f-ck
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck
If you're cool being taken down and giving up
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!
I done felt pain, waited but no help came
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain
Ever been told ""go to hell"" and felt flames
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper
It's all down hill and it only gets steeper
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper

It cost to be the boss, it aint get no cheaper
But there's a man above that we all under bro
No bread truck but he work wonders though!
After you wake up, everything is wonderful
You can overcome anything you undergo
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious

That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business
Beef is only good when you in the burger business
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal

Should I get to pumpin the brakes or mashin on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked... But I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashin wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life... I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger... Figures

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's followin me
Askin for my I'd whos car I'm driving
Po Po's botherin me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't wanna set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fuckin with me

[Cain]
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Everytime they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face askin for my registration and id
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they askin
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passin
Or maybe it's my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doin shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lye.. No stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes wanna stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's wanna frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

[Nate Dogg]
Ones for the money and twos for the show
Three must be for the motherfuckin po po'
I've seen ghetto kings fall to the floor
Cause they can't see ask [?]
(still some of y'all creepin with the Po Po's
Sleepin wit the Po Po's
Some of y'all walking wit the Po Po's
I ain't fuckin with the Po Po's)

[Fabolous]
Bitch!
They gon' have to put my back on the cement
Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
On my way back to the precinct
I'm back in the G-bent
Black wit the pre-tint
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
That's why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips.. To stick up in the ar's
Detectors in the dash.. To pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but it's cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hittin superman's chest.. Nigga

[Hook:]

[Fab:] shit man a nigga ain't even do shit awe shit here comes this dude right now
[Cop:] Alright buddy unfortunately you came back straight, you and your buddy
Scain Scholar get the fuck outta here I don't wanna see you guys around here again alright

And I keep a down ass chick straight on her knee caps
To keep the family business confidential

Invisible set glow
Full clip to let go
Back in the metro
Fresh off the jet though
Fifty grand richer from a thirty minute set show
Gangsta but i'm the flyest you ever met ho
Button up etro
The Air Jordan Retro
Million dollar neck row
Got homie upset so
Now I get the bank and make them petty dudes bet mo'
Told you from the get go
Ya'll can't deny it
I just supply it
For those who buy it
Now I ride by it
It might start a riot
Chicks won't quiet
Long enough to try it
Dirt they throwin' mud slides on my name

Least you know where my head at, now shorty where your head at
She gon' dive in head first, school me like the board of ed

Laid up in that all day, can't get out that waterbed

I'm tryin to help you open yo' eyes and see that
Ha ha, this some shit, cool shit, real playa like

[Chorus: Fabolous (Lloyd)]
Hey shorty, we can do it real playa like
We can go a few places that you say you like
See what a day is like when you be my a-alike
Girl just lay back, I'll do it the way you like
(Said it's the flyest thing, just the way we swing)
(Me and you, how we do, be so flyyyy)

[Fabolous]
You need to leave them burgers alone and make a steak upgrade
I'm filet mignon with a tape-up fade
I see things clear through these Mark Jacob shades
Like the clarity in these jewels that Jacob made
You sleep better knowin you gon' wake up paid
Hairstyle, nails filed, makeup made
We can shock South Beach, shake up Dade
In a droptop Phantom with the Drakov blades
I'ma stop by the barber, you can hit the shops in the harbor
Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on 12, dinner for dos
We, begin with a toast, end with a dose
Of the light green cheeba, rolled in a Cohiba
It's Sunday, so you know the Forge is
Weather gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky
We can show the world how to be fly, yessss

[Chorus:]

[Fabolous]
If you want to act Hollywood fine, but shorty let's do it
When we sittin on the hills like the Hollywood Sign
And every man lies, but not every man flies
Privately to Van Nuys
Range on the runway, driver to pop doors
Straight to Barney's, somethin we need to stop for
She like, ""It's early - what we gonna shop for?""
How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields
Real playa like dress, good black heels
No 'Hanas, we can do Katana's
You, me, and ooh-wee marijuana
Then slide through Hyde, might include Mood
Maybe go to Area, if it's in the area
The Friday's young, try things my way hon
Malibu ride, highway 1

Nothing is too much, everything you touch turns to gold
You make me better (you make me better)
I'm fly as I can be, but when you're with me
I can't help but notice, I'm more focused (but you're the coldest)
Girl you are so...

Ay shorty
Bring the Maybach, we got a long way to go
Just lay back, you had a long day, I know
And they whack, do it the wrong way, I know
I play back but have the song playin low
While - we six-deuce and let you fix Goose
In a glass with some ice, maybe mix some juice in
On the way to L. I., well I, coulda took the hell-eye
But we do more behind wheel
Hampton home, two floors for nine mill'
Real playa like two doors from Seinfeld
White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled
Hey, you gotta live one day right (right)
Well how 'bout from Friday to Sunday night?
Then back 'fore they notice back up in Lotus
Let the world know we back and we focused~!

If everybody a boss, then who's really workin'?
If they say they got that raw sh-t, that really mean

It's not just where they record
There's a cost to be the boss
They can't clearly afford

Swear to the Lord, there's guns like the audience
You put on a show, my 40 clearly applauds
Sittin' fifth row, I might appear to be bored
Plotting on a Kanye but screaming where's my award

Ballin' out of control, never won an espy
'Bout to buy a black ghost and call that shit sp
Glow outta this world, I'm coming for my Moon man
You niggas slide back like that walkin' on the moon dance

No glitter glean, handgun with a beam
Have some boys follow you, street fam, twitter team
Like you could fuck with me, oh, did it seem
Dr King and Def Jam ain't the only ones with a dream

I'm a grown ass man, this kid a teen
You're a spoof of me like if hip hop did a Scream
Audi Coupe, looking good so I went and copped it
Got that tt poppin' like a trending topic

My ride is matte black, my pride is that jack
It might get ya dog shot, even a cat smacked
Anyway though, styles don't apply to me
Jeff Goldblum couldn't be more fly to me

Shorty say right after the suck fuck proof
You hit it on the head girl, duck duck goose
You shoulda got the message that I chuck up deuce
Break 'em off and leave it, you seen my fucked up tooth

It's fuck a bitch, there's more fish in the aquarium
I rarely hear no, like when niggas ask you to marry them
There's no lights in the place you buy your jewelry from
Funeral fab, I'm just here to bury them

Reporting live from the beacon
Booth tired from the beatin', had foreplay all day
Prepin' the beatin' the mic for a threesome
With my vocal's bi-coastal, speakin' til their eyes totaled

Mr. Wi-fi, out a franchise go to
Magic, standby local's
Watch the track bust
Once I show my dick size to the pro-tools

I teach you how to have models screaming get behind me
E pills and Maybach's ain't gon' matter if your T. I. P. Is Tiny
Nevermind me, we could get knee deep in the beef
Seek me with the heat
But you'll need more to keep me on a leash

Here's a cc for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
Invest in Rockports and be easy on your feet

Give a few hammers, a few semi's
And a few snubs to a few crips
Couple vampire's and true bloods
Gambling in casino's, have a hunny handing me my c-notes
The modern day gambino

I'm careful every step I take
You the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
That'd be the last mistake you ever make
Me I chop his head off from a rooftop
And race it downstairs just to see if I can catch his fade

Like groceries when I'm shooting at fags
Make sure the breads separated
And put the fruits in a bag
Withstand the hatred

Dudes is falling off doing all they can to save it
But everybodys run stops ask Brandon Jacobs

What y'all call swag to me is all faggotry
Fours want blatt at me, that'd equal more casualties
Abort the strategy or get attacked
With that Duracell they put in your back
Now that's assault and battery

You can keep the bitching to yourself
There's beams on every burner
These lasers, a petition wouldn't help
What good is having shooters if they the type that miss?
Where I'm from, better be careful when you drive that whip

Niggas, put they life at risk for pies that flip
In my town Ben Affleck wouldn't try that shit
And if he did he'd get turned around burnt down
Tell 'em new jacks, it'll be a while
'Fore they eligible to earn the crown

Acid out the baggie, this is more than dope, flawless flow
Fuckin' off a sign, every whore I scoped to wore my robes
Strappin' up, the corner cold, critical, unquestioned
My opponents know
I shoot like Kapono, watch me own the show

Chromatose, toasted, gettin' money while I roam the coast
Stones and boats, mansion homes and hopes, I deserve 'em both
Overdose, time to earn my votes, watch me turn the volts
Voltage through a hater, this electric chair, danger

Yeah, I see ya, now make way 'fore it turn to diarrhea
Hear a microphone'll give you three of everything I wear, yeah
Models by the pier, swear, bottles, private Lear, steer
Style that's outta here, rare, thousands by the chair, squares

Sleep on me, you can't here, war with me is scurry
Get beat silly tryna lamp here, better bring your fury
Heat, I got a drop, Dampier, niggas try me barely
No one breathes, I need a ant's ear, pressure's necessary

Got my mind on the cheddar, kill my haters together
Bury 'em in abundance and starve they families' stomachs
Paper come in my thumb, it's brand new fifties and hundreds
On point, just like the drum is I'm warnin' them baby mothers

Got the hunger of a broke rapper
Kill you while I'm rollin' up then smoke after
Catch you at your show, snatch ya
Empty out the dough faster
Bentley off the scene, magnum Mo' splasher
Four-packer, Southside nigga spittin' coke at ya

This is for the fronters and the naysayers
I'm about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
They say I'm out of my league on this one
So when I get done, I want you to cut your fuckin' ears off,
Twitpic 'em

Lord, I want you to leave this vicinity
You gon' be around here 'bout long as Justin Bieber's virginity
This is Jesus identity, mixed with weed, Hennessey, Kennedy, King
Mixed with a kill-or-be-killed killer regime, I'll as you seen, switch

Y'all write all that hard shit, then y'all fall right off, it's horrible
My oracle is all I offer, so before I borrow, yo
Won't be here tomorrow flow, sorry, I will prob'ly adios
My body with somebody toast

This shit just practice, sickest rappin' Baptist, kill your pastor
Steal your Chap Stick, after that make you kiss a cactus
Then take your hoe, make the hoe give the whole clique fellatio
Everyone, that wasn't the whole entourage on hbo

Then after that, I tell her, I can't do much with you, shawty
I just found out I could fly to Dubai and hire Buffy the Body
Don't call us if the bitches ain't flawless
If they are, then we can hang, like Aretha Franklin braless

The drunk me can box like the sober you
The sober me be more nervous
Than Waka Flocka in the votin' booth
We beef like bein' deep and dumpin' Ks
You beef like Lady Gaga and her stylist

Y'all get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
My Feng Shui is a pump in the desert
You'll come up shorter than an Asian
Jumpin' out of a trunk in the desert
While my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine

Niggas snitchin', it's a shame, we call 'em male tattlers
Fiends touchin' they noses more than url battlers
It's hard to spit saliva when you spit fire
So I'll just pour sugar in your gas tank
Put a banana in your tailpipe
So the car can fit the driver"

I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin
Some where rhymin, or somewhere climbing
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me
I know these greaseballs, wonder how could they ever stick me

Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, cause the cemetary
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throw
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record
And the girls more than like you, when you running run
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you
You going on like thirty-six, flowin on some berry mix
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks
Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six

Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up
I just turn the system up and keep boppin
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection
Don't they see when I come through, how these people point in my direction
That's why I poke out my jeans, like my joint with a erection
Till I'm in a joint made for correction
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread
It wouldn't even surprise me, if one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga

Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flipping and pitching
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it
(nigga you know) and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent
I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap
Like A. 40 Cal, spittin on instrumentals I clap!
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back
I get you murdered if I think you a wrap
Cause if you don't show loyalty, then that show me where ya principles at
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact
I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it
Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement
And I blow off ya head for no reason, and just when I'm leavin
You don't know me ya on me homie, but the spread make us even, bloaw!

[Outro - Paul Cain]
And the bad part about it is man, haha
I'm only twenty years old man
And I'm just havin fun
Man I ain't even tryin man
Desert Storm's youngest, and in charge man
Paul Cain, man
Yo Fab man, you ain't even gotta go hard man
I got these niggas man
Clue! Holla at cha boy
Skatin Dolla

Fabolous,Respect,/f/fabolous/respect_20052288.html,"Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers
I ain't no killer right
But y'all niggaz gon' make me one
For real.. Leave me alone, shit
You fuckin with the wrong one brotha
I'm telling ya

I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about killin ya
With machine guns shotties and desert E dilligers
Putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggaz anatomy
And watchin him die slow
You need full clips to push up in the joint
When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint
'cause theses motherfuckaz will push him to the point
That you'll end up locked down doin push ups in the joint
But they'll box you in the corner
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you wanna
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)
Till there's a murial on your block and some candles
Who wanna die?

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
'cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respect

My teflons will have you screamin like wyclef jean (someone please call 9-1-1)
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm
Ima have more bury than that guy stephon
First they put that white seed over you brother
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
Next you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greavin
When you pull the marijuana
Ima wanna kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
But I'm loosin my patience
Fuck it send me to the island I could use a vacation
Now it's easy for me to understand
How you could just kill a man

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
'cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respect

I'd rather be judged by twelve
Than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man, or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga, then this right here nigga
Picture me putting my hearse
Like I ain't gotta a clip full a hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit em up outta here and get em up outta here
I got the juice like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm sayin prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him before the fucker run into me
I dunno, what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs goin into me
I'm just tryin to live my life
So niggaz better give me my respect or give me life

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
'cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respect

Look what you made me do man
Look what you made me do man
I didn't want it to come to the right
But fuck it..
Niggaz will push you to that point man
Niggaz will play with you so much man
Aggravate you so much man
That you wanna kill a nigga man

Low stamina rap niggas, you need ginseng

I bomb niggas, nuclear missiles is whistling

It's been a drought, coke prices is up, ching-ching
Shell a nigga from Brooklyn house to Sing Sing

Glass of pink for everybody

So I'm buyin' drinks for everybody
Problem is that I can't link with everbody
And everybody think they everybody
You think you Big Meech? No you don't
Bring the strip club to the house? No you won't
And I'd invite you to the top but I'm sure
It's for real niggas and you'd get stopped at the door

Yo, a real nigga never worry bout what a coward do
Time is money
So I respect what an hour do
One phone call
And the posse'll shower you
You know my regime is much more powerful
Same plans of course
Every gram is [?]
Get charged to the game cause every man's a boss
Respect my conglomerate cocaine
Cash in the stash and the mask
My connect is anonymous
You don't wanna problem with
Niggas that get your momma hit
No death where the flesh rule
Nigga I'm the shit no restroom
No room to rest
Them niggas'll test you
See where it gets you
Baptize these rap guys, the gat flies
Cocaine crack pies, big niggas get half size
When the sword hits the waist or the four hits the face
He gone need a prayer, put the call into Ma$e
I put it all in the coke
Put it all in the Chase
All in Wachovia
All in the H

Yesss - it's the return of the young hustle
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle

Then you might see me on the strip flashin
Like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight
So shiiiiiiit, gettin hit in my leg is like
I mean it coulda been a 2Pac vegas night
Or maybe a Notorious L. A. Evening
""Baby you okay?"" I mean well I'm breathin
Hell I'm even, bossin and I left
The money ain't right then I toss you to the left
Yesss, to the left, to the left
Everything is hustle to the death for the F-

You lookin at your new hustle, like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell, in my past hustle
Shorty work it, she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap, she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin, can't turn my back to the money
And truthfully you're cool but I'm attracted to money
So why don'tcha turn your back to the money and let it shake
I'm lovin how you move that smooth, you let it snake
But players don't chase at it baby we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm 9: 15, that means I'm hella straight

Got a deal, No sellin', Been supplyin since
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints
We done make ya eyes look bent, Just by the sense

Once I present the four fifth why comment
Im the type you tell ya dame bout
Push a fellow brain out

Luckily, I be feeling good in my bucket seats
Thug motivation: my coupe cost a buck 03
Mind of a hockey player: you could suck a d

That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec
12"" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

[Chorus]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it 'cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

[Chorus]

Ah, Yo
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, fam, bigger Bust of the stand if you can't reach

[Chorus]

Uhhh, uhhh
Fox then B.I.G.
Who fucking with Fox, who want it with I
Bust a shot for me and Big from the villfredo sky
Got my Joan Fross shit on, hop off my dick
Canary bangle-round I ain't gon' 20 carrots on this bitch
Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six
Bed-Stuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 Jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
'Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
And no Stranel ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill nuns squeezing the lhama
Bog roll dutty, Fox and Poppa

Run for your gun you suckers
B.I.G. I'm a get them motherfuckers
Don't you worry about a thing, bang-bang-boogie
I got a few chickens that's gon' work that noggie
In the lack with a sack go and put it on the mat

Uh, turning it out, run in your house

Yea, you know the crazy thing is
They gon talk about you when you ain’t got shit
But then they gon talk about you when you got shit
And see they gon talk even though they don’t know
What you had to do or what you goin through
Sacrifices

[Verse:]
Seeing yo family scrambling, that’s sanity damaging
Gotta make a move, can’t just stand and be mimicking
Have a man who be managing, randomly standing in places he shouldn’t
Tryin to move that Pamela Anderson under…
Standing these hammers and grandma keep paddling
Cuz them niggas from the other side of fence will be vanishing
New day, new funeral, my grandma be panicking
But I gotta eat, she just handing me sandwiches
And her appetite like mine got me standing in scandal and
Ridin shottie with my homie but I plan to be Phantoming
Bumpin something I could feel, fam I need sample
And not no Bieber on the hook, I need Anthony Hamilton
I got molly, I got white, I be Hannah Montana
And like amigo it’s illegal but it’s grams in my hand again
So it probably ain’t right but this the land of the scandalous
To your own friend snake, you probably can’t understand it
Then when you go you just gone, all we missing is payments
Now the king fall for my freedom that I risk just to pay
When ain’t no love for these streets, ain’t no kissing the pavement
Yea I’m sick and tired of shit, they insisting be patient
But for what? To wait on that eviction note?
I woke up to some real shit, them dreams I have is fictional
Unless I go and get it, don’t stop get it get it
Too alive, threw money in the loop dances with it

[Hook:]
Jesus died on that cross, that’s a sacrifice
Niggas dying for they cross, that’s a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge, that’s a sacrifice
If Shawty took that charge for you that’s a sacrifice
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
Just do what you gotta do baby
Gotta do what you gotta do baby

[Verse:]
Baby gotta do what a baby gotta do
Baby mama ain’t got it but her baby father do
Never pick up baby boy but his Mercedes powder blue
Now mammy sick of daddy and the baby got a flu
And was crazy bout it too
Cuz all she see is lies
When she look him in eyes and her baby got him too
Pay a little child support but what’s so shady bout him too
He’s in the club he pop Rose but won’t bring baby bottles through
I know things apart, I ain’t say we gotta blue
But if you walkin round in Prada buy yo baby Prada too
Tellin hoes yes, we can’t get a maybe out of you
Shit is fucked up and I don’t think the baby got a clue
What’s a lady gotta do? Bend over for dollar tips?
Cuz ain’t nobody giving young single mothers scholarships
Mama just got diagnosed, breast cancer
So when they aks what she gon do, her best answer
Is I don’t know, gotta do what I gotta do
I don’t know about yo bills but the ones I gotta do
People always wanna try to tell you what you gotta do
But there’s a difference in with those who don’t and those who got it through
It’s called sacrifices, hate to see my man gone
Bed was like a pop fly just to bring my man home
Can’t just leave him out there
Gotta believe in yo self even when it’s doubt there yea

[Hook:]
Jesus died on that cross, that’s a sacrifice
Niggas dying for they cross, that’s a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge, that’s a sacrifice

Shut ya heat down, you'll quickly be embarrassed

Stick to living savage, I'll stick to living lavish
Picking up a bad bitch, the chick look like my ad-libs (niiice)
She calling me Fab Pitt, you can be my Jolie
Swing big sticks, shorty you can be my goalie
You ask too many questions, yo, you can be the police
You know what time it is girl, you can see my Rolie

You can't see me but you know a sick nigga in it right

Stuntin' in the sickest air max, oh

Still I put it down in the mattress

I wanna be your number 1 fan, but from the stage
Know it's hard to see way up in the stands

Way too many of them with one hand

I understand, but damn [x2]

[Verse 1 - fabolous]
Yea, slow down baby, let me be your yellow light
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice
And when you slap this ass, it shake like jello, right?
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair
And she know they talking but she never gon' care
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear
I can't imagine what a fall upon lebron's ear
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line
Niggas buy her watches just for making time
Fake say ""give it up"" never had to ask
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames
The same dudes will see her and give they last name
Funny how I became the apple of her eye
The game went south and I'm a rapper from ny
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love ""trap or die""
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy
And fell in love with a 2009 verse
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut
You know me? I can spot a swan from a duck
My approach? Smoother than an armani tux
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange
Asked ""can we meet again?"" she said ""that can be arranged""
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained
But for now she hopped into a platinum-colored range

See baby, see you gotta get ur mind right while there's still time left.

Still spitting, I'm the city's saliva
Want the keys to it like the designated driver
Sometimes I listen to my old rhymes, it feels like I had the k-k-keys the whole time
Ain't gotta give me credit, I take cash

Those old niggas trying to live off their old bodies
These young niggas think they killing shit, they nobodies
But this ain't about old school/ new school
Cause my old school look better than your new school

So when he did go, I aint even cry
I had reason, but that aint even why
How could he have failed if he aint even try
I ask no questions, I aint even pry
Truthfully I wanted to I can't even lye
Like a canceled flight, that aint even fly
To just walk away, like you aint even my
Like, like, like I aint even your
I can't even say it, I aint even sure
He shouda gave me everything and left me even more
But he left me without saying what he was leavin for
And that's when I became a man
And that's the day he stopped bein one
This year I became a father
And imma die bein one, wassup son

Nah not his date, I'm talkin bout his daughter
Now that's stuntin like your daddy

And imma die bein one, wussup son

Tell that nigga, we on our way out to England

And don't be scared cabby, the Yay I be slingin

We can hop in a lid and fly where you wanna be
Yea, you a G, the type that ryde with them cameraz

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be my thug baby
Because I need one tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be my thug baby
Because I need one tonight

[Verse 2:]
Allright, okay...
You just gotta stay patient boo
I'ma make sho to take you, where eva you dream a vacation to
You can push the grey station thru

How da hell??? Been tweekin out
How you been sneekin out, spent weekends out
She'll be tired of trainin dat month
You probably be fakin' like you came and you ain't even nut
Miss I'll pipe you til you get a pain in yo gut
The kid'll be responsible for changin yo struck
Wherever you hurt, I'ma rub it down
I be ready to smack it up, flip it in public now
I know how to get you hot, I know how to hit yo spot
If I take you home, I know how to keep you stylin
I know how to keep you smilin if I take you home, let's go

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3:]
I think it's just that ladies???
I'm in love with my red 6, and got a crush on a navy Caddy
I like'em deepcut, bust, with crazy fatties
They be wishin' I was just, they baby daddy
I'm the one that make it real easy
For you to just drop'em like he hot, like he Lil' Weezy
I ain't gon never make you feel sleezy
And I'ma put the roof up on the drop if it feel breezy
I love the way you smerk and giggle, jerk and wiggle
Throw yo legz up while I work the middle
Already told me how you strictly be witt'em
Now I'ma show you so much cash, that you'll quickly forget'em
I'm young, but know I'll have you in a bungalow
Fillin yo stomach wit Cris, yo lungz with dro

Fabolous,Talk About It,/f/fabolous/talk+about+it_21447977.html,"I got something to say, no
You gon' listen today, no

Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well I'ma talk about it
Baby, can we talk about it? Hey, oh no
(Yup, we most certainly can)
Can we talk about it? No, no
(And I ain't gon' take too much of your time)

Yeah, first thing they say is stop killing
But can we talk about the cop killings?
Before we talk about the crack dealing
They acting like blacks ain't got feelings
Knowledge of self is through wisdom
So can we talk about the school system?
Young girls raped and knocked up
Will Hillary release niggas that Bill locked up?
Can we talk about the cost of living?
We can talk about guns, but we forced to get 'em
It's a new race every time you cross the ribbon
Might've skipped the beat, but we never lost the rhythm
You don't understand so you ain't able to feel it
When my momma's in pain, I ain't able to heal it
Fatigues and field boots, the outer wear
Sponsor what, vote for who, fuck outta here

Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well I'ma talk about it, baby
Can we talk about it? (We can't remain silence)
Can we talk about it? (We gotta speak up)
Can we talk about it? (They say it's justice)
Can we talk about it? (I feel like it's just us)

Look, I know y'all tired of talkin' and going to demonstrations
But if we don't speak up, you help the discrimination
We need a one-on-one before it's goes gun on gun
People skip the front page 'til they see they son on one
And now it's too late to talk, the topic has changed
They shootin' at black targets like these cops at a range
Can we talk how many died for the birth of a nation?
And how this national anthem ain't worth my ovation?
And if I am standin' up, I'ma stand up for equality
It's brutality, we need more than that apology
Can we talk about it, not just artists, but the players too
Y'all on the field, not the mic, but y'all can say it too
We need more Kaepernick and just what the rapper kickin'
We need more than Instagram posts with smart captions
Black actors, stop actin' and start action
Kerr got the credit, forgot about Mark Jackson, damn

Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well I'ma talk about it, baby
Can we talk about it? 
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it? (May I have your attention, please)

Sensitive subject, but can we talk about it? (yeah)
Step straight to it, not try to walk around it? (nah)
How we make America great again? (how?)
If we open up the doors and let haters in
Wow, it's nothin', we winners
But that could all change, since Trump won, we finished
Much realer than we thought
I'm sayin' all I really wanna know is can we talk

Can we talk for a minute?
I just want to know, know, know
Can we talk for a minute?
I gotta know right now, yeah
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?"

One running with Fabolous, who knew as well as I do
Every fed in the country wanna nail my crew
Before I hit the tens, I'm getting bailed by crew
Be back downtown, bagging chicks at L-I-U
Cause money ain't a thing no more, I use to sling the raw
Now I'm off in spring to tour, in Singapore
Might catch me getting head from a bilingual hoar
Who never seen so many diamonds in her ring before
I'm a boasting fly bro, soon to lay on a coast of Cairo
Roast the hydro, type of cat you would say, is supposed to lie low
And V two shades with the toast and the Tahoe

Cubans to the belly, and still throwing links on
Ya'll cats know me, I be throwing clinks on

If do find me, then I will crash your shit
If you think you was a'ight, I will blast your shit

And, ain't no love, just trying to get my thing off

That's not love

[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]
Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die
The answer's right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don't cheat
I just play my position, get mvp
I get money, don't shit come free
It's my life and I run it even when
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
See...

[Hook:]

[Fabolous - Verse 2]
Say what's on your heart if you're real
Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot
You empty clip niggas aint got a shot

These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother

[Hook:]

[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]
Look, as the crooked World revolves
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggas pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they f-ck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it's leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That aint love

[Hook:]

[Fabolous - Verse 4]
Life is but a dream
Aint always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless

That's what we work so hard for Fabolous?
So they can point their fucking fingers
And call me the fucking bad guy?

[Verse:]
I guess I'm the bad guy
The fingers is pointing
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in
They be asking fellas why (why?)
It's cause the streets is watching
With an envious ear, jealous eye
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin
I keep the home selling two way contact like Johnny Cochran
Be the same dudes, testing your patience
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments
These playas been playin' foul
And I done learned my lesson with flagrants
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment
I'm what they been trying to do, not do
I'm the kid, they been lying to you
You need people like me
I'm so F-A, B-O, L-O, you-S

Quit they job and live off the child support
How could you stand there, smile in court
I'ma just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts
You better sign a pre-nup
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from? '
I love the way your butt switches
But non of these s*** bitches
Is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail
I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony Larussa
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters

Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real

Come on
What type of bad guy give fellas death, females hugs
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs
I ride with ratchets, clips under the cl rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong
Cause even if I get locked
My money won't let me stay unrighteous for wrong
Case dismissed, the da even liking the song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club it's cool
But don't change the subject fool
And start askin if I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin
Fyi, stay the fuck from 'round me
You good guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me

dunked on a bunch caught ali-oops on the rest of them
I got the lean on the ""J"" now
it really don't matter if we play in arenas or playgrounds
throw it around the back so it look fly when I pass
just to avoid the block go high off the glass
I'm killing them out there they gon' have to bring caskets
this all I hear after the baskets *swoosh*
but I ain't even warm up
and still pull from where it counts for 3 points and leave the form up
you must be insane if you give me the lane or perimiter
the crossover will sprain every limb on ya
I never woulda, ever coulda
thought I could come off the baseline and jump over seven-footers
soon as you step out the locker room you now can see
how live it gets in 2003

I'm the crowd favorite and I believe the fans
love the way I finger roll it with either hand
my handles pull it through presses plus I can play the lane
and block shots like bulletproof vestes
I often be found in the paint waiting for I miss
so I can slam it back off the rebound
then I show off with class
look the other way when I throw off a pass
call it when I go off the glass
hope ya'll play better ""D""
or I'ma keep scoring until the coach hold his hands like the letter ""T""
When I put pressure on the ball they be feeling on lock
remind 'em of a jewel theif when I be stealing the rock
shorty over the summer you might have boosted an inch

Don’t make put one of yall in the grave
I’m playin with money, yall niggas savin
Pain, I’m a cause of something yall couldn’t phase
Couple niggas shot, just one of yall niggas brave
Rushin him to the er, rushin me to the stage
This the Soul Tape 3, nothing we need to say
Leave the handguns at home,
Fuck em, just bring the K’s for the homies in the county
With nothing it’s eating trays
Since I started eating my motto was eat away
Being top 5 was always followed by doa
Thought I was on top on a bottle that kia yay
Then I went straight from the block to the vma’s
The way that hand move on the clock you’d be amazed
You just feel the burn niggas, you don’t see the blaze
Take a good look in my eyes, you’ll see that haze
Right, left, life or death, either ways
Same tough guys, a problem they see you late
Never show yo hand and they dying to see his face
I’m married to the game, you dying to get engaged
You only gangsta when the lions is in the cage
Your life’s worth nothing, the goons had it appraised
I might do the rafe maroon with the beige
Bad bitch with me, dooby with the shades
If you ain’t self-employed then truly you a slave

[Verse: Fabolous)
Tooling to your ways, brain on your winter coat
Niggas burning bridges then expecting you to send a boat
If I’m comin at yo neck think a bullet in the throat
Never gon forget you niggas, got him written in my notes
I’mma send the goons, I snitched on 7 folks
They gon kill you just cus, don’t make me send the loks
New blue hunneds, spending C notes
Fresh pair of tems, vanish P cotes
I’m a standup nigga, never been a joke
Riding since pedal bikes we reflectors in the spokes
I slipped her for my arm, put the game in New York
You apply a little pressure and them rookies feelin chocked
Niggas looking washed up, there’s something in the soap
You lookin like Adrien Runner & The Ropes
My shoes is too waxed, I should be in the sloaps
Might come through in the bubbles, same way they send the pope
Parading now on 5th ave like I’m in the float
That new 8-50 push button like remote
Control is hard to have especially when you broke
They sleepin cuz they eatin but you hungry and you won’t
Shawty mouth wet but her stress is in the scope
Greatest of all time so her name has name is been a gold
She say you got them people waitin for it then it’s dope
The game is fucked up but if you back then it’s hope, nigga"

Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my car
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring
And the kids are snoring
And my ankle's in a sling

I'm sifting through sand, sand, sand, sand
Looking for pieces of broken hourglass
Trying to get it all back
Put it back together
As if the time had never passed
I know I should walk away, know I should walk away
But I just want to let you break my brain
And I can't seem to get a grip
No matter how I live with it

[Chorus]
These are the last blues, yeah
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left

The next time the phone can wring my neck as it gets no answer
And of the time that I've spent telling it my roots
I'm shaking in my boots
And still it looks at me like an old friend I've betrayed
The darkside of the doormat is the one your shoes have frayed

But there's a light on in chicago
And I know I should be home

Loaded guns to our heads

Cause tonight it's just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot
So we only lose a little
We are alive

We're gonna die
It's just a matter of time
Hard times come
Good times go
I'm either gone in an instant
Or here til the bitter end
I, I never know
What I've got will make you feel more alive
I'll be your favorite drug, I will get you high
I will get you high

We are alive

But don't take love off the table yet
Cause tonight it's just fire alarms and losing you

And I’m the holy water you have been without.
And all my thoughts of you, they could heat or cool the room,
And now don’t tell me you cried, oh, honey, you don’t have to lie.

I wish I cared enough to know.
I’m sorry every song’s about you,
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love.

Hired a construction crew, 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream.

I sing the blues and swallow them too

My words are my faith to hell with our good name.
A remix of your guts-your insides X-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop

I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills.
I could write it better than you ever felt it.

I breathe you in, but honey I don't know what you're doing to me

I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight til the ending
This will not be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it baby, I'm talking no inflation

Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves

I meant more like a relapse
Now and again I think ""His and hers, for better or worse""

Are the ones around my eyes

The ringing in my ears gets violent.

Get hitched and make a career out I robbing banks

When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotion won't grow
And we're changing our ways,
Taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart
Again [x4]

Why is the bedroom so cold
Turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect run so dry..
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again [x4]

Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good...
Just can't function no more?
But love, love will tear us apart again [x7]"

But I can't stand to be around you
""go home""
Ill walk myself to you
Ill walk myself away from here

""go to hell"" is all I thought for seven weeks
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people
Looking glossed just like i remember a summer ago

Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
""go home""
Ill walk myself to you
Ill walk myself away from here

""call me back"" I'm pleading with a cork in my head
It wouldn't be the first time
My pillow has been mistaken

Where can I go when I want you around

Empty another bottle

Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears
Rather ones that just don't care
Cause I know
That you're in between arms somewhere
Next to heartbeats
Where you shouldn't dare sleep
Now I'll teach you a lesson
For keeping secrets from me

Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying no once in a while
Oh once in a while

And did you hear the news?
I could dissect you
And gut you on the stage
Not as eloquent as I may have imagined
But it will get the job done(and you're done)
Every line is plotted and designed
To leave you standing
On your bedroom window's ledge
And everyone else that it hits
That it gets to
Is nothing more than collateral damage

Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying no once in a while
Oh once in a while"

I'll be your best kept secret
And your biggest mistake
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday

So where me like a locket
Around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue

So where me like a locket
Around your throat
I'll weigh you down
I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue
You look so good in blue

Keep Quiet
Nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret
And your biggest mistake
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday"

So put all of your anger on.
In the truly gruesome do we trust,
I will always land on you like a sucker punch.

I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.

If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you,
You, would never sing along.
Cast them out because this is our culture,
These new flocks are nothing but vultures.

Because they took our love and they filled it up,
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,
Now I'm just numb!

Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,
Now I'm just stuck!

So could you please hold your applause?
Take this sideshow and all its freaks,
And turn it into the silver screen-dream.

Two more weeks, my foot is in the door.
I can't sleep in the wake of saturday.
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended.

Pete and I attack the lost Astoria with promise and precision and a messed up youthful innocence.
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived more than an hour.

There's no more anniversary

To make your heart swell and burst
No matter what they say, don't believe a word

'Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it
I'll keep singing this lie
I'll keep singing this lie

Are we going up, or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light

We're traveled like gypsies
Only with worse luck and far less gold
We're the kids you used to love
But then we grew old
We're the lifers here til the bitter end
Condemned from the start
Ashamed of the way
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts

'Cause I'll keep singing this lie
I'll keep singing this lie

Are we going up, or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light

There's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up
And another around to help us bend your trust
I've got a sunset in my veins
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay

The best part of ""believe"" is the ""lie""
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up
(x2)

(Are we going up or just going down?)
Are we going up, or just going down
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears and put them on ice

For the first time in my life.
It won't pass me by.

My room's a mess and I can't get dressed.
I gotta be out by eight o'clock.
Deep inside I know the answer. (I know the answer)

Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory

So Wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home
Joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth (his teeth)

And we're throwing stones at a glass moon

Whoa songs for the genuinely and cunning, whoa-oh

We keep the beat with your blistered feet
And we bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing
Slept through the weekend and dreaming
Of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
Got postcards from my former selves saying: ""How've you been?""

Robbing lips and kissing banks under this moon

It was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper from the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter

And maybe I bit off more than I could chew
And overhead of the aqua blue

Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window
To the pitch black streets

And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again

More the war like the carnival bears set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe

It twists my head just a bit too thin

Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said, I said,
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back.
True romance is dead, I shot it in the chest then in the head.

And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your prince,
Because they've got me in a bad way I've never seen a heart I couldn't break.
It was never about the songs, it was competition,
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest...

Which came first, the music or the misery?
Where high-fashion, were last chances.

I'm casually obsessed, And I've Forgiven Death,
I am indifferent yet (I am a total wreck),
I'm every cliche, but I simply do it best.

With a nod and a wave
Of my hand cause that's just the kind of boy
That I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the after life
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat
For the die hards

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

[Verse 1]
I just need enough of you to dull the pain,
To get me through the night until we're twins again,
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again,
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again.

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a jet black crow droning on, and on, and on,
Up above our heads droning on, and on, and on,
Keep making trouble 'till you find what you love,
I need a new partner in crime and you're my shotgun.

There's a room in a hotel in New York City,
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.

And honey I only appear so I can fade away.
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream,
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame.

And there's a jet black crow droning on, and on, and on,
Up above our heads droning on, and on, and on.
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck,
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day.

Miss flack said I still want you ba-a-ack

I've got troubled thoughts
And the Self esteem to match
What a catch
What a catch

And all I can think of is the way
I'm the one who charmed
The one who gave up on you
Who gave up on you...

Na na nanana na na nanana
Na na nanana na na

What a catch, what a catch, what a catch, what a catch

I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calender
This way you will always know

I've got troubled thoughts and the self esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch,
And all I can think of is the way
I'm the one who charmed
The one who gave up on you
Who gave up on you...

Where is your boy tonight
I hope he is a gentleman maybe he wont find out what I know

We're going down, down
In an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging

Dance dance we're falling apart to half time,
Dance dance these are the lives you love to lead

This aint a scene it's a goddamned arms race,
This aint a scene it's a goddamned arms race

One more night and one more time,
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
Growing up, growing up...

I've got troubled thoughts and
The Self esteem to match
What a catch..."

What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?

What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this?
What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?
What's this?

In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure them in their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt this good before
This empty place inside of me has been filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?"

The picture was on the back of a packet of cigarettes,
When she touched him he turned ruby red,
A story that they'll never forget, never forget.

Girls are getting back rubs,

My old friends become exs again.

We ended it on the floor,
I don't wanna go home alone,
Where did the party go?

And not enough all at once,
You know I only wanted fun and you got me all fucked up,

And everyone's looking for relief,

And mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle
Clear your throat and face the world,

Only breathing with the aid of denial

Stacked on 1 to 6 the gallery is hushed,
Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado,
The city sleeps in a cell notwithstanding what we all know,
Hang on a rope or bated breath whichever you prefer

And everyone's looking for relief,
A bidding war for an old flame's grief,

The cause, the kid, the course, the charm and the curse,
Not a word that could make you comprehend,
Too well dressed for the witness stand,
The press prays for whichever headline's worse

We hit a couple divvy little bars
We noticed there was quite a lovely lady
Sittin' at the table next to ours

Now Barney, who was pretty friggin' wasted
Got up and stumbled over with a groan
He said, ""Hey, just between us, my Neanderthalic penis
Is as massive as a Stegosaurus bone!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix

“Oh, yeah! He is a bastard”
“Wow!”
“And he, and he really does not give a damn
About the feelings of women!
And it's sad! It's really sad”
“Well you think that's bad, listen to this”

One day I met an ape of great charisma
Magilla the Gorilla was his name
He wore a little hat and matching bow tie
A fashion which has brought him great acclaim

I said, ""What do you see as your career-peak?
Of all your many flashy escapades”
He said, ""Well this is funky, but you're lookin' at the monkey
Who’s responsible for bringing you the aids“

“Okay, okay! Listen to this little gem""

I had a conversation at a party
With famous Rabbit Hunter Elmer Fudd
He told me I just had to see his rifle
And dropped it on the table with a thud

I said to him, “It’s quite a lovely firearm”
He told me his fiancé likes it too
He said, “This maybe corny but it really gets me horny
When I press it to her temple while we screw!”

“Aw, God! That is one shit bastard!”
“Eww, you’re not kidding?”
“Yeah, that, that kinda’ stuff’s against the law too, I think”
“Well, I got one that’s even worse than that”

On Friday night I went to get some candy
Some soda and some chips and other stuff
Along the way I passed a little alley
And there I saw that K-9 called Mcgruff

I said to him, “Hey! You’re that famous crime dog!”
He said, “I only work from nine to five!
And now it’s close to tennish and I got a job to finish
‘Cause as you can see this hooker’s still alive!”

“Uh! Imagine Mcgruff beating up hookers!”
“He is a dick, he is a dick!”
“Yes, yes! He’s a nasty cartoon, but I can top that
Listen to this!”

One day as I was strolling through the forest
I happened on some mushroom covered turf
And there from underneath a patro-fungus
Emerged the one and only Papa Smurf

He said, “This is our secret mushroom village!”
I said, “Then I’m the first to see these views?”
He said, “I’m only kidding
‘Cause we only keep it hidden from the Asians
Adams, Faggots, Blacks and Jews!”

“That Papa Smurf sounds like a monster!”
“Oh, he’s a dirty, nasty racist and a bigot and homophobe
And you know what I did when I got home?”
“What?”
“I called up Gargamel and I told him where the village is!”
“That’s sweet""

“Can I go next?”
“Of course, sweetie!”

“One day I met a”
“Holy crap! Look who’s here, it’s Jason Alexander!”
“Hey, Cartoon-haters!”
“But, but I was supposed to go next!”
“Quiet, honey! Mr. Alexander wants to talk!”

“I couldn't help overhearing what you were talking about and I agree
Cartoons are real fuckin' assholes!”
“Yeah, that’s sorta what we’ve been trying to communicate”
“Well, get a load of this!”
“He said load!”
“I know! I heard!”

I once met Scooby-Doo at a premiere bash
He looked a little haggard and he stunk
He said, “The trouble started last December
When Daphne made a pass while she was drunk”

And now he’s got a child out of wedlock
It’s dealing his career a fatal blow
I asked him, “Where’s the baby?”
He said, “Jason, buddy, maybe now you see
Why fuckin’ Scrappy’s gotta go!”

All cartoons are fuckin' dicks
They get their kicks from being pricks
It's a quirk, we just can't fix
'Cause all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

“Wow, Scrappy is the bastard child of Scooby and Daphne?”
“Shocking, isn’t it?”
“Yeah! Hey, you douche bags wanna wrap this up?”

So let us leave you now with one suggestion
A bit of wisdom you can take for free
The Mickeys and the Goofys and the Daffys
Are not the gentle souls they seem to be

So anytime Sylvester catches Tweety
Or Tom has got poor Jerry in a fix
He’s in a fix! Sit back and just observe it
‘Cause the little s***s deserve it
For all cartoons are fuckin' dicks

Always a succulent treat
(While I suck that, you suck this)
Aren't you a sight

You're a delight
(Damn you, you fool)

The diaper change was quite a job
The grossest I've ever seen

And I grunted and pooped out a poop

Feeling I was born to lose
You are there to say that life's okay
Thank you for it all dear booze

When a chilly wind is blowin'
Telling me to sing the blues
You begin to show your soothing glow
Thank you for it all dear booze

Drifting, flying, on a cloud of whiskey dreams
No more sighing, eyes alight with moonshine beams

When a love is unrequited
When she brushes off my woos
You are there to mend, my fluid friend

You can kiss your life goodbye.

Yeah when you use toad,
It will mess you up.
It will make your mama cry
That's no lie,
You'll choke on your tongue and die

You've got to give it up
You got to give up the toad now
It's no joke buddy, give it up
You got to give up the toad now
Or you'll croak
You've got to give it up,
And don't smoke
Or you will see,
It hurts to pee

There'll be blood, gushing from ya
Every time that you cough
And forget getting lucky,
It falls off

Yeah you'd better wise up
'Cause I'm telling you
Toad is one Lando for bins

Got to give it all up
Or you're gonna see
Your whole life will hit the skids
And your kids will be born without eyelids

You've got to give it up
You got to give up the toad now
Thanks to you
And just give it up

For movies stars to play the Whitehouse game

You've got a lot to see.

The town of Vegas has got a different face
Because it's a family place with lots to do

Where in the fifties a man could mingle with scores
Of all the seediest whores well now his children can too.

The country's changed, that is except the South, and you'll agree

No one really know's, my dear lady freind,
Just quite how it all will end
So hurry cause you've got a lot to see.

The baldness gene was cause for dread
But that's a fear that you can put to bed
They'll shave your ass and glue it on your head
You've got a lot to see

The pc sge has moved the bar,
A word like ""redneck"" is a step too far
The proper term is ""country Music Star""
You've got a lot to see

Our flashy cell phones make people mumble gee whiz
Look how important he is is life must rule
You'll get a tumor but on your sugery day
Yur doc will see it and say ""wow you must really be cool""

There's no cure for death.

With the wonderful hope
Of returning our home.

Don't cry, don't be sad, big brother.
You're not the only guilty one.
There's only one road before us,
We will purge our sins completely.

I cannot blame you,
I am not hurt at all.
Well, we sinned
By wanting to be stronger than everyone else.

But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, Did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
Party just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops
That were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 Square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?

Everything VV's, I'm gone to the maximum
Young nigga flood out a 'axima, flawless the face, then run through a pack of them
Everything classical, everything magical when they was checking my catalogue
Eating on caviar, smash on a stallion
Draped in medallions, yeah

Look on the calendar, yeah we compatible

You astronomical, way too phenomenal to not have her naked where I land
I got a second option, and fourth and fifth one whereever a nigga staying
I had it falling right out of my pocket when I was just smashing her, she seen the bands
Her body Coca-Cola and she seen a can
The Glock was still on me while we was romancin'
Think I fell in love with this girl, came from France
She caramel, what'd i get a tan
I need to pay her when I get the chance
Gave her some drip, gave her a whole lot of splash

She ain't got no teeth, she know a young nigga eat beef
She want me to leave, she know I'm not a rat, I got cheese
I was quieter than a mouse, when I got it in her mouth she couldn't breath
I was thinking like, ""Jeez,"" she done got a lil schlong on my teeth
I done took a little E, I fucked her, made her pee
Made her part of my team, then she asked me for a ring
I was already red bottom, came on the scene
It's hard to trust you when I'm paying this carpet green

Y'all give her capital murder, her swagger killer
Shawty got more bags than a drug dealer
I put her in a Patek, I put her in the c’s
I'm on a whole 'other level with her
Had to get a penthouse just for the freaks
So they could all come and sleep with us
We do nothing that is normal, everything we do is super gigantic
We don't put on fugazi, everything we wear super Titanic
I just caught me a wave, feel like a nigga that jumped in the Atlantic
One hell of a car collection, pulling it up, it's panoramic
Picked her up in a Cayenne, soon as she got in she got nothing on

I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no bitch who need that kind of nigga, scram, ho

[Verse: Future]
Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch you better cut it, shawty I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh you greedy in Tahiti, I just seen you flaunt
Aye tell that girl you 'bout to settle, [?]
Aye see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo
Oh you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from makin' mula
Oh you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art
Backseat of the Benzo, the amg
Can you love a thug, is all make believe
Pure fantasy, I see through it easily

They trying they best to shine, they trying they best to take off

I took the profit from the coke and slapped it right on my feet
I tried to hide a half a million cash, it took me some weeks
Man, that bitch got some head so good, you gon' swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed the molly with the lean, now we laid up in a suite
I'm in the hood posted up, I know the police gon' sweep
I keep a hood ho, so I can keep that dough where she sleep
She down for a nigga and she ride with that four-fifth
I put that AK in her name, but I keep it on me
I'm brand new when I step out from my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos, trying their best to compete
I got a style so outrageous, I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets, all you niggas know me

I'm running up to every car before the car even parks
We went from Reebok and Girbauds, now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be Future, I'll look at you just like you're my son
I got a rap check and all I hang around is ex-cons
And if I ever get in trouble, my bitch gon' pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yopper and she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice, cause it was already done
These niggas showing out for me, so now they ordering up ones
Been on some futuristic shit, now I'm back where I begun

Put the codeine in the Sprite, and then I'll have me a drank
Smelling like a pound of loud when I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp, in the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign, and I'm cool as you think
You need to turn it to the max if you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes

Future,Big Rube,/f/future/big+rube_21058605.html,"The snake bites
The scorpion stings
Weak niggas plottin' to steal crowns from kings
But that weight's a heavy burden on even the broadest of
Shoulders
The thickest-skull thugs and even the hardest of soldiers
The climb to the top filled with pleasure and pain
Peril and loss, profit and gain
Many hands once held open for a pat on the back
Now grapes a knife in the night on a silent attack
They wanna stop you from loving'
Stop you from laughin'
Keep you in misery, malice and madness
They path in life is to make your path rougher
Your joy is their poison, your suffering their supper
Once success is tasted, they say that you changed
“I thought we was folk, man, you just ain't the same”
“Come on, let me borrow a bit off your name”
Be a sucker if you want, they gon' hate you just the same
When surrounded by darkness don't get swallowed by it
Pain, anguish, and fear, don't get followed by it
All habitual line-stepping niggas be quiet
You violate the game, you disqualified
Gone…"
Future,Big Rube Speaks,/f/future/big+rube+speaks_21081948.html,"I'm stainless
Tethered by earth and flame
Mixed with time and pain
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
And the product I done came with
Not blameless for the straps and the dope that I hold
The sacks that I sold

Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges

The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with
Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens
See the clear path that I used to couldn't see
Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be

Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
My sweat and my tears dull pain

And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known
I was born to reign"

They know we ain't got a blueprint to this shit
We just came into this shit with it already

Baby mama flagein', she don't get no pardon
Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the Banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out your spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case

All I know, identity theft, I buried all the credit cards
G1 had me in the kitchen, sellin' hard and doin' fraud
Took me out the 'jects, now I'm flyin' private jets, nigga
'Member snatchin' chains, I got my own around my neck, nigga
I caught five kidnappin', but I ain't no babysitter
I caught five kidnappin', how you let me take your nigga?
Posted on the ugly, I jump out, go to bustin'
My baby mama dusty, got my little one out here musky
Skrrt, skrrt, pull up in a vert, call it a pullback, ayy ayy
Pull up in a Wraith, they be like ""Who is that""?
Pulling up in luxury, thank God, ain't no more strugglin'
I'm rollin' 'round, I be duffelin'

I just beat the case, I'm ridin' in a double R
Spread the cheese with your people, gotta feed the squad
I bought my mama and my brothers, them another car
At first I was playin' with this shit, but now I'm goin' hard
It's like my baby mama feel like she the superstar
I threw away the Fossil watch and bought an Audemars
Was in the 'Yota, now I'm ridin' in the luxury car
I was off the chain, now a youngin' on the charts
I was ridin' Suzuki, ayy, now I'm actin' boujee, ayy
Now I'm coolin', foolin', I'm just 'bout my music
No more shootin' cee-lo, poppin' wheelies on the Banshee
Can't be thuggin' no more, homie, I stay in a mansion
I'm on mollys and the Xannies, feel extravagant
Took me off the ugly corner, I'm ridin' panoramic
You hate the way I'm transitionin', I'm corporate thugging
You miss when I was headfirst, when I wasn't gettin' no money

Pour up the medication in the Sprite and stir it 'round

We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass em around
I say everything triple time, Rollie, AP, Hublot triple time
I just know the ones you call upon, I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat, everytime a nigga talk a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette, run it back you hear my intellect
Celebratin like the championship, celebratin like the championship
Celebratin like the championship, celebratin like the championship
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you...
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just wish you'd stop perpetrating like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, niggas straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson; put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone - waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' off of me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another 60 thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick and got my brain washed
And for the shit that got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil lil liquor out, pour a lil malt liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

[Hook]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 2]
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene it’s homicide
Diamond pinky ring – a lollipop
Fuck the hate – I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin’ harder than the Pacers
I been tryin’ to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I’m making U.S.D's overseas
That’s U.S. dollars that you can’t achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said “Nigga please.”
For that white girl, she said “Nigga please.”
Playin’ poker – now we’re back at Strokers
I forgot her name, but her pussy’s soakin’
When I seen her on a pole…
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin’ myself that I’m still gettin’ loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control this
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles
These niggas who bogus, let's pour up a pint
I'ma fuck around and faint like I'm Kid Cudi probably
I fuck around and faint, I'ma fall on a drink
Rockin’ Tom Ford, poppin’ molly
Married to this motherfuckin’ money

Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 3]
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo, I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in the shit and some mo'
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might go after Madonna, I get the crack in the summer
Strapped in the lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partna
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don’t you panic panoramic companion
They was tryna' serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that comes with these millions
I'm taking everything that comes with my children
Yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Pour that bubbly, drink that muddy, drink that muddy
When we're cuddling, yeah I'm covered in
I was dug in it, I was just loving it
That's for them other niggas, that's for them other bitches
They ain't for you dog, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you shorty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely

I got the truth in me, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, ""Boy I think the money's startin' to change you""
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong

Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I take (still comin')
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make me fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

They take my kindness for weakness

Take my kindness for weakness

They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am

I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies

You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded

Pussy be fucking my life up, and yet at the same time its giving me stamina
My role model fucked my life up
Two bitches in the same room, no light on
So easy getting 100 thousand when the night up
Got cake cookin' up cake bake
My life fucked for a ladies bit
83 to 88, money comes so fast

[Hook: Future]
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
Girls it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true

Know I'm out here getting it baby
Why you tryna to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Money coming stu-stupid fast
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Getting money, then I count it all
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ohhh fuck my life up, ohhhh

To land up in a penthouse

And I seen the dim vie
I'm on that prickle danger
Trying to clear my thoughts

Graduated from finesse schools

Hey you niggers start hating on future
For one time
I commit a million crime
That ain't enough for you
I'm a sing a million rhyme
All the shit I've been through
I was grinding hard
Niggers trying to hold me back
They want to see what we can pluck
They want to see what we sack
I got it though
It worked out
I kept the lawyer
I sits den as
With no royal
Niggers try to chase paper
Then you got to take the slider screen up
Till we get screaming
I can sleep right
Then they put a hit on your head
Then you walk around with a price
Million ain't way what you see
I put spicer in my date
And I strapped her with the rental
Her chasing after paper

Need a big booty bitch to fall in love with me
I can make it hard for you to fall in love with me

All my whips got extras now
Why so many hoes on the low? You know
Why my niggas extras? (Extra, extra, extra)
Why my bitch so extra?

Pour me another one, I cannot slow
Until I can't feel no more pain
Pour me another one, I cannot slow

Jump out this bitch, got the water again
These bitches calling me Aquaman
I got her phone number callin' again (Callin' again, callin' again)
Benjis on benjis on benjis again
Thats all I been on since you got with him
Ain't been the same since, I wanna save my pain
You know it's all before, man, these hoes all in love
Had to hit all the clubs, swapped out the ones before
Big booty from my city, never seen nothin' like
Nothin' like hit it, quit it

My bitch asked me why I always stay extra-d out
All my whips got extras now
Why so many hoes on the low? You know
Why my niggas extras? (Extra, extra, extra)

Get the backend at the door and let the dogs kill (Dogs)
Point 'em out, then turn around, that's how we let 'em in
Paranoid, one conversation, then I switch the SIM (Oh)
This took like NBA business, I ain't talkin' scrimmage (NBA)
You know I'm James Bond with it, Harden with the finish
The whip's got curtain options in it, I don't need it tinted
Just need the option not to see 'em when I'm ridin' in it
Used to spend checks on my Nikes, now they pay me (Yeah)
Got some Bulls cheerleaders and they wavy (Alright)

Roll some OG gas, I can't let 'em breathe (It's lit)
Pop me ten to three, I can't let 'em sleep (Pop it, pop it)
Flyin' through the clouds in somethin' heavenly

I'm a street nigga and I stay faded
Never worked in a gym, but I weighed it

First off, you get the ammo, then you cock it (Straight up)
First off, we had to blast off like a rocket
I put the Patek water on, but I got options (It's lit)
PJ takin' off and I ain't stoppin', no

Fishscale, nigga, I can't fuck with no laws
Never fear what's on my lens, I see fugazi
I should pee on this bitch and make her pay me

I’m gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals
Maybe one day I’mma get out the drank
And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don’t watch TV, we count Fettuccine
4 and a half, it’s right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a ‘Ghini
You gon’ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a biznite
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, I’ma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ain’t gon’ make you a pile

Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut
Talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging 20 Crip cause
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Open up that fye
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off
I grew up on the side you gotta make yourself a boss
Niggas'll shit on you any chance they get
Cross you out on a lick
If you ain't ready for the ending then quit
It's a dirty world, you gotta get your hands dirty
I'm going for the title with my hands on the rifle
I put in the same work you put in, survival
Looking at my rival, they looking suicidal
Keep them bodies off wax, I can spot a rat
Let the play, brrrat! 

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
Slang a bunch of packs, and go and snatch a Benzo
I played them streets as a young nigga, ain't never liked Nintendo
Them gangstas in the yard, them my motherfucking kinfolk
They'll kidnap you and yo broad (in broad) daylight, no pretendo
I grew up 'round a bunch of monsters, call that pressure on ya
Be so scared for ya life, you call the police on ya
You ready say you ready
You gon' starve or you want fetti? Yo life'll change a second
Good or bad, don't open yo mouth, make sure you shut it
Ain't no telling who listening, make a wise decision
I'm from 'cross the tracks, like Boosie
If you ride, you better know who shooting

Swear A Nigga Just Seen A Ghost, That Money Comin In Over Flow

Astronaut At The Same Time, Gone To Mars At The Same Time
Pluto, Jupiter Same Time, Pick A Planet At The Same Time
I'm Trippin, I Feel Ignorant 
Keep Rolling, Keep Sipping, She looking, She with it
My Girl Gonna Have A Fit When She Find Out How Hard I'm Diggin
Her Friend Shit I'm Trippin

Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'

Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, 'cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man

Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice
Gotta keep a drink cool
Bust a nigga, Tadoe
Runnin' up my pesos
Runnin' up my cake though
14 carat gold, I'm a motherfuckin' ruler
Upper echelon, you my motherfuckin' student

Fuck that fake shit nigga, fuck that fraudulent pretending
Got young Doolie on the body and I really do miss her

Two hundred on a the tab, baby this is not a Jaguar
You don’t have to ask, keep that hammer on me, MC
You show these niggas love and they gonna show you a barrel
It’s Taliban gang, we in a whole ‘nother era
Our money ain’t the same, I’m in a whole ‘nother bracket
It’s five thousand or better, what I spend on a jacket
Finesse a nigga momma in the hood when I’m trappin’

You niggas wanna go to war, it’s like in ISIS
That bitch gon’ fuck your homeboy ‘cause she triflin’
They got my lil’ one down the road on the hummy

Fly, shit, only, that's just the code that I live by

Try to hold me back and doubted me, they did it several times
You can never underestimate a nigga like my kind
Ima' rebel, I'm a warrior, and I'll destroy ya
All these dues I paid you go need more than a judge of lawyers
You put my back against the wall, Ima' come out standing tall

Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk

Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' gotta buss a cape

Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider

Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's

Tell that bitch ""leave me the fuck alone!""
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package

And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'

Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash
Gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapid
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas 'til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie, nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse 2: Future]
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gone wake up and smoke on some blunt and fuck
She gone keep it so real with a nigga that-
I'ma come back and always gone fuck with her
Bend a curve and spray like a model but
I was working and serving Antartica
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury
Fuck around teach you that recipe
Fuck around, you gone be out of here
Make her say ha like a nigga was Juve
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Take the tool inside the club, just incase a nigga ever gotta use it
Get a pint of code an pour it up, nigga

Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue

Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move

Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that’s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

Buy my Range, make 'em go insane

My guillotine, drank promethazine
TEC and beams, go to those extremes

Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
Before the business, Theodore lenses
Theo-Dur prescriptions, focus on the missions
Intermission, never take a break
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
Ain't no way, ain't no fuckin' way
We call the play, we didn't come to play
Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game
They gang, we gang
But they are not the same (Freebandz)

Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say ""grow""
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Australia (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4
Know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (how many?)
Take the mask off so you can see

Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Burn it down nigga while I wait
Burn it down on good drink
On good drink, on good drink
Money long get your money long
Get these yellow diamonds like a honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Getting doped up that's everyday
Hermes on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day

Fuck a bitch in a big way
And I hit her right on the staircase
Hit that mouth I go bareface
When I'm in that mouth I go bareface
Pain pills took a double dose
Gotta bank roll with some iron on me
They told you I was real, real nigga
They wasn't lying on me
I get better and better with time don't I?
Drinking codeine like wine don't I?
Step on the scene, got diamonds on me
It's a dirty game, niggas dying in it
The black range got a rind in it
Hit her throat then dive in it
Flip an officer, switch sides in it
Niggas switching sides, they some pie niggas
Thank god they ain't my niggas
Stacked tall like I'm hiding it
Steal a car use for Friday night
To hotbox at the ride in

Whippin' the yam, whippin' a fifth of the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Been rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Swerve in the new Maserati
In a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from 12's
Movin' and squashin' them bells
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that dope
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss or a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pride in my left
Leanin' over, over to the side

Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'til the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tail
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
Yughh, look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I mention the monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos

You wanna come to paradise?
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?

[Verse 1]
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
All these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
They know damn well this wasn't promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left 80 racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession

Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Yeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah
We get in our feelings, yeah
I don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah
I'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah
Keep my promise, take my love with you everywhere
And hell no it ain't about no braggin' rights
But even if it was, shit I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
I'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn, she know what to do with me
And right now I don't know what to do with you
I don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you
She caught a red eye, leavin' L.A
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty

[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession

Keep goin', keep goin'
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse]
I make Yeezy Boost moves in my Reeboks
It ain't gon' never stop
Tryna run a billion up until my income pop, yeah
You'll get rich and have problems that you never thought
It bring tears knowin' we came up out the sandbox
(Bringin' tears to my eyes)
Made it out the trenches, it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball, seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful, they envy
Tryna shake the devil, on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me
I got so rich, nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet, it wouldn't graze me
I done been considered a fake, it don't faze me
I done came up out the ghetto, my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil, these niggas hatin'
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers, this shit brazy
Icy-ed out the Hublot, these niggas lookin' fugazi (Yeah)
Money stack tall past the ceilin', I can't be jaded
I done came from sleepin' on floors, you can't persuade me (Yeah)
I been takin' other niggas' hoes, it's gettin' outrageous (True story)
Rich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages (Pluto)
Fuckin' with my ego, but I never lost a lady (Facts)
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious (No cap)
20 percent of my dames, I shipped 'em right out to Vegas (Gone)
You can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' (Wizard)
You can see my past and where I was on they faces (Weak)
I done flipped the truck over and crashed, ducked the agents (Facts)
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist (Freebandz)
I been gettin' richer each year, feel like I'm racin' (Uh)
Tried to tell you the form of love but you wouldn't take it
Hard work and perseverance, they ain't related
Poppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations (Fuckin' up my family)
Ten milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant
I can see it vividly at the crib, Rico basement
Watch him get the mula, I was sittin' back bein' patient (I was bein' patient)
I was sittin' back, programmin' my brain, I was in trainin' (Yeah)
I be in my coupe, Maybach and nothin' ain't have to trade it (Skrrt skrrt)
Thinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided (Swear I was)
Now I Double R and Ghost it up, I feel spacious (Woo)
I don't feel the safest, but I feel gracious (Yeah)
I thank God every day, I don't feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies (Sheesh)
Probably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it
Home invasions, and you ain't have to persuade me (Nah)
Cut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day
Came from whippin' out the bowl, Tom Ford suit and tie (Yeah)
Get my grandma to serve my dope, that ain't a lie (On God)
You can tell I've been broke when you look into my eyes (Future)
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky

[Outro]
Bringin' tears to my eyes, oh yeah
Nobody done noticed 'til the jet was in the sky
Bringin' tears to my eyes, keep goin'
Gotta tell The WIZRD, it's a story like a book
Tears in my eyes, I can't forget where I came from
I lost a lot but it's alright
It can't be worse, might lost my main homie to the streets
You should've never give up on me without hearin' my side of the story

So he ain't gotta go through this
Don't get caught in my fit

They tracked me 'cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect

I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fall

Love me or hate me, get richer than Pryor
No fronters, no necklace, my nigga will buy it
The plug tried to give it to us, we took it
I learned the game, nigga, then I got money
The chains and rings and they came from the pain
18 karat gold on my fangs
I hustle, deal with killers, stuck in my veins
Ran through 10 mil like the avenue

I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle

I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today

Fuck all these interviews, that shit commercial
Ayy, I run up with Murda
These niggas, they ready to whack so
Shit, I'm ready to stack some
I get money, young money hereditary
We had syrup in the four when they never did it
Had the molly's on Pluto, they never did it
Had them Percocets when you would never do it
Used to dream of the shit that you never do
Now I'm livin' the life that you never knew
Out my all red, don't open up every door
They got red on these carpets on every floor
Got a stash for them ratchets in every door
Took a half on a half, I went overdose
Sold a half for a bag, deal at your door
I go play in the place, they say, ""Bonjour""
Knowin' knowin' exactly what I done before
If you shoot on command, I'ma love you more
All the dirt that I did, I try wash it off
When it come back to haunt me, I never know
Wish I knew all the day when the time would come
Ain't no friends in this game, it's another war
Put a whole 'nother style on another broad
Went to work for the love of my little boys

I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed

You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered

I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance

Come with me to paradise, takin' all my jewels
Ten chains on my neck, feel bullet proof

16 passenger jet, it hold me and my comrades
We got tigers for pets, got a Bugatti in my bookbag
Show my watch love then you gotta show my wrist love too
I took a pistol in the coupe, I didn't deny it
I got the cash on me and I can't hide it
After you ride it

Came up off a brick
Bought a Richard Mille, my new watch don't tick
Drippin' in Louis V, made a movie, and Prada another film
It's the Don Dada, I stand this Lamborghini on one wheel
Twelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill
Monday all the way to Sunday, pick a time to drill
Gettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)
One thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)

Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me, when this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the .50 carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you

Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy

I got all my niggas with me through the bad and the good
I got all my jewels on me and I'm still in the hood
I can never stop from grinding cause I made it out the mud
I can never forget when I was on the block selling drugs
Codeine calm my nerves I was getting high since a kid
I took all my problems and I turned it all into hits
I can channel my anger now I can go make me some billions
They trynna' predict my next move but I say fuck politics
Long as I stick to the formula I'm never gon' switch
Freeband gang for life thats the blueprint

Always sit and I laugh, I just laugh
Cut up the bass, cut down treble

I wish I could take everybody with me
But I can't so I ain't
But I ain't gonna lie, if I could I do it
I know different languages, speak a few of them fluent
In other words what I'm tryin to say I ain't in the USA
I've been tryin to stay away, the states ain't big enough for me
Right now I'm in Belize
You say you called, I was probably sleep
It's midnight in Georgia, where I'm at it's noon
And ain't' coming back that way no time soon
These niggas talking bout they new cars
To me that's a waste of money
I'm never home buying multiple luggage I'm trying to stay gone
Black called me from the bing
Told me hold it down I told him hold his head
I guess we're sayin' the same thing
Number one rule of the game, play for keeps
Sleep with one eye open, these streets a beast

Cross my heart, Cross by my heart
Spit chrome heart, help me spot the fakes

Shall not be harmed by any weapon formed
So I'm not alarmed, plus I stay armed

Plus I done got better so the hatin' done got worse

You think Rocko got them millions, that ain't yo business

But if it's one thing you can count on
You can count on me

That you did for your work several years ago

And I'm still wearing my shoes,

Friends are the ones on whom you can depend
He's my friend he's not my friend
Friends are the ones who are there in the end
He's my friend they're not my friends

If you trip over I'll catch you fall
If you kick my dick I won't break your balls
If you get drunk and vomit on me
I'll make sure you get home safely

If you cross the road and a truck struck you
I'll scrape you up and reconstruct you
I'll cheer you up if your depressed
If you get murdered I'll avenge your death

Friends walk together, la, la, la, la
Pop and lock together, sh, sh, sh, sh
Me and him together, la, la, la, la
Me and Jim forever, uh

Friends go jogging at the track
Friends borrow money never pay it back
Friends do not let friends to crack
Friends go out and grab a snack

Friends drink beer in the sun and like girlfriends
That don't mind if you have more than one
Friends tell you when your fly's undone
Murry your fly's undone

My uncle John had a special friend
They dressed alike his name was Ben
I've never seen two friends like them
They were very, very friendly men

One ring to bind them, one to find them, one ring to rule them all!
Yeah, little Frodo!
You've got to rule them!

Come on, rule them with your ring, yeah!

""We'll never make it! There's thousands of them and only nine of us!""
""Ohhhh...""
""We made it!""
""Hooray! We made it!""

Hey Frodo, what you doing wearing the ring?
All powerful jewellery, is that your new thing?
I know it's hard when you're little more than 3 foot 4
Your little ass so close to the floor
Trying to lead your fellows to the gates of Mordor
The fellowship
Yeah, the fellowship
I don't rap about bitches and hoes, I rap about witches and trolls
Just passing on the words of the Elven king,
Wisdom to all
Frodo! Don't wear the ring!

And then we can float in a moat and be freaky, freaky
Let's take my body and we'll cover it with honey
Stick some money to the honey
Now I'm covered in money, honey

I go outside onto the ledge and push my ass against the
Glass
You can act like you don't know me
I'll take a cup and then I'll put it on my head
And I'll just stand there being freaky with a cup on my
Head

I told you I was freaky
I told you I was freaky, baby
You didn't believe me
Don't look at me

I told you I was freaky

Girl, let's get freaky

Let's make two life size cardboard cut outs of our
Bodies
And then pose them into sensual positions
I'll paint the wallpaper pattern onto your naked skin
Stand against the wallpaper and get off like chameleons

I flip some clips on my lips, I clip some chips to your
Hips
I nibble chips off your hips and watch the moon eclipse
I'll go outside and get some leaves and pretend to be a

You can be a squirrel and store my nuts for me

Brings

And make some homemade wings
Gonna fly so high with makeshift pillow wings

Wings

Here I am all dressed in snakeskin
Now I'm in you kitchen making love to your cake tin
Oh no is this the one your baking
I told you I was freaky did you think that I was faking

At 8pm I sell my underpants on Ebay
At a half past 9 I hold a seance in your hallway
At 10o'clock I have some ghosts for a threeway

Try to make it delicious,
Try to keep it nutritious,
Create wonderful dishes.
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
Nobody compliments the meal

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I feel like a prize asshole
No one even mentions my casserole.
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
You coulda said something nice about my profiteroles

Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye,
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive,
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs,
And the assistant suggested I try a ladies' size

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit I'm a man!
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
Get me a small man's wetsuit, please

It's my birthday, 2003
Waitin' for a call from my family

They forgot about me

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, Mum
I call my friends and say, ""Let's go into town,""
But they're all too busy to go into town
So I go by myself, I go into town
Then I see all my friends, they're all in town

I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings.
They're all lined up to watch that movie
""Maid in Manhattan.""
Have you even been told that your ass is too big?
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?
Have you ever been told you've got a weird-shaped head?
Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away?
Once again, they forgot about J
Were you ever called ""homo"" 'cuz at school you took drama?
Have you ever been told that you look like a llama?

I'll catch you in the corridor, a smart casual blouse
You brush past my cubical, I'm instantly aroused
I watched you at your desk this morning, filling out some spreadsheets
I could not help but picture you spread out on my bed sheets
I watch you from the water cooler, talking to finance
I had to take my paper cup and pour it down my pants
Well, let's get out of these clothes
Let's get out of this office
Is that a tent in your pants?
No, that's a two-bedroom cottage
Gonna feel your boober in the back of the Uber

Well, you've got one hot leg

From a big word book
A dictionary?
Yeah, that's it, thanks

And my underclothes
You look good nude?

And I trimmed my pubes
And they're the perfect length of pube, oh

Can't fight this fire
Can't fight this feeling
Let's take it higher
I'm gonna spunk on the ceiling
You can touch my boobies, like they do in rude movies
As when we're finished we'll have to replace all the duvets

Yeah, it's a primal calling

We should go back to work
Well, I've got spunk on my shirt
I'm going to wipe down the ottoman

We walked to the top of the hill and we ate sandwiches!
Yeah! Oh, we just grabbed a sandwich, and put it in our mouths. Oh, that's the only way to have sandwiches! Oh Jenny, tell me? Do you still walk? Do you still get into sandwiches in a big way?
I still walk a lot, but I'm not eating as many sandwiches as back then

Kind of?
We were standing at the lookout...
Oh, I remember exactly what we did at the lookout. We just looked!
... Out! Across the city from our little spot on the hilltop
Oh, it's so pretty from way up there

We talked about how the lights from the buildings and cars
Seemed like reflections of the stars
That shine out so pretty and bright
That night...

It was daytime
The daytime, of the night...

Do you remember what you said to me?
Not word for word, actually, Jenny, but I remember there were some verbs
Well, you said, ""Meet me here in one year""
You just needed some time to clear your head
And you seem to have done that

No, not at all, 'cause we adopted him. I can't believe you don't remember, it was a very difficult process!

Lost but happy at sea
Petrov and Yelena said to me, 
Shouldn't we have something to eat?
But I said there are plenty of fish in the sea, 
BUt all they can see is me

They said, ""Any last requests?""
Biding my time, I say ""Yes! 
I want to party just us three
Lost, but happy at sea"".

So we drank all night from the keg
I passed out then I woke with one leg
I said ""Petrov, have you seen my leg?""
He said, ""No"", and he went back to bed... 
But he looked suspiciously well-fit.

Three days later they were hungry aga-a-a-in.
They said, ""Any last requests again, my friend?""

I said, ""Umm... Do you know the Rolling Stones?
You know like the Rock Concert, going ""More! More!"", 
You know?""
Ah... It was a hilarious, hilarious moment in a bleak, 
Bleak time of my life.

So, we danced all night to the Rolling Stones.
When I awoke they were chewing on bones.
Yelena was sucking blood from the tub, 
That's when I knew something was up

""Hey Petrov""
""What?""
""What is that you're eating?""
""Nothing""
""It looks like meat""
""Oh, this... It's just... one of those... fish""
""How come it looks so much like my arm?""
""It's an arm fish""
""What about the fingers?""
""Fish fingers""
""You see, the thing is my arm seemed to have been
Hacked off at the elbow last night. I was just
Wondering if you might have seen it?""
""Oh yeah... Look at that - no arm over there. Oh... 
Don't you hate it when that happens... I don't know -
You were very drunk last night. Perhaps, you lost it in
A fair game of chance?""

Rambling through the avenues of time
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
And by chance her eyes fell onto mine
So I sat and acted all non-nonchalant
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Reading the future that lay in my hands
My shadow played a bass clarinet
(Where you going with this bret?)

We waltzed down a moonlight boulevard
Just two silhouettes in the mist
(Ah yes)
Days went by and years went by
Moments went by when we kissed
(When was this?)
She said your beard is woven of heartache
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
(Uh bret, could you please move over to your right?)
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
About the moment we first met that day
(I'm trying to watch tv)
Then we reminisced about how we first reminisced
(Oh yeah? Sounds a bit gay)
She handed me a broken memory
A keepsake to forever most say?
A brief taste of love is as sweet as any

And with that she made her way
(Oh yeah? What was her name?)

She said her name was a secret
Then she said her name was cherie
(Was her middle name cherie
So it's a secret cherie maybe?)
Mm, maybe
(What'd she look like?)
She looked like a parisian river
(What dirty?)
She looked like a chocolate eclair
(That's rare)
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
(Oh nice)
And the rainbows danced in her hair
(Aw yeah)
She reminded me of winter's morning
(What frigid?)
Her perfume as eau de toilette
(What's that mean?)
She was comparable to cleopatra
(Quite old)
She's like shakespeare's juliette
(What thirteen?)
The bohemians of soho did pirouettes
As we waltzed through the streets of manhattan
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song
(Bret, did any of this actually happen?)
There's a girl I described she's as real as the wind
It's true I saw her today
The other details are inventions
Because I prefer her that way."

Ejected, cast out to the sea,
Disconnected, they didn't want me.

Unprotected, like a baby in the snow,
Dejected, like a clown without a show,
I objected, pretended I was unaffected,
But still ended up rejected.

Like a cake shop without any cakes,
Like a cornflakes box without any flakes,
Left all alone in the world
Like a little laughing girl

Who's been neglected, feel like I'm cut into two
Or bisected, slung, flung, tossed, threw
Or trajected, treated as though I was infected,

Good cops been framed, put into a can
All the money that we're making
It's going to the man

What man? Which man? Whose the man?
When's a man a man? What makes a man a man?
Am I a man? Yes, technically I am

They're turning kids into slaves
Just to make cheaper sneakers
But what's the real cost?
'Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper

Why are we still paying so much for sneakers?
When you got them made by little slaves kids
What are your overheads?

At the end of your life, you're lucky if you die
Sometimes I wonder why we would even try
I saw a man lying on the street half dead
With knives and forks sticking out of his leg

And he said, ""Can somebody
Get the knife and fork out of my leg, please""
""Can somebody please remove
These cutleries from my knees""

And then we break it down
Acappella jams
Breaking it down, let me break it down
Jamin' out, just jamin' out, yeah, yeah"

Goin' to the party
Sippin' on Bacardi

Will be made of Origami

Tell the players
Make it understood
It ain't no good
If there's too much wood

Make sure you know

Wanting to play him, but they don't even pay him

With the years doors have been locked and windows closed
And the things I'm sure I knew are no longer due
But I see comfort in my home, in my heart
To make a kind of peace, it's a kind of peace

And above me if there is nothing and no one knew I really care
It's just a now, a now I prefer, not the future and not the past
So put the chairs to one side and let us dance
It's a strange kind of peace

It's a kind of peace, it's a strange kind of peace

You've been places I've never been.

Come home, come home Angeline.
You've been places I've never been.

You took the small change from the job in the hall,
Be back in an hour but you're not back at all.
The children are crying, the flowers are dying,
There's no food on the table,
I don't think I'm able to cope,
You've been places I've never been.

Come home, come home Angeline.
Come home, come home Angeline.
You've been places I've never been.

Cheap perfume and alcohol, dancing on tables,
With kissing for strangers all laughing and howling,
And jokes and tall tales that ain't funny at all,
Bluffers and smugglers, boozers and gamblers,
Jump old queens and tarts at the babbled bar.
Oh, they've been pushing you too far.

Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight
For the love of that girl

Greed's all gone now, the panic subsides
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Try to put myself on on the inside

Let me know I'm just on the outside

It's gone, gone, gone, gone,

Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap,

14 years old and hard to the core,
I'm walking home making plans for war,
My hands was cut, my uncle says 'what's up? '
Let me guess, your clothes are in a mess, you're in distress,
Sit down, take five and let me look at your knees,
Your still alive son, please take it easy
Sometimes you have to let the world know you're not bluffing,
But enough is enough, don't loose your life over nothing,
Scuffling in the street is no way to die,
And I don't want to have to meet your mama's eye,
So try and listen hard before you fall into the trap
Of making war over a baseball cap.

Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap,

Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[2nd Verse]
She told me her name was billie jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

[Chorus]
Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(do think twice)

[4th Verse]
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son

My tv barks at me, from the corner
Life on the street is like a sauna, it's too hot.
Put bars around what you've got,
And the whole city lucky that we ain't been shot.
We got full blown decent into argument
Here we go.
Times to overthrow the parliament, so
In these struggled times
I wanna know, do you
Make a stand or just follow the flow
Even though, you know y' leaders are fullup of ego
Do we go where the others go and lay low
Only moving on someone elses say so
I say no!
What's in my heart is unexplainable
I ain't a fool
And happiness is attainable
And even on the days when rain will fall
I still plan to love and I always will
It's a calling from when I rise in the morning
This is a love we were born in
Ya tap it and it just keep coming and coming and coming

[Lsk]
Love is you, love is us, love is...

[Maxi Jazz]
Hmm. It's a powerful thing that can make a man sing
And bring people together with strength of feeling
Now, be connected from the floor to ceiling
Ecuador to Beijing become all the same thing
Like a movement, love too strong to deny
Born to fly but we stay grounded and I don't know why
We have a powerful tool, no need to cry
With it you separate the truth from a lie
The point I wanna make,
Is you could never escape from your fate,
The mistake is to take without giving.
So, break the tradition.
Make a decision, cause no matter how hard you try
You're still in prison,
If ya born with wings and you never fly
Listen, you don't stop,
Especially when the going gets rough.
That's when it's real
And I love that stuff,

Love is you, love is me, love is us, love is free
Zip up your front all ya want

Heart of stone, Have a care, I carry traces of death in my hair,
You know my breath stinks, I leave shit everywhere,
So be aware I'm unfeeling Don't you dare try appealing to my better nature,
You better wait, you're missinformed, Ain't nothing warm about me,
Cold and gray, concrete clay and steel, And what else is real? I mean the actual deal,
People seem to love living under my hair, Some of them call me London,
I'm also known as New York. Anywhere in the world you find me I talk the same bad talk,
Walk the same walk from side to side, You're transparent to me,
There ain't a thing you can hide, Derive glamour from the stamina it takes to survive.
You think I didn't know it's over with your face like a rat
Now give me your cash and go Before you're heart brakes,
You're living under my wing And all you got I'm gonna take, I'm a dirty old man.

I sit awake for my people to release the pain, So I can know peace again In my skin,
Sin diceit and mistrust soaked in, I think I might just fuss Often drops of woe,
Streets flow with tears, I fall down all around your ears.
If I could, if I was made of wood start a fire, no lie,
I can afford to smoke sacred fire, Cos I wouldn't bet on people changing just yet
My eyes are wet and my heart is full of fear and regret,
So you're catching the rough edge of my tongue, I started young,
I got teenagers carrying guns. I hear you wanna hold me to blame, but we're the same,
So for me win society and feel the shame, I'm a rough old man.

I didn't know anything was wrong,
And last night while I was thinking it through,
Trying to find who am I and what d'you need me to do?
Don't leave.
There's a record you used to play,
There's Judy singing 'best to be without you',
And I know just what she's singing it for
Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?

Finest silk to touch your skin,
Don't know how to write a love song,

Although she friend recommend certain cream and tease her
She favourite tipple is bacardi breezer
Claim she 31 but no-one believe her
Love randomer restaurant with she friend anita
You should meet her, anita, another big eater

Slipped disc for the waiter then theres always a feature
When they run go carrying food for them two creature
One night she come so much rice she nearly have a seizure
Fall off she chair, licked she hair and catch amnesia
Wake up in a&e and bellows she want pizza (give me food ya)
Doctors quickly sign paper and release her (one time...)
Cough, 'nough police to police her
Fatty boo you better pray no-one sees ya (this time)

Be careful of the things that you do
Say now you got plenty but the plenty could be few
This is my chance to shout it in other avenue
Say don't you be a sinner, don't you keep all for you

I said a long time no you start warm is a ripple
Every lickle dime, every nickle, you are trouble
Watch you're little head fatty boo
And give the dog a bone that could never be for you

Nicknamed fatty boo but we call her mel life
Changed forever when she discovered chanel
Now she, has a mind to buy designer apparel
She no, favour gazelle, but she bounced like hell
Whenever she spya something to die for on the fashion channel (17... Breezer... Chhhooomm)
And one like tinkerbell
Fatty, big like two church bell in parallel
Cats walk and mel never match up too well
But fatty was saucy, couldn't be told
She loved margo with her big nick, drifling the cold
She even bolder than the skinny girls, shoulderless (they're mine!)
And admired everywhere from her openness

Microphone check 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2!

Be careful of the things that you do

Finally fatty boo you stood with me in '73
Saturday night playing the music at my fathers party
6 records on the changer often with dan settee
Still your gram 6 years old and I'm the man
Steady with calypso to start then play reggae
One thousand bolts of holts (huh) for everybody
In the days when r&b meant
Arthur conrey, otis reading, booker t and the mg's
Every, lickle piece of attention as we tried to squeeze from the father
His friends and the family
Sometime deliberately tease with the tune that wont please
And the whole room reaction set my young heart at ease
I used to be black suits and shirts with skinny ties
And they was wise and funny and, funny and wise
Staying up late and playing the music with grown ups was my prize
The lickle fat kid with sparkling eyes.

Prospects, not the nicest, my wife is
About as cold as ice is
When stressed, she's not the wisest, who is?

We all got baggage, hers is financial
Peace to my uncle and so thanks to
A loan from him
We still have a home to live in

I'm learning to ride the riddim, when she come in
Face full of arguing
Another nice night in ruin
Remembering back when we were just into each other

Now we just injure each other, without thinking
And when the silence fall, and the world gets really small
She crawl into bed, I'm in my three fifty zed
High speed meditation just to ease my head

Light beep on as I slide in
Put the music on to keep me from crying
A tear may escape as I scrape first gear
But have no fear I'll never stop trying

I'll never stop trying
Hmmm...
I'll never stop trying
I love the surge, the pull, away from the curb

The way the sound-reverberate
As I push my foot down, accelerate straight out of town
And with the help of James Brown on the tape
I reach escape velocity on the M3

Transcend my physical bounderies
Blend with the mystic reality
And finally, I'm free
Travelling instantaneously through space

'Till I will reach that place within me
That has no trace of a beginning, has no end
Where I both recieve and send
My soul fills the universe end to end

And I feel myself heal and mend
My mind is still and I'm floating
Look down, throttle's still wide open
Inner serenity comfort me, past junction twenty three

On my way back, full chat and I'm flying
I won't crack and I'll never stop trying
I'm flying, I'll never stop trying
I'm flying

It's like all of a sudden
And everything is different
You can still see everything around you
But it's all completely lost its significance

It's not important anymore
This inner-acceptance that you are we
And everything that is
Is you

Emotions unstick and fall away
Til all that remains is joy
My earthly body's doing one sixty
And float free in the realm of eternity

The essential inner drama
Where my rhythm resonates so all phenomenom full uppa
Original stamina
Look uppa

I know the speed camera
Physical laws unravel
I travel through the fabric hole
The unseen going mad quick

Some call it magic
They flash and I never get a ticket, boom
I'm leaving with the mystic laws
So benefit is automatic

And I'm back with my girl
Back in the real world
Two AM, we both tired of arguin
She wanna know we're I been

Back before big bang and then back again
And she scold me, stop lying
And I told her, and I hold her
I'll never stop trying, baby

I'll never stop trying
I'll never stop trying
I'll never stop trying, for you
I'll never stop trying

I'll never stop trying
I'll never stop trying
I'll never stop trying, for you
I'll never stop trying

I'll never stop trying
I'll never stop trying
I'll never stop trying

Remember emily?
[in background - ""that's a long time"" 2x]
In a long dress one summers day she said yes
Now every special requests requires another
So many times it feels endless, a big yes
Branded red on each breast
But she selfless out there
Doing her best strangest scene
Nobody seemed to be impressed.
The more she do for this fool
The more she behind schedule
Had no fun for so long
Old records turned her onto high school flings
And she was full of daring

Colorful hair used to wear thirteen rings
Now she staring gludgery
Full in the face and accepts it as her place
And just incase there's anything she missed,
She recheck the list
Does it over again,
To make sure it's spotless.

Jimmy longed for how it used to be,
She was viscous and volatile
She was feisty, iced tea was the tipple never asked nicely
Her lips used to curl down ever so slightly, impolite,
Fire burned bright behind the oakley,
We just had to get to grips.

After a few long sipped juice begin to lose flavour,
She no longer gets to savor being consumed.
Jimmy sleeps drunk in the other room still in his shoes escaping head long into the booze,
The whole house vibrating with the changes of moods.

From feisty she turned into being nice to me
In the old days he'd of been wearing ice t,
Jimmy cradles times return,
She was fine and so beautifully unconcerned.

Jimmy told her on the day he quit
You don't love me you love the relationship

Me?
I'm the prodeney product of misogheny,
Jimmy and emily harmogeny
They promised me nothing but honesty,
And that's all I got,
I could never be the cement in their destiny,
They still haven't forgiven me,
You know my own woman is leaving me
Said she stopped believing me,
Can't even see what she saw in me,
I told my woman she was beautiful,
She didn't believe,
Convinced herself I was preparing to leave,
So she took my son and left the world free.

I told my woman she was beautiful ten times a day,
Ten times a day she would smile, and look away.

I end up throwing my love down a bottomless pit.
And giving myself away..."

Talks, starts to walk, amongst love and security.
Goes to school, learns to read and write
Probably follows a team with his friends
And gets to ride the train,
Fall in love, probably fly on a plane
Get to work all week and spend what he earns
On the high street
He's got doctors, nurses, fireman, churches,
Kindergarten, wedding bells and jet black hearses
Passport, bankcard, maybe his own yard
Locks and alarms, trinkets and charms,
Maybe a baby in his arms

Came into the world coughing,
Already full of mother's disease
Went back to a flat, with no gas, no cash,
Rapped in a duvet full of cigarette ash,

Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia, please, release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath

Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast

At least a couple of weeks
Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night I write by candle light
I find insight, fundamental movement, uh

So when it's black, this insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack

Faithless,Killer's Lullaby,/f/faithless/killers+lullaby_10113462.html,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home,
Conceding defeat with a low moan
Hangin' in A sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone
I bought him coffee and a snack,
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes,
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach 'll burst,
Feel like I've been cursed.
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock,
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked.
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust,
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys
Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near,
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part
That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found,
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges at the thought
Of syringes

J (as in Jerome), I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows,
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
Cage
And write another stage into a new age,
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Jerome took me home under steel skies
Knowing I'm prone to dramatize but unknown for telling lies
And what I verbalize he can see behind my eyes
The why oh why's that identify killer lullabies
And he surmised
No surprise couldn't hear that
Closed my eyes as he steered that old black BM home again
Not knowing how and not knowing when."

But not the many lives he's saved before
Show us starving kids through expensive lenses
On a far and distant shore
Of which, when sold, could feed a good few
Hey mister rich - Why don't you help the poor

Bad news, sad news, never no good news
S'all they print and beam
Make a child believe that there ain't no love
Well hey, love lives on my street.

Love is you, love is me, love is us, love is free
Zip up your front all ya want

Love is you, love is me, love is us, love is free
Zip up your front all ya want

Way to display the way I'm feeling, I need healing
From the floor to the ceiling,
But I'm not gonna sit n' die while time ticks by

Iron out the creases,
Find out what peace is.

Your the mister of the house now remember this
And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss

In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid,
Even though I'm only a kid
Certain things can't be hid

Held me like I was made of gold
But left her inner stories untold
I said, momma it will be alright

And whatever he's doing, he's doing the right thing
It's frightening, but it makes me mad
Why do all these people seem to hate my dad
And if that aint enough now I got these spots
I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
And what's more, I can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war
And all we ever seem to do
Is hide the tears
Seem like daddy been gone for years

And you ain't going to nirvana or farvana

Waiting for someone else to make us free
And we refuse to see
That people overseas suffer just like we

Float like a butterfly,

Love myself born slippy
Outta love for you,
And I knew that someday people would love me too.
None of that heckling about my black skin got through,
I would walk bare foot through hell for you,

And my gratitude for those glorious days
And your victorious ways,
Instilled in the young minds,

And trigger wetness under your vest
Test your fitness
Special request to my love interest
Impressed, I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress
I watch the rhythm slide right up your dress

Induce a case of mild madness
Cook it till it's black 'cause we like it just a tad crisp

It's not over, I'm not going home till I can take you with me, I'm not going home
It's not over, I'm not going home till I can take you with me, I'm not going home
It's not over, I'm not going home till I can take you with me, I'm not going home
Come with me, come with me, come with me (me, me, me, me, me)

(Come with me)

(Come, come with me)

Outside the club there's a line of taxi
I want you climb next to me
Up on the backseat
I need your company to relax me
In your black dress you never look less than sexy
That we both here together has profound meaning
I'm so down with you
I can feel you breathing, on me skin
Tell the doorman we won't be leaving
Till then, and not the one that we won't be needing

You give me something to believe in
Now, kiss me properly and stop your teasing

It's not over, I'm not going home till I can take you with me, I'm not going home
It's not over, I'm not going home till I can take you with me, I'm not going home

It's not over, I'm not going home till I can take you with me, I'm not going home

New York, New York, temperature's droppin'
The band's out shoppin', not stoppin' 'til ears pop
Cops protect shops, lots of yellow cabs and bellhops
And it never stops
I'm waitin' to do an interview, so much to tell you
Today I feel close enough to smell you
Additional dates they were plannin' just fell through
Florida's out
We fly September 22 to Heathrow,
But there's not really long to go
Tonight will be a brilliant show
Lettin' you know I miss you
More than four hits the floor at a party
Send my love to everybody
Please, send my love to everybody
(everybody everybody everybody...)
Send my love to everybody

Honey, I'm writin' from D. C., feelin' queasy
Stayin' healthy on the road isn't easy
The tm recommends an antigen
One of them could resist again
I miss you like a lock in the door
What's more, I go to sleep with my Walkman
'cause half the crew snored
Don't mean to be a bore, everybody's been great,
But there's fifteen of us in a bus state-to-state
So I stay up late with a tape, or meditate
My bed is travellin' at fifty-five M. P. H.

Reclinin' by the grass as the trucks pass
Gleamin' with the flash of sunlight from the glass on the windscreen
As for us, there's too much to relate
We've done five gigs, yet we're only in our third state
America's big, you'd love how they pile up your plate
Only place in the world even I can gain weight
Our next date is Wilmington, Delaware
Open air, there's a rumor Melle Mel'll be there
Anyway, all my love, God bless, I'm yawning

A local hero yo, but now he ain't unsung

No snacks here, you won't be dancing on peanuts
Strictly hot food, keep you nice and strong
So you can go on and on and last long

I will be played deep brown, the place teared down
Dangerous on the door, seen it all before

Take the words and the bass,
Taste, and then swallow me,
You're chasing the devil
Cos you're level if you follow me
For quality, and I make no apology
For linking my thinking with computer technology.
Cos this is like a modern day hymn
For the new church,
I search for the truth,
I've got a hole in my tooth,
I'm uncouth, yes sir,
I'm from the street university
Where we learn to earn even in times of adversity.
And I will find it a easy when you're out a hard time,
Petite crime sometimes,
But now I'm inclined to find
A fresh direction, kiss me neck,
Check out the funky section.
Cos this is the part where I start to rip up words,
A comfort coming straight from my heart,
I'm not a mystic,
My views are realistic, simplistic,
One special brew I get pissed quick,
And get sick so I don't do it no more,
I won't find peace of mind
Rolling around on the floor.
The point I want to make,
The mistake is to take without giving,
From within,
You know how I'm living,
I'm cool, I'm looking after myself,
And I could never place wealth before my spirit,
I feel it's unhealthy,
The devil creep around you so stealthy, stealthy
'Till you get bold, rush the gold,
And before you're much older,
You're soul is sold, where's it getting ya,
Competition starts swearing ya,
Gold-diggers setting you up,
Soon be forgetting your existence,
Do you need a for instance,
I have to admire your persistence
In sticking to a game plan,
That brings you pain man,
And at the end of the day nothing is gained,
So listen to the voice within,
I'll see ya later,
Pay heed to the Grand Oral Disseminator.
Quite still you feel there's nothing going on
Until you realize the space behind your
Eyes is filling up with something like peace
As your thoughts cease some pleasure grows in your soul.
I aint a Christian
Sometimes I feel like diss'in em
But listen I'm just trying to tell you what I know
If you would once relax, chill to the max
These words on wax will cause sweet bells to ring in your soul.
If I say God is alive I know you'll want to know why babies die, food don't grow.  Why?
Trains smash, plans crash,
Situation mash and slam bam
Your fellow man - money's in fashion
It aint rational, because dammit, he didn't just give us the planet
And it's wealth, inside your soul he left a piece of himself, his voice is small
I keep lying and trying,
Denying the call from inside
You can't hide responsibility
So decide from today just who it's going to be,
Thou shalt have no other God but me,
So set you free see,
But you'll have to listen,
And who's that false idol
I see you kissing?
Money, success and untold wealth, good health
And all you have to do is love yourself.
It's a fact you'll attract all the things that you lack,
So just chill
And get off the race track
And take a pace back, face facts,
It's your decision,
You don't need eyes to see,
You need vision,
Continue to view the lord as being separated
And you'll be living a lie that's being perpetrated,
For many centuries, I'm on a mission I want to mention these facts,
These facts in my rap,
I don't sing,
But I want to share the peace that they bring,
My name is G. O. D.
The Grand Oral Disseminator."

Incase of upheval, fundamental movement below,

When I get deep, wanna hear myself sleep,
Not drowning, just tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud,
I wonder what it's like to be dead,
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot,
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...

I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep,
The pills ain't cheep but the bills are steep,
So I ___ with a booze and a slpiff,

And if I take a corner too quick you get sick, when I do my handbrake

Watch me ride, me broadside's wide like a battleship
Side slip, push, only hip, stick it in gear and get the gas uplift
It never failed to bring a grin to the limb

Sleep the eyes, on the limit, sit down and spin it like we do
Every Friday, 'round my way where I play before we..
No alcohol is a rule
My baby gets passed around I don't frown
I love to see my friends getting down
When it's just me and she you know it's never precarious
But sharing with your buddies is hilarious
Variously we argue and
Disagree and get heated
Have to tell my people that we see it and we start the anti-stress process
'Til there's a big mess of twigs and seeds to meet your needs

Pepper your thoughts with spice, and entice you to a space
Where I dwell with bass players and layers and loops
Think what I think with my prayers. It's nice. My world is everything I've
Become
Contained in the hum between voice and drum
I'm coming from the same place I'm still running from
But even sitting in the garden one can still get stung"

Teenage and its a trouble understanding ya,
Ya got plenty of energy and stamina,
Forgot all the little tricks I tried to cram in ya,
There's a bit of 'I Don't give a damn' in ya, ha
And that's your old man in ya,
Stand in your way, never or ever abandon ya,
And on the day people say what they can't stand in ya,
Don't let your ego get out of hand on ya,
It ain't a good look when crook-kharma land on ya,
Balance yourself, bring out the Zinedine Zidane in ya,
The I will and I can in ya,
Execute the grand plan in ya,
I'm your daddy and happy to see the man in ya.
Might know too much but I'm no soft touch,
Brought you up, to recognise lies as such,
I need no crutch, child hood was arduous,
And if there is a god I'm sure he would pardon us,
Must be working hard in us,
Not to harden us, ha.

Children ya still own the power,
To turn this into your finest hour,
Now a young ma-mum that mistake can make a contribution why dont we wait and see...
Give back the mothers their dignity,
And the fathers who roam free a lesson in humility,
This society needs to learn empathy.
It happened to you, it could happen to me (x4)

Start a ripple
It will buzz you like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibility speak just a little
The words have enough weight to turn rock to metal

To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
But your individuality overflows with quality
It manifests solidly
If you believe
A rich creativity, fever pitch energy
And crazy synchronicity

In you the song which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now, in you

Never never scared
Worries washed
Pressed air

Stay awhile. Kick off your shoes. Don't go. Please stay. --
It always happened this way.

When it's too hot to move
I'm woozy

Nobody in bed with me
I need room to be where I want to be
No need to zoom or rush
In fact, take out the bass in case we need more hush
Less percussion, a little less pushing and shoving
Take it easy, you could even get sleazy
Come around, watch a movie with the sound down
And get woozy

In one word... Tradition. ""

Watchin' the tide roll away

Headin' for the Turtle Bay

Look like nothing's gonna come my way

Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay

Looks like ain't nothin' gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

I'm sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
Six thousand miles I've flown
Just to make this rock my home

This is for my strugglers
Hear me crying in the rain
I need your help, come help me now
There's so much pain
Wasted, hungry, and so much to give
And all we need is a chance to live
And just be free
For we are the victims of this political war
We do not want our children to suffer more
In a world where only a few would rule
No equal opportunity for the majority
Unite now, unite now
We got to unite now, unite now
Unemployed, I'm tired of being pushed around
By my family, by society,
But whos to blame?
Open you eyes and try to see the reality
That you can feel the way we feel
And it will open your eyes
For we are the victims of this political war
We do not want our children to suffer more
In a world where only a few can rule
No equal opportunity for majority
Unite now, unite now
We got to unite now, unite now
Attracted by the city lights many come to see
But there's nothing more than the country life
When there was so much joy
In the city you have to give a lot to live
Youll have to steal cause there's no world go round
There's so much pain
For we are the victims of this political war
We do not want our children to suffer more

My baby, my lover
One that I could never keep

With another
Really believed every word that
You said you would never
Now that the ties that we've had
Has been severed
Baby, I should've really been clever

Give me the reason why
Why can't I get over you, finding it
When I
So hard to do
Knowing that you've moved on too
I spend so many sleepless nights
Tossing and turning, why
Do I make it hard to try

Kiani
I should've made the first move
When I saw it coming

I felt something was wrong
My heart was running
Yet I still gave you the benefit
Of the doubt
I gave you everything I had
Still you left me
Heard you telling everyone that
You possessed me
Made me really find out what this
Love was about

Chorus

Fiji
Only a fool would give up this
Beautiful experience with her
Dumb enough to walk away from
Love that she shared
Thought he would get over until he
Got soberand realized the things that he did to her
(I could never) bring myself to
Break her heart
(I could never) keep this love
And never ever part
(And forever) I will always treasure
This alone
No worry yourself, she will get
Blessings from above

Kaya daw naglasing, dahil sa problema

Sa awa ko, dinukot ko ang piso sa bulsa
Ang sabi niya, ay mama kulang dagdagan pa
Kaya ako dumukot ng sampo dinagdagan
Siya nama'y nakangiti at biglang lumisan
Siya'y sinundan ko, di n'ya nalalaman
At siya'y nakita kong pumasok sa ihaw-ihaw.

Iii
Ako'y lumapit sa kanya
At siya ay nabigla,
Para bang nakakita ng multo ang mama
Oh ilan kaya ang tulad ng taong ito?
May dalang sulat upang manloko ng kapwa

Mag-ingat kayo,

I'm calling out your name

I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown
They said I swam the sea that ran around
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found
And I know the place another way,
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me
I'm calling out your name,
I'm calling out your name

Stay with me, stay with me

Did you throw your heart away?
Oh I know just what I say
Did your phone cut in the way?
Being still downtown I say
And I know you ran away,
Oh I know but I'm feeling okay
And I found love and fear won't go,
And I found love and feeling won't go
See you walk away, feeling okay now,
Happy now, happy now?

Through the olive groves

Like an eggshell, a white bell
To lighten my cold room
So let me sleep where I lay
With a murder of crows
That live in the boughs of my brain

Where my ghost lies in loose-limbed array

And go upload my heart to the fatal shore

The rusted homes abandoned at the remains of the day

On black rivers and rainbows to Neptune

Cities burn, we got youth to spend

And life to live again, my friend

Cities burn, we don’t give a damn

We got youth to spend

Is what I need to clear my sight and clear my head

Coming down over

Coming down over again

When all is said and all is done
Our fathers ran and leave all the damage
They’ve down behind
Left us with the blind leading the blind

We got youth to spend

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
And if I could fly
Like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond the doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond the doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

Oooh we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

You get so much enjoyment out of causing kids pain

A chick who's just plain mean
A sour sweet 16
She's a fire breathing dragon
In a pair of black jeans (Oooooo)

Ahoooooooooo

Hey vicky won't you tell us true
How'd we ever get the bad luck to be stuck with you
Oh vicky can we say one thing
It's your super tall and uckiness
That makes us wanna siiiing

I wished everyday would be Christmas
Geepers, how foolish I was
It Isn't a gift
And Isn't a toy
Its the family and friends
That I really enjoy
I wish that tomrrow weren't Christmas
But I wish that the feeling would stay
'Cause Christmas can always be there in your heart
And never be locked in just one single day!
Its great that tomorrow ain't Christmas
In Dimmdales and London and Rome
If I had just one wish
I'd think it be this
I really just wanna go home now
*Spoken*I really just wish I were home."

He's reading my list
He's feeding the deer
He's hauling my gifts from the North Pole to here

I wish everyday could be Xmas
'cause every other holiday reeks;
New Year's Day's for mom and dad
The Easter bunny's eggs smell really bad
Valentine's Day always makes me sad

Dad: 'cause Timmy just can't get a girlfriend

Timmy: What?

The hood never caused but they all was hard
His kind never represented love at all
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top
Access granted with this empty can of starch
No not the [?] liquor store got robbed
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large
I wrote xxl in the view of my squad
Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall
Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow

Try and juggle in the casket wit ya sister lavonne
Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue
Only thing come to ratchet was the 23rd song
Yeah it coulda been tragic for the boy from the scums
Yeah he got the craftmatic no rest till I won
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone
Born near the savages kinda made me numb
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum
Cause...

Sitting here, reminiscing,
Of all the nights I had to grind
Taking chances with the system,
I put my whole life on the line
All my life know it ain't been sweet
All my life I been in the streets
All my life up against concrete
All my life mama gave me the speech
All my life somebody died every week
All my life ducking the police
All my life without soda I weeped
All my life no first class seats

With the bad boys always catching my eye

Ooh, bad boys

Some think it's complicated
But they're straight-up fun for me
I don't need no explanation
It's nothing more than what you see here
My heart still feels divided
Halfway between wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't know why

Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind

Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye

I know you want me shawty 'cause I'm a (bad boy)
Hey shawty can't help it, she so so addicted to them rougher fellas
With even the alphabet she only sings the crooked letters
Let mama take all the risks
For that chemistry she like them tougher than leather
?
By any means necessary, girl
She likes them ruthless, that's my world
It's not the news, it's what I heard
To get them more the merrier
It's not a big surprise
I know them bad boys catch your eyes
Look at her walk when I go in disguise
You'll have them shawty, don't worry, you fly

Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye

Through fog lens, all for the Benz

Don't you feel it tonight that you wanna be free?
No you don't mind
Cause what's mine is yours and yours is mine

Turn down for what? I'm not taking a breather
Can't help myself, I'm surrounded by divas
I can just tell how you look at me, stare at me, watching me watching you think like a freak

She sent me, she can't hide that tongue in mascara
You like it, I love it
That kinky, that yell
I know I'm in trouble, but I clean up well

Hard to follow my dreams workin this 9 to 5
People keep tellin me my check is on the way
So sun up to sundown I'm grindin, tryin to make it by
Prayin for my shift to come and take away the pain
That day is finally here (x3)
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain,
New wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here
That day is finally here (x2)
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this

[Verse:]
No, no I won't settle for nothing less than the air that I breathe
I-I-I know it's a struggle, but who the hell g'on do it for me
Who the hell g'on do it free
If I don't get up and bust my ass, that's my motto
I can't put my faith in the lotto, luck don't stay nowhere near where I go
Unless you ride that muthafucka
And you be lucky enough to get away, in the grave
What can I do, what can I say, I tried to get paid
But I got grazed, the bullet went through
But I ain't get paid,
Now what do I appreciate? My J-O-B
Hey boss, I'm comin in late

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Lil cousin got it right? And bike without no frame, ride the same rides without no brain?
Life ain't life, without no shame, if I make it out the hood, damn right I'm gon change
My cell phone number
But the area code still gon be 305 tho
My friends who was my friends just like my kin
Walked em in model?
But please wipe your feet on the rug
You can keep your shoes on, it's all love
Boy let me stop, I'm dreamin too much, now who the hell
? Gon give up a million bucks
Nobody but God, right now I could use me one of them black cards
I'm scarred, I fell apart, I came here with stars, it's hard huh?

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
F-F-F-Findin me
That day I been tryin to reach, that pay I been diein to see
Boy them folk wouldn't lie to me
I thought money ain't grow on trees
Depends on the roots, how you plant that seed
They quit, you can't see no leaves
Hold up, I need my versace's
Grace covers of magazines, my mother she proud of me
Myself, I, the one who the haters thought wasn't gon be shit
Big yachts, every day I get seasick, I was broke, the prefix
My book say ""Why yall gave that nigga some cash?""
I wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? Here it goes"

Found me a hood that'll help plant my seed

(Cause in my hood err nigga gotta eat) [x5]

Niggas gotta grow
Penny bitchin for paper till you poppin big bucks
Give it a blow they c*** it ain't no telling with them thugs
Dealers straight out da projects only felon that'll bust
Some shit you don't discuss
Snitches they get them stubs
Damnit I'm proud to buy my own bag to fill my dutch
Planted my own seed now a month without bud
Granted I got the fee and we don't pump the same blood
You need that new Mercades
Home of that color gravy
How the hell you gonna pay me
I made a deal to 380
Tell me I'm acting shady
I try to ignore the lazy
Set my brains on the deli
If mine arrest me I'm ready

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Chow I had that dinner platter meals on deck
Cash coming that currency to earn that respect
Money machines measuring making sure you collect
Rolling that dice game you better be stomping best
Keep it moving like chess
Look for ya new address
Proof of ghetto for s**
That make the culprits go wreck
Hope the fay of the fruits of ya label mama impress
Don't know whoever knew you could point at you through the stress
That drama on the block
All them run-ins with cops
Couldn't afford shoes was happy 2 pair of socks
Steady paying ya dues that landed you in the box
Other niggas confused you asked them to borrow crop.

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Crying erryday big breaks on they grain
Preparly marinate a million strong keep the change
Challange that generate we gotta tone it with a crain
Hustlas for that bank be aware that we untaimed
Duckets we deranged
Muscle the day I change
Melica off in that hood come get you that's point blank
Hit you it's all good

Women tell us hes never survivin that chedar lane
You see we want it all
Yea we breakin the law
Buy it Sell it Cook it that's a merry thang if it's raw
Anyway you put it tell the folks we breakin the law
Sing it so I took it and if you tell a nigga that's all

Your other men probably should follow my blueprint, baby
Strap on your seat, and get ready to go
You know I’ve been filling Beatport
3 million feed up in the sky full diamonds
I’m only beginning and I get the feeling
I’m behind the beat for the nighters
I got a few Miami Viaces
I don’t ever look at the prices

You know who the king of the night is
Beautiful music for you to go lower

From party, and bigger than life

Cameras flicking, I see me
You’re fixing, I’m fixing my color
My natural height
She can get it, my whole click with it
No question, we are on the champion flight
This I roll ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London and land in the Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don’t recognize
So let’s toast to a new day in Rochan
80 million they still rollercoasting
What’s the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, sober like couches

Oh-eh-oh
Who told y’all the party’s over?
Oh-eh-oh
Well, it ain’t over till I told y’all
I fill my cup on and over
Tonight I won’t might be sober

Face just shower, the minute in an hour
Heard about the news whole day went sour

Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give him my regards but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause a quarter million on my necklace
Dui never said I was driving wreckless
You and I know that jealousy is not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop I was destined

Flo Rida,Jealous,/f/flo+rida/jealous_20785217.html,"It's been a month since the Fourth of July
Stood there and stared at the grief in my eyes
Leave it to me to live out a lie

So I sat on the curb and I cried like a child
Catching my breath just walk for awhile
And I thought of what could go wrong

I'm already gone
Don't say a word
I can't hear you
Don't hold me close
I can't feel you

So I stopped at the store to grab cigarettes
Couldn't say it out loud couldn't fathom it yet
You finally feel and we feel like this

I'm sorry just wasn't enough destroying your faith
Preserving your trust we couldn't choose
And neither could I

I know that I left you for dead
Don't give up so soon
Because you know that we all have a bed
It's waiting for you in the recovery room

Just forget everything that I said
Washed out the wounds
Walls painted red
Waiting for you in the recovery room

She stood there in her summer dress
Wind caught her hair and failed to confess
I smiled as we raced through the night
My hand caught her wings then nothing felt right

I know that I left you for dead
Don't give up so soon
Because you know that we all have a bed
It's waiting for you in the recovery room

Just forget everything that I said
Washed out the wounds
Walls painted red
Waiting for you in the recovery room"

And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic

Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll
Come on let's go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain't nothing like the feeling
When you're winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain't ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

Gotta find that tone, has a mind of it's own

Love while I'm sposed to up hold it down for this crown

What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, like I'm singing hey yo
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll, roll, roll, roll... 

And let's go all night, all night

Make a wish
Just make a wish
Write out a list
What's broke is fixed

Make a wish
What's diamonds
And pearls
You know
You're my girl
I'll give you the world
Make a wish
I ain't talking bout
No ifs or maybes
No possibles
Girl
You're driving me crazy
Make a wish"

Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)

[Flo-Rida]
Hey hey hey shorty, took me to tipsy from sober
Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier
Hopin she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover
Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta
Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need
Like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment - must be sealed inside
Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind
Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime
Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?
Body bangin, I lay the language, that walk is famous
The proper anus like she was painted
She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous
None other, who's her lover, this above her
Get it from her mother, did it to her brother
Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler
Shorty whassup~! She had..

Heyyy parking lot pimpin, yeah that's the way I approached her
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster
Miss - got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder
Serious, she the business and I need closure
So hood and I'm startin, I'm blowin see no stuck up trumpin
Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin my platinum my money
This ain't your normal every day baby
The type to drive nothin less than that 600 Mercedes
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like A. 380
I feel like she put me under a spell
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal
I put her on my tab, had her sippin, call a cab

My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be god damn if my rims ain't too
My momma ain't at home and daddy still in jail
Tryna make a plate anybody seen the scale
Lets go!
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I be god damn if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white now how much you tryna pay
Lets go!

Today was a good day hope I have me a great night
I dunno what you fishin' for hope you catch you a great white
Me I see great white heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this who knew it came in bails
Who knew it came with jail who knew it came with prison
Jus cuz you got an opinion does that make you a politician
Bush robbed all of us would that make him a criminal
& den he cheated in Florida would dat make him a seminal
I say and I quote ""we need a miracle""
And I say a miracle cuz this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and cc Allah
Mr. soul survivor does that make me a konvict
Be all u can be now don't dat sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga boo
It's really a desert storm that's word to my nigga clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, a.r. Arizona
Rep for them real niggaz im winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama on my way to Savannah

I said I woke up this morning headache this big!
Pay all these damn bills feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to polos
Love me some spinach dip I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right I take a trip out to Houston
A earthquake out in China a hurricane in New Orleans
Street dreams tour I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for soulja slim brought out b.g.
Its all love bun, I'm forgiving you pimp c
You know how the pimp be
That nigga go'n speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven
He tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so ya'll let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther feelin just like a king
Guess dis is what he meant when he said dat he had a dream

[Chorus]

Yeah!
History, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets try to flip some keys
So a nigga wont go broke
Then they put us in jail now a nigga cant go vote
So I spend dough all these hoes is trippin'
She ain't a politician honeys a politician
My president is black Rolls golden charms
Twenty two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of people is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego you got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cuz at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity never lose your integrity
For years there's been surprise horses in this stable
Just two albums in I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr black president yeah Obama fa real
They gotta put ya face on the five thousand dollar bill

Let let me go in, sexy moanin, ca catch me jonesin
Let no not ever with this little mama off schedule
Got me achy, call me papi, hottest I be fly as feathers
But but bout that, sh shawty housed that
you you got that prowl cat
I wanna pop it like ecstasy, pretty face and all that
But what I look for, this gal is hood core
But that is outdoors
Deserve an encore, the definition of a shone

[Chorus]

Hey, I'm feeling you girl, wanna get close to you, no doubt
My sister swagger should tell it more
than anything can vouch
Little mama you are what's inside ghetto
Fine I'll make you proud
So stuntalicious, I love it, lets at least work something out
Miss thing, million dollar game, coke bottle frame
Make my wall of fame let me know your name
I control the rain I could make it better, matter of fact
I make it weather, stormy weather with this cheddar

All because you hot as ever
if you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby,
You won't like it, send it back and its okay baby
You's a keeper, touch of diva, give me a fever
If I could freak ya, give me the word and I'll be along

[Chorus]

Girl let me touch you like nobody can (yeah girl)
Girl let me show you I'm a gentleman (uh huh)
I wanna be the one to hold your hand (oh yeah)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be

Girl let me touch you like nobody can (yeah girl)
I wanna show you I'm a gentleman (uh huh)
Girl let me be the one to hold your hand (oh yeah)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be

[Chorus]

I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you (on you)

And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

Love comes once every now
You and I know your love comes once in a lifetime
Love comes once in a lifetime

[Verse 1]
She was the neighborhood dream girl
Can look, but don't touch, they all wanna know us
If it ain't with me, then it can't be no one
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
You stayed down, don't play around
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway
It was us, drop-tops, speeding down the runway

[Pre-hook]
So let’s go
I want you to know that you're special
I'll never compare you to no one
Baby, cause I know that your love comes
Once in a lifetime

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
And she was prom queen, I'm just a new Jack
My city tatted on my back, she had my back, I knew that
But I started looking for more
When they started feeling the flow
Them girls trouble
Come more than a lifetime and time don't wait for no one
I'm out here like I throw ones and they dance for me
My man he warn me how my come-up might just cancel me
Now I gotta go fix that, get that, hit that
He flip that in that like I used to be big D-A-D-D-Y
I'm so special, she can't have another dude that woo her
I got my Bugatti, but that just pickup [?] her
That sears these years on lairs get weird
My fear is tears that smears and make-up
Don't ever make up, you better wake up

[Pre-hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge]
I only got one life to live
And I wanna spend it with you
Love the money and the cars, but listen, baby
You are what I’ve been missing

Witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose
Don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical

Wack your shows in Japan with me getting drunk
We had plans, plans change the new sun
The lord never leave us lonely when you lose one

Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's greener on the other side.

I take care of the yard, everyday, I don't know why my hoe got missin.
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position.
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my hoe to get up and get missin.
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt and I saw for myself then witness.
Well I'd tell you about my hoe, never had restrictions.
I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that hoe in the kitchen.
Got me on a mission, left my she'd without permission.
I'm sheddin' tears messin up my vision, this hoe gon' make me go to prison.

I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's green on the other side.

That hoe cost me my job, I'm afraid I shoulda learned mo' about the business.
A hoe is good for diggin', I shoulda know this from the beginnin'.
I don' got caught slippin' now I'm trippin out the door somebody else found interest.
Throw my hoe until I found out until I find out different. Better to know then have intuitions.
Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart.
I never thought that hoe would get to my heart, I found out right off this bitch came from a
Bar?
Why this hoe ain't in somebody garage. I was a gentlemen right from the start.
Ever since I put the hoe in my touch, now this bitch won't even spare me the rod.

My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still
Missin'.
Plow in the world, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my hoe's still missin, like it's green on the other side.

7 years now it's all over, now hold on goin' gotta feel me brah.
Left my home, no sign of luck. I try to drink patron so all the memories gone.
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup. Bought the hoe my last couple of bucks.
Lost a hoe I never felt this crush, like cushion a dutch, never this much.
If I woulda known my hoe was just temporary.
And I ain't talking about the hoe you find in the dictionary.
I feel like going to war like the military.
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery.

My lawnmower home, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin'.
My rake's in the shed, but my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still missin', my hoe's still

I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain
And I wanna know

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
Oh oh oh
My mind keeps saying
Run as fast as you can
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Oh oh oh
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker

Oh oh oh

Troublemaker

Maybe I'm insane
Cause I keep doing the same damn thing
Thinking one day we gonna change
But you know just how to work that back
And make me forget my name
What the hell you do I won't remember
I'll be gone until November
And you'll show up again next summer

Yeah
Typical middle name is Prada
Fit you like a glove girl
I'm sick of the drama
You're a troublemaker
But damn girl it's like I love the trouble
And I can't even explain why

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
Oh oh oh
My mind keeps saying
Run as fast as you can
Troublemaker
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Oh oh oh

She can autograph my pockets,

I'll be looking at everybody else, 
Watch it, 
I don't wanna be obnoxious, 
But this girl worth the gossip 
Take away the smile, 
The tattoos now, forever she very guard less

I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
On and poppin'
She met Mark and then
Attitude like we arguing
Return I'm gonna celebrate, glitter to my life
I should twitter this is girl, she's sparkling

But she's got groupies, 
She ain't no actress
But she makes movies, 
And when she struts that thang around
Everybody be breaking their neck like

Pull it up, get a little cozy and

Rock star, none of that practice

It's like my head's back, been drinkin' out the bottle, I swallow
Some strong drank but really just my motto, she lotto
Jackpot, grand prize, champion franchise
Born ready and she get it right there on time
Early A.M., breakfast after the mayhem
Baby cause they don't make them like you, I hope that you hate them
Black card, that's a vergin, I keep 'em twerkin'
They're workin', that's why they're perfect, go 'head and purchase

[Refrain]
Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright
When you go down, down in my mind
Do what you want, that's what I like

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 2]
Wobble, wobble, satisfaction, my model
Show me you'll lead the way, and maybe I'll follow
Promise you ecstasy, long as you're here with me
No promise at all, my love be guaranteed
Cause baby I'll hit the throttle, make our way to the grotto
Private dancin' in there and some Playboy mansion tomorrow
It's all free, cause I agree you make 'em weak
Talkin' 'bout my knees, and the thing you need, girl

[Refrain] + [Pre-Hook]

[Bridge]
Work, work, work, work, work with it
Don't stop, don't, don't stop, get it
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree
That I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries

Green grass of home.

At four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, that I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak.

He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low:
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long, 
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud, 
To hide it's face and cry.

Did you ever see a Robin weep, 
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost his will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

The silence of a falling star, 
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

Way out on the rim of the hill

With a sweet refrain.

And he'll kiss your lips,

Freddy Fender,Silver Wings,/f/freddy+fender/silver+wings_21016756.html,"Silver wings
Shinning in the sunlight,
Roaring engines
Headed somewhere in flight.
Their taking you away,
And leaving me lonley,
Silver wings
Slowly fading out of sight.
Don't leave me I cry,
Don't take that airplane ride.
But you locked me out of your mind.
Left me standing here behind.

Silver wings
Shining in the sunlight,

Roaring engines
Headed somewhere in flight.
Their taking you away,
Leaving me lonley.
Silver wings
Slowley fading out of sight.

Freddy Fender,Since I Met You Baby,/f/freddy+fender/since+i+met+you+baby_20959825.html,"Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
And everybody tells me that I am not the same

I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
Cause since I met you baby all I need is you

Interlude - Instrumental

Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can"
Freddy Fender,Tell It Like It Is,/f/freddy+fender/tell+it+like+it+is_20959827.html,"If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will
Tell it like it is

Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live

Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy

But I
Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy"

Next time you see me, things won't be the same
And if it hurts you my darlin', you only got yourself to blame

Well it's a true true sayin', all that shines is not gold
Well it's a true true sayin', all that shines is not gold
And like the good book says you got to reap just what you sow

Well you lied, you cheated, oh-oh for so long

You're a wrong-doing woman and another girl has got your throne"
Freddy Fender,The Wild Side Of Life,/f/freddy+fender/the+wild+side+of+life_21016762.html,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life"

Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping.
Vaya con Dios my darling,
May God be with you my love.

Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you,
Although you're many million dreams away.
Each night I'll say a pray'are, a pray'are to guide you
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day.

Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow,
But the memories we share are there to borrow.
Vaya con Dios, my darling:
May God be with you my love.

Now the village mission bells are softly ringing,
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing,
Vaya con Dios my darling,
May God be with you my love.

Wherever you may be I'll be beside you,
Although you're many million dreams away,
Each night I'll say a pray'are, a pray'are to guide you
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day.

But the memories we share are there to borrow,
Vaya con Dios, my darling!
