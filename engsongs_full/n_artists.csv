Cause ain't a bitch could fuck with my flow
When it comes to drugs, mami just say no
Either you're on something or you're S-L-O
Had to switch up the flow, let this skeptos (sketels) know

Nicki Minaj,All Things Go,/n/nicki+minaj/all+things+go_21091474.html,"[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose

[Hook]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
I know its sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love him
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

[Hook]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
I know its sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Hook]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
I know its sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you"

Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them push daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like

Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

Nicki Minaj,Autobiography,/n/nicki+minaj/autobiography_20847175.html,"[Chorus:]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected my life reflected

Daddy was a crack feind 2 in the morning had us running down the street like a track team

[Verse 1:]
When he burnt the house down n my mother was in it
How could I forget it the, pain infinite
She's my queen and I ain't even british
She's the only reason that I went to school and I finished
She told me that I had talent
Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent
She saw something in me that, until this day I don't know if I could be dat
But I'm a die tryin and when I'm done cryin
Grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
N shoulda thrown a book at, ch'you cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at ch'you

[Chorus: x2]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected

[Verse 2:]
Damn I wanna run to you
Hold you n kiss you tell you how I miss you
Thought I would have a son for you
But now it's official it's over and I can't let you go
But I gotta let you know all the s*** I did make it feel like I'm dyin real slow, cause no one understands me they don't know what to do when I'm hurt when I'm angry
You was my friend and my man and my daddy,
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me anything I ever needed knew you had me
Cause of you all them chicks could'ntstand me
So why hurt you that's the question
It took this long for me to learn my lesson
Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
I finally understand the true meaning of karma

[Chorus: x2]
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected

Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to busy tryna have fun now I pat myself on the back for sending you back cause god knows I was better than that to conceive then leave you the concept alone seems evil I'm trapped in my concience
I adhear to the nonsense listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you
But how the fuck would they know what I was ready to do
And of course it wasn't your fault
It's like I feel it in the air, I hear you sayin mommy don't cry can't you see I'm right here I gotta let you know what you mean to me when I'm sleeping I see you in my dreams with me wish I could touch your little face or just hold your little hand if it's part of gods plan, maybe we can met again

Rape his mum if her fannys not to hairy,
And she's a muddafucking virgin like mary,

Soon ssimon cowell will be signing me a petition,
To be number one in the world is my ambition,
I guess I can do it it's my decision,

Soon I'll be the fucking talk off the town,
I'm the muddafuknig king so wheres my muddafuknig crown,
I'll sell more records then jay sean -down,

My lyricks will get read more then a nursery full of
Kids reading noahs ark,
You might be a pittbull but I'm a fucking shark,
I'll drop bombs like a taliban in iraq,

Yeah I'm gonna doit I'll walk the walk and I'll talk the talk,
I'll eat you like a cannabis stalk,
You may be black but I'm as white as chalk

I'm only 14 and writing my bars in school,
Everybody nos me as tom robbo the kid whos cool,
I'm gonna batter oli williams whatta fucking fool,
Sayin I was the one who took a knife when he was the
One who clearly broguht a tool,"

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night—peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred milli, always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell!""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp Teslas and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit

You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy had these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake

I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang

Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer

Swingin' them hips when you pass

Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)

Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tounge on you you put your tounge on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla tonight

I said you need some thick skin, baby, suck it up
He go insane on it, I put my fame on it
Coulda put ZAYN on it, but I put your name on it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it, yeah
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down (Turn it down, baby)
Got a bed wit' your name on it (Your name...)

Nicki Minaj,Bed Of Lies,/n/nicki+minaj/bed+of+lies_21090217.html,"[Hook: Skylar]
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

[Hook: Skylar]
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar]
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Outro: Skylar]
Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies"

She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her - no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns

He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter then wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters, and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it. Where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless
Well, that's what you are, how I see it is how I call it

I was just a player in the game of love
Til she came and turned me tables around
Stacking up mi chips
Lining up all mi cups
Still they all came tumbling down

Man I think I might, think I might make her the one
Take them stealing me up on the run
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done
If love is the beat, she's the stead of my drum
Fly me away, the kingdom come
She got me going daram-dam-daram-dam

Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no oh no, till love shot me down
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
Oh no oh no, till you came around
I'd rather die a thousand times, than live without your love
Hey-o, hey-o, I was born to be wild
I'm blown away, uh whoa, I'm blown away

Ooooh, I'm blown away
Ooooh, I'm blown away

Love was just a word till I bought me a baller
Oh you everything for holding me down
I'm telling all my homies that mi find mi a queen
In the jungle so you facing the crowd

Man I think I might, think I might make her the one
Take them stealing me up on the run
She hits me like a shot gun, I'm done

If you will die then why would you try
And if you apply, a suit and a tie
It's what I will buy then you will be mine
Because you and I, we're born to be wild
I am Martha, you King Arthur
Who knew you would land me
I be known to eat these rappers, cook 'em like chef Ramsey
Mission accomplished, you're my accomplice
Cove on vogue, yeah I'ma go topless
I'ma go bonkers, I'ma go crazy

Then hang a baby off on the balcony
Teach him the moonwalk, Tell him he's japanese

Don’t be mad, lil' mama, cuz you not in

They wanna know why I’m posted at the bar
I tell ‘em that I’m just singing posters at the bar
But really, Y'all know why I’m posted at the bar
You bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar

At the club every day but that ho ain’t me
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi

I do my 2 step one time with a snap

Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back

I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

Tryna act like a mac, yeah the one with dame

That shit don’t make up, for no wack ding-a-ling
I hate a dude, that be pushin’ a Benz
Or he live with his mother, or he stay with his friends

How the fuck you eatin’ tuna and it's not bumblebee

[Verse 3]
I hate a girl that be stuntin’ in the game
Iced out chain with her best friend name
Cuz them the girls that be swervin’ in my lane
Why they lookin’ for change in they boyfriend Range
I hate a clown touch down to my town
But when the check come she short like bust downs
I hate a girl stay singin’ in public
Everywhere I go bitch be singin’ some dumb shit (shut the fuck up)
If I could get a deal I'd have one too
I hate a girl that see her man and say , that’s my boo (stop playing)

They need help like they only got 5 on it

They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist, by the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I met the one and your wasting your time
But you waited

The public won't get it, they got A. D. D.
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah follow the rules, let me say my prayers and get ready for school)

Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?
Ayyyyyy!... Can anybody hear me?"

I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
Cause I am in need of more attention
Could have called back 
Just to say something
Imma fall back

This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now?
This to dedication; this is meditation
Higher education; this the official competitor elimination
I-I-I-I was taking trips with Webs to move weight
Came back to Queens to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half, like they flunk they math
Bitches ain't half cut up crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone
Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memories only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers; niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharika
Candice, Temby, Lauren, Aiesha

It's a celebration (For the ghetto)
It's time like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay
We made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Labor transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T. O. Nigga, either riding range
The Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rap
Wish you niggas good luck, trynna get where I'm at
Straight like that

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: Settle
Give me one word for each chain: Yellow
Pocket full of money, black card; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A. I
This is how you deal with the fame: Stay high
Stay putting on for the town; may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play high
4 Mill in three weeks, y'all did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yes, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photos
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don't let me hear Sean Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace
Let me hit up Sean Comb money case that's on my place, let's celebrate

[Hook:]

[Verse 4: Nas]
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated pg, this rated pj
Cause that's where a nigga from murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermuda, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little not, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brothers sister
I just aspire and desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list went like this, first thing discover
The difference in pussy, white, Black, Latin or other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting lists just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter
Fast Cash Life, happily ever after

And never tell me no
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong
But you should know I bought 'em
I changed it, I changed it
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though
I changed it, I changed it

No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here
She gon' dread this and Nicki like Lisa hair

The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe
I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls
Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals
I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers
I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and them bitches my sons
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run
MJ, game 6, Jackson, Tyson

Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em ""Let's beef""
Changing girls, change is fine
She don't like girls, change her mind
Change the world, change my line
Never ever change my slimes
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes

Shorties standing in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang we don't say no names
If you talk to cop I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Leave the domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Putting my relations in your conversations
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation
You get my position nigga better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never made it

Get on them conference calls, go meet them lawyers with me

Okay. Okay. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm 'bout to master these bitches, man. Chea! Chin checker

[Verse 1]
I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to Cali
Used to push a pink Denali, now it's Chevy Impalis
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys
Now I get my work it out like Biggity-Bally
I used to go hard, used to cock the brim
Used to take the dollar car, used to shop at Vim
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me
I don't mean Cover Girl when I say ""easy breezy.""
Jiminy Cricket, let the master in
When it come to bad bitches, I'm the last of kin
I'm bringing S-E-X-Y B-A-C-K
If Nicki ain't the best, suck a D-I-C-K
I'm Young Nicholas, my style ridiculous
I heard your money funny, and mommy, I'm ticklish
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it
I always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict

[Verse 2]
I used to make a dollar stretch like a Pilate
Now I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti
Gotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby
Look, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time
And you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind
They think I'm making fun of them, when I be like: ""Na-Na-Na-Na!""
That's the track, little mama. Look: ""Na-Na-Na-Na!""
Do what I do it, like I do it for the T.V
Bitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me
Do it all for GP, tell 'em to suck a pee-pee
Monday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in DC
Get a ticket, or you only get a snippet
If you write your lyrics, little mama, I can dig it
I show you how to do it, what I do is really magic
Abracadab' tricks are for kids, silly rabbit

Tell him to kick rocks or give me some top

Who you know fresher than Nick? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn, but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go ""Ew""?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar

[Verse 2]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

[Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to
Treat me like a real one s'posed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night, wanna humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And if they workin' where the bag is
Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Went to Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

Yo, you can't wear Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
You drink CÎROC now? Okay, you P. Diddy?
Oh, you a young G Herbo or Lil Bibby?
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, oh, you Nas, bae?
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat and tears in perfecting my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
Kobe, KD, Kyrie! Pick a K

Got the domino effect in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call ‘em cashews

Yo, SB. I think it's my time... 
You know why? My tears have dried, 
And I know that no weapon formed
Against me will prosper. And I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivaters.
Young Money.

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold now 
They screamin, ""Nicki leave me alone!""
I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush for mainstream
I am the streets. I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! 

[Verse 1 - Nicki]

Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or a real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tec 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersect sign. hit em wit a tommy so my niggas call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner, bitches like nelly and kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, fuck I look like chompin on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, louis on the duffle. I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle).
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta. tell em I'm the ninja, 
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks
I'll have the rap bitches for dinner.
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis.
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski.
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed.
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)
OOhhh!

Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?

Let another girl sit in yo throne.

Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end

From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder.
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water.
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp. but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm nasty than a summa bitch.
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
It yeen got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't cover my strip
I wear that metal, no olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You fuckin wit me if you fuckin wit Nick
They ain't fuckin wit me they ain't fuckin wit Nick
Your girlfriend, her descision is split
Cuz she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin Nick, as long as she be fuckin rich
That's why I keep my luggage cuz, I swear yall's a fuckin trip.
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger just punch a bitch
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, ""Gunovich""
Weezy F. Baby and the ""F"" is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country bitch.

Now it's which worlds tour should I go on and take
See you told me I would lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmychoos just for fun
Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me
Australia Sydney, Might run up in Disney
Out in la wit Lindsey,
Got the eye of the tiger the lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time it's just me and my prime
Everything I try to teach them they gonna see it in time

I was crack now the whole album crack
You ain't even gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque I ain't gotta get awards

All the girls will applaud All the girls will commend
As long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls never thought they can win
Cause before they could begin you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick ima only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe till I mothafucken say so
To all my bad bitches I could see your halo.

And, you know, obviously for me, I don’t feel like that
'Cause it's me, you know? I feel like I’ve been doing it for ten billion years
But every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for getting me this far
'Cause sometimes you don’t realize how far you’ve gotten
Until you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not going to be about my talent, you know?

It’s not gonna be about my looks
It's gonna be about who wants it the most

Fifty trucks, when I pull up we a fleet away
You ain’t on my throne, ain’t even a seat away
But thanks to Nicki, all these new bitches can see the way
I got the krippy, I ain't talking 'bout the gangs, though
Had all these bitches rocking pink hair and bangs, though
Now I got 'em rocking inches now
But I'll leave these bitches hanging like lynches now
Word play got 'em stepping up they pens-es now
Still stick me for my flow like syringes now
Still kicking closed doors off the hinges now
Shotgun and them '88 Benzes now
With my plug, I call him Poncho, but I think he wants that chocha
Put this pussy in his boca, make my niggas take his coca
Now I'm balling like I'm Sosa in a Lamborghini rosa
Yelling, ""¡Viva Puerto Rico!"", all my bitches es hermosa

En PR ya es legal, yo firmé la ley
Fumando como Snoop Dogg y Wiz Kha'
Las gatas quieren Kush, no quieren Friska
Prendí un bastón como el de la brisca (Farru!)

Las libras yo las compro y llegan por FedEx
Priority el paquete, next day vía express
Del celular traqueo con el GPS

Que tiene un guille de bichote y lo que fuma es regular
Sintéticas de esas que venden por ahí en los puestos legal

I just took her name and made the bitch a LLC
Stuff a couple stacks up in, then bitch, get on your feet
You make twice as much if you switch it up, just to see
To you he's rich and famous, but he's just a guy to me

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki with a factory
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill levels still a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I watch but just take a bath for me
Put the trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them give me fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I rip every rap and beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Apetit
Used to get real hyped off a half a mil'
Used to get real hyped off half a pill
We don't pay niggas to front like they like my shit
We don't pay niggas to come in and write my shit (uh)

Push the limits, I'm a pushy bitch, yes, I bumped him

Yeahhh, ohh yeahh
I coulda been had fame, jump shot with a stupid ass aim
'Cause you couldn't get around the last name
So my crossover wins the last game
And it's I'll right, switched up the flow, but it's still right
Go back to that, yeah I still might
I'ma just do me, when it feel right, ahh
You can bring it any day
Natural Bad ass, nba
That's my initials, that's why officials
And I'm bossy can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn the flow nasty, coffee
Don't you do like the pope and cross me

[Chorus:]
And it's my last chance, last chance ooohh
And it's my last chance, last chance ooohh
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
And I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot

I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I can just depend on
Until I touchdown in the end zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-peckin' away like vultures
But little did they know, distribute the payroll
Pick out the outfit, pick out the single
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the tidbits vary
Never been like me, ain't never been like this
My flow's a crisis, they screaming high pitch
Gun c***, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell em that I'm gunning for the top forbes
Headed to the top dot org

[Chorus:]
And it's my last chance, last chance ooohh
And it's my last chance, last chance ooohh
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
And I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot

All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes
Anybody tryna stop me, better not fuck with em this time
Shoot I am ready to shoot into the sky!

[Chorus:]
And it's my last chance, last chance ooohh
And it's my last chance, last chance ooohh
Then shoot, I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
And I'm ready to shoot

Safety's off and I put it on stun
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up. (2x)"

Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there’s some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did alot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don’t understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin’ the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the ‘burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don’t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don’t understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn’t ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me?
You know you’re Harry and I’ll always be Hermione

[Hook]
I’ve been lonely, I’ve been waiting for you
I’m pretending, and that’s all I can do
The love I’m sending ain’t making it through to your heart

[Verse 2]
Dear Wayne, I’m writing another letter cause
You never did respond, it’s been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors
Knockin’ on a set of doors
Knockin’ on heaven's doors
Let’s play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner?
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you’re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
If you’re reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger

Anyway, I just heard Tip saythat black people
Turnin' lemons into lemonade, tell 'em to demonstrate
I guess he did already, guess I'm a little bitter
Cause I show bitches how to do it, like they baby sitter
So where my cash at? And where my stash at??
I mean, where the Dow Jones, where the Nas-Daq?
I do it for the little macs, with their caps back
My little niggas pumpin' crack, out they napsack
Know what I mean? Get the sticky cream, pass that
I smoke bitches, can't nicotine patch that
Don't need your spot, to get a good game

It's been a long time coming, but you don't know specifics
No more phony wishes, we ready, cause now we know the business
Come holla at your guy, I always make it pour
Invite me to ya wedding, I throw dollars at the bride
It's dirty money, dirty jeans, and dirty scullies
You heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully
Most of these rappers lost, it's no cash at all

She ain't yours, she ain't mine
Throw a hundred every time
I think my coupe just lost its mind
Put yo mama on that trippy shit, sippin' lean, snorting lines
Overseas like bonjour
Last ten years I've been on tour
And I still got that old money
I touch more green than a lawnmower
With a ratchet bitch, you laid up
I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up
I take that bitch to my mansion

Think that shit's got pneumonia.""

'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
Speed it up a little bit!
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach
And I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?

Red light
You know I can't make this thing that official
Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you shit
You don't like that I make this easy, leaving
After sexing on the floor
Baby I know you need me, like I need you
But I'm not the one you wanna love

So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You use to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love

No love
Don't come looking for love
No love

[Nicki Minaj]
August you know, I'm here to save you
Me and them girls we aint the same boo, 
You know I hate it, when you leave me
Cause you love it then you need it
But you know how bad I need it 


Until the morning we can freak but baby girl you gotta know, know, know
We can rubble in these sheets but after this you gotta go, go, go
Don't take it personal
When it feel so good we can get emotional
But that is when you find out that it hurts the most
Since then I've always been like trust nobody show no love

So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You use to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love

No love
Don't come looking for love
No love"

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a set-up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big bitties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in like seasonin'
And tell 'em, bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about, your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully, with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

How do you do that sh-t
How do you do that sh-t
How do you do that sh-t
How do you, how do you, how do you, how do you, how do you

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they looking you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But looking back it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no you aint lying
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make hoarse from yelling at you
At gettin' at you, pickin' up dishes and throwing them at you
Why are you speaking when no-one asks you

How do you do that sh-t

What are we doing
Could you see through me
Cause you say Nicki and I say ""who me""
You say ""no you"" and I say ""screw you""
Then you start dressing, and you start leaving
And I start crying and I start screaming
The heavy breathing but what's the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm asking you something
Yo, answer this question, class is in session
Tired of letting passing progression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Ok you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You can turn a free throw to a goal
N-gga got the peep hole to my soul

How do you do that sh-t
How do you do that sh-t
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

Won't you just stop looking through me

No I can't take it

When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
""Nick-Nack, Carry Crack"", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

Accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence was for your amusement

Nirvana,The Priest They Called Him,/n/nirvana/the+priest+they+called+him_20101121.html,"Fight tuberculosis, folks. "" Christmas Eve, an old
Junkie selling Christmas seals on North Park Street.
The ""Priest,"" they called him. ""Fight tuberculosis, folks.""
People hurried by, gray shadows on a distant wall.
It was getting late and no money to score.
He turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife.
Cab stop just ahead under a streetlight.
Boy got out with a suitcase. Thin kid in prep school clothes,
Familiar face, the Priest told himself, watching from the doorway.
""Remindsme of something a long time ago."" The boy, there, with his overcoat
Unbuttoned, reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare.
The cab drove away and turned the corner. The boy went inside
A building. ""Hmm, yes, maybe"" - the suitcase was there in the doorway.
The boy nowhere in sight. Gone to get the keys, most likely,
Have to move fast. He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner.
Made it. Glanced down at the case. It didn't look like the case the boy had,
Or any boy would have. The Priest couldn't put his finger on what was so
Old about the case. Old and dirty, poor quality leather, and heavy.
Better see what's inside. He turned into Lincoln Park, found an
Empty place and opened the case. Two severed human legs that belonged to
A young man with dark skin. Shiny black leg hairs glittered in the
Dim streetlight. The legs had been forced into the case and he had to use
His knee on the back of the case to shove them out. ""Legs, yet,""
He said, and walked quickly away with the case.
Might bring a few dollars to score. The buyer sniffed suspiciously.
""Kind of a funny smell about it."" ""It's just Mexican leather.""
""Well, some joker didn't cure it.""
The buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor.
""Not even right sure he killed it, whatever it is.
Three is the best I can do and it hurts. But since this is Christmas
And you're the Priest... "" he slipped three bills under the table into the
Priest's dirty hand. The Priest faded into the street shadows, seedy
And furtive. Three cents didn't buy a bag, nothing less than a nickel.
Say, remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back unless
I paid him the three cents I owe him. Yeah, isn't that a fruit for ya,
Blow your stack about three lousy cents.
The doctor was not pleased to see him.

""Now, what do you WANT? I TOLD you!""
The Priest laid three bills on the table. The doctor put the
Money in his pocket and started to scream.
""I've had troubles! People have been around!
I may lose my license! "" The Priest just sat there, eyes, old and heavy with
Years of junk, on the doctor's face.
""I can't write you a prescription."" The doctor jerked open a drawer
And slid an ampule across the table. ""That's all I have in the OFFICE!""
The doctor stood up. ""Take it and GET OUT!"" he screamed, hysterical.
The Priest's expression did not change.

The doctor added in quieter tones, ""After all, I'm a professional man,
And I shouldn't be bothered by people like you. ""
""Is that all you have for me? One lousy quarter G? Couldn't you lend
Me a nickel...? "" ""Get out, get out, I'll call the police I tell you. ""
""All right, doctor, I'm going."" Of course it was cold and far to walk,
Rooming house, a shabby street, room on the top floor.
""These stairs,"" coughed the Priest there, pulling himself up along the
Bannister. He went into the bathroom, yellow wall panels,
Toilet dripping, and got his works from under the washbasin.
Wrapped in brown paper, back to his room, get every drop in the dropper.

He rolled up his sleeve. Then he heard a groan from next door,
Room eighteen. The Mexican kid lived there, the Priest had passed him on
The stairs and saw the kid was hooked, but he never spoke, because he
Didn't want any juvenile connections, bad news in any language.
The Priest had had enough bad news in his life.
He heard the groan again, a groan he could feel, no mistaking that groan
And what it meant. ""Maybe he had an accident or something.
In any case, I can't enjoy my priestly medications with that sound coming
Through the wall. "" Thin walls you understand. The Priest put down his
Dropper, cold hall, and knocked on the door of room eighteen.
""Quien es?"" ""It's the Preist, kid, I live next door.""
He could hear someone hobbling across the floor.

A bolt slid. The boy stood there in his underwear shorts, eyes black with
Pain. He started to fall. The Priest helped him over to the bed.
""What's wrong, son?"" ""It's my legs, senor, cramps, and now I am without
Medicine. "" The Priest could see the cramps, like knots of wood there
In the young legs, dark shiny black leg hairs.
""A few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race,
It was then that the cramps started. "" And now he has the leg cramps back
With compound junk interest. The old Priest stood there, feeling the boy
Groan. He inclined his head as if in prayer, went back and got his dropper.
""It's just a quarter G, kid."" ""I do not require much, senor.""

The boy was sleeping when the Priest left room eighteen.
He went back to his room and sat down on the bed.
Then it hit him like heavy silent snow. All the gray junk yesterdays.
He sat there received the immaculate fix. And since he was himself a priest,
There was no need to call one."

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.
Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.

Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,
Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.

And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.
Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young."

When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home.

Oh, I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
The gypsies say and I know why
""a falling blossom only touches lips that lie""

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon
I thought you loved me, you said you loved me
We planned together to dream forever
The dream has ended, for true love died
The night a blossom fell and touched two lips that lied

I'm welcome as the flowers in may.

And treat you in the same old way.

There were angels dining at the ritz,
And a nightingale sang in berkeley square.


I may be right, I may be wrong,
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me,
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.


The moon that lingered over london'town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.
How could he know that we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down.


The streets of town were paved with stars,
It was such a romantic affair.
And as we kissed and said goodnight,
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.

When dawn came stealing up, all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous,
I still remember how you smiled and said,
""was that a dream? or was it true? ""


Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing of fred astaire,
And like an echo far away
A nightingale sang in berkeley square."

You'll grow tired of me
'Cause after you get what you want
You don't want what you wanted at all

You've got a changeable nature
You're always changing your mind

That is hard to satisfy
You're unhappy most of the time

Can you count the ripples
In streams passing by

If our dreams fell through
Would the summer roses
Miss the morning dew

Ask me if I'll love you
When years have flown away

At the end of a river
The water stops it's flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go

But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on 'til the end of time

The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song

Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais

Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis"

Funny taxes, kids at play.
Paris without you is lonesome,
Yearning more and more each day.
Can't lose this blues,
This azure-te.

As sweet as she could be.
Once I had a gal,
And she was right for me.
Kinda sandy hair,
Eyes so soft and blue
That you couldn't help but care
When she looked at you.
She called me ""baby""...
""baby"", all the time.


She said, ""baby, can't you see?
""baby, understand
""baby, you're for me,
Won't you take my hand? ""
But I pushed her away,
Wouldn't let her near
Pushed her far away
Now I'm wishing I could hear her
Call me ""baby""...
""baby"", all the time.

It's so lonely through the day,
Lonely through the night,
Lonely, lonely hours
Without that gal I held so tight.

Will listen to my plea.
Keep her close to you
So she'll come back to me,
And call me ""baby""...

Through the gallows floor 

She killed a man in Wolf City, Wyomin'
Wolf City, Wyomin', killed a man it's true 
And that is why they're a-hangin', hangin' Cat Ballou

She has the smile of an angel (Fights like the Devil) 
The eyes of an angel (Bites like the Devil) 
The face of an angel (I say she's the Devil)
She's mean and evil through and through

Cat Ballou, Cat Ballou-ou-ou 
She's mean and evil through and through 

With her outlaw band, they're now tellin' a story
Now tellin' a story, how she rode the plain 
The wildest gal in the We-est, since Calamity Jane 

And today's the day, that she's goin' to glory
She's goin' to glory, for the way she sinned 
They'll be a-speedin' her sou-oul, on the wayward wind 

She has the smile of an angel (Fights like the Devil)

When you behold your shattered dreams.
And gigolo and gigolette
Awake to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams.

Here is where you'll always find me,
Always walking up and down.
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town.

The joy you find here, you borrow,
You cannot keep it long, it seems.
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams.

Forgive my heart
You're still a part of everything I do
Forgive my lips

If you are still
My only thrill
Am I to blame

Forgive my dreams
In all my dreams it seems your face appears
Forgive my eyes

Don't know why you haunt me
But you do
Forgive my heart

Happy, happy snowman
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty, the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have
Some fun down before I melt away""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets
Of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpaty, thumpaty, thumpaty, thumpaty
Thumpaty, thumpaty, thumpaty, thum
Just little kid, Frosty, go

Thumpaty, thumpaty, thumpaty, thumpaty
Thumpaty, thumpaty, thumpaty, thum
Over the hills of snow
Over the hills of snow
Over the hills of snow
Over the hills of snow"

He who hesitates
When it comes to love

The wonder of it all.

You'll never know
If you don't try.


He who hesitates
When her eyes say yes,
Just how much you've missed
You will never guess.


Your chance
Goes by
And it's too late
To wonder why.


Dreams cannot replace
The wonder of her smile.
The warmth of her embrace,
Don't let it
Escape you.


When you fall in love
And you feel the glow,
Take her in your arms
Never let her go.
Don't be
The one
To hesitate with love.

There heads are full of cotton, hay, and rags!

Vacillating, calculating, agitating, 
Maddening and infuriating hags!

Eternally noble, historic'ly fair,
Who, when you win, will always give your back a pat.

Why does ev'ryone do what the others do? 
Can't a woman learn to use her head? 
Why do they do ev'rything their mothers do? 
Why don't they grow up- well, like their father instead?

Why can't a woman take after like a man?

A better companion you never will find.

Ready to help you through any mishaps. 
Ready to buck you up whenever you are glum. 
Why can't a woman be a chum? 
Why is thinking something women never do? 
Why is logic never even tried?
Straight'ning up their hair is all they ever do. 

Why don't they straighten up the mess that's inside? 
Why can't a woman behave like a man? 
If I was a woman who'd been to a ball, 
Been hailed as a princess by one and by all; 
Would I start weeping like a bathtub overflowing? 
And carry on as if my home were in a tree? 
Would I run off and never tell me where I'm going?

My dreams come true
A few kisses ago.

I remember you,

""i love you, too,"" I do.
Didn't you know?

A distant bell,
And stars that fell like rain
Out of the blue.

And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all,
Then I shall tell them
I remember you."

My heart is filled with ecstasy,
And like a dope, I let the chance slip by.


There, I should have told her then
But all I did was sit and grin,
And I ended up so mad that I could cry.

Better face the facts, ol' buddy,
And be prepared to take the blow.
You don't have to sit and study,
It's something anyone should know.
Shake hands... Get your hat...
And go.

You can praise her eyes,
And adore her hair.
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.

And you can walk her home
In the warm spring air,
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.

And you can look
With a longing in your look,
And try every method in the book
And worship the smile that kind of
Took you unaware.

And you can weep and sigh,
You can say, ""unfair"".
You can almost die of despair.
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there."

I would have said ""impossible, impossible, my friend""

To dream about what might have been
Is strange enough for me

A dream too beautiful to be

Someone longs for you and your caress
He's learning now how empty arms can be

How he misses you and must confess
Without you he's like driftwood on the sea
He's just a dreamer who is still in love with you
That dreamer happens to be me

I'll never know just why we parted
It's more than I can comprehend
I only know when you departed
You started a night that has no end

Perhaps there'll come a time when you're alone
Your heart still haunted by a memory
If then you chance to find there's someone on your mind
I hope it happens to be me

Our love affair is a wonderous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with out first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space

Our love affair
May it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So take my hand
With a reverent prayer
That we may live
And we may share
A love affair to remember

So take my hand
With a reverent prayer
That we may live
And we may share
A love affair to remember"

Look out what you're doing
You're caught in a pot
Whatever she is brewing
Stay out of the pot

You better get wise, here's what I advise
When she sighs for a squeeze
Freeze, blame it on the breeze
Start to sneeze, get the measles

She'll get you off balance
Then suddenly shove duck
When she throws her hook out
Don't let your heart get took out
Pick up your pack and cook out
Oh look out, look out it's love

Look out where you're rowing
Stay close to the bank
That river is flowing
Right into a tank

Look out where you ramble
You're out on the loose
You're liable to amble
Ride into a noose

You better look out or better turn about
Like a trout
At the dam, scram, take it on the lamp
It's a jam, it's a stampede

She'll talk to her lawyer, where by and where of
She'll get the marriage book out
And she'll pick the perfect look out
Her welcome mask's been shook out
Oh look out, look out for love"

I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.


The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.


Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.


Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.


Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.


I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too.."

The sleepless nights I've had about the boy

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there
Are traces of the cad, about the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
In the fury of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy?
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

So if I could employ
A little magic that will finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me
But I can't because I'm mad, I'm mad about the boy"

I was lonely as I could be
Until a senorita smiled at me

There was music and sweet guitars
And in her eyes were a million stars
She was lovely beyond compare
And in that moment
I had learned to care

She was to me, a serenade
A melody that my heart had played
And all too soon, I had to go
She understood that I loved her so

I waved goodbye, she waved goodbye
And from my window, I could see her cry
I went away and when I did
I left my heart with her in old Madrid

Mutiny, mutiny, must have mutiny
Swing out, kids, swing out

There was mutiny in the nursery when they all got loose
They began to yell for old Mother Goose

Get on down, all together
Get on down, take a gander
Get on down, struck on home
Don't miss the jamboree

Mutiny, mutiny, must have mutiny
In the nursery!"

My baby don't care for shows, my baby don't care for clothes,
My baby just cares for me.
My baby don't care for furs and laces,
My baby don't care for high-toned places,
My baby don't care for rings or other expensive things,
She's sensible as can be.
My baby don't care who knows it,
My baby just cares for me.

My baby's no crosby fan, dick tracy is not her man,
My baby just cares for me.
My baby don't care for mr. Tibbits,
She'd rather have me around to kibbitz.
Roy rogers is not her style, and even clark gable's smile
Is something that she can't see.

I wonder what's wrong with baby,

National Anthem,Australia Anthem Text,/n/national+anthem/australia+anthem+text_20565023.html,"Advance australia fair
Advance Australia Fair (The National Anthem of Australia) was composed by Peter Dodds
Mccormick sometime around
The turn of this century. Several versions with different combinations of the verses are
Found in different references. Some
Australian governments seemed to disapprove of the sentiment of some of these verses,
And passively discouraged their
Remembrance. Consequently, several of these verses are very difficult to find unless one
Searches for old and original references.
God Save The Queen is also sung as The Australian Royal Anthem.
Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;
We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in Nature's gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;

Advance Australia fair!
In joyful strains then let us sing,
""Advance Australia fair!""
When gallant Cook from Albion sail'd,
To trace wide oceans o'er,
True British courage bore him on,
Till he landed on our shore.
Then here he raised Old England's flag,
The standard of the brave;
With all her faults we love her still,
""Brittannia rules the wave!""
In joyful strains then let us sing
""Advance Australia fair!""
Beneath our radiant southern Cross,
We'll toil with hearts and hands;
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands;
For those who've come across the seas
We've bounblockquoteess plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
""Advance Australia fair!""
While other nations of the globe
Behold us from afar,
We'll rise to high renown and shine
Like our glorious southern star;
From England, Scotia, Erin's Isle,
Who come our lot to share,
Let all combine with heart and hand
To advance Australia fair!
In joyful strains then let us sing
""Advance Australia fair!""
Shou'd foreign foe e'er sight our coast,
Or dare a foot to land,
We'll rouse to arms like sires of yore
To guard our native strand;
Brittannia the shall surely know,
Beyond wide ocean's roll,
Her sons in fair Australia's land
Still keep a British soul.
In joyful strains the let us sing
""Advance Australia fair!""

Green woods caught them with friendly voices,
The sun called with its flame to a seed-time far-famed,
The stars poured faith into broken forces.
And in time of storms, troubles and mighty desires,
Thou hast budded and bloomed, long-awaited,
In a life-freshet, over the land of thy sires,
Thou hast flooded and poured, unabated.
Thou has flooded and poured, in a bright tale of life,
Through field, woodland, hill and vale streaming...
From thy native flower-copses thy crown is made bright,
Like a swan' plumage, brilliant gleaming.
Thou dost quiver and echo with songs of the bards,
Long-past years thou dost raise up and nurture,
Today's forward leap thou wouldst never retard,
Boldly facing mysterious futures.
In the sun thou goest bold, lovely flower of fire,
Gently sowing forth dreams, gold-adornéd;
Thou fearest no neighbour, though great be his ire,
Thou fearest no path briared and thorny.
From end unto end, frontier mound unto mound,
On the breezes renewal is borne now,
And, embracing the soul, without limit or bound,
Mother-joy for the better day born now.
Now there are no axes among forests green,
Felling young pine-trees in frosty winter,
Now there are no reapers from dawn to dark seen
In summer with scythes ringing, glinting.
Strength is known in the hands, without tears songs are blithe,
Desirous of glory, breasts quiver,
In their books a new law, with pens of sun-scythes,
New people are writing for ever.
Blossom them, and raise, soaring upon eagle's wing,
Souls, hearts and thoughts slumbering dully,
Awaken and forth into great spaces, bring
Strength by the witch-noose unsullied.
Send messengers forth, send unto the world's bound,
As falcon from falcon-nest winging.
Let them fly, fly away unto warriors sound,
Set the thunder of good news far-ringing.
Enough, dearest country, in field, wood and brake,
Hapless orphan, thou spendst night's long glowering,
Enough of thy heart's-blood wrong drank as a snake,
And cold winds blew, through thy bare bones scouring.
Arise from the depths, thou of falcon-born race,
O'er sires crosses, their woes, degradation,
O young Bielarus, come thou forth, take thy place
Of honour and fame among nations.

National Anthem,Brazil Native Anthem Text,/n/national+anthem/brazil+native+anthem+text_20565011.html,"Hino Nacional/National Anthem
The Brazilian National Anthem is sufficient grounds for the fame of it's composer,
Francisco Manuel. Through it's admirably
Warm and spirited melody, it took it's place as the national anthem before it was accorded
Any official recognition. Various
Changes made to it have not distorted it's essence, though they have softened it's martial
Tone. Originally composed in a purely
Orchestral version for military band, it has been the various texts which have been set to it,
Especially that of Osуrio Duque
Estrada in 1922, which have somewhat spoilt it.
The history of the anthem is the subject of controversy. In the view of some, it was
Composed for Brazilian Independence, others
Believe it was written for the 7th of April and performed on the 13th to a text attributed to
Ovнdio Saraiva de Carvalho e Silva,
In which there are references to ""a wise reign"" and ""a Brazilian monarch"", the 7th of April
Being taken as the dawn of Brazilian
Liberty. A third view is that of Souza Pitanga and Ernesto Sena, supported by Alberto
Nepomuceno who writes: ""In the same
Year (1841), at perhaps the height of his career, Francisco Manuel composed the anthem
To celebrate the coronation of the
Second Emperor of Brazil, showing himself to be a composer of great merit in this inspired
Work, which still animates the
National soul today.
Decree No. 15671 of the 6th of September 1922 officially adopted the words of Osуrio
Duque Estrada, written in 1909, the
First version of it. Law No. 259 of the 1st of October 1936 prescribed the version of
Leopoldo Miguez for orchestral
Performance, and the version by Lt. Antonio Pinto Junior of the Federal District Fire
Brigades, for military band, in the original
Key of B Flat; and finally a version in F by Alberto Nepomuceno for singing:
Music: Francisco Manuel da Silva (1795-1865)
Verses: Joaquim Osуrio Duque Estrada (1870-1927)

And verdant trees so fair,
With the Creator's glory
Reflected ev'rywhere,
O sea of palest em'rald,
Merging to darkest blue,
Whene'er my thoughts fly Godward,
I always think of you.
Dear, verdant island, set in blue Caribbean Sea,
I'm coming, coming very soon, O beautious isle, to thee.
Although I wandered far,
My heart enshrines thee yet.
Homeland, fair Cayman Isle,
I cannot thee forget.
- Away from noise of cities,
Their fret and carking care,
With moonbeams' soft caresses,
Unchecked by garish glare,
Thy fruit with rarest juices,
Abundant, rich and free,
When sweet church bells are chiming,
My fond heart yearns for thee.
- When tired of all excitement
And glam'rous worldly care,
How sweet thy shores to reach
And find a welcome there,
And when comes on the season
Of peace, goodwill to man,
'Tis then I love thee best of all,
Beloved Isle Cayman.

Con que Chile en tus aras juró
Que, o la tumba serás de los libres,
O el asilo contra la opresión.
1.- Ha cesado, la lucha sangrienta
Ya es hermano, el que ayer opresor;
Del vasallo borramos la afrenta,
Combatiendo en el campo de honor.
El que ayer doblegabase esclavo,
Hoy ya libre y triunfante se vé;
Libertad es la herencia del bravo;
La victoria se humilla a su pié.
2.- Alza, Chile, sin mancha la frente;
Conquistastes tu nombre en la lid;
Siempre noble, constante, valiente
Te encontraron, los hijos del Cid.
Que tus libres, tranquilos coronen
A las artes, la industria, la paz
Y de triunfos cantares entonen
Que amedrenten al déspota audaz.
3.- Vuestros nombres valientes soldados,
Que habeis sido de Chile el sostén,
Nuestros pechos los llevan grabados...
Lo sabrán nuestros hijos también.
Sean ellos el grito de muerte
Que lancemos marchando a lidiar
Y sonando en la boca del fuerte,
Hagan siempre al tirano temblar.
4.- Si pretende el cañon extranjero
Nuestros pueblos osados invadir,
Desnudemos al punto el acero
Y sepamos vencer o morir.
Con su sangre el altivo Araucano,
Nos legó por herencia el valor,
Y no tiembla, la espada en la mano
Defendiendo de Chile el honor.
5.- Puro Chile es tu cielo azulado,
Puras brisas te cruzan también,
Y tu campo de flores bordado,
Es la copia feliz del Edén.
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña
Que te dió por baluarte el Señor
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña,
Te promete un futuro esplendor.
6.- Esas galas, oh Patria, esas flores
Que tapizan tu suelo feraz,
No las pisen jamás invasores;
Con sus sombras, las cubra la paz.
Nuestros pechos serán tu baluarte,
Con tu nombre sabremos vencer
O tu noble, glorioso estandarte
Nos verá combatiendo, caer.

National Anthem,Ireland Anthem Text,/n/national+anthem/ireland+anthem+text_20564966.html,"Soldier's Song
We'll sing song, a soldier's song,
With cheering rousing chorus,
As round our blazing fires we throng,
The starry heavens o'er us;
Impatient for the coming fight,
And as we wait the morning's light,
Here in the silence of the night,
We'll chant a soldier's song.
Chorus:
Soldiers are we
Whose lives are pledged to Ireland;
Some have come
From a land beyond the wave.
Sworn to be free,
No more our ancient sire land
Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
Tonight we man the gap of danger
In Erin's cause, come woe or weal
'Mid cannons' roar and rifles peal,
We'll chant a soldier's song
In valley green, on towering crag,
Our fathers fought before us,
And conquered 'neath the same old flag
That's proudly floating o'er us.
We're children of a fighting race,
That never yet has known disgrace,
And as we march, the foe to face,
We'll chant a soldier's song
Chorus
Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale!
The long watched day is breaking;
The serried ranks of Inisfail
Shall set the Tyrant quaking.
Our camp fires now are burning low;
See in the east a silv'ry glow,
Out yonder waits the Saxon foe,
So chant a soldier's song.

Mexicans, at the cry of battle
Lend your swords and bridle;
And let the earth tremble at it's center
Upon the roar of the cannon.
Your forehead shall be girded, oh fatherland, with olive garlands
By the divine archangel of peace,
For in heaven your eternal destiny
Has been written by the hand of God.
But should a foreign enemy
Profane your land with his sole,
Think, beloved fatherland, that heaven
Gave you a soldier in each son.
Chorus
Ii
War, war without truce against who would attempt
To blemish the honor of the fatherland!
War, war! The patriotic banners
Saturate in waves of blood.
War, war! On the mount, in the vale
The terrifying cannon thunder
And the echoes nobly resound
To the cries of union! Liberty!
Chorus
Iii
Fatherland, before your children become unarmed
Beneath the yoke their necks in sway,
May your countryside be watered with blood,
On blood their feet trample.
And may your temples, palaces and towers
Crumble in horrid crash,
And their ruins exist saying:
The fatherland was made of one thousand heroes here.
Chorus
Iv
Fatherland, fatherland, your children swear
To exhale their breath in your cause,
If the bugle in it's belligerent tone
Should call upon them to struggle with bravery.

For you a laurel of victory!
For them a tomb of honor!

Awaken thee, Romanian, shake off the deadly slumber
The scourge of inauspicious barbarian tyrannies
And now or never to a bright horizon clamber
That shall to shame put all your nocuous enemies.
It's now or never to the world we readily proclaim
In our veins throbs and ancestry of Roman
And in our hearts for ever we glorify a name
Resounding of battle, the name of gallant Trajan.
Do look imperial shadows, Michael, Stephen, Corvinus
At the Romanian nation, your mighty progeny
With arms like steel and hearts of fire impetuous
It's either free or dead, that's what they all decree.
Priests, rise the cross, this Christian army's liberating
The word is freedom, no less sacred is the end
We'd rather die in battle, in elevated glory
Than live again enslaved on our ancestral land.

National Anthem,Scotland Anthem Text,/n/national+anthem/scotland+anthem+text_20564927.html,"Although modern, this anthem commerates the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 when the
Scottish Army under Robert I (the
Bruce) King of Scots defeated Edward ii (of Canarfon) King of England. This ended the
English rule of Scotland. Ironically in
1603 Elizabeth I, Queen of England, Wales, Ireland and France* died childless and her
Second cousin James vi King of Scots
Ascended to the English throne. Thus marriage achieved what the force of arms could not.
* English and later British Kings from Edward iii to George iii adopted the title King of
France though only one, Henry V was
Actually crowned in France abd became defacto Kinf of France.   Anthem text courtesy of
Andrew Williams's Homepage.

Ukraine is not yet dead, nor it's glory and freedom,
Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.
Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,
And we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.
We'll not spare either our souls or bodies to get freedom
And we'll prove that we brothers are of Kozak kin.
We'll rise up, brothers, all of us, from the Sain to the Don,
We won't let anyone govern in out motherland.
The Black Sea will smile yet, grandfather Dnipro will rejoice,
Yet in our Ukraine luck will be high.
Our persistence, our sincere toil will prove it's rightness,
Still our freedom's loud song will spread throughout Ukraine.
It'll reflect upon the Carpathians, will sound through the steppes,
And Ukraine's glory will arise among the people.

(The Defense of Fort Mchenry)
September 20, 1814
By Francis Scott Key
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
Oh! Thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust.""
And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you to be happy
You to have the best of things
To be down with me, baby
'Cause your lovin', it's so good

You're giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby don't you know
That I'm down until the day I die
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you

So i had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,
Untill i call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so i can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2:19 was when my moma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,
Im seein' my death, and i ain't even took my first step,
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!

Checkin his daughter tianna into junior high,

And vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses
Lace dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan,

I mean, i wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school i didn't show up, and fucked my flow up,
Mom said that i should grow up, and check myself,
Before i wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! i couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, i wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was neccessary,

Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that... (no question)
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push... Me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin"

Trying to push 700's, they ain't made them yet

A S1 diamond from a eye class don
A Cham' Dom' sipper from a Rosay nigga, huh?!

While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot

When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice

Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude
Or we tastin like food when we get in the mood
Listen girlfriend we don't mean to be rude
But anything I touch come straight to the rear
I take chickenheads like the Playmate Of The Year

You're pledging to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die
Jump in the Benz, took me a little ride
Round the mountain, broke a left, hit Sosodef
And told the nigga jd I was the one, fuck the rest
We Funkdafied, kicking it live
Robin Leach teach a nigga how to really survive
Whether it be track or blunt, ain't no need to front
Got what you need, and I take everything you ever wanted, nigga
We comin' mass, his pimpin' ass, his glass is full of Moet
The Rolex is bar-bayed, parkade, B to the are-A, T
Rolling off slow on chrome 17's

Use to sell crack so I could stack my riches

Relentlance approach to know if your broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke alot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
16 shots for my niggaz in the pen
Until we mothafuckin meet again, yea

I'm doin rhymes now
Fuck the crimes now
Cmon on to ave
I'm real hard to find now
'cause I knee deep in the beats

In the landcruiser jeep
With the mack 10
By the seats

For the jackers and jealous ass crackers in blue suits
Make your prove that it's bullet proof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks I got jin madd blunts
And bitches suckin aghhhhhhhhhhh

I'm stickin ice picks on the tip of your dick
Give your testacles A swift kick
Aint that some shit

Am I hard hard-core
Harder than the plymeth
Aint no myth
Its a nigga with it's spliff and the crome four fifth

Pressed on ya back
So what you want knocka
What you want to act

I hope civilized 'cause I love to see niggaz die
Brains all leakin  out on the streets
And the pastor preachin ""he was a good man""
Claimed a bad man when the burner was in his hand

Nows he's singin sad songs with elvis
3 to the head
Bout 6 across the pelvis

Fuck wit the high guy
You die
Your the same mothafucka kickin

I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses

Can't see B. I. G. Wit telepathy

Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out things went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for circumcise and he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridge Port, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand
'Cause man

I don't wanna live no mo'

I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Tutex to take over this projects
They call him Tutex, he tote two techs
And when he starts to bust
He likes to ask who's next?
I got my honies on the Amtrack
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hun to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last I'm literally lounging Black,
Seating back counting double digit thousands stacks
Had to re-up see what's up with my peeps
Toyota dealer cars had it cheap on the jeeps
See who got smoked but rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call
It couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated
Like lino wa' the car
I heard Tec got murdered in a town I've never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her where she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy should be home in three
Until them I look south for the home family
A true G, that's me blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't trying to see no black man turn into John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er now
Trick 'er little dope buying young girls tringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges
Seeing syringes in the veins
Hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke makes my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set no sweat from cold moet
Can't bag yet because's still wet
But when I dry back in five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had to burst on the third
Rehearse that's my word
Thinking the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no!
Even though they had me scared
Yo they gotta eight I gotta teck with air holes

That's just how the shit goes in the struggle mother fucker

The bitch.  You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like
A cold and shit.  Fuck'em.

Verse 1

Now when I'm fuckin' those Jen I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
'cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin' door
[You know] they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get their little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leavin'
Bitches be schemin', I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One hoe said, ""Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous? ""
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
'cause when I like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
[And you know that ain't right]

You know that ain't right

Verse 2

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep'em in flavours like Timbo's and Jibbo's
Bitches just like to play the Mary though
[Yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, Dee, the mpv
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep!  Banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee
Now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me, see
You know that ain't right

Repeat chorus

Verse 3

Uh... Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin' up the block, I be passin' her
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin' on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin' I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin' her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin' family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash

Whether gettin' money legally or illegally
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man! 
Yeah! Grew up a screw up, baby 
Got introduced to the game
I ain't took a breath yet 
Let's go! 

[Ludacris] 
Ever since I was an embryo, waitin' to shape up and ship out 
Somethin' in my brain said, ""Wake up and kick out!"" 
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out 
'Cause when I came, I was draped up and dripped out 
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out 
Peace out, A-Town gone and then I dipped out 
And, oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out 
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out 
Somebody get him, the lil' nigga's out of control 
Put a lil' bit of rum in my bottle; I'll dream about diamonds and gold 
Gold, gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent 
The essence of adolescence got my body feelin' fresh'n 
Fresh'n, fresh'n, and it was a blessin' to rhyme and start reppin'
I was the best in my section with flows harder than erections 
Still the best, but now I'm grown with more range than a tec's 
And I'm a heavyweight; you niggaz is lighter than my complexion 

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy] 
Hey
Y'all already know what it is 
I'm a tell you, nigga 
C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5 
Homey fronted me a sip, shit, I made it a bird 
That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word 
Say, the ice is cool but them pots is hot 
You better cook slow but that money come fast 
I got what you need; I hope you brought all the cash 
You know the kid pimpin' all over the world 
A hundred carats got me all over your girl 
Yeah, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag 
A corporate thug; I run with a Playaz Circle 
I got a Field Mob that'll disturb your peace  
Blowin' Sean Jay, all we do is smoke 
Finish countin' my bread, and I was gettin' some head 
Whassup? 

[Chorus]

[Ludacris] 
I'm a be all the way real with this, look 
When I came into the game, they ain't do nothin' but doubt me 
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothin' without me 
Pickin' up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown 
Only reason you on that song is 'cause I turned that down 
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys 
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's 
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions 
From hangin' on the block to throwin' parties in the Hamptons 
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a 
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no Marta 
From dice on the curb to stackin' up chips, but harder 
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick! 
Guard your women, dog 
I went from ashy to classy 
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doin' the nasty 
Reach your hand up in the air, and you can play with the stars 
It's not the hand that you're dealt, but how you're playin' your cards, boy!

Cause I'm a piece of shit it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black timbs and black hoodies.
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin all day, no gettin mah dick licked
Hangin wit the goodie-goodies
Loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice.
All my life I've been considered as the worst. Lyin' to my mother even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime
From drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion

I swear to god I wanna just slit my wrist and end this bull shit
Throw the magnum to my head threaten to pull shit
And squeeze,
Until the bed's completely red
I'm glad I'm dead
A worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin up
I can't
I can't believe suicides on my fuckin' mind
I wanna leave I swear to god it feels like death is fuckin callin me
But nah you wouldn't understand
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to pookie, in new jack
Except when I crossover, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby mama kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes,
Forgive me for my disrespect forgive me for my lies

Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree

Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass

Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit

Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gone mention me

Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consist of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs

Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub

Gator chunks bitch, rollin blunts with the willyist of the willie
Hitch link cop, M1's and 9-Milli's, stories like a motherfucker.
Model bitch is wonderin if i'ma fuck with her.
She knows I treat my bitches like gavana, Dolce and Gabana drippin.
Big Poppa never slippin.
H-Class diamond, shining, dinner with wifey whining, dining.
Smokin cigars and Bogatar with Columbian nigga's named Panama and Enrique and shit.
Games we play life ending.
Bitches bendin over with ease for a pair of Moschino jeans and a
Donna Karan Tank-top I got your bank stock, say whos on top?
Benjamins under the rest of them, advancing from duplex to mansion.
Stashing keys, hiding g's over seas, vcr is in my viens.
Game elevates, money I make into stocks and real estate bitch.
Jet-skiing in the - caribean, white sand, discusing plans with my man,
Dark blue land, smoke tint, chrome rims and a system that leave my rear views trembling.
Whatchu gonna do when poppa catch ya attitude, drop to your knees and show gratitude. Kiss my ring, it's a frank white thing.
I stay potent, bitches devoted take my dick and deep throat it.

Eternal sunshine, in this elevated world of mine.
Lookin for this hour glass of time.

Is there any money out ther for me?
You just listen to this hustler's story.

Now, in Mexico far from the block, trying to figure out how many glocks to a box.
Now, selling arms is what has rocks in my socks

Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase

Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, ""Don't blast here's the stash,
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!""

Nigga, ransom note style put the scarf around my motherfuckin face,
Gagged that bitch up, played the kizzack.  Soon this nigga comes up in
The spot, flash the Desert in his face he drops the glass.  Looked like
The nigga pissed on his-self or somethin, word to mother!  Ahh fuckit
This nigga runs dead to the floor, peels up the carpet, start givin me
Mad paper, mad papers.  (I told you that bitch was a shiesty bitch 'cause!
Word to mother I used to fuck her cousin but you ain't know that! Hahaha.
You wouldn't know that shit.  Really though.)  I threw all that
Motherfuckin money up in the Prada knapsack.  Two words, I'm gone!
(No doubt, no doubt... no doubt!)  Yo nigga got some live, y'all got
Some live? You got that dutch baby? *conversation fades out*"

Did it with the glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm

Ih.. Ih, ih (it has been)
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero {uhh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We've ride so many piggybacks off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

[Obie Trice + {B. I. G.}]
Since B. I. B. Taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B. I.

[Diddy + {B. I. G.}]
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uhh}
And when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!"

The Notorious B.I.G.,Juicy,/n/notorious+big/juicy_20101878.html,"Intro:

(fuck all you hoes) Get a grip motherfucker.

Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothin', to all the people that lived above the
Buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on
Me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughters,
And all the niggaz in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?

Uh-ha, it's all good baby bay-bee, uh

Verse One:

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood
It's all good

Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

Chorus:

You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

Verse Two:

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good

Uh... And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Verse Three:

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all...

(It's all good)

... And if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Uh, uh... And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Uh... And if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

Let's go

[Biggie]
Niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)

[Biggie] [Chorus:]
Do you know where your going too
Just a memory... Everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the ak
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you

Do you know where your goin too
Just a memory... So you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you

[Pusha T]
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if it's on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is Russian, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

[Chorus:]

[Malice]
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the facade
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laudering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hue the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-you-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh

[Chorus:]

Intro: repeat 2X ('Biggie' repeats every line of beat)

This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you

Verse One:

Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like ramadan
Its that rap phenomenon Don-Dadda, fuck Poppa
You got ta, call me, Francis M. H. White
In tank-light totes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, and keep firin
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip, on that cat with that grip on rap
The mo shady, ""Tell em!"", Frankie baby
Ain't no tellin where I may be
May see me in D. C. At Howard Homecomin
With my man Capone, dumbin, fuckin somethin
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen befo'
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis, before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get, who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure
Biggie, ""How are you gonna do it?""

Chorus: repeat 4X

Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more

Verse Two:

On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get, when ya marked with death
Should I start your breath should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically, I'm worser, don't front the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got c** in them, cause they, nothin but dicks
Tryin to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds, that's sick
Got pay off my flow, rhyme with my own click
Take trips to Cairo, layin with yo bitch
I know you prayin you was rich, fuckin prick
When I see ya I'ma

Chorus

Verse Three:

This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of ny
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya Braille'n it, stash that light shit, or scalin it
Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, vigilante
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren
One shot, they disappearin
Its I'll when, mc's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home, Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragilly, my nine milly
Make the white shake, that's why my money never funny
And you still recoupin, stupid *echoes*"
The Notorious B.I.G.,Last Day,/n/notorious+big/last+day_20101856.html,"Intro/Chorus: The Lox

Can I live til my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

[The Lox]
Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all

You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kicked the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds
Ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year

Chorus: repeat 2X

Before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deepe and you drown
With no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
Niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore

[Notorious B. I. G.]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert Ease make mc's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first lp, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'

Left side, right side, witcha hoe I might slide
Runnin wit this big guy, y'all niggaz is pranksters

The two weed spots, the two hot glocks

I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin

Everybody hit the D-E-C-K

Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson

Ain't nuttin separatin us from a mack-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, told ya
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustaz
No matter how you try, niggaz never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me strikin down the block, hittin corners
Mobbin like a motherfucker, livin like I - wanna
And ain't no stoppin at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga

Yo, this goes out to everybody from Staten Island
{*ah Mister Cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is gettin hard, word is bond, I swear to God
I even got caught tryin to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus?
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin lot
In front of my buildin I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

[Kane] This how we gonna do it, hold up Cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[Shy] Staten Island in the motherfuckin house
Whassup Wu-Tang Clan in here or what?

Hold up Cee..

Now what's the bullshit niggaz been saying
Don't try to act like Martin now with that ""I was just playin!""
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! Oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catchin wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, 'lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause when it comes to goin against Kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nuttin happenin
Non resistable, non compatible

Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the 8-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swingin from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin in a house of pain

From doin flicks to bustin tricks out the fuckin frame
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block
Jealous ass suckers got em duckin from my smokin' glock
And bustin niggaz asses is to stay alive
Skinny ass playa watchin bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin? how I'm a hustler?
Buckin busters 'til they die

And we party hard party wit Nas

And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize

And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better

They say the game ain't what it use to be on [?]
Used to be a g, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me snoopy trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

[Big]He fucked up, yo..

Yo, yo yo yo, yo..

Chorus: sung by Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 2X)

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

[Notorious B.I.G.]
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin somethin
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS

Chorus 2X

{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
Now.. we don't give a fuck..
We just absolutely.. don't give a fuck..
Because.. there ain't no motherfuckin love here..
There ain't no love here..
You know, we.. we just gon' keep doin what we do
We gon' keep FUCKIN YOU UP..
And I'ma keep stompin your MOTHERFUCKIN HEAD IN
You FUCKIN BITCH, c'mon!!
{last line overlaps Biggie's next verse}

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh.. I'm flamin gats, aimin at, these fuckin
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that?  Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Blackwoods and Dutchies, ya can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin tryin to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin out -- the block
For distances, givin long kisses BITCH

Chorus 2X

{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
All we have to do now.. is say a prayer for you.. y'know?
That's all we have to do, just to pray for your mind.. cause..
Eheh, see your mind got control of your heart..
When it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart's supposed to got control of your mind..
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold..

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Frank White the menacin, Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and mac-10's
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it)
This brolic, alcoholic .. {*Biggie's chorus fades in*}
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballentine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe
Sling steal slow, as for remorse, we feel no

Chorus 3X

See the fucked up thing is that I love you..
Yaknahmsayin?
It's just in my nature to love you..
I can't hate you.. cause it's not in my nature to hate you..
You know, I don't know..
Maybe.. I'm a different type of individual..
But.. you have me on the line..
And there's a thin line between love and hate
And God forbid I cross that line..
Cause y'all not gonna give a fuck
I'm tellin you right, MOTHERFUCKIN, NOW!!
THE SHIT, Y'ALL DONE STARTED, IS NEVER GONNA STOP!!!
WE ARE NEVER GONNA STOP!!!
And we not talkin bout.. no other rappers..
We talkin bout YOU motherfucker

So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
Mc's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... That if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin, ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates
The funk baby

Chorus (repeats 8X)

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"" (Lotug, Chief Rocka)

Verse Two:

All I want is bitches, big booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches
From stayin in my business, what is this?  Relentless
Approach, to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen
Until we motherfuckin meet again
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick
The funk baby

Repeat chorus

Verse Three:

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
[What's Love, Got to Do]
When I'm rippin all through your whole crew
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain

Yo, would you kill for me?
Hmmm, yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin' gats, in a Coach bag steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

So when did you first start rappin'?
Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18
So how did you first get started? Who influenced you?
Ain’t nobody really influenced me, you know what I’m saying? 
I was just tired of being on the streets, you know what I’m saying? 
Had to get up off that, you know
I see. So where you from?

Fuck it
Fed up, my nigga want to take it down south
Sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route

And his older brothers, understand, the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy
You win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother

Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheatin, now Drew she gotta slay her

Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door

I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanks

As a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he liked to do everything

He liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

His early inspirations toward rap music were
The ll's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the house

Even though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he chose

My son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my son's life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dying

We are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of that

He appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hating

And I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my son's life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in music

I'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generous

The thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave"

On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in ranges, believe them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies, Kill em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn em with thirty-three-eighties
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six buy the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one point five
I kill em all I'll be set for life Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Chorus:

Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture me bein scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture me bein shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfuckin beef cook
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture a nigga high
Then my life in that man hands, while he just decidin
Niggaz bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin ain't in my protocol

Verse Two:

Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tuscon, pushed the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a young'un, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, called The Jooks
Heard it was sweet, bout three-fifty a piece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speakin Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Heavy in the game, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
Specially if my daughter cryin, I ain't lyin
Y'all know the signs

Chorus

Verse Three:

We agreed to go on shootin is silly
Because niggaz could be hidin in showers with Mac Billy's
So I freaked em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Historia, I went to war with her
Peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from her workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blaze they place, long story, Glo seen my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was comin for the safe
Now she breakin, shut up, 112, what's shakin
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
In a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggaz bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need it
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we bout to blow this
Lets get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline, the nigga pass me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughin, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spin-t around, shot the chink in the breast
She cryin, headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin but Franco faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin
I know them niggaz in the Range is on they way up
Flippin, pistol grippin, I know they clippin
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant

I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
Shit, lyrically, niggaz can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin it
Doesn't it seem odd to you
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo Thugs dudes
Who's the killa, me or you?

Seven A. M. Woke in the mornin
With Hen and caffine and green and nicotine
No dough so pop a couple of doze
Lil Ripsta, nigga Mista Clean
Nigga Dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimentally sting, wit my
Instrumelody, and heated
Especially for your team
And a forty-five indeed will beam
In between the scenes destroy your dreams
You willin to die, we'll see
How many flees when I cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo Thugs
Trained to be perfect, disciples
When it's survival tongue, never double-edged sword
Triple, six rivals spittin fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breakin out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddeon shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Claire
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender never no surrender no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend friend, hey
Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marchin we shootin
In daily recruitin there's a tough law
Everyday in the ghetto
We start em off little we give em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the label kick it

[Krayzie]
Nigga roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off
Got a nigga car door
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin they Thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And bitch if you stickin we buckin them guzzlers, fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But Willie be servin em clemency
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin
Like gimme back me money
Thuggin with me killers, need us a leader
Or liquor but niggaz ain't got shit
Wit a sawed off pump chrome thirty-eight pistol
Now who ready to get bent
Nigga like me feenin for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money so
I'm makin my dummy rocks if I go broke

Chorus: Intro 3, Intro 2

Yeah, Little Lay hey comin in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya wit magic
Droppin down licks betta call on my gadgets
With an automatics status we spray time to load the glocks
But I'm thinkin not
There's another he forced tellin me do what I gotta do
So my otha potnah nigga die tonight
And I'm always runnin from the boys in blue
Biggie booms on my ass now provide the cellular phone
The carphone, what's happenin
Grab artillery niggaz start packin
Cause a motherfucker try to get me in a jacket, and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, despise the wise
Wanna test a nigga size, that'll cost him
Nigga fuck around wit the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run

I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose

Loungin black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at?
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But I throw my vest on my chest
Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin but frontin
For me to start somethin
Buggin and barkin at niggaz like I was duck huntin
Dumbing out, just me and my crew

Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice

Niggaz wanna flex, who got the gat? (biggie!)

Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin down punks!

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man big jacques got the glock in his waist and
Were smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said lets leave calm
I'm hittin skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a heineken
Niggaz start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing,
Biggie breaks it up yelling yo chill, man, chill!]

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like lil shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of don perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that.

This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S. I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie?  The Notorious
Jeee-zus, ""Unbelievable"" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
Mc, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)"

Yeah...

(We gon' kill your ass)

As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper girl stripper the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die

As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes
To the Lexus gettin paid, is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggaz gettin wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready

I'm ready to die!
(Nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet)
(We gonna make you suffer)

In a sec I throw the tec to your fuckin neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talkin
You better act like Cece, and keep on walkin
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung on like you slumber right you fell to the conrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stompin
I'm rippin mc's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin cheek drip
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest
Biggie Smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die!

I'm ready
(Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggaz definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready!

(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
(If I should die before I wake)
(I pray the Lord my soul to take)

Big shout out to my man Mel Smith, my man Don Cee San in the house,
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?

Verse One:
Sick of mama screaming that ""Get a job, nigga""
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Wispered in his ear ""This is what we got to do, G""
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby-mama screaming ""Your daughter 12 months""
Can't live life slinging rocks and smoking blunts
Hanging wit the niggas don't pay the bills
And being broke at thirty give a nigga the chills
So what we got to do is creep
When we see a sweet vic
Did you see that shit

Columbian Dominican, yeah whateva
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys,
20 G's,
Nigga please,
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't leave

Chorus:
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the bitches is the song I sing

Real niggas do real things

Verse Two:
After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib and bought the mafia an arcade
Mad games, pool tables, and candy
A little extra trick'n loot be comin handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit
Sold the 5 bought the 6
Del vet copped the lex, we was set
Neno had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin o's he kept the profit
No one could stop it
We was livin' it up
All the s*** young bitches stressin,
Givin'it up
Same bitches suckin' dick
Tryin their best to threw me
Said the niggas I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she smoked on that note
I saw trenchcoats
One had a mac spittin,
All I saw was gun smoke
The other had a shottie,
I was shootin everybody
And I wasn't missing
Had to get out this position
Niggas still hitting
Feelin hot ones in my back
Licked six shots, smoked a nigga wit the mac
The nigga wit the shottie still busting
Cussing, maricon's and puta's
All I'm tryna do is shoot ya
Two shots in the ruga
Booh-yeah
Blew his ass out
Then I passed out (passed out, passed out)

Chorus:
On the road to the riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing

Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 peace
Real niggas, aight

Biggie talks to someone about Lil'Ceaser

Verse Three:
The doctor said I need about 3 weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin me
Saying the best part of the day is my half
Feeding me breakfast and giving me a sponge bath
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm getting high getting head on the beach
Chillin'
Sitting on about half a million
With all my niggas,
All my guns,
All my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side,
Fuck them tricks

I married this shit, y'all niggaz still engaged
Turn blowouts to 360 waves
How this 12 gauge feel sittin on ya tongue, on ya lips 'n'
Dippin with money L in the green beamer
Sippin Zima's, on our way to see Katrina
She said she need a ""Freak Like Me,"" like Adina
Fucked her by mistake she had a twin named Regina

Squirtin on curtains, lips, tits and sheets

Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck
Wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York New York, ready for the likes of this, uh
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2: 19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy""

Verse 2

Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf?  Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Verse 3

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat?  Nah, nigga you're slippin'

The Notorious B.I.G.,Somebody's Gotta Die,/n/notorious+big/somebodys+gotta+die_20101867.html,"Verse One:

I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops!
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52, who the hell
Is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'cause I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck the Pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock

Chorus: repeat 2X

Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid

Verse Two:

Fillin clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin
Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin
About how much loot and crack he stackin
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
Small crew
'Round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was I?
Yeah
One night in town
Blew the fuck up
D-Rock went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice
Got 'em right for the virgin white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He said ""Yo Rock, set em up"", no question
Wet em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hitch links, Cocks, and Calicoles
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin hustlin
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine runnin
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if yo comin

Chorus

Verse Three:

Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin shit
Run up in they cribs
And make em catch the man n shit
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the niggas they want
And murder innocent kids
Not I
One niggas in my eye
That's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate
Thai
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin to his faculty
I start to get a funny feelins
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin
Scream his name out
Squeeze six knuckles shorter
Nigga turned around holdin his daughter"

In the middle of an hour, bring niggas more drama than they baby mamas, nigga wanna battle, I'ma bomb ya,
One man but attack like a pack of piranhas, like terracotta,
Niggas always ready for the war, they don't really wanna see a nigga tho,
We can hit 'em, in a minute, then be finished with 'em
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sicko flow
Doin' it wit Swizz, Oh NO!, u niggaz is jus tro-ou-ble,
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to servin em' verbally (YEAH),
And niggas ya'll heard of me, brick city killa, nigga word to me,
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic, with a tactic to snatch his rep back, and stack some platinum
And double on 'em at random, with the bullets I brand 'em,
Feelin' to hold the game ransom,
Runnin up in your mansion, cash demandin, flashin cannons, niggas ain't ready for this one,
Cuz I'm on a mission to get even better believe it, I'm heavily heated,
Its easy to see it, if you wanna see me, let that be the reason.

Oh goddamn, nigga!
Do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You aight?
Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prob'ly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Get a hold of yourself, nigga!)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder, if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Yo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand (Nigga, talk to me please, man!)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Yo, I'ma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

What, uhh, uhh
Nigga can't tell me nothin bout this coke, uh-huh
Can't tell me nothin bout this crack, this weed
To my hustlin niggaz
Niggaz on the corner I ain't forget you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz, word up

(Chuck D) ""One two three four five six seven eight nine""
""TEN""

I been in this game for years, it made me a animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule nombre uno: never let no one know
How much, dough you hold, cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up
Number two: never let em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence
Take it from your highness (uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number three: never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck
She be layin in the bushes to light that ass up
Number four: know you heard this before
Never get high, on your own supply
Number five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell em bounce
Number six: that god damn credit, dead it
You think a crackhead payin you back, shit forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely seperated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
Number nine shoulda been number one to me
If you ain't gettin bags stay the fuck from police (uh-huh)
If niggaz think you snitchin ain't tryin listen
They be sittin in your kitchen, waitin to start hittin
Number ten: a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years, on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up, uhh

Crack king, Frank Blizzard

Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal

Fuck the game, gimme the chain and the Range
My niggaz up to par, drop-top Jaguars
Lock on you when you step in the car
Lock-whole you when you step in the car
That's the superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hashes in the pocket with the 9
Roll up the whole dime, as my seats recline

Makin Robin scream, ""holy moley""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape I'm that Paper Crusader
Playin Sega in the wide body Blazer

I shot dice with a preacher and drank yak with a pastor
So I see myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born it was all on the own and
When it's time to die you'll be all alone so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone and
Start takin care of your own, nigga
Everybody's schemin with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be be, tryin to fight me
Standin at the crossroad but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and, some take the left
But lo and behold, what do I see?
In the distance, some resistance

I'm jammin like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few snitches
Bla-Dow! Plus my style c*** like new bitches
I roll with forward high punches, spit a flame like Liu Kang
Burnin yo' membranes, when the wind change
Mad explicit was lifted, my scriptures
Leavin your mic boney like that +Tale of the Crypt+ bitch

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it?  I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin with me, believe me that's a privelege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggaz get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga we be flyin through your hood
And hoodrats scopin with they eyes on my goods
See we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we meet em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible fuck the nigga next to you

Drunk of Dom, silk and gators
Spittin words makin birds till they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon fly
Ain't no lie, pimped out, the ssi
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew, in each state
Now I got two in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates

Verse Three: Too $hort

I had a whole lotta bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game always say the right lines
Had a few prostitues and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you
She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman lovin a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lyin
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you cause you couldn't be, like them real niggaz
She was a hustler by nature, and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too $hort

Crazy ass man
I never woulda bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm thirty years old nigga
And that bitch was hoein when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
Shit... You just a rest haven for hoes man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga
She ain't nuttin but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife fool
Everytime you turn your back that bitch is fuckin with dem gangstas
Eastside Westside these are my potnahs
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man, yeah I know a few

Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked G, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though

Verse Two:

No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a Mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

Verse Three:

If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky grand Pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed"

All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw

Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)

Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners

Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two

Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)

Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin somethin
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system

Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up

Cash in my Carharts, it ain't hard to get em

When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggaz thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?

And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me
Into flamin' 'em like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggaz in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggaz don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the dra-ma

Venue after venue, I've been through
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you s***s and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'm a roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes
Get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke lye
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming ""Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance""

Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen bitch means number one and two
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
You don't wanna play around (with me)
Probably just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together
And that we gonna have a kid together
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing
B. I. G.  Is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch

When those Bad Boy are gonna stop making all this money?!

Verse One: Styles Paniro

I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrero
But for now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman
Bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up
I got my cuban mommy cooking up
We got it all from Heron to Fishscale
New York to Ismail get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Going around the globe, hunnies wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip
Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the feds, catch me if you can
I'm a still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Get there and bury the bricks in the sand
They think I want a tan, I'm sittin' on a hundred grand
So I can hit the boat and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and hide the money in the tower
Stack blocks by the keys
L to the O to the X you'll see

And we gonna do the same thing to you we did to you in '95.
We gonna keep hittin' you in your head with all that
Flaaaaaaaaavvaaaaaaaaa

Verse Two: Jadakiss

Yeah aight then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount the flows
Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf.
Dot on your head, take all your strength
Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seam while I'm sonning you like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your duel cassette running me
Tryin' to get in front of me playa, but you ain't gettin' none of me
Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming B
When you want it? Now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators
With my mega click, involved in Montega bricks
Niggaz is mega sick, and you know we roll mega thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'
All that for frontin', what you gonna do? Nothin'
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write better nationalize
I'm into gettin' money, twistin' hunnies
Niggaz is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that, that's why I never called her
It's all about quick whips and fast knicks
Gats with mad clips, tv's in your whips
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I'm tryin' to get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so I'll s***s match
Runnin' around all crazy twistin' hunnies back
And breakin' niggaz that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Your click be like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all

Chorus

Verse Three: Sheek Luchion

Yo, hard as it is to make a buck I ain't tryin' to get stuck
So I'm a keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect Tek-9's and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with hunnies crushin' grapes
So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Luchion the mayor
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit so the town supports this
(Uh-hun)
My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' rallies, and holdin' parades for the lifers groups
Now what you gon' do?
When they come for you
The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing
And bubble gum chewing (whoooh)
While me and my mans are pursuin'
Who you think the ladies are enhancin'
Rocking Vansons I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how wo lock this

Chorus

Verse Four: The Notorious B. I. G.

Click, click, uh, uh, uh
Niggaz talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Crystal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Hitchlin' cocked M-1's and nine millies

Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana
Dippin'
Big poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggaz named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
>From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
Vcr's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribean, white sands
Discusing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life

Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed

Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)

Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters

And waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl

Be on my side,
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide

Staying here all alone
When you could be taking me
For a ride.

Yeah, she could drag me
Over the rainbow,
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead.

You take my hand,
I'll take your hand
Together we may get away

Too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today.

Yeah, she could drag me
Over the rainbow,
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead.

Be on my side,
I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me
Staying here all alone
When you could be taking me
For a ride."

I saw a glimmer from in her eye
I saw the distance, I saw the past
And I know I won't awaken, it's a dream that can last

I feel like I died and went to Heaven
The cupboards are bare
But the streets are paved with gold

And all the lights were turned down low
And no one wondered or had to go
Out on the corner the angels say
There is a better life for me someday

From door to door.

Find a place nearby
For her to stay.
Just someone

Fix my meals and go away.

Turns strange.

For the raid.

They tore you down and
Plowed you under.
You're only real
With your make-up on
How could I see you
And stay too long?

All along the Navajo Trail,
Burn-outs stub their toes
On garbage pails.
Waitresses are cryin'
In the rain
Will their boyfriends
Pass this way again?

Oh, Mother Goose,
She's on the skids
Shoe ain't happy,
Neither are the kids.
She needs someone
That she can scream at
And I'm such a heel
For makin' her feel so bad.

Sickness gone
It's hard to say
The meaning of this song.
An ambulance can only
Go so fast
It's easy to get buried
In the past
When you try to make
A good thing last.

I saw today
In the entertainment section
There's room at the top
For private detection.
To Mom and Dad
This just doesn't matter,
But it's either that
Or pay off the kidnapper.

So all you critics sit alone
You're no better than me
For what you've shown.
With your stomach pump and
Your hook and ladder dreams
We could get together
For some scenes.

Well, I'm up in T. O.
Keepin' jive alive,
And out on the corner
It's half past five.
But the subways are empty
And so are the cafes.

Except for the Farmer's Market
And I still can hear him say:
You're all just pissin'
In the wind
You don't know it but you are.

And there ain't nothin'
Like a friend
Who can tell you
You're just pissin'
In the wind.

I never knew a man
Could tell so many lies
He had a different story
For every set of eyes
How can he remember
Who he's talking to?
Cause I know it ain't me,
And hope it isn't you."

But I'll see you in my dreams
And I might live a thousand years
Before I know what that means.

Once there was a friend of mine
Who died a thousand deaths
His life was filled with parasites
And countless idle threats.
He trusted in a woman
And on her he made his bets
Once there was a friend of mine
Who died a thousand deaths."

Don't care what the governments say
""they're all bought and paid for anyway""
Save the planet for another day
""hey big oil, what do you say?""

We were runnin' through the night
Never knowin' if we would see the light
Paranoid schizophrenic visions
Livin' in fear of the wrong decisions

We got to wake up
We got to keep goin'
If they follow us
There's no way of knowin'

We got a job to do
We got to
Save mother earth

Be the ocean when it meets the sky
""you can make a difference, if you really try""
Be the magic in the northern lights
""six days....six nights""
Be the river as it rolls along
""it has three eyed fish and it's smellin' strong""
Be the rain you remember fallin'
""be the rain, be the rain""

Yeah rain was fallin' and we're soakin' wet
Hail is beatin' down on our heads
The wind is blowin' through our hair
Faces frozen in the frigid air

We got to get there
Alaska
We got to be there
Before the big machines

We got a job to do
We got to
Save mother earth

Dream the hunter on the western plain
""the birds are all gone, where did they go?""
Dream the fisherman in his boat
""he's comin' home empty, he's barely afloat""
Dream the logger in the great northwest
""they're runnin' out of trees, they got to give it a rest""
(there's no other way to cut it)
Dream the farmer in the old heartland
""corporate greed and chemicals are killin' the land""

Next mornin' sun was up at dawn
She looked around and earth was gone
Dark visions he had last night
He needed peace, he needed light

He heard the rumble and
He saw the big machines
The green army rose
It was a bad dream

He had a job to do
He had to
Save mother earth

Be the ocean when it meets the sky
""greek freighters are dumping crap somewhere right now""
Be the magic in the northern lights
""the ice is melting!""
Be the river as it rolls along
""toxic waste dumpin' from corporate farms""
Be the rain you remember fallin'
""be the rain, be the rain""
Save the planet for another day

Flew the lone grey rider
Leather bag
Pounding on his back
Above the clouds the moon
Was climbing higher
A pack of wolves wanted
Their money back

With folded arms
The chief stood watching
Painted braves
Slipped down the hill
In his ears
The spirit talking
As they closed in
For an easy kill

At the house
The door was wide open
Wind blew
Curtains off the rod
She was waiting and hoping
She was praying to her god

He was luckier than most men
He was barely in his prime
As she stood there
In the doorway
Her long dress flowing
Would he make it this time

[solo]

Over the hill
In the big green country
That's the place where
The cancer cowboy rides
Pure as the driven snow
Before it got him
Sometimes I feel like
He's all right

Sometimes I feel
Like a piece of paper
Sometimes I feel
Like my own name
Sometimes I feel
Different later
Sometimes I feel
I feel just the same

Lookin out across the bay

And focused on

Kind of like a wave confused
Dancing in the sunset hews
She waved to me
And called me over

And the green grass grows

How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards,
Cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window.

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye.

Land of beauty,
Space and light
Land of promise,
Land of might
You're my home now
And it's true
California, here's to you.

Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye.

Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal.
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Even Richard Nixon has got
Soul.

Traffic cops are all color blind.
People steal from their own kind.
Evening comes to early for a stroll.
Down neon streets the streaker streaks.
The speaker speaks,
But the truth still leaks,
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Even Richard Nixon has got it,
Soul.

The podium rocks in the crowded waves.
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before
He played this role
For the hotel queens and the magazines,
Test tube genes and slot machines
Where even Richard Nixon got soul.
Even Richard Nixon has got it,
Soul.

Hospitals have made him cry,
But there's always a free way in his eye,
Though his beach just got
Too crowded for his stroll.
Roads stretch out like healthy veins,
And wild gift horses strain the reins,
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Even Richard Nixon has got
Soul.

Though I campaigned all my life

Named Captain Kennedy
He lost his wooden schooner
To the Germans on the sea
Exploded on the water
For everyone to see
And humiliate that American
Captain Kennedy.

I saw him in Nassau in 1971
His strength was failin'
But he still ran a run
He worked 'til his fingers
Wore to the bone
To buy that wooden schooner
And sail on his own.

He was known in the islands
As hundred foot iron

Was passin' it's time
And time flew by faster
With life on the sea
And the days grew shorter
For Captain Kennedy.

Sit by my side, come as close as the air, 
Share in a memory of gray
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures
That I play of changes

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die, trapped within
the circle time parade of changes

Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind, 
Visions of shadows that shine.
Til one day I returned and found they were the
Victims of the vines of changes

The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze
A race around the stars, a journey through
The universe ablaze with changes

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
But when the morning breaks they're swept away by
golden drops of dawn, of changes

Passions will part to a strange melody.
As fires will sometimes burn cold
Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver
strings of souls, of changes

Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else, 
One last cup of wine we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on
the rolling river shores of changes

Sit by my side, come as close as the air, 
Share in a memory of gray
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures
That I play of changes"

They've come to see
What's going down

Falling down.
Falling down, falling down.
Falling down, falling down.

On this noisy shore
Standing at the edge of you.
Could those dreams of yours be true
Or did you, did you, did you
Pushed it over the end?
How much time did you spend?
Pushed it over the end.

Into politics now
And things are looking much better

Knitting her fine sweaters.
At the end of a weary day
She feels hard and she looks hard.

There's another poor man
Falling down.
Falling down, falling down.

And found you waiting at the door
And far inside your walls

With the secrets of the worlds.

In their clothes of many colors

And the men stood
Straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on.

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones.

They carried them
To the flatlands
And they died along the way

A wad of cash in my pants
I get paid by a ten year old
He says he looks up to me
There's still crime in the city
But it's good to be free
Yeah

Now I come from a family
That has a broken home
Sometimes I talk to Daddy
On the telephone
When he says that he loves me
I know that he does
But I wish I could see him
I wish I knew where he was
But that's the way
All my friends are
Except maybe one or two
Wish I could
See him this weekend
Wish I could walk in his shoes
But now I'm doin' my own thing
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
Although my home has been broken
It's the best home I ever had
Yeah

Well, I keep gettin' younger
My life's been funny that way
Before I ever learned to talk
I forgot what to say
I sassed back to my mom
I sassed back to my teacher
I got thrown out of Bible school
For sassin' back at the preacher
Then I grew up to be a fireman
Put out every fire in town
Put out anything smokin'
But when I put the hose down
The judge sent me to prison
He gave me life without parole
Wish I never put the hose down
Wish"

At the crossroads
Looking for a sign of true love.

Bought my ticket, honey

Have turned to stone

About you
All day long
'Cause you've been
With another man
Here you are
And here I am.

That he cracked
Long ago in the
Museum with his
Friends.

The jailbird takes the raps
And he finds himself
Spread-eagled on the tracks
But the training that he learned
Will get him nowhere fast.

And I know we
Should be free
But freedom's just
A prison to me
'Cause I lied
To keep it kind
When I left you
Far behind.

With the rain
Pounding on his
Back he recalls
The moment that
He cracked long
Ago in the museum
With his friends.
And like those
Memories the rain
Keeps pounding
Down, down, down.

Have turned to stone
I can fly fly fly away.
Watch me fly above the city
Like a shadow on the sky.

To follow one's own dream

Are not often what they seem

And load you down
In disguise of security.

To make those deals
In the days that used to be.

Talk to me, my long lost friend,

Your circumstance,
Are you driving a new car

Or just another
Hundred thousand miles away

Are falling from the trees

See the turtles
Heading for the bog
And falling off the log.
They make the water splash,
And feeling no backlash,
They climb the happy banks.

On the boats,
The old and creaky boats,
The shoreline goes gliding by,
And the wind,
There was a dying breeze,
Is making the banners fly.
See the colors,
Floating in the sky,
The pride of the captain's eye,
As he glides
His slender craft inside
And opens up the door.

On the coast,
The long and tempting coast,
The cards on the table lie,
And a speech,
So eloquent in reach,
Was made by a passerby,
Passing by the way between
Here and left behind.
And it ripples through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake.

Yes, it echoes through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake."

Song of love to sing for you.
All I need is this song of love,
To sing for you.

On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones
That missed their chances,
When they couldn't let it show,
Lies the land of sweet surrender,
Like a dream
It might have ended there,
But we didn't even know.

Floating in love's atmosphere.

Shining in the sun...

Don't ever leave me, baby
No matter what you do
There's just one thing
I'm askin' of you.

Don't take your love away from me
Don't take your love away from me
'Cause if you ever leave me, baby
How wrong you would be
Don't take your love away from me.

When I make a promise,
You can bet that it's true
When I make a promise,
Baby, you can bet that it's true
So put your chips down, baby
Empty your pockets, too
'Cause when I make a promise,
You can bet that it's true.

Neil Young,Double E,/n/neil+young/double+e_20179269.html,"Back in the country
Livin' on the double e
In the sunshine of her life
There's a ready young filly
And mom and daddy
Won't let her leave
Mom and papa won't let her go

But when they go out dancin'
She breaks out on her own
She's hot enough to
Burn the house down
And mom and daddy don't know

When edith and earl
Renamed the double e
They nearly made history
The neighbors rose up
And some of them were mad as hell
'cause it used to be the double L

Change comes slow in the country
When you're new
There's a lot of distrust
Years pass by uneventful,
And memories turn to dust

Meanwhile granny
Has got her bright colors on
The sunshine in her eyes
Cruisin' by the bars
And honky tonks where she met grandpa
And caught that young man's eye

Dusty white eldorado
Cruisin' through the trees
Slippin' through the shadows
Of what used to be

Back in the day
Livin' in the summer of love
Livin' in the summer of love

Grandma's ok
But not the same since grandpa's gone
She's livin' in the summer of love

Back in the day
Livin' in the summer of love
Livin' in the summer of love

Livin' in the summer of love

Livin' in the summer of love

Livin' in the summer of love"

You dressed in black and white,
You lost in the mall
I watch you disappear

Another sleepless night,
A sun that won't fall.

A new day is dawning
And our homeless dreams
Go back to the street

Another civilization
Would really make
This life feel so complete.

In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a longway from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go

Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
I'm stuck here on the grass, with the pain that ever grows
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the cloud she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain"

The riders on the hill
The fire in the fields
She sees the mission bell
Swinging in the silence
Now the shooting starts
The bullets pierce the hearts
The seqoritas crying at the well.

Up in the Gold Hotel
The money hits the table
The heavies all are there
That's why the deal's goin' down
Beautiful women all dressed in
Diamonds and sable
Down upon the street
Beside a garbage heap
A Mariachi band begins to play.

Somewhere a blues guitar
Plays echoes in the alleyway
The Tijuana dawn
Claims another day
The golden sun
Rises on the runway
The pilot understands
The money changes hands
Inside the jet
The briefcase snaps. Goodbye.

In Eldorado town
There lives a great bullfighter
His eyes are screaming blue
His hair is red as blood
And when the gate goes up
The crowd gets so excited
And he comes dancin' out
Dressed in gold lami
He kills the bull
And lives another day."

Dawning on the green

Bouncing off the towers

Won't you try to do us justice
Because we want to be just like you
And your families

A-rocking on my daddy's knee
Daddy took an old guitar and sang
Bury me on the lone prairie
Uncle Bob sat at the piano
My girl cousins sang harmony
Those were the good old family times
That left a big mark on me

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to she'd a tear for me
'Cause then I won't be far from home

Walking down the trans-Canada highway
I was talking to a firefly
Trying to make my way to Nashville, Tennessee
When another car passed me by

Some day I'm gonna make big money
And buy myself a big old car
Make my way on down to that promised land
And then I'm gonna really go far

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky
And then I won't be far from home
Just bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to she'd a tear for me

Neil Young,Farm Aid Song,/n/neil+young/farm+aid+song_20536384.html,"Well I hate to say the farmer
Was the last of a dying breed
Living off the land
And taking what he needs
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind.

In the struggle for parity
Not one man's voice can sound
Cause the foundation
Of the conglomerate
Is firmly in the ground.
Yeah, they want to feed the world
But for power and for greed
Then they'll cut off the supply
Until they get what they need.

Well I dreamed I saw a dust bowl
Where the farmers used to live
Earth was flying through the sky
It had nothing left to give
Tractors were burning
On the Whitehouse lawn
Just woke up one morning
And the farmers all were gone

I hate to say the farmer
Was the last of a dying breed
Living off the land
And taking what he needs.
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive.
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind.

From you know with straws in the bottles
Things were lookin' you know, sun was shining so bright

There was gliders flyin' around in the sky

They go down the alley ways, you know

So I said, you know, ""I don't believe this. This isn't real""

Right on them and made and awful sound and, uh—
I ran over there, I could see that they
Were really gone, you know

But on the ground beside them was this little baby, dressed in— it just had a red blanket wrapped around it, so I picked it up and took it to my car over on the corner which wasn't too far away and put it in the back seat

It was sleeping and I looked and a crowd had gathered on a parking lot

Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong

Getting so much resistance from behind

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
Cause she once was a true love of mine

[Verse:]
If you're goin' when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and the summer ends
Please see for me she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling wind

Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breasts
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
That's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

Remember me to one who lives there

Is not a dream
The only reality
Is the way it seems.

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all.

Give me strength to move along.
Give me strength
To leave my sweetheart.

I'm riding down this wet road
In my old car
The moon is almost full
Except for stars.
The party ended
Long before the night
She made me feel alive
And that's all right.

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all.

Give me strength to move along.
Give me strength
To leave while she's gone.

The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes

Lots of coal in the mines
We got soldiers so strong
They can bury their dead
And still not go back
Shooting blind.

There's women and men

Doing forty hours
Plus overtime

Held at the airport
Can come home
To something worthwhile.

There were creatures at play
Running hand in hand
Leading nowhere to stay
Driven to the mountains high
They were sunken
In the cities deep
Livin' in my sleep.

I feel like goin' back
Back where
There's nowhere to stay
When fire fills the sky
I'll still remember that day
These rocks I'm climbin' down
Have already left the ground
Careening through space.

I used to build these buildings
I used to walk next to you
Their shadows tore us apart
And now we do what we do
Driven to the mountains high
Sunken in the cities deep
Livin' in our sleep.

There's nowhere to stay."
Neil Young,Goin' Home,/n/neil+young/goin+home_20206740.html,"On the hill where Custer was,
Making his last stand,
With the Indians all around,
And his gun in his hand.

Such a wind was blowing that day,
Through the battleground,
I could feel it in my hair,
As I turned towards downtown.

Weaving through the buildings,
Cutting though the streets,
Slicing through the culture,
Piling on the weeks.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home.

Dropping in on you my friend,
Is just like old times,
Said the fool who signed the paper,
To assorted slimes.

It's hard to get blood from a stone
But for you I'll give it a try,
To provide your accomodations,
And leave you satisfied.

You'd think it was easy,
To give your life away,
To not have to live up to,
The promises you made.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home.

Elusively she cut the phone,
Moved from cell to cell,
Really looking remarkable,
And obviously doing well.

She made a turn on a wooden bridge,
Into the battleground,
With a thousand warriors on the ridge,
She tried to turn her radio down.

Battle drums were pounding,
All around her car,
She saw her clothes were changing,
Into sky and stars.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home."

Said edith as she filled his cup,
""nobody'll find you here
And earl is glad you guys showed up

The way things are downtown
You might have to stay for a while
There was a helicopter flyin' over your house
When I talked to your neighbor kyle""

""who the hell do they think they are?
Invading our home like that
Grandma and I had to leave so fast
We couldn't even catch the cat

The helicopter scared the shit out of it
And it took off down the trail
Down past the railroad track
Towards the county jail""

""jed you really screwed up now
What'd you have to do that for?
Everybody wants to hang your ass
Here's a note from lenore""

She touched the cold steel bars
As she pushed the paper in
Jed took it up and read it
And couldn't hide a grin

Outside the jail window
A crow flew across the sky
Completely disappearing behind each bar
Then a helicopter flew by

""say hi to earl and edith
Tell'em I'm doin' fine
Tell'em you're ready to leave home now
And they should cut the line

Can grandma come and see me?
I've got a new song to sing
It's longer than all the others combined
And doesn't mean a thing""

The noise was unfamiliar...
A walkie talkie squealed
Generators were runnin'
Vans parked in the field

Tv crews and cameras
They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch
They came through the gate and up on the lawn
Knockin' down edith's tiki torch

Grandpa saw them there
Looking through the venetian blind
""those people don't have any respect
So they won't get any of mine

I ain't gonna talk about jed...
I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9
I don't have time to talk that fast
And it ain't my crime

It ain't an honour to be on tv
And it ain't a duty either
The only good thing about tv
Is shows like 'leave it to beaver'

Shows with love and affection
Like mama used to say
A little mayberry livin'
Can go a long way""

He took earl's gun from the closet
And loaded up both barrels
Went out on the porch and fired them off
And up walked a woman named carol

""susan carol from early magazine
I've got some questions to ask""
""well you can stick 'em where the sun don't shine,""
Grandpa said with a gasp

Then he fell face first and let out a sigh
Edith came out in shock
Grandpa was whispering to her from down on the floor
He looked like he was tryin' to talk

""that guy who just keeps singin'
Can't somebody shut him up?
I don't know for the life of me
Where he comes up with this stuff""

They laid his head on a newspaper
With a picture of carmichael on the front page
Posing with a little league baseball team
And a seedy shot of jed with a motorcycle.

Grandpa died like a hero
Fightin' for freedom of silence
Tryin' to stop the media
Tryin' to be anonymous

Share your lovin' and you'll live so long
Share your lovin' and you'll live so long
Share your lovin' and you'll live so long
Live so long"

She rides alone with you and me

Up on a hill
They rode in one long column
They were freezing with the chills
Of the new day dawning.

Their hair long and grey
They heard just one voice calling
Grey Riders on the morning sky,
The sun made diamonds
Of their road-weary eyes.

The phones were ringing in the pink motel

He was the King

Pushing a plough in a black and white movie

It was some kind of Vegas dream
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape
And a blue-haired lady screamed

Rocking on the back of a flatbed truck
With an old guitar in his hand
He was the King

He was riding in a pink Cadillac
Wind was blowing through his hair
And he never did look back

Neil Young,Helpless,/n/neil+young/helpless_20099105.html,"There is a town in north Ontario,
With dream comfort memory to spare,
And in my mind
I still need a place to go,
All my changes were there.

Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
Yellow moon on the rise,
Big birds flying across the sky,
Throwing shadows on our eyes.
Leave us

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby can you hear me now?
The chains are locked
And tied across the door,
Baby, sing with me somehow.

Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
Yellow moon on the rise,
Big birds flying across the sky,
Throwing shadows on our eyes.
Leave us

Helpless, helpless, helpless."

And you find yourself alone
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you
Yes I'd miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say I'm here for you

When the winter comes to your new home
And snowflakes are falling down
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and I'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you
Yes I'd miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say I'm here for you

In the spring, protective arms surrounding you
In the fall, we let you go your way
Happiness I know will always find you
And when it does, I hope that it will stay

Yes I miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say I'm here for you
Yes I miss you
But I never want to hold you down
You might say I'm here for you
I'll always be here for you"

They can relax and watch the sun
Rise above all
Of the beautiful things
They've done.

Go to the country take the dog
Look at the sky without the smog
See the world laugh
At the farmers feeding hogs
Eat hot dogs.

What a pity
That the people from the city
Can't relate to the slower things
That the country brings.

Time itself is bought and sold.
The spreading fear of growing old
Contains a thousand foolish games
That we play.

While people
Planning trips to stars
Allow another boulevard to claim
A quiet country lane
It's insane.

So the subtle face is a loser
This time around.
Here we are in the years
Where the showman
Shifts the gears
Lives become careers
Children cry in fear
Let us out of here!"

That closed behind are cracking

Last night
I heard the bells of summer rapping
The word vows of a mother incomplete

The emptiness of summer must begin it
The nagging of the mother of the wild
Convinced me that I had no way to win it
She took it from my hand and then she smiled

The coldness
Of the closeness of the moonbeam
The walking in the dawn to greet the night
The water and the flower is a bad dream
The stocking drawn reveals the end of sight

It's over 'cause it's older than the midnight
The school boy told the woman on the street
The joining of the weekend - Monday daylight
Will leave the black rose meeting incomplete."

Surrounded my old stagecoach

There was a time
When the river was wide
And the water
Came running down
To the rising tide
But the wooden ships
Were just a hippie dream
Just a hippie dream.

Don't bat an eye
Don't waste a word
Don't mention nothin'
That could go unheard
'Cause the tie-dye sails
Are the screamin' sheets
And the dusty trail
Leads to blood
In the streets
And the wooden ships
Are a hippie dream
Capsized in excess
If you know what I mean.

Just because
It's over for you
Don't mean
It's over for me
It's a victory
For the heart
Every time
The music starts
So please

Don't kill the machine.

Goes to seed
In an ether-filled
Room of meat-hooks

I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just drive on through.

You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
Smoked some then and I'll do it again
If I only had some cash
Only had some cash.

Then I tried amphetamines
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my '48 Buick's dash.
But I knew that wouldn't last.

Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter.

But the neon lights
And the endless nights
The neon lights
And the endless nights
The neon lights
And the endless nights
The neon lights
And the endless nights
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes.

Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen
See or be seen
Or see or be seen.

Living in the country
Sounded good to me
Smoking grass while the summer lasts
In the real organic sea
Where everything was green
Everything was green.

Then we had a kid and we split apart
I was living on the road
A little cocaine went a long long way
To ease that different load
But my head did explode
My head did explode.

I wish I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru.

When I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too

Did you just drive on through.

Counting on one another

Held a broken arrow?

Eighteen years of American dream,
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall.
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall,
His mother had told him a trip was a fall,
And don't mention babies at all.
Did you see him, did you see him?
Did you see him in the river?
He was there to wave to you.
Could you tell that the empty quivered,
Brown skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow,
Held a broken arrow?

The streets were lined for the wedding parade,
The Queen wore the white gloves, the county of song,
The black covered caisson her horses had drawn
Protected her King from the sun rays of dawn.
They married for peace and were gone.
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you.
Could you tell that the empty quivered,
Brown skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow,
Held a broken arrow?"

Been burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful comin' down
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'
Flashed and I think I'm fallin' down
Crashed, and my ears can't hear a sound
No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

SONG: Do I have to come right out and say it
(Neil Young)
Do I have to come right out and say it
Tell you that you look so fine?
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?
If it was a game I could play it
Trying to make it but I'm losing time
I got to bring you in, you're overworking my mind
Chorus:
Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she cared
Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared
Once before
Do I have to come right out and say it
Tell you that you look so fine?
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

And every thing you've got is all that she requires.

You can feel it getting down to the wire.

All the hurt you thought was gone has now returned,
And every thing she's laughing at is all you learned.
And you let go, let go, let go, 'cause you know you're getting tired.
Can you feel it getting down to the wire?

Those of us who run
To catch a moment in the sun
Seem to find the when we're done
That we weren't supposed to run

And there's to many words going down
Babe wrecking against the walls with the hollow sounds
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you see
It ain't million, you and me not a crown

Finding what you sought
After all the time you fought
Sometimes leave's you with the thought
That perhaps you just been caught"
Neil Young,Expecting To Fly,/b/buffalo+springfield/expecting+to+fly_20350860.html,"There you stood on the edge of your feather,
Expecting to fly.
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye,
Knowin' that you'd gone.
By the summer it was healing,
We had said goodbye.
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry,
Babe, ended with a cry,
Babe, ended with a cry.

I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground.
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I found,
Knowin' it was gone.
If I never lived without you,
Now you know I'd die.
If I never said I loved you,
Now you know I'd try,
Babe, now you know I'd try.
Babe, now you know I'd try,
Babe."

And my eyes aren't open
And I'm standing on my knees
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I miss you

Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I miss you

Sometimes I feel like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home

City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I miss you"

I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair

For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season

I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on.
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, You're strange, but don't change, and I let her

Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster"

Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun
To singing in the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes
Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score
Who's trying to act like he's just in between
The line isn't black, if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be

And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five
Who's got the feeling that he came alive
Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same
It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim
Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor
There it is baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleepin', but is writing this song
Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong"

I went insane
Like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now"

All I hear are screams from outside the limousines
That are taking me
Out of my mind

Happy to find
That I don't know what I'm smiling for
Tired of hanging on
If you've missed me, I've just gone

And she's comin',
Singing soft and low,
Singing rock and roll.
She's a joy to know.
Neath the shadow
Of her soothing hand
I am free there
Just to make my plan.
Dream of faraway lands,
Anything close at hand.
And she will follow me.
What do you know?
Familiar places she's been by,
And I know.
Could it be she don't have to try?
And tomorrow,
She's a friend of mine.
And the sorrow,
I see her face is lined.
She's no longer blind.
She's just hard to find."

Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun

On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wondered
With the secrets of the worlds

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones

They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today

And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way

With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail

'cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail
And it's less than a mile away
I hope they didn't come to stay
It's got numbers on the side and a gun,
And it's making big waves

Daddy's gone, my brother's out hunting in the mountains
Big john's been drinking since the river took emmy lou
So the powers that be left me here to do all the thinking
And I just turned twenty-two
I was wondering what to do
And the closer they got,
The more those feelings grew

Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassuring
He told me, 'red means run, son, numbers add up to nothing'
But when that first shot hit the dock, I saw it coming
Raised the rifle to my eye
Never stopped to wonder why
Then I saw black and my face flash in the sky

Shelter me from the powder and the finger
Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
Just think of me as one you never figured,
To fade away so young
With so much left undone
Remember me to my love
I know I'll miss her"

But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
Cause I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking at my mirror and seeing a scar
But I'm not giving in an inch to fear
Cause I missed myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

When I finally get myself together
I'm going to get down in that sunny southern weather
And I find a place inside a laugh [?]
Separate the hooey from the chair [?]

Only to trip at the sound of good-bye
Wordlessly watching
He waits by the window
And wonders
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries
Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?
They are one person
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other
Stand by the stairway
You'll see something
Certain to tell you confusion has it's cost
Love isn't lying
It's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello
They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are for each other"

But somehow I feel you're safer where you are.

If you're looking for examples to refer to,
Take a look around yourself I'm sure you'll find
There are many things to make your life much brighter
And I bet there's many more inside your mind

There's a man I know
With no expressions
He's got none at all
There's a man I know
With no expressions, no
He's got none at all

You know, I've never seen this man laughing
Come to think of it I've never seen him cry
But you might by loving start him singing
By and by, he'll stop and sigh
You'll feel a breeze, his nose begins to freeze
And then it winks good-bye

Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone?
All you have is memories of happiness
Lingerin' on.

You might wonder who can I turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.

All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you,
They're only passing through you in the end.
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to,
And wait for you to come back again.

You might wonder who I can turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room.

From that lamp on down the hall.
Maybe the star of Bethlehem
Wasn't a star at all."

My life's an open book, you read it on the radio

But' if you still decide you want to take a ride

Meet me at the Wrecking ball
Wrecking Ball, I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball
Wrecking Ball, I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight

I see smokey eyes right across the bar
I've seen that look before shining from star to star
Though I can't take that change
If you've got time for one dance

The restless line of cars goes stretching down the road
But I won't telephone cause you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way
What is it makes me want to say"

All the great explorers
Are now in granite lake
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade

The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen.

They killed us in our tepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun.

They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share.

I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the mornin'
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen.

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk about Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
Like the Astrodome
And the first tepee

Neil Young,Furry Sings The Blues,/j/joni+mitchell/furry+sings+the+blues_20075345.html,"Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now
And Egles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
Lt's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent - waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent - staring ar her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter- ghosts - history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues"

Well, you take my hand and I’ll take your hand, baby
Oh, together we may get away
All of this madness is too much sorrow, yes it is
And it’s impossible to make it today

Ooh, la la la la la la la la la la
She could drag me over the rainbow and take me away
Down by the river I, Lord I shot my baby
Down by, down by the river, I shot my baby"

Oh, hello, Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said you're strange, but don't change, and I let her

In a while, will the smile on my face turn to plaster
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change I don't know, why don't you ask her [4x]"

A situation that could casualise your mind

Than you've ever seen me be

Dug a hole and I did fall in
There I stayed for a while
Who done told to be my saviour
In their pity they done lost all sense of me

Nothing really matters but the love that's in my heart
Long tall sally's standing by me
Many are the friends I have been loyal to a fault
Who have known all along
That there ain't too much good we've done
Feeling shameful for too long
And you ain't bad but you went wrong
We all are sinners
The lord forgives us every one
God forgive every one"

I was reckless, tryin' to throw my life away
I was too young for where I'd been
Tryin' to regain my innocence
Already lost my best friend
Off somewhere in Vietnam
I wasn't going to go look for him
My destiny, just around the bend

Come along this apparition
An enigma for my intuition
Told me hold on to what you said
You got song, and you're too classy
Hard as Canadian black ice
All over you, makin' you think twice
Y'already can
Our destiny just around the bend
Just around the bend

So come on, let's go to New York city
Play the night owl, it's a pity
Couldn't find him, so I headed west
Think everyone knows the rest
I found him on the Sunset Strip
Bad place to get a grip
Got a band of famous men
Next thing you know
They took me round the bend
Round the bend

We got down on to some magic places
But the peoples around all had four faces
Couldn't stand such an honest heart
They couldn't wait to tear us apart
Early I didn't know
But the magic isn't odd you know
Don't need to be alone again
That's rockin', a roundin' at the bend
Roundin' at the bend"

And when she leaves she leaves nothing at all

See the drunkard of the village falling off the street
Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady
'cause the taste is so sweet
But the laughing lady's loving
Ain't the kind he can keep

There's a fever on the freeway
Blacks out tonight
There's a slipping on the stairway

There's a rumbling in the bedroom
And a flashing light
There's the old laughing lady

Hunger only for a world of truth

Thought I'd make history
Making babies was the best I could do
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever
Found out the hard way one can't possess another
And all that you have is your soul

So don't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
'Cause all that you have is your soul

I thought, thought that I could find a way
To beat the system
To make a deal and have no debts to pay
I'd take it all, I'd take it all, I'd run away

A little luck to come my way
A hope to dream, a hope that I can sleep again
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands

The whistle blows and the factories close
There's a million more commuters on the access roads
The brake lights flash--there's an RV crashed
I'm in the passing lane going nowhere fast
The traffic crawls and the engine stalls
I'm stuck on the edge of the urban sprawl

There's a line of cars as far as I can see

Goin' nowhere
Roll down the window, let me scream

Oh yeah, ain't it a shame
We're all jammed up at the interchange
The paramedics and the CHP
Wait impatiently for catastrophes
I'm spending half my days like this
I might as well be working on the midnight shift
The radio's tuned to the traffic news
And everybody's choking on monoxide fumes

From sin and shame

To stay upon that tree
And take a crown of thorns for me
Because of love

Shouldering the blame
Why did he chose to go (he didn't have to go, no)
How could he love me so?

On the road to Calvary

I had fallen down but he picked me up
He rescued my soul
Now I want the world to know
Because of love he left the grave
Prepared for us a place
Hell back again someday

Because you believed
Youll live eternally
And I'll fall on my knees
And I will cry

You walk beside me.

You make me want to be the best that I can.
And you walk beside me, giving strength I've never known.
I am not alone,
You walk beside me.
I am not alone
Whereever the road leads.
And I rely on your patience,
When I face the unknown.
And becuase of you, I am...
I am not alone...

In the sun, In the rain
Through the good times and
In the pain.

I know that you understand.

Natalie Grant,I Believe,/n/natalie+grant/i+believe_20807936.html,"In a land far away time stood still
Long ago there were shepherds in fields
Or at least this is how the story goes

The story goes woman with child
And a man with no room
Born in a manger for telling it too
This is how the story goes

But it is more than a fable
And it’s more than a fairytale
And more than my mind can conceive

I believe the Wise man saw the baby born
The angels called the son of God, Heaven’s child, the great I am
Born to take away my sins through nailed pierced hands
Emmanuel has come

I believe two thousand years still the story lives on
God’s gift to us sent to earth wrapped in flesh
His only son, His only son

And the heartbeat of heaven
Confounded our wisdom
But it’s still the simple truth
That sets me free

I believe the Wise man saw the baby born
That the angels called the son of God, Heaven’s child, the great I am
Born to take away my sins through nailed pierced hands
Emmanuel has come

And I believe precious child how can it be
That God’s great plan for His story
Would send you to the lonely tree
That you would come for one like me

I believe in a cross, I believe He came for one, he came for all
Heavens child became a plan, gave his life for me
In spite of all I am, I believe, I believe, oh I believe

Christmas lives in me
I believe"

Where are the words that can say what's
In my heart
All that I am is amazed by who you are

Chorus:
The one thing I desire
Is just to know you more
To live a life that moves and breathes
And loves to bring you joy
So fill me with a fire
That burns away my doubts and all my fears
Into a place where you are all I hear
It's the one thing I desire
To do what you require
Is the one thing I desire

To love when I'd rather turn away
To give when I'm more resigned to take
To reach out a hand to someone who
Feels alone
The way you reached for me
When there seemed to be no hope

Offering a sacrifice of praise

I will make mistakes
I will face heartache

All other ground is sinking sand

Many times before
My life has been like broken glass
And I have kept the score
Of all my shattered dreams and though it seemed
That I was far too gone
My brokenness helped me to see
It's grace I'm standing on

Has been a badge I've worn
Though I have been torn

Natalie Grant,If The World Lost All It's Love,/n/natalie+grant/if+the+world+lost+all+its+love_20202820.html,"All around us these days,
There are souls that cry so deeply,
To fill the emptiness we feel inside.
We look around so hard to try and find,
The kind of love we know that will survive.
But here within a heartbeat,
Is a love that so completely,
Will take away the fear we try to hide,
And even though we often wonder why,
He gives us love so strong we can't deny.

If the world lost all it's love,
He would still have some to give you!
And if the stars should lose their light,
We'd still have His to hold back the night!
This hope is mine,
If the world lost all it's love,
His still would shine!

Hearts in need of kindness,
Often stumble into blindness,
When the dream world and the real world pull apart.
It leaves us with a cold and empty heart.
You'd think that we would know right from the start.

If the world lost all it's love,
He would still have some to give you!
And if the stars should lose their light,
We'd still have His to hold back the night!
This hope is mine,
If the world lost all it's love,
His still would shine!

Lost inside the hearts we hide,
There's hope that He will take us in.
To take away the suffering,
And let new life begin.

If the world lost all it's love,
He would still have some to give you!
And if the stars should lose their light,
We'd still have His to hold back the night!
This hope is mine,
If the world lost all it's love,
His still would shine!"

You can't love if you don't love yourself

There is hope when my faith runs out
Cause I'm in better hands now

It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down
It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground
So take this heart of mine there's no doubt
I'm in better hands now

I am strong all because of you
I stand in awe of every mountain that you move
Oh I am changed, yesterday is gone
I am safe from this moment on

There's no fear when the night comes 'round

He is my light, my strength, my song;
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My Comforter, my All in All,
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone! Who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save:
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied -
For every sin on Him was laid;
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine -
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath.
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand."

Wild at heart and following her dreams
Believing she was pretty
Got a ticket to the city
Where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine

It was only a chat room, but it would lead the way
To the door of a man where she'd throw it all away
He said they'd take it slow
But little did she know
She'd be all used up by the end of the day

But she was strong
And she would survive
Ambition would be her drive
And she said...

I'll make a way
I'll do whatever it takes
Even though it won't be easy
I have a plan and though I may not understand
Someday, I'll make a way

Where did she go wrong, how did she get here?
Livin' hard and looking older than her years
Miss Little Big Town
Trying to hold a job down
Doing what she could to choke her fears

But she was strong
And she would survive
A spark of hope had kept her dream alive
And she cried...

I'll make a way
I'll do whatever it takes
Even though it won't be easy
I have a plan and though I may not understand
Someday, I'll make a way
Someday, I'll make a way

Walking down the road
In the city where she'd come with so much hope
Her vision had long died
Along with all her pride
And she found herself at the end of her rope

But she heard angels through the door
Of a church she'd passed a million times before
There was a song of heaven ringing
And soon she found herself believing
That out there maybe there was something more

So she bowed her head to pray
And said, Jesus, please make a way

And she heard Him say...

I'll make a way
I'll do whatever it takes
Even though it won't be easy
I have a plan and though you may not understand
Today, I'll make a way

Take my dreams and help me to fly
On the wings of possibility
Come rewrite my history

Take this life and make it matter

Help me give more than I take
Let me see into somebody else's heartache
And be the difference love can make
My heart is finally finding
That there is more

Only one life to live
Only one love to give
Only one life, only one love

Natalie Grant,Make Me Over,/n/natalie+grant/make+me+over_20565088.html,"I've been silent instead of speaking up
Gave my advice instead of giving love
I have been unfair, faithless and unkind
I have shut my eyes just so I would stay blind
It's not what I'm meant to do
Cause I wanna honor You

Make me over, make me new
Make me a mirror, a reflection of You
Take me all apart, take me to Your heart
And pull me closer
Oh Jesus, make me over

Take away the pride that whispers in the dark
Take the stone out of the middle of my heart
Hidden underneath my insecurities
Is the servant that You've destined me to be
Day after precious day
I get in my own way

So make me over, make me new
Make me a mirror, a reflection of You
Take me all apart, take me to Your heart
And pull me closer
Sweet Savior, make me over

I am only made of Your imagining
I'm dust and clay on the wind
Wash me in the river of Your sacrifice
Until I'm changed, purified

Take me all apart, take me to Your heart
And pull me closer
My Jesus, make me over

Make me over
Make me over
Oh, make me over, Jesus"

Just to glimpse your fate
Just to see whether it all works out
It's a long road, a heavy load
You gotta really want to go
And just let the others walk around
You now

Up and down again
But this time it's different
It took some waiting to straighten
Out the bend
In and out of luck
Yeah at times it was difficult
I got a new life baby, It takes some getting used to but...

Chorus:
No sign of any rain
My skies are clear today
I keep bracing for that hit
But there's not sign of it.
No obstacles in sight
My skies are clear tonight (My skies are full of light)
I keep thinking I might see that cloud arrive
Oh but there's no sign of it
No sign of it

And as I look around, it's all new ground
The leaves on the trees touch down
But I'm above weightless as a dream
It's been a long road, a heavy load
I just simply had to go
Had to get here hard as it's been

In and out of luck
Yeah at times it was difficult
I got a new life baby, it takes some getting
Used to but...

How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by,
Yet in thy dark streets shine'th
The everlasting Light,
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild,
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray,
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell,
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!"

One million chains could never hold back this moment in time
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means
Heaven and earth, they cradle the infinite Joy born on this night
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world
He stands beside her, he'd share her pain if he only knew how
He whispers 'i love you' as he gently strokes her brow
He's so scared, but he's so blessed
There's a thundering pride pounding deep in his chest
For he knows...

Christ is born, we are blessed
Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess
That we know..

The world hears the voice of God weep
Mary sings a lullaby
As the Hope of the nations gently falls asleep
She knows this is the one Child
To forever change the world."

Whose body is torn
With illness
But she marches - on

Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!"

My mama watered mine, and raised me to be
A rose, a rose, or some greater thing
Mama, you're beautiful to me
Oh my Daddy, I want you to know
Your little, baby girl became that rose
The bloom, the bloom blushed deeper red
With every drop of sacrifice you bled
[Chorus:]
There's no growing without any pain
There's no flowers without the rain
We are bound together by blood that's flowing through us
And that's the way it is with love
I have a vision, a hope and a dream
I see a hill, across a healing stream
Where the Rose arose, to set us free
And the Cross became a family tree
[Chorus:]
Circle of God comes around
And turns us into special things, somehow
And one day we'll hold little flowers of our own
And we'll sacrifice so that they can grow

Natalie Grant,There Is A God,/n/natalie+grant/there+is+a+god_20304730.html,"For as long as I remember
Ever since I was a child
I've had the understanding in my heart
That there is a Creator, a Master of design
Who hung the moon and every single star
But the greatest revelation that I could ever know
He loves me in my weakness
And calls me His own
[Chorus:]
I have a hope, and I believe
My faith is alive, my spirit is free
Though He's unseen, still I know deep within my soul
There is a God
In the arms of human nature
I've fallen on the way
He's heard the desperation of my cry
Oh, one drink of living water, can heal the hurt inside
He fills my cup, it never will run dry
For the price of my redemption is covered by the blood
And I have been made worthy
By His gift of love
[Chorus:]
Father of Light
He never changes, He never fails
Giver of grace, author of life
He paid the price, so I can say
I have a hope, and I believe
My faith is alive, He's living in me
There is a God
I do believe, I do believe
[Chorus:]
There is a God
He's the way, the truth, the life
There is a God
His name is Jesus"

Sometimes my soul feels the edge of the night.
Sometimes my will, my foolish pride,
Carries me far, far away from Your side!
And when I lose my way, I know...

I look to You to find my strength.
Carry me to the end of my days!
A steady hand to lead me through,
Arms of faith to bring me back to You!
I will keep my eyes on love,
Set my heart on things above!
When my soul is so afraid,
I look to You to find my strength!

Sometimes my hope, it slips away.
Sometimes my dreams come crashing down!
Sometimes my life, this crazy life,
Has a heart, has a heart of it's own!
And when I lose my way,
You know

I look to You to find my strength.
Carry me to the end of my days!
A steady hand to lead me through,
Arms of faith to bring me back to You!
I will keep my eyes on love,
Set my heart on things above!
When my soul is so afraid,
I look to You to find my strength!

When the tears keep pouring down,
And my lips can't make a sound,
I know You hear my prayer,
And Your strength is always there!

I look to You to find my strength.
Carry me to the end of my days!
A steady hand to lead me through,
Arms of faith to bring me back to You!

Set my heart on things above!

As all across the earth we call His name
Reminding us, the whole world over
Deep at heart, we are all the same

Closing the distance, between our different lives
And His grace fills every step we take
As we walk on in faith
No matter who or where we are

Take all the walls we build
And bring them crashing down

We know we will never face this world alone

How two hearts can come together
And love can last forever
But now that I have found you, I believe
That a miracle has come
When God sends the perfect one
Now gone are all my questions about why
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life

(Chorus)
I wonder what God was thinking
When He created you
I wonder if He knew everything I would need
Because He made all my dreams come true
When God made you
He must have been thinking about me

(Verse 2)
I promise that wherever you may go
Wherever life may lead you
With all my heart I'll be there too
From this moment I want you to know
I'll let nothing come between us
And I will love the ones you love
Now gone are all my question about why
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life

To harmonize in perfect tune

Cause my world just can't be right
Without you in my life

Counting minutes as they passed
Searching for a sign
Wishing for the best
And just when I thought my chance was gone
You came to me with open arms

Like a miracle out of the blue
You rescued me when I turned to You
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies
When You walked, when You walked into my life

When You appeared
Like sight to the blind
Like music to my ears
Like a reason to a rhyme
Just when my hope was wearing thin
You taught my heart to love again

Like a miracle out of the blue
You rescued me when I turned to You
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies
When You walked, when You walked into my life

And there's nothing to fear- your loves

That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is

I remember this afternoon
When my sister came into the room
She refused to say how my father was
But i knew he'd be dying soon.

And i was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad
That i realized that i despised this man i once called father.
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching
His body now just eighty-eight pounds
Blinded eyes still searching
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.
Dying alone, naturally.

I was his favourite child, i had him a little while
Just as long as i could play the piano and smile a little smile
Just when i needed him most, he was already a ghost
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken

Leaving me alone with all my troubles
Not ever once touching me and saying
""daugther, i'll help you get over.""
Now he's fadig away and i'm glad to say,
He's dying at last. naturally.

It's a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart
Believes the words that the bible said ""til death do us two part"".
For her that was forever and ay, he decided her night and day
How could some english words so small affect someone so strangely?

Taking her away from us, her soul included
She might es well be gone with him, all the children are excluded.
Loneliness is hell, i know so well,
For i'm alone. naturally.

I waited three weeks for him to die
I waited three weeks for him to die
Every night he was calling on me
I wouldn't go to him.
I waited three weeks for him to die
Three weeks for him to die.

And after he died, after he died
Every night i went out, every night i had a flight.
It didn't matter who it was with
'cos i knew what it was about.
And if you could read between lines, my dad and i close as flies.
I loved him then and i loved him still, that's why my heart's so broken.

Leaving me to doubt god in his mercy
And if he really does exist then why does he desert me?
When he passed away i smoked and drank all day,
Alone. again. naturally."

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Then slowly turn away from me

Maby the suns light will be dim
But it wont matter anyhow
If mornings echo says we've sinned
Well it would what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the nght
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)

And she'd be sitting around
In a rocking chair talking to herself

And she used to say she used to say
Sometimes the cold gets in my bones so bad
Till I just don't think I can go
Yeah and for a little while well I don't care
If my days are coming to an end
And just as soon be gone sometimes

Sometimes the night comes down on me
And I know what's ahead
An evening in this cold old house
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed
An evening in this cold old house
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed

Sometimes
I wonder why I stay
What am I waiting for
My children are grown and gone away
They got children of their own now
Don't need me anymore

In winter when the streets are bare
There ain't nothing much to see
I just can't help missing and thinking
About that kindly man
That one old winter time came
And took away from me

And then one morning
Another spring is there outside my door
Things are blooming
Birds are singing
And suddenly yes well I ain't sad
Ain't sad no more ain't sad no more

When it's warm and the sun is out
It's like my heart's restored
I've had my love I've had my children
And I have so many memories
So don't mind me complaining
What the years may bring

Cos this old world has been fine with me really
And I'm thankful for seeing another spring
It's gonna be better this time another spring
It's gonna be groovier this time another spring
It's what's happening this time
So I'm thankful for letting me see another spring"

Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born"

Beat-up little seagull
On a marble stair
Tryin' to find the ocean
Lookin' everywhere

In a hard town by the sea
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothin' here for free

Hooker on the corner
Waitin' for a train
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk
Sleepin' in the rain

And they hide their faces
And they hide their eyes
'Cause the city's dyin'
And they don't know why

Oh, Baltimore
Man, it's hard just to live
Oh, Baltimore
Man, it's hard just to live, just to live

Get my sister Sandy
And my little brother Ray
Buy a big old wagon
Gonna haul us all away

Livin' in the country
Where the mountain's high
Never comin' back here

Nina Simone,Beautiful Land,/n/nina+simone/beautiful+land_20100626.html,"Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse

Red is the color of a lot of lollipops,
Orange is any orange on a tree.
Yellow's the color of a bag of lemon drops,
Green is a piece of seaweed in the sea.

Blue is the color of the sky in summertime
Indigo is a Siamese cat's eyes.
Violet's the color of a flow'are in wintertime.
These are the colors of the rainbow skies.

There is a beautiful land
Where all your dreams come true;
It's all tied up in a rainbow,
All shiny and new;
But it's not easy to find
No matter what you do.

It's not on top of a mountain
Or beneath the deep blue sea
Or in London zoo or in Timbuktoo,
Or in Timbuckthree.

And if you travelled the world
From China to Peru,
There's no beautiful land on the chart.
An explorer could not begin
To discover it's origin
For the beautiful land is in your heart."

Of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair

Oh, I love my lover
And well he knows
Yes, I love the ground on where he goes
And still I hope

That the time will come

His face is like roses so fair
He's the prettiest face
And the neatest of hands
I love the ground on where he stands

Oh I love my love
And this he knows
I love the ground on whereon he goes
If you no more on earth I see,
I can't serve you as you have me

The winters passed and the leaves are green
The time is passed that we have seen
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I will be as one

I go to the Clyde to mourn and weep,
But satisfied I never could sleep
I write you a letter
Just a few short lines
I'll suffer death ten thousnad times.

So fare you well my ain true love
The time has passed but I wish you well
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I wil be as one.

I love my love and this she knows
I love the ground whereon he goes
He's theprettiest face and the neatest of hands,
I love the ground wereon he stands."

With silver needles and with silver threads

Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women she'd a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man

Between a doctor and a lawyer man

She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match

Rounding third he was headed for home

If he likes to dance now
Tell you what you do
When you see him comin' down the street
You start to (Do the bungaloo)

Oh no, even when he's wrong
Tell him that he's righr
You can take the blame
Both day and night"
Nina Simone,Desperate Ones,/n/nina+simone/desperate+ones_20100500.html,"Jacques Brel, Jouannest, Eric Blau, Mort Shuman

They hold each others hands
They walk without a sound
Down forgotten streets
Their shadows kiss the ground
Their footsteps
Sing a song
Tat's ended before it's begun
They walk without a sound
The desperate ones

Just like the tiptoe moth
That dance before the flame
They burn their hearts so much
That death is just a name
And if love calls again
So foolishly they run, they run, they run
They run, they run, they run, they run
They run without a sound
The desperate ones

I know the road tey're on
I've walked their crooked mile
A hundred times or more
I drank their cup of bile
They watch their dreams go down
Be hind the settin sun
Yeh, yeh, yeh, they walk without a sound
The desperate ones

Le he who threw the stone at them
Stand up and take a bow
He knows the verb ""to love""
Beu he'll never, never, never know how
On the bridge of nevermore
They disappear one by one
Disappear without a sound
The desperate ones

And underneath the bridge
The water's sweet and deep
This is their journey's end
The land of endless sleep
They cry to us for help
We think it's all in fun,
They cry, they cry, they cry, they cry
Without a sound
They disappear without a sound
They walk without a sound without a sound
Disappear without a sound
Cry without a sound
Yai, yaj, yaj, yaj, yaj, yaj, yaj
The desperate ones"

Do I move you, are you willin'
Do I groove you, is it thrillin'
Do I soothe you, tell the truth now
Do I move you, are you loose now
The answer better be (Yes, yes)
That pleases me

Are you ready for this action
Does it give you satisfaction
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'
If you are then let's start swayin'
The answer better be (Yes, yes)

When I touch you do you quiver
From your head down to your liver
If you like it let me know it
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it

Nina Simone,Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me,/n/nina+simone/do+nothin+till+you+hear+from+me_20100729.html,"(1943) Duke Ellington, Bob Russell

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will



Original lyric

Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Sine ev'ry one spreads the story
With his own little personal touch

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memroy
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And you never will"

Do what you gotta do
Come on back see me when you can
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And man you never lied to me
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can"

I want you to know

And I get more than my share
But that's me one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing

Your winning ways excited me
And all the while I was certain
That we two found a love that comes just to a few

And so I guess I'll go
Although it's only nine

Streets full of people, all alone
Roads full of houses, never home
A church full of singing, out of tune
Everyone's gone to the moon

Eyes full of sorrow, never wet
Hands full of money, all in debt
Sun coming out in the middle of June
Everyone's gone to the moon

You see a long time ago life had begun
Everyone went to the sun

Parks full of motors, painted green
Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream
Arms that can only lift a spoon

You see everyone's gone

Everyone's gone to the moon

What will happen now

Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.

""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of veiw that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

A smile to put them in,
Got other lives to listen to
And some music that I have to do
I forget that I'm not over you for a while.

Days go by with no empty feeling,
Until I touch my hair and touch my skin
And remember you're gone.

Drop around-you need your friends. ""

It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit

Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be

I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit

Placed some labour laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie

Nina Simone,Glad To Be Unhappy,/n/nina+simone/glad+to+be+unhappy_21301445.html,"Look at yourself
If you had the sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band

Look at yourself
Do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand

Since you took it on the chin
You have lost that toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble

Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win
But here am I 
More than glad to be unhappy

Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad

Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad"
Nina Simone,Go Limp,/n/nina+simone/go+limp_20100631.html,"Alex Comfort, Nina Simone

Oh Daughter, dear Daughter,
Take warning from me
And don't you go marching
With the N-A-A-C-P.
For they'll rock you and roll you
And shove you into bed.
And if they steal your nuclear secret
You'll wish you were dead.

(refrain:)
Singin too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.
Singin too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.

Oh Mother, dear Mother,
No, I'm not afraid.
For I'll go on that march
And I'll return a virgin maid.
With a brick in my handbag
And a smile on my face
And barbed wire in my underwear
To she'd off disgrace.

(Refrain)

One day they were marching.
A young man came by
With a beard on his cheek
And a gleam in his eye.
And before she had time
To remember her brick...
They were holding a sit-down
On a nearby hay rig.

(Refrain)

For meeting is pleasure
And parting is pain.
And if I have a great concert
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again.
Oh Mother, dear Mother
I'm stiff and I'm sore
From sleeping three nights
On a hard classroom floor.

(Refrain)

One day at the briefing
She'd heard a man say,
""Go perfectly limp,
And be carried away. ""
So when this young man suggested
It was time she was kissed,
She remembered her brief
And did not resist.

(Refrain)

Oh Mother, dear Mother,
No need for distress,
For the young man has left me
His name and address.
And if we win
Tho' a baby there be,
He won't have to march
Like his da-da and me."
Nina Simone,Go To Hell,/n/nina+simone/go+to+hell_20209519.html,"Now if your mind lies in the Devil's workshop
And evil duens your thrill
And trouble and mischief is all you live for
You know darn well
That you'll go to hell

So you're living high and mighty
Rich off the fat of the land
Just don't dispose of your natural soul
Cause you know darn well
That you'll go to hell

I say hell
Where your natural soul burns
Hell
Where you pay for your sins
Hell
Keep your children from wrongdoing
Cause you know darn well
That they'll go to hell.

I say hell
Man, woman were created
Hell
To live for eternity
Hell
With an apple they ate from the tree of hate
So you know darn well
That they went to hell

Now Satan was an angel in heaven
But he stirred up trouble and woe
So the lord commanded that the Devil be branded
So you know darn well
He went to hell
Yeah, he went to hell
Yeah, he went to hell
He went to hell."
Nina Simone,"God, God, God",/n/nina+simone/god+god+god_20482831.html,"From the depths of slumber,
As I ascend the spiral stairways of wakefulness,
I will whisper:
God! God! God!

Thou art the food, and when I break my fast
Of nightly separation from Thee,
I will taste Thee, and mentally say:
God! God! God!

No matter where I go, the spotlight of my mind
Will ever keep turning on Thee;
And in the battle din of activity, my silent war-cry will be:
God! God! God!

When boisterous storms of trials shriek,
And when worries howl at me,
I will drown their noises, loudly chanting:
God! God! God!

When my mind weaves dreams
With threads of memories,
Then on that magic cloth will I emboss:
God! God! God!

Every night, in time of deepest sleep,
My peace dreams and calls, Joy! Joy! Joy!
And my joy comes singing evermore:
God! God! God!

In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping,
Serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving,
My soul will constantly hum, unheard by any:
God! God! God!

How am I gonna face the empty years.

Let a gambler lead me astray

She sews those new blue jeans
And my sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied

Tell her to do, not to do what I have done

You came show me the way

Till now I was like a grain of sand
Lost on a lonely beach

That this was within my reach

Because darling you're mine

A love worth more than gold"

I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.

[Chorus:]
I can't see nobody... No, I can't see nobody.
Mine eyes can only look at you... You.

I used to have a brain; I used to think of many things.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Don't ask me why, little girl. I love you and that's all I can say.
You're ev'ry, ev'ry breath I take. You are my nights; my night and day.

(chorus...)

Every single word you hear... Is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... A love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... It doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... But in my eyes you'll always be.
Every single word you hear... Is coming from this heart of mine.
I loved you such a long time ago... Don't know why...
And I don't know why... Baby...

I get along without you very well
Of course, i do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then i recall
The thrill of being sheltered
In your arms
Of course, i do
But i get along without you very well

I've forgotten you
Just like i said i would
Of course, i have
Or maybe except when i hear your name
Someone's laugh that's just the same
I've forgotten you just like
I should

What a guy
What a fool am i
To think my aching hearth
Could keep the moon
What's in store
Should i phone once more
No, no, no, no, no
It's best that i stick to my tune

I said that i get along
Without you very well
Of course, i do
Except perhaps in spring
But then i should never
Ever think of spring
For that would
Surely break my heart in two"

My baby ever treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!

My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like alonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Original lyric

The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The good book says "" go seek and ye shall find""
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;
In emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him.
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!

My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out

I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should

And I'll forgive you your mistake
But forgive me if I take it all to heart
And make sure that it doesn't start again

Yes I'm the kind of people
You can step on for a little while
But when I call it quits
Baby that's it

But crawling just ain't my style

Deep inside me there's no regrets
But a gal who's been forgotten may forgive
But never once forget"

To help the needy and show them the way

I'm going back home where I was born

Try to understand I think this city's grand
But with all it's charme give me the little country farm
I'm going back home where I was born

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now oh yeah
I tell you all about it I think you ought to know
Tell you all about it why I wanna go

I miss the country preacher and the house of prayer
I miss the bootlegger smelling in the air
Miss friendly faces and the country smiles
The crickets singing you can hear it for miles

Miss the rooster crowing at the break of dawn
Yes it all happens where I was born
Miss the fried chicken colored greens
Miss the hot biscuits and the lima beans
Miss the prayer meeting where the people pray
With the drum beating till the break of day

You can have it you can have it
You can have it you can have it
You can have thy town I won't be around
This here life's too fast but 'll never never last

I'm going back home where I was born
I got to go home got to go home
Where the people are real people can feel
Got to go down got to go down
Leave here today on my way so long so long
Going back home going back home
Got to go home got to go home
Got to go home got to go home
Where I where I was born"

The stars would fall from the skies

The birds in Maytime
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me

With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you"

Rien n'est jamais acquis Г  l'homme. Ni sa force
Ni sa faiblesse ni son cЕ""ur. Et quand il croit
Ouvrir ses bras son ombre est celle d'une croix
Et quand il croit serrer son bonheur il le broie
Sa vie est un Г©trange et douloureux divorce

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Sa vie elle ressemble Г  ces soldats sans armes
Qu'on avait habillГ©s pour un autre destin
A quoi peut leur servir de se lever matin
Eux qu'on retrouve au soir dГ©sarmГ©s incertains
Dites ces mots ma vie et retenez vos larmes

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Mon bel amour mon cher amour ma dГ©chirure
Je te porte dans moi comme un oiseau blessГ©
Et ceux-lГ  sans savoir nous regardent passer
RГ©pГ©tant aprГЁs moi les mots que j'ai tressГ©s
Et qui pour tes grands yeux tout aussitфt moururent

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Le temps d'apprendre Г  vivre il est dГ©jГ  trop tard
Que pleurent dans la nuit nos cЕ""urs Г  l'unisson
Ce qu'il faut de malheur pour la moindre chanson
Ce qu'il faut de regrets pour payer un frisson
Ce qu'il faut de sanglots pour un air de guitare

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne soit Г  douleur
Il n'y a pas d'amour don't on ne soit meurtri
Il n'y a pas d'amour don't on ne soit flГ©tri
Et pas plus que de toi l'amour de la patrie
Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne vive de pleurs

Her beauty,
She thinks her brown body

Naked,
Under palm trees
And see her image in the river

On the street,
And dishwater gives back no images."

I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips
Upon my lips
And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark

But soon
This dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun
Fun to be kissed

Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind

We're gonna find romance

In the evening by the moonlight
When my mother had finished working
We used to sit around the fire place
Till the cornbread it was done
And then we all would eat our supper
After that we'd clean the kitchen
It's the only time they ever gave us to spare
To have a little fun
Then my daddy used to take his fiddle down
That hung upon the wall
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright
How the folks would enjoy it
They would sit all night and listen
As we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear banjos ringing
You could hear them by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear folks all singing

Watching rainbows play on sunlight;
Pools of water ice cream cold light, in the morning.
Yeah yeah yeah
Its the morning of my life.

In the daytime I will meet you as before.
You will find me at the?(pool) waiting by the ocean floor,
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that nobody understands,
In a morning.
Its the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the ev'ning I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where w'll stay till the sun shines
Another day lay on clothes lines
I'll be yawning
It is the morning of my life
The morning of my life"
Nina Simone,Isn't It A Pity,/n/nina+simone/isnt+it+a+pity_20285779.html,"Isn't it a pity
You don't know what I'm talking about yet
But I will tell you soon
It's a pity

Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a shame
Yes, how we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain

How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to remember
Just forgetting and no thank you
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do I explain
Why not too many people can see
That we are all just the same
We're all guilty

Because of all the tears
Our eyes just can't hope to see
But I don't think it's applicable to me
The beauty that surrounds them
Child, isn't it a pity

How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
The most precious thing
Without thinking anymore

Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to keep open our door
Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do I explain
Isn't it a pity
Why not too many people
Can see we're all the same

Because we cry so much
Our eyes can't, can't hope to see
That's not quite true
The beauty that surrounds them
Maybe that's why we cry
God, isn't it a pity

Lord knows it's a pity
Mankind has been so programmed
That they don't care about nothin'
That has to do with care
C-a-are-e

How we take each other's love
The most precious thing
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to keep open the door

But I understand some things take so long
But how do I explain
Why not too many people
Can see we're just the same

And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
God, isn't it a pity
The beauty that surrounds them
It's a pity

We take each other's love
Just take it for granted
Without thinking anymore
We give each other pain
And we shut every door

We take each other's minds
And we're capable of take each other's souls
We do it every day
Just to reach some financial goal
Lord, isn't it a pity, my God
Isn't it a pity, my God
And so unnecessary

Just a little time, a little care
A little note written in the air
Just the little thank you
We just forget to give back
Cause we're moving too fast
Moving too fast
Forgetting to give back

But some things take so long
And I cannot explain
The beauty that surrounds us
And we don't see it
We think things are just the same
We've been programmed that way

Isn't it a pity
If you want to feel sorry
Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us
Because of all our tears
Our eyes can't hope to see

Maybe one day at least i'll see me
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'
And till that day
Mankind don't stand a chance
Don't know nothin' about romance
Everything is plastic
Isn't it a pity
My God."

The things I used to like, I don't like any more,
I want a lot of other things I've never had before,
It's just like my mamma says, I sit around and mourn
Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.

I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring."

Been hoping that you'd drop in

Beautiful what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry

Put some music on while I pour.

But baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell.

I oughta say no no no sir
Mind if I move a bit closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay

Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside

Ooh baby it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
My your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half-a-drink more
Never such a blizzard before.

I've got to get home
But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
Your eyes are like starlight now*
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt,

And I make love

And I ache
Just like a woman
But I break
Like a little girl

Nobody here feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
And no one has to guess
That baby's got new clothes
Lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And the problems
From her curls

Refrain
I take
Just like a woman...

It was raining from the first
And I was dying her of thirst
That's why I came here
And a long time's curse
And what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear
Ain't it clear

I must admit
I believe it's time for me to quit
And until we meet again
Bein' introduced as friends
Please don't let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry
And it was your world

I take
Just like a woman....

Original lyric by Bob Dylan

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand here in the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

(break:)
It raining at first, and I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here.
Ain't it clear...

That I just can't fit.
I believe it's time for us to quit.
But when we met again and are introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world.

You take just like a woman.
You make love just like a woman.
And then you ache just like a woman.
But you break just like a little girl."

When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on rue morgue avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess out of you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend my doctor
Won't even say what it is I have got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

Up on housing project hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them
Are to be what they claim
If you're looking to get silly
You better go back from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
Hew they blackmailed the sergeant at arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking like a ghost

I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough"

Just say I love him loved him from the start
And tell him that I'm yearning to say what's in my heart
Just say that I need him as roses need the rain
Tell him that without him my dreams are all in vain

If you should chance to meet him anytime anyplace anywhere
Say I was a fool to leave him
Tell him how much a fool can care
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then
Just won't you tell him that I love him

Ask no pity about my shame

Gave a heart but I was spurned
All this time how I have yearned
Just to have my love returned

Years have passed by
And the spark still remains
True love can't die
It smolders in flames
When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

Years have passed by
And the spark still remains
True love can't die
It smolders in flames
When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

I'm the keeper of the flame"

And she was a lass from the low countree
But she loved his lordship so tenderly.
Oh sorrow, sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

One morn when the sun was on the mead
He passed by her door on a milk white steed
She smiled and she spoke, but he paid no heed
Oh sorrow, sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

If you be a lass from the low countree
Don't love of no lord of high degree
They haint got a heart for sympathy
Oh sorrow, sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God"

'Tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
'Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow, when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown
Oh! Who would inhabit this bleak world alone!"

To bring home the bacon,
And if I find myself alone and forsaken,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in it's recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because It brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Hiked a-hundred highways, never found a home.
Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,
Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me.

There was a girl, in denver, before the Summer storm.
Oh her eyes were tender, oh her arms were warm.
And she could smile away thunder, kiss away the rain,
And even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.

Chorus

There was a girl, in Portland, before the Winter chill.
We used to go a-courting, along October hill,
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow,
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.

Watch him close his eyes from the start
Hear that music pour from his heart so fine

So sweetly he plays and he says it so well
Completely up under his spell

So if you're in the mood for music and love
Just forget the stars up above
For you'll find you'll be drawn
To the man with the horn

But the show hasn't been written for it, yet

Hound dogs on my trail
School children sitting in jail
Black cat cross my path
I think every day's gonna be my last

Lord have mercy on this land of mine
We all gonna get it in due time
I don't belong here
I don't belong there
I've even stopped believing in prayer

Don't tell me
I tell you

Yes you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie

Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies

Do things gradually

Then he lightly touched down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
In fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

Original lyrics by Judy Collins

My father always promised me
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

We lived in Ohio then
He worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats
We knew we would sail in time

All my sisters soon were gone
To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man

I stayed behind the youngest still
Only danced alone
The colors of my father's dreams
Faded without a sound

And I live in Paris now
My children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life
In words they've never seen

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again

My father always promised us
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again"
Nina Simone,My Man's Gone Now,/n/nina+simone/my+mans+gone+now_20100748.html,"George Gershwin, Dubose Heyward

My man's gone now
Ain't no use a listenin'
For his tired footsteps
Climbin' up the stairs

Old man sorrow's
Come to keep me company
Whisperin' beside me
When I say my prayers
When I say my prayers

He come around
He come up, he come around
Ain't that I mind workin'
Workin' means travelers
Journeyin' together
To the promised land

But old man sorrow
Mountin' all the way with me
Tell' me that I'm old now
Since I lose my man
Since I lose my man

Since I lose my man"
Nina Simone,My Way,/n/nina+simone/my+way_20100614.html,"(1968) Jacques Revaux, Claude Franзois, Gilles Thibault, Paul Anka

And now, the end is near and so I got to face
The final curtain, girl
Friends I say clear and state her case of which I'm uncertain
I've lived a life that's full of travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yeah, regrets, I've had a few
But then again, who feel to me uncertain.
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each other course, each careful footstep along the byway,
Yeah, and more, much more than this,
I did my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I did all much more than I could do
But threw it all, when there was doubt, on everyday
And it's not enough, I faced it all
And as big as all did my way.

Oh, I've laughed and cried, had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, counted also music
To think like the old lad
And may I say not in a sky away,
Oh, no no no, You're not me, I did it my way.

What is a man, what have he got
If not himself, and he had not to may the things
He truly feels not words of one for use
With that shows, I took the blows and did it my way!

Original French lyric

Je me lГЁve et je te bouscule

J'ai peur que tu aies froid

Et pas encore rentrГ©e

Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit déjà
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Ou il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière
Je ferai un domaine
Ou l'amour sera roi
Ou l'amour sera loi
Ou tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants-là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est para""t-il
Des terres brulées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai là
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas"

And over his image

Stand on the sea of glass
With the harps of God all around them.

I'm so tired with cold feet
Who says: ""Here's two bits Nina honey, go and eat?""

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time

For no body, no time

I go home to find some bliss
Who hands to me a glowing kiss?

Well once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, I didn't care
Takin' my friends out for a mighty good time
Buyin' boot leg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Couldn't find me no friends
Had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it, till the eagle grins

I said nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, you ain't got one penny
And your friends, you didn't have any
Just as soon as you get up on your feet again
Here they all come, they say that they're your long-lost friend
Oh lord without a doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you
When you're down and out

Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out"

He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen

Will spend her life alone"

Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy Southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
With a skull on it's masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""Hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you! Earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here, tonight
Nobody's gonna sleep here

Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face

This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""Why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Runs a flag up it's masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them NOW, or LATER?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them NOW, or LATER?""

Noon by the clock
And so still at the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""Right now.
Right now! ""

Then they pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It
Is

Nina Simone,Poppies,/n/nina+simone/poppies_20100774.html,"A child ran through the meadow on a sun drenched summer day
And then he stopped his play
And kneeled in a field of poppies.

A man walked through my ghetto on a humid summer day
And then he stopped to pay and he dealed in a field of poppies.

Oh, flower of forgetfulness, just an hour away to the moon
Take a deep breath if you are reaching for truth
While you're in the stupor
The door knocks and death takes another youth.

Poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...

A boy I used to know, a boy I used to know who's laughter rang to the skies
Was a joy to behold
Then I looked into his eyes, a look so cold, a boy who (rose on (??? Sorry))
In a field of poppies

Poppies, red poppies, red poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...,

He came right to my alley Lord with sorrowful sounds
Crying rags old iron and pulling his cart
Ask him how much he'd give me for my broken heart

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
So I asked that old rag man how much he would pay
For a heart that was broken baby when you went away
For a burnt out old love light that no longer beams
And a couple of slightly used second hand dreams

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
For those big empty promises you used to make
For those memories of you that are no longer sweet
I wish he could haul them off down the street

And never get love
You'd better let love depart

I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?

He's left me left me for another and my heart went with him
How can I go on

Was our love a game played for a day
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray
Am I to blame for this unhappy ending

Nothing else is left me but a memory
Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone

I live alone.
That hasn't always been easy to do.
But just a single woman;
Some times as night the walls talk back to me.
They seem to say
Wasn't yesterday, a better day.

Always alone at home or in a crowd;
A single woman out on a private cloud;
Caught in a world few people understand.
I am what I am.... Only one single woman.

There was a time...I can't remember when.
The house was full of love but then again
It might have been imaginations plan,
Just to help along,
One single Woman."

Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,
Dealing out the cards from left to right,
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

And until you want to share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire."

A certain lad
I've had in mind

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret

I'd like
To add his inital
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me

Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead

Searching the promenades seeking a clue

Stars
(Janis Ian)

I was never one for singing what I really feel
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real

Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story

People lust for fame like athletes in a game,
We break our collarbones and come up swinging,
Some of us are downed
Some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found
But most have seen it all,
They live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
They always come up singing

Some make it when they're young,
Before the world has done it's dirty job
And later on someone will say
""You've had your day, now you must make way""
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned
Or the many years forgetting what you know too well
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down
You try to make amends without defending
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five
That follow as you walk and ask for autographs
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you
Some make it when they're old
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare
Or perhaps there's nothing there)

Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
But most have seen it all,
They live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
They always have a story

Some women have a body men will want to see
And so they put it on display
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance

But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day

Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
But most have seen it all,
Who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
And we always have a story

So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down"

Nina Simone,Strange Fruit,/n/nina+simone/strange+fruit_20100706.html,"Lewis Allen, Sonny White

Southern trees
Bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop

As sung by Billie Holiday

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop."

Praise the Lord
See them flinging out the banner

They sing merrilly 'bout the golden rule

They all hollar in the righteous way

It's time for me to call on Mother Hannah

Same feeling

You can spend the night forever (beside her)
And you know that she's half crazy
And (But) that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
(then) She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.

Now (And) Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
'cause (And) you think maybe you('ll) can trust him
'cause (For) he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Between (Among) the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning, leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever"

Hey friend your misery bewilders me
How come you're never satisfied or gratified
Four walls n' a roof, electricity,
Stable mind, wife and child,
Hot and cold water to run anytime.
But still you, whine.

I want more

A bum could rummage through ya bin
And live like a king
On just one crumb o'ya cake
N'ya say ya life needs fulfilling
Some would give anything to live like you
Shame your mind, don't shine
Like your possessions do.
Whining, complaining all the time,
Don't see no rain on you
What side your bread is buttered on
If only you knew

What d'ya mean
I want more

Yep

I was told as a child,
I want more never gets
Learned to count my blessings
Long before I saw an abacus
So what ya family don't speak
At least they're alive
Show me a man without guilt
Or a soul that ain't lied
You don't know what ya got
Open your eyes, look around
Really, hear me you,
Ain't got no reason to be down

What d'ya mean
I want more

Friend what is it that you seek
What is it that you try to find
Someday I hope you realized
It shined in you all the time.
Hills to climb, sights to see, seas to cross,
Friends to make, hands to shake, the world is yours,
Foods to taste, sounds to hear, love to feel,
Seeds to sew, things to know, fish to reel,
Space to quiz, stones to lift, life's a gift

Misunderstood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane

He had hair like wool, like wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, hail mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never?
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree
But I don't give a fuck if you see me

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For 8 and a half months I gave ms. cit da pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say fuck em and we the same
So hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like easter sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout bitch
Excuse my french emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, cause you thought lil wayne is weezy
But weezy is dwayne

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood

I was watchin T.V. the other day right
Got this white guy on there talkin bout black guys
Talkin about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who?
America
You see, one in every 100 Americans are locked up
1 in every, 9 black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money that we spend on sending a motherfucka to jail
A young motherfucka to jail
Would be less to send, his or her young ass to college (heh)
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers
You know crack, cocaine, yeah, stuff like that
Meanin due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
The police are only
I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs, because
Crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And um, you know the other thing is mostly found...
You know where I'm going
But why bring a motherfucka to jail
If it's not gonna stand up in court
Because this drug ain't that drug
You know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that (heh heh)
Mmm hmm, I guess it's all a misunderstanding, and um
I sit back and think well shit us young motherfuckers,
You know, that 1 in every 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood
And it's not like the suburbs
We don't have the things that you have
Why? I really don't want to know the answer, but uh...
I guess we just misunderstood uh, yeah
You know we don't have room in the jail
Now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know
Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mmm hmm
Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you
Sex offender on a level 3 drug, convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got?
Yeah, well you know what
You know what? I have a fuckin daughter
You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor
To jail just because the reason why he live next door to me
Ain't the reason why I live next door to him
Mean that, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out, bring him to jail for life
And then you move in a sex offender, heh heh heh
They giving me a paper, heh heh
Is that a misunderstanding, cause I don't understand it
ANother thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this
Uh, Mr. Al Sharpton, here's why I don't respect you
And nobody like you, hmm hmm, see
You're the type that gets off on gettin on other people, heh hehe
That's not good, no homo
And rather unhuman I should say
I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity rather
To me, is helpin one another, no matter your color or race
But this guy, and people like him
They'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, heh heh
You know, spect before check, anyway
Mean that, I much rather you talk to me first and see if you
Can learn an opinion before you make one
Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton (heh heh)
Hold on, I ain't finished with you man
Gotta pluck the ashes, mmm hmm, hold on, um
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me
So, if you're not goin to try to, then what you say
Or think about me, or whatever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me, and, it doesn't make you a good person to
Criticize before you improvize
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither but
The characteristics fall heavily into bad sway, hah hah
But since I am human, I am good and bad as well
But I try my hardest to stay good
And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good
But I do try
So with that said, I don't fault you, I mean, you're only human
Good or bad, but I also don't respect you
And I don't care if that's good or bad, heh heh
You see you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson
You a nobody, to me, you're just another Don King with a perm
Heh heh, just a little more political
And that just means you're a little unhuman than us humans
And now, let me be human by sayin fuck Al Sharpton
And anyone like him, fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood, why?
Cause I live in the suburbs but I come from the hood
Bring the hook in!

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"

They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained

How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!

Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,
Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.
Once in a night as black as pitch
Isabel met a wicked old witch.
The witch's face was cross and wrinkled,
The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.

I'll turn you into an ugly toad!

Isabel didn't scream or scurry,
She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,
But she turned the witch into milk and drank her.

Isabel met a hideous giant,
Isabel continued self-reliant.
The giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,
He had one eye in the middle of his forehead.
Good morning Isabel, the giant said,
I'll grind your bones to make my bread.
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She nibbled the zwieback that she always fed off,
And when it was gone, she cut the giant's head off.

Isabel met a troublesome doctor,
He punched and he poked till he really shocked her.
The doctor's talk was of coughs and chills
And the doctor's satchel bulged with pills.

Swallow this, it will make you well.

With the full moon in my eyes.

Friend had said

In the yellow haze of the sun,

Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby?

'Neath feathers, birdies are tucked away,
In yellow jackets, the bees sleep tight
And cuddle close through the chilly night,
My baby's snug in her gown of white.

The robin's home is a nest overhead,
The bees, they nest in a hive instead,

He kindly stopped for me
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality

We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility

We passed the school where children played
At wrestling in a ring

We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun

We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling in the ground
The roof was scarcely visible,
The cornice but a mound

Since then ’tis centuries but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses’ heads
Were toward eternity

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me
The carriage held but just ourselves

And Immortality"

Natalie Merchant,Break Your Heart,/n/natalie+merchant/break+your+heart_20098267.html,"People down-cast in despair
See the this-illusion everywhere
Hoping their bad luck will change
It's a little harder everyday

I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
The way they've been
And the way they've always been

People shallow, self-absorbed
See them push and shove for their rewards
When I, me, mine is on their minds
You can read about it in their eyes

People ruthless, people cruel
The damage that some people do
Full of hatred, full of pride
It's enough to make you lose your mind

I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been

I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been

Don't spread the discontent
Don't spread the lies
Don't make the same mistakes
With your own life

You never will let love survive

I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been

Don't spread the discontent
Don't spread the lies
Don't make the same mistakes
In your own life

Don't lose your pride
And don't think everybody's gotta choose a side

Inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have seen?

Well, I've walked these streets 
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond markets the scarlet welcome carpet
That they just rolled out for me

And I've walked these streets 
In the madhouse asylum they can be 
Where a wild-eyed misfit prophet
On a traffic island stopped and he raved of saving me

Have I been wrong, have I been wise 
To shut my eyes and play along
Hypnotized, paralyzed by what my eyes have found
By what my eyes have seen, what do you see?

Have I been blind, have I been lost 
Have I been wrong, have I been wise 
Have I been strong

Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized

Once, a sailor loved me.
But he was not a sailor,
Who sailed on the wide blue sea.
He sailed in an airship;
Sailed like a bird on the wing;
And every evening at midnight,
He would come to my window and sing:

Chorus:
Come take a Trip in my Airship,
Come sail away to the stars!
We'll travel to Venus,
We'll sail away to Mars!
No one will see while we're kissing
No one will know as we swoon.
So come take a Trip in my Airship,
And we'll visit the Man in the Moon!

One night while sailing away from the crowds,
We passed through the Milky White Way.
While idly drifting and watching the clouds,
He asked if I'd name the day!
Just by the Dipper, I gave him my heart,
The sun shone on our honeymoon.
We swore to each other, we never would part,
And we'd teach all the babies this tune."

Til you get out of town
And honey,
You might come with me""

Spare the innocent ones
I'll take you with me
Together we will be drifters free""

She's a lusting, trusting fool

That I've sworn
But stranger if you do
I'll belong to you""

""if you do...

Would you take me with you?

And love me too?""

Sees his love anew

I will tell UNTO you
Your future
You often have asked me
Your true love will die
By your own right hand
And crazy man Michael
Will cursed be""

Michael he ranted
And Michael he raved
And he beat at the four winds
With his fists-o
He laughed and he cried
He shouted and he swore
For his mad mind
Entrapped him with a fist-hold

""you speak with an evil
You speak with a hate
You speak for the devil
That haunts me
For is she not the fairest
In all the broad land?
Your sorcerer's words
Are to taunt me""

He took out his dagger
Of FIRE AND OF steel
And he struck down the raven
Through the heart-o
The bird fluttered long
And the sky it did spin
And this cold earth did
Wander 'round startled

Oh where is the raven
That I struck down dead
And here did lye
On the ground-o?
I see my true love
With a wound so red
Where her lover's heart
It did pound-o

Crazy man Michael
He wanders ALONE
And he talks TO
The night and the day-o
But his eyes they are sane
And his speech is plain
But he longs to be far away-o

Michael he whistles
The simplest of tunes
As he asks of the wild WOODS
Their pardon
But his true love has flown
Into every flower grown
And he must be keeper
Of the garden"

She dreamed she saw
Her true love's blood
Go flowing down the stream
Waking early morning

Who came here for to stay?""

Off rims of apple pies,
She pokes the roast-potato-dish
When Sunday dinner's done,
And if there are two left in it
Griselda snitches one;
Cold chicken and cold cauliflower
She pulls in little chunks?
And when Cook calls:
""What are you doing there?""
Griselda bunks.

Griselda is greedy. 
Well, that's how she feels,
She simply can't help eating in-between meals,
And always forgets what it's leading to, though
The Doctor has frequently told her,
""You know why, don't you?""
When the stomach-ache starts and Griselda says:
""Oh!""

She slips down to the dining-room
When everyone's in bed,
For cheese-rind on the supper-tray,
And buttered crusts of bread,
A biscuit from the biscuit-box,
Lump sugar from the bowl,
A gherkin from the pickle-jar,
Are all Griselda's toll;
She tastes the salted almonds,
And she tries the candied fruits?
And when Dad shouts
""Who is it down below?""
Griselda scoots.

Griselda is greedy. 
Her relatives scold,
And tell her how sorry she'll be when she's old,
She will lose her complexion, she's sure to grow fat,
She will spoil her inside?does she know what she's at?
(Why do they?)
Some people are greedy. Leave it at that."

As far as you could go. By the 1/4 inch cut of your hair and the Army issue green
For the past eight weeks I can tell where you've been.

It was all cut and dried to me
There was soldier's blue blood streaming inside your veins.
There is a world outside of this room
And when you meet it
Promise me you won't meet it with your gun.

So now you are one of the brave few
It's awful sad we need boys like you.
I hope the day never comes for

They've made a decent boy of you and I don't mean to spoil your home coming
But baby brother you should expect me to.

""Stock and barrel, safety, trigger, here's your gun.""
So now does your heart pitter pat with a patriotic song
When you see the stripes of Old Glory waving?

There is a world outside of this room
And when you meet it promise me you won't meet it with your gun taking aim.

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'

In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
O-or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see,
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (in the ghetto)

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
Where he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Oh, People, don't you understand

And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

As her young man dies,
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto x 2 (In the ghetto x 2)"

That noble race and brave,
That their light canoes have vanished
From off the crested wave
That 'mid the forests where they roamed
There rings no hunter's shout,
But their name is on your waters,
Ye may not wash it out.

'Tis where Ontario's billow
Like Ocean's surge is curled,
Where strong Niagara's thunders wake
The echo of the world,
Where red Missouri bringeth
Rich tributes from the west,
And Rappahannock sweetly sleeps
On green Virginia's breast.

Ye say, their cone-like cabins,
That clustered o'er the vale,
Have fled away like withered leaves
Before the autumn gale,
But their memory lives on in your hills,
Their baptism on your shore,
Your everlasting rivers speak
Their dialect of yore.

Old Massachusetts wears it
Within her lordly crown,
And broad Ohio bears it
'Mid all her young renown,
Connecticut hath wreathed it
Where her quiet foliage waves,
And bold Kentucky breathed it hoarse
Through all her ancient caves.

Wachuset hides its lingering voice
Within his rocky heart,
And Alleghany graves its tone
Throughout his lofty chart,
Monadnock on his forehead hoar
Doth seal the sacred trust,
Your mountains build their monument.
Though ye destroy their dust."

Returning only when the dawn

Saying maybe
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all

Look at my hands
There's so much here that I don't understand
Your face-saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them
'Cause I've been treated so wrong,
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable

With fine winding tendrils that strangle the heart
They say that promises sweeten the blow
But I don't need them, no I don't need them
I've been treated so wrong,
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable

In the frost-killing hour
Sweet turning sour and untouchable
I need the darkness, the sweetness, the sadness, the weakness
Oh I need this
I need a lullaby, a kiss goodnight, angel, sweet love of my life
Oh I need this
I'm a slow-dying flower
Frost-killing hour
The sweet turning sour and untouchable
Do you remember the way that you touched me before
All the trembling sweetness I loved and adored
Your face-saving promises
Whispered liked prayers
I don't need them
I need the darkness, the sweetness, the sadness, the weakness
Oh, I need this
I need a lullaby, a kiss goodnight, angel, sweet love of my life
Oh, I need this

Natalie Merchant,Nursery Rhyme Of Innocence And Experience,/n/natalie+merchant/nursery+rhyme+of+innocence+and+experience_21243097.html,"I had a silver penny
And an apricot tree
And I said to the sailor
On the white quay

Sailor O sailor
Will you bring me
If I give you my penny
And my apricot tree

'A fez from Algeria
An Arab drum to beat
A little gilt sword
And a parakeet?'

And he smiled and he kissed me
As strong as death
And I saw his red tongue
And I felt his sweet breath

You may keep your penny
And your apricot tree
And I'll bring your presents
Back from sea.'

O the ship dipped down
On the rim of the sky
And I waited while three
Long summers went by

Then one steel morning
On the white quay
I saw a grey ship
Come in from sea

Slowly she came
Across the bay
For her flashing rigging
Was shot away

All round her wake
The seabirds cried
And flew in and out
Of the hole in her side

Slowly she came
In the path of the sun
And I heard the sound
Of a distant gun

And a stranger came running
Up to me
From the deck of the ship
And he said, said he

O are you the boy
Who would wait on the quay
With the silver penny
And the apricot tree?

I've a plum-coloured fez
And a drum for thee
And a sword and a parakeet
From over the sea.'

O where is the sailor
With bold red hair?
And what is that volley
On the bright air?

O where are the other
Girls and boys?
And why have you brought me
Children's toys?'"
Natalie Merchant,Ode To Billy Joe,/n/natalie+merchant/ode+to+billy+joe_20565073.html,"It was the 3rd of June, another sleepy dusty Delta day.
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was bailin' hay.
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat.
And mama hollered out the backdoor, ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet.""
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge.
Today Billy Joe Macallister's jumped off the Tallahatchee Bridge. ""

Papa said to mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas,
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits please.
There's 5 more acres in the lower 40 I got to plow. ""
And mama said it was a shame about Billy Joe anyhow.
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge,
And now Billy Joe Macallister's jumped off the Tallahatchee Bridge.

And brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billy Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show.
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie; you know it don't seem right.
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billy Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchee Bridge. ""

And mama said to me, ""Child what's happened to your appetite?
I been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite.
That nice young preacher brother Taylor dropped by today,
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday; oh by the way,
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge,
And she and Billy Joe was throwin' something off the Tallahatchee Bridge. ""

A year's come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe.
'n brother married Becky Thompson 'n' they bought a store in Tupelo.
There was a virus goin' round, papa caught it and he died last spring,
And now mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything.
And me, I spend a lotta time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge,
And drop 'em into the muddy water off the Tallahatchee bridge."

A novice Carmelite,
In sister cells, the cloister bells,
Tolled on her wedding night
Ophelia was the rebel girl,
A blue-stockinged suffragette
Who remedied society between her cigarettes
And Ophelia was the sweetheart to a nation overnight
Curvaceous thighs, vivacious eyes
Love was at first sight,
Love was at first sight, love
Ophelia was a demi-goddess
In pre-war Babylon
So statuesque, a silhouette
In black, satin evening gowns
Ophelia was the mistress to a Vegas gambling man
Signora Ophelia Maraschina
Mafia courtesan
Ophelia was the circus queen, the female cannonball
Projected through five flaming hoops
To wild and shocked applause
To wild and shocked applause
Hey, he-he-he-he-hey,
Ophelia was a tempest, cyclone, a god-damned hurricane
Your common sense, your best defense lay wasted and in vain
For Ophelia'd know your every woe and every pain you'd ever have
She'd sympathize and dry your eyes
Help you to forget
And help you to forget
And help you to forget
Ophelia's mind went wandering
You'd wonder where she'd gone
To secret doors down corridors
She'd wander them alone
All alone"
Natalie Merchant,Order 1081,/n/natalie+merchant/order+1081_21243063.html,"A bomb went off this morning raining bodies on TV
They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

It's amazing that the soldiers somehow all know how to dance
It's amazing how the soldiers keep the creases in their pants
Now it's safe to walk the streets at night; a new world has begun
Everybody's sleeping soundly thanks to 1081"
Natalie Merchant,Owensboro,/n/natalie+merchant/owensboro_20344631.html,"Well, I lived in a town
Way down south
By the name of Owensboro
And I worked in a mill
With the rest of the ""trash""
As we're often called
As you know

Well, we rise up early
In the morning
And we work all day real hard
To buy our little meat and bread
Buy sugar, tea, and lard

Well, our children they
Grow, grow up unlearned
With no time to go to school
Almost before they learn to walk
They learn to spin and to spool

Well, the folks in town
They dress so fine
And spend their money free
But they would hardly look
At a factory hand
That dresses like you or me

Would you let them wear
Their watches fine
Let them wear their gems
And pearly strings

But when that day
Of judgement comes
They'll have to share
Their pretty things"
Natalie Merchant,Party Of God,/n/natalie+merchant/party+of+god_20813104.html,"In a busy street, a man sits down
Oblivious to the traffic sounds
No chaos, no frenzied shrieking crowd
Thank God their silence, walking heads, bent down

Come when they saw us
Called it lethargy
The treadmill turns
There down below their feet

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or cross the waves of an angry sea
Risking, risking and braving, braving
The shipwreck and the mutiny assailing, assailing

In a haunted doorway and from the light of day
See another life fall to ruin in pain
False smiles from even children it seems
Landlocked ground for empty and lost dreams

A league against me
I hear him say
It's not worth half the effort
Or the price you pay

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the Heavens above
And tell God, dear God, stop jeering and jeering
As our human frailties and all our failings, are we failing?

Pound, pound on an endless street
Again and again the nightmare scene
All strained against the tightened rope
Not one with a lasting lingering hope

There's evidence
Everywhere you see
Put a quarter down at the newsstand
So that you can read

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the clouds above
Entreating, entreating
Their mercy, some mercy

But as clouds will do, they'll rain down
First gently, gently and sweetly, so sweetly
Until they silence me
With a burst of thunder, thunder and lightning and lightning
And helpless landlocked screaming
I know god must be agreeing

It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part

Landlocked in screaming
God must be agreeing
To be helpless is the worst
Must be the worst part of watching
The worst part of watching"

Lock you up and throw away the key
For the countless counts of low down double-cross you've been about?
Have you no decency?

Did you really think you could pull it off, the perfect crime, crime of the heart?
Do you really think that you'll get away, escape my justice until you're dying day?

Lay beside your name
Lay to rest your rage
Your hunger and amazing grace

With candles, with flowers

I heard rumors explode with lies
I saw children in tears
Cry and crowd around the sight
Of where you had collapsed that day
Where your last breath and word
Had been sighed
Where your heart had burst
Where you had died

I saw how they were lost in grieving
All half believing you were gone
The loss and pain of it
Crime and shame of it
You were gone

Natalie Merchant,Sweet And A Lullaby,/n/natalie+merchant/sweet+and+a+lullaby_21243075.html,"There's not a rose where'er I seek
As comely as my baby's cheek.
There's not a comb of honey-bee,
So full of sweets as babe to me.

And it's so sweet,
Sweet and a lullaby.

There's not a star that shines on high,
Is brighter than my baby's eye.
There's not a boat upon the sea,
Can dance as baby does for me.

And it's so sweet,
Sweet and a lullaby.

No silk was ever spun so fine
As is the hair of baby mine.
My baby smells more sweet to me
Than smells in spring the elder tree.

And it's so sweet,
Sweet and a lullaby."

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and fate
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
Stuck around St. Petersberg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
In a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
What's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
I watched the gleam
While you kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the Goth they made
I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid tracks for troubadors
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners Saints
As I end this tale
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well learned qualities
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah

Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down
Tell me baby, what's my name

What's me name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name"

Who told you that nothing about you is alright

But that's enough girl, give it away give it, give it all away.

Tell yourself that you're not pretty, look at you, you're beautiful.
Tell yourself that no one sees Plain Jane invisible to me, just tell yourself.
Tell yourself you'll never be like the anorexic beauties in the magazines.
Just a bargain basement Barbie doll, no belle du jour, no femme fatale
Just tell yourself.
Tell yourself there's nothing worse than the pain inside and the way it hurts
But tell yourself it's nothing new cause everybody feels it too, they feel it too.
And there's just no getting 'round the fact that you're thirteen right now."

With a jolly old bear in a coat of brown.

While I cut a caper and so did he.
Then 'twas fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee,
I looked at him, and he winked at me,
And I whispered a word in his shaggy ear,
And I said, ""I will go with you, my dear.""

Well, he didn't say much, but he nodded his head,
As the organ-grinder began to play
""Over the hills and far away.""
With a fiddle-de-dum and a fiddle-de-dee;
Oh, I looked at him and he winked at me,
And my heart was light and the day was fair,
And away I went with the dancing bear.

Oh, 'tis fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee,
The dancing bear came back with me;
For the sugar-plum trees were stripped and bare,
And we couldn't find cookies anywhere.
And the solemn old fellow he sighed and said,
Well, he didn't say much, but he shook his head,
While I looked at him and he blinked at me
Till I shed a tear and so did he;
And both of us thought of our supper that lay
Over the hills and far away.
Then the dancing bear he took my hand,
And we hurried away through the twilight land;
And 'twas fiddle-de-dum and fiddle-de-dee

By the land, so dark and dangerous,

Of begging for bread, of emptiness inside.

Natalie Merchant,The Gulf Of Araby,/n/natalie+merchant/the+gulf+of+araby_20098265.html,"Words and music by katell keineg

If you could fill a veil with shells from killineys shore
And sweet talk in a tongue that is no more
If wishful thought could bridge
The gulf of araby
Between what is
What is
What is
And what can never be

If you could hold the frozen flow of new hope creek
And hide out from the one they said you might meet
If you could unlearn all the words
That you never wanted heard
If you could stall the southern wind
That's whistling in your ears
You could take what is
What is
What is
What is
To what can never be

One man of seventy whispers free at last
Two neighbors who are proud of their massacres
Three tyrants torn away in a winters month
Four prisoners framed by a dirty judge
Five burned with tyres
Six men still inside
And seven more days to shake at the great divide

The gulf, the gulf of araby
The gulf, the gulf of araby

Well, we would plough and part the earth to bring you home
And harvest every miracle ever known
If they laid out all the things
That these ten years want to bring
We would gladly give them up
To bring you back to us
O, there is nothing we would not give
To kiss you and believe you can take what is
What is
What is
To what can never be

One man of seventy whispers not free yet
Two neighbors who make up knee-deep in their dead
Three tyrants torn away in the summers heat
Four prisoners lost in the fallacy
Five, on my life
And six, I'm dead inside
And seven more days to shake at the great divide

The gulf, the gulf of araby
The gulf, the gulf of araby"

[ Traditional ]

On the night that I was married
And upon my marriage bed
There came a bold sea captain
And he stood at my bedhead
Saying, ""arise, arise, young wedded man
And come along with me
To the lowlands of Holland
To fight the enemy""

Now then, Holland is a lovely land
And upon it grows fine grain
Surely 'tis a place of residence
For a soldier to remain
Where the sugar cane is plentiful
And the tea grows on the tree
Well, I never had but the one sweetheart
And now he's gone far away from me

I will wear no staysail around my waist
Nor combs all in in my hair
I will wear no scarf around my neck
For to save my beauty there
And never will I marry
Not until the day that I die
Since these four winds and these stormy seas
Came between my love and I"

He asked of me
How many strawberries grow in the salt sea?
And I answered him, as I thought good
As many a ship sails in the wood

The Man in the wilderness
He asked me, Why
His hare could swim and his pig could fly?
And I answered him, as I thought best
They were both born in a cuckoo's nest

The Man in the wilderness
Asked me to tell
Tell all the sands in the sea and I counted them well
And with the grain, well, not one more
I answered him, you go make sure

Said with the grain, well, not one more
I answered him, you go make sure
I answered him, you... you go make sure"
Natalie Merchant,The Walloping Window Blind,/n/natalie+merchant/the+walloping+window+blind_21243081.html,"A capital ship for an ocean trip
Was ""The Walloping Window Blind,""
No gale that blew dismayed her crew
Or troubled the captain's mind.
The man at the wheel was taught to feel
Contempt for the wildest blow,
And it often appeared, when the weather had cleared,
That he'd been in his bunk below.

The boatswain's mate was very sedate,
Yet fond of amusement, too,
And he played hop-scotch with the starboard watch
While the captain tickled the crew.
And the gunner we had was apparently mad,
For he sat on the after-rail,
And fired salutes with the captain's boots,
In the teeth of the booming gale.

The captain sat in a commodore's hat,
And dined, in a royal way,
On toasted pigs and pickles and figs
And gummery bread, each day.

But the rest of us ate from an odious plate,
For the food that was given the crew
Was a number of tons of hot-cross buns,
Chopped up with sugar and glue.

And we all felt ill as mariners will,
On a diet that's cheap and rude,
And the deck shook when we dipped the cook
In a tub of his gruesome food.
Then nautical pride we laid aside,
And we cast the vessel ashore
On the Gulliby Isles, where the Poohpooh smiles,
And the Anagazanders roar.

Composed of sand was that favored land,
And trimmed with cinnamon straws,
And pink and blue was the pleasing hue
Of the Tickletoeteaser's claws.

And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge
And shot at the whistling bee,
And the Binnacle-bats wore water-proof hats
As they danced in the sounding sea.

On rubagub bark, from dawn to dark,
We fed, till we all had grown
Uncommonly shrunk when a Chinese junk
Came by from the torriby zone.

She was stubby and square, but we didn't much care,
And we cheerily put to sea,
And we left the crew of the junk to chew
The bark of the rubagub tree."

Live it up girl 'cause it never lasts long.
It's heaven for now but not for long.
It's gonna hurt you, it's going to make you feel so bad.

Once I could love, I could trust, I could not doubt
But that was just about the worst thing that I could do.
It was just about the worst thing that I could do.

Maybe not now, but it won't take long
Before it's gonna hurt you and truly do you some harm.

Once I was open, could hope, I had no doubt
But that was the worst thing that I could do.
It was just about the worst thing that I could do.

Once I came close to that most elusive fire burning with hopeless love and desire
But it was just about the worst thing that I could do.
It was just about the worst thing that I could do.

En el pasado estuve ciega como tu.
Atrapada y perdida como tu.
Embelesada y suspendida en mi jaula de plata.
Esos recuerdos te acompanaran toda la vida.

Trapped and lost like you with no escape
Suspended in my silver cage.
These memories will remain with you forever.)"

The apple and the fall of man
The price we pay
So the people say
Down the path of shame it led us
Dared to bite the hand
That fed us fairy tale and moral end
Wheel of Fortune
Never turns again
Never turns again

The worst of it has come and gone
And the chaos of millenium
And the falling out of the doomsday crowd
Their last retreat is moving slow
They burn their bridges as they go
The heretic is beautified
Teach the harlot's child to smile

Rocked again by indecision
Should we make that small incision
Testify to the bleeding heart inside
We cut, we scratched, we rend, we slashed
And when he opened up at last
Found a cul de sac
Deep and black
Smoke and ash
Deep and black
Smoke and ash

The wicked king of Parodies
Kissing all his enemies
On the seventh day
Of the seventh week
Tyrant's voice is softened now
But just for one forgiving hour
Before the rise of his
Iron fist again
Fist again

I've come tonight
I've come to know
The way we are
The way we'll go
And to measure this
Width of the wide abyss

I come to you in restless sleep
Where all your dreams turn bittersweet
With voodoo doll philosophies
Day glow holy trinities

The crooked raft that leaves the shore
Ferries drunken souls aboard
Pilgrims march to Compestelo
Visions of their saint in yellow

Follow deep in trance
Lost in a catatonic dance
Know no future
Damn the past
Blind, warm, ecstatic
Safe at last"

Their voices climb and fall, battle trumpets call.
I fill the bath and climb inside, singing.

He will not touch their pastry
but every day they bring him more.
Gold from the breakfast tray, I steal them all away
and then go and eat them on the shore.

I draw a jackal-headed woman in the sand,
sing of a lover's fate sealed by jealous hate
then wash my hand in the sea.

Threats like: ""If you don't mind I will beat on your behind,""
""Slap you, slap you silly.""
made me say, ""O, what's the matter here?""
I'm tired of the excuses everybody uses, he's your kid, do as you see fit,
but get this through that I don't approve of what you did to you own flesh and blood.

""If you don't sit on this chair straight
I'll take this belt from around my waist and don't think that I won't use it!""

Answer me and take your time,
what could be the awful crime he could do at such young an age?
If I'm the only witness to your madness offer me some words to balance out what I see and what I hear.
All these cold and rude things that you do I suppose you do because he belongs to you
and instead of love, the feel of warmth you've given him these cuts and sores won't heal with time or age.

I want to say ""What's the Matter here?""
But I don't dare say."

There's a land beyond the river
That they call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by faith's decree
One by one we'll gain the portals
There to dwell with the immortals
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear the bells now ringing
Don't you hear the angels singing
'Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee
In that far off sweet forever
Just beyond the shining river
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

[Verse 2]
We shall know no sin or sorrow
In that heaven of tomorrow
When our hearts shall sail beyond the silvery sea
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When our days shall know their number
When in death we sweetly slumber
When the King commands the spirit to be free
Nevermore with anguish laden
We shall reach that lovely Eden
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

A barbed wire fence
By the railroad ties

Climbing over
The old stone wall
I am bound for the riverside

Well I go to the river
To soothe my mind
Ponder over
The crazy days of my life
Just sit and watch the river flow

Find a place
On the riverbank
Where the green rushes grow
See the wind
In the willow tree
In the branches hanging low

Well I go to the river
To soothe my mind
To ponder over
The crazy days of my life
Watch the river flow
Ease my mind and my soul
Where I go

Well I will go to the river
From time to time
Wander over
These crazy days in my mind
Watch the river flow
Where the willow branches grow
By the cool rolling waters
Moving gracefully and slow

Child it's lovely
Let the river take it all away
The mad pace, the hurry
The troubles, the worries
Just the river take them all away
Flow away"

Oblivious to the traffic sounds
No chaos, no frenzied shrieking crowd
Thank God their silence, walking heads, bent down

Come when they saw us
Called it lethargy
The treadmill turns
There down below their feet

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or cross the waves of an angry sea
Risking, risking and braving, braving
The shipwreck and the mutiny assailing, assailing

In a haunted doorway and from the light of day
See another life fall to ruin in pain
False smiles from even children it seems
Landlocked ground for empty and lost dreams

A league against me
I hear him say
It's not worth half the effort
Or the price you pay

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the Heavens above
And tell God, dear God, stop jeering and jeering
As our human frailties and all our failings, are we failing?

Pound, pound on an endless street
Again and again the nightmare scene
All strained against the tightened rope
Not one with a lasting lingering hope

There's evidence
Everywhere you see
Put a quarter down at the newsstand
So that you can read

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the clouds above
Entreating, entreating
Their mercy, some mercy

But as clouds will do, they'll rain down
First gently, gently and sweetly, so sweetly
Until they silence me
With a burst of thunder, thunder and lightning and lightning
And helpless landlocked screaming
I know god must be agreeing

It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part

Landlocked in screaming
God must be agreeing
To be helpless is the worst
Must be the worst part of watching
The worst part of watching"

And I had a little girl in a holler tree
I said, little girl, it's plain to see,
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

She said it's hard for me to see
How one little boy got so ugly
Yes, my little girly, that might be,
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me

To see he frog eat the goggle eye bee
To hear that west wind whistle to the east,
There ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

Oh my little girly will you let me see,
Where over yonder where the wind blows free
Nobody can see in our holler tree
And there ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree
And laid it on to she and me
It stung lots worse than a hive of bees
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

And I still look back to my tanglewood days,

My dearest friend,

Where we could gaze into the stars
And sit together now and forever
For it is plain as anyone could see
We're simply meant to be"
Nightmare Before Christmas,Jack's Lament,/n/nightmare+before+christmas/jacks+lament_20611465.html,"There are few who deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowed far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have see grown men give out a shriek
With a wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears"

JACK
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There are so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something's here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee
Eureka! I've got it"

Inside a nasty trap and wait

Nightmare Before Christmas,The Closing Song,/n/nightmare+before+christmas/the+closing+song_20611455.html,"And finally, everything worked out just fine.
Christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time.
But after that night, things were never the same--
Each holiday now knew the other one's name.

And though that one Christmas things got out of hand,
I'm still rather fond of that skeleton man.

So, many years later I thought I'd drop in,
And there was old Jack still looking quite thin,
With four or five skeleton children at hand
Playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band.

And I asked old Jack, ""Do you remember the night
When the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright?
When a million small children pretending to sleep
Nearly didn't have Christmas at all, so to speak?
And would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back,
To that long, fateful night. Now, think carefully, Jack.
Would you do the whole thing all over again,
Knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then? ""

And he smiled, like the old pumpkin king that I knew,
Then turned and asked softly of me, ""Wouldn't you?"""

Nightmare Before Christmas,The Opening Song,/n/nightmare+before+christmas/the+opening+song_20611454.html,"'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems
In a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.
For the story that you are about to be told
Took place with the holiday worlds of old.

Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from.
If you haven't, I'd say it's time you begun.
For holidays are the result of much fuss
And hard work for the worlds that create them for us.
Well, you see now, quite simply that's all that they do--
Making one unique holiday, especially for you.
But once, a calamity ever so great occurred
When two holidays met by mistake."
Nightmare Before Christmas,Town Meeting Song,/n/nightmare+before+christmas/town+meeting+song_20611452.html,"Jack
Listen, there were objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain

It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream

But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

Harlequin demon
A box?
Devil
Is it steel?

Werewolf
Are there locks?

Harleouin demon
Is it filled with a pox?

Devil, werewolf, harlequin demon
A pox
How delightful, a pox

Jack
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

Witches
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

Jack
That's the point of the thing, not to know

Clown
It's a bat
Will it bend?

Creature under the stairs
It's a rat
Will it break?

Undersea gal
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

Jack
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
Now we pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

Mr. Hyde
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?

Medium mr. Hyde
Let me see, let me look

Small mr. Hyde
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

Jack
Hmm, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

Mummy and winged demon
Small toys

Winged demon
Do they bite?

Mummy
Do they snap?

Winged demon
Or explode in a sack?

Corpse kid
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

Mayor
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
Why, I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

Jack
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want

And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
And sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
Though they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well..."

What's this?

What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this?
What's this?

There are children throwing snowballs here
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?
What's this?

In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're eveywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?

is end it all
and leave forever

what once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again
my world is ending

I wish that I could turn back time
'cause now the guilt is all mine
can't live without the trust from those you love.
I know we can't forget the past
you can't forget love and pride
because of that it's killing me inside

It all returns to nothing, it all comes
tumbling down, tumbling down,
tumbling down,
it all returns to nothing, I just keep
letting me down, letting me down,
letting me down,
in my heart of hearts,
I know that I could never love again
I've lost everything
everything, everything

'Cos we can't fulfill our dreams
In this life

So I must let us break free
I can never be what you need

Through fireside parties, of tears and cheers
The hands of James Hooker flew over it's keys
And God know who who else 'fore it came to me
When I was alone I could be Julie Gold
It rang her ""From A Distance"" just like it was my own
I'd pretend I've the voice of Beth Nielsen Chapman
I wrote ""Late Night Grande (Hotel)""
With just my right hand happenin'

Chorus
Now it's keys rent the air in it's new place to stand
A gift for the children who'll play right and left hand
Just a 1937 pre-war Kimball
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand

Oh, it's lonesome in this corner at five am
I'd called Harlan Howard, only he'd understand
All of those melodies that came to be
Mornings in that corner... That piano and me
I wish for a left hand like Glen D. Hardin
I could play Jimmy Webb or perhaps Randy Newman
Ah, it's a blessing it never met Jerry Lee's feet
Just the hands of those children
Is all this Kimball needs

I've let it go... Let it go
That piano I bought from Al Jones long ago
I've let it go, I've let it go

The songs that we wrote, ah, not for note
That piano will always know

Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
Where the years went I can't say
I just turned around and they've gone away

I've been siftin' through the layers
Of dusty books and faded papers
They tell a story I used to know
And it was one that happened so long ago

Chorus
It's gone away in yesterday
Now I find myself on the mountainside
Where the rivers change direction
Across the Great Divide

Now, I heard the owl a-callin'
Softly as the night was fallin'
With a question and I replied
But he's gone across the borderline

The finest hour that I have seen
Is the one that comes between
The edge of night and the break of day
It's when the darkness rolls away

Alabama sweet-talking baby
Calmed the heart of a lonely lady
You kept me flying high
And the leaving easy
And it's Dallas in the rain
And I was dreaming.

October winds still blowing, Lord
You know the song were flowing
From a broken-hearted lady by the wayside
Listen to my song
You kept it ringing clean and strong
You held me like an angel to confide in
And I tried to make you home
But I was dreaming.

Lord, I guess you just ain't home
That damned old telephone
Is trying hard to help me find the lines here
Wish that you could understand
Why I love the other man
He gives me truth and reason,
I believe in.

Early morning fog is rolling in,

In fact, that was how they met
He was a Yorkshire man in Cambridge
She was from Massachusetts

They spoke and they fell in love
They kissed and picked daffodils
She came across the ocean
Just to bid her heart goodbye

The hawk next to his goddess
They were glorious to see
Back when Ted loved Sylvia

Close friends disapproved
Said they ought to wait
They did not care with all that said
And married nonetheless

They traveled and they taught
A life of academia
Typewriters and cocktails
Angry verses and sad pleas

Dutiful wife and mother
The poet behind her man
Back when Ted loved Sylvia

The tempests that were howling
And tearing them apart
Were forces that had been in place
To wreck them from the start

So she stayed home with the kids
Collecting poems in a jar
He had his lectures and soon a mistress
And left her all alone

Why did she end it all?
Was he just to blame?
There's only two that know for sure
And neither one remain

I don't need an answer
I prefer to read between the lines
Back when Ted loved Sylvia

I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

I don't have to miss no tv shows
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder

Cause I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue"

Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there somethin' I can send you
From across the sea
From the place where I'll be landin'?

There's nothin' you can send me my own true love
There is nothin' I'm wishin' to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Ah. but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be ownin'

I might be gone a long ole time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there somethin' I can send you
To remember me by?
To make your time more easy passin'?

How can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I don;t know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm feelin'

If you my love must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're goin'

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of stormy weather
And yes there is somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather"

The Christmas lights are veiled in snow
Tell me where are you going?

It seems to me that you are lonelier
Than I've ever seen you be

That you've gone crazier
Than you ever thought you'd be
When the lights go down
And the dance floor is empty
And the crowd is going home
I will be waiting
For my brave companion of the road

Some days come up roses
Some days just come and go
Some nights are so ruhtless
That you can't recall the day before
This love has seen better days
Than home for these holidays

Look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wonderin', too

And I had me a buddy back home
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Frisco Bay
And, sometimes, when I've had a few
His old voice comes ringin' through
And I'm goin' out to see him some old day

If you see me passin' by
And you sit and wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor
Lace 'em up and bar the door
Thank the stars for the roof that's over you"

Me down the river
To drift away alone

And why my own wheels are gonna carry me
Far from his gentle hands
Baby, I can't come home

Rests heavy on my tongue

He'll never recover

Pure blended whiskey
She drank it like wine
Her eyes were the color of Canadian whiskey

She's living alone
Up by Yellowstone Creek
And old Trapper John
Brings her cases of whiskey
Canadian whiskey
He says she never will speak

I am a clock without hands
I'm walking through the midnights
Counting all the moments
Of the loves I've left behind
Crying on the shoulders of the days
I've not forgotten now

I am frozen in time
Like the battles of the soldiers
Left displaced of time
Where their tears still fall
Loves that wreck out on the track
Far beyond my looking back to recall
I'm just a clock upon the shelf
Without hands to give the time of day
For love at all

Chorus
I am a clock without hands
No one understands this
That when the autumn comes
I see no reason for a fall
Spring can fail to move me
With it's tulips and it's clover
Now the time for love is over
I am a clock without hands
I'm just tickin' and that's all

I recall a time
When love still had the power
To reach inside this clock
Where my hands held a dream
The innocence of passion
And the words of Saint Teresa chiming in
And I recall the faith
Of the love of my life
And the loosing of my hands
Which he took with him when he died
I'm crying on the shoulders of his love
That I'm remembering now
It's been ages since this heart has ticked a beat of love
So I've forgotten how

That I would leave your city behind

Out in these streets these people are angry
Well, they push and shove one another aside
Well, I worked from the heart and you worked for the money

Like the ashes of her cigarette
He got scattered thrown on the breeze
As he tried to forget
He lost all his heat
And his heart never will be the same
He got lighter than air
But he'll only come down in the rain

Strung out and hung out to dry
Laughin' under the line
It's not such a dignified place
But he really don't mind
He says with his feet on the ground
He'd have nothin' to say
Claims he likes it up there
And he'll only come down in the rain

Comin' down in the rain
Washin' outta the sky
Loaded down with the pain
There just ain't no way to fly
You can read him as clear
As the wall where he once wrote his name
It was right next to hers
But it'll only come down in the rain

Burnin' himself out on a limb
Like a leaf in the fall
He blazed for awhile
Now he's feelin' all dried up and small
The colors all gone
Disappeared, near as quick as it came
He says he can't stay up
But, he'll only come down in the rain

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range

She was courted by young Vandermeer
And quite handsome was he I am to hear
He brought her silver rings and lacy things
And they promised to marry before the snows came that year

But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us, one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet in his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beautyin Virginia City too
At dusty sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Where the Walker runs down into the Carson Valley plain
There lived a young maiden Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she

From the lungs of the young men
In a Deadwood saloon, South Dakota afternoon
And the old ones by the door
With their heads on their chests,
They told lies about whiskey on a womans breath

Yes, and some tell the story of young Mickey Free
Who lost an eye to a buck deer in the Tongue River Valley
Oh and some tell the story of California Joe
Who sent word through the Black Hills
There was a mountain of gold

[Chorus:]
And the gold she lay cold in their pockets
And the sun she sets down on the trees
And they thank the Lord
For the land that they live in
Where the white man does as he pleases

Some flat-shoed fool from the East comes a-runnin'
With some news that he'd read in some St. Joseph paper
And it was ""Drinks all around"" cause the news he was tellin'
Was the one they called Crazy
Has been caught and been dealt with

And the Easterner he read the news from the paper
And the old ones moved closer so's they could hear better
""Well it says here that Crazy Horse
Was killed while trying to escape,
And that was some time last September,
It don't give the exact date""

[Chorus]

Where the white man does as he pleases

Then the talk turned back to whiskey and women
And cold nights on the plains, Lord
And fightin' them indians
And the Easterner he says he'll have one more
'fore he goes
He gives the paper to the Crow boy
Who sweeps up the floor

Where the white man does as he pleases
Where the white man does as he pleases
As he wants to, as he pleases"

To pay all their wages
To wade back again

Goodbye to you Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus and Maria

Come working the fruit trees
And they rode on the trucks
'Til they took down and died

And we died in your deserts

We died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees
And we died in your bushes

We died just the same

Over Los Gatos Canyon
Like a fireball of lightning
And shook all our hills
Who are all those friends
All scattered like dry leaves
The radio says
They are just deportees

We can grow our best orchards?
Is this the best way
We can grow our good fruit?
To fall like dry leaves
And rot on my topsoil
And beknown by no name
Except deportee

And he'd sit in the kitchen and he'd cry
And run his fingers
Through seventy years of living
And wonder, Lord, has every well I've drilled gone dry
We were friends me and this old man
Like desperadoes waiting for a train
Like desperadoes waiting for a train

Well he's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He taught me how to drive his car
When he's too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girld
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperadoes waiting for a train
Like desperadoes waiting for a train

From the time that I could walk
He'd take me with him
To a bar called the green frog cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes
Lying about their lives while they played
And I was just a kid
They all called me sidekick
Like desperadoes waiting for a train
Like desperadoes waiting for a train

One day I looked up and
He was pushing eighty
And there was brown tobacco stains
All down his chin
To me he was one of the heroes
Of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men
Drinking beer amd playing moon and forty-two
Like desperadoes waiting for a train
Like desperadoes waiting for a train

And then the day before he died
I went to see him
And I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song

Come on, jack, the son-of-a-bitch is coming

We're like desperadoes waiting for a train
Like desperadoes waiting for a train (4 times)"

In his pockets and waited
For the dollar matinee

When you step back into the street

She was a smokey old velvet delight

Just like he'd always done
With his feet hanging out in the aisles

And he watched her with eyes disbelieving
Felt something like time on his brain
And he told himself
Don't you remember it's only
Just a part that she's playing

Lord, she's bigger than life on the screen
There's a laugh from the balcony, good Lord
And the sun will burn you and blind you
When you step back into the street

While the captions translated the scene
Oh, and Ronnie stared back
At her body and breathed
""Christ, that's the first time I've seen it!""

Well, the busses, they were humming outside
But old Ronnie never went

Swim wear saunter, tan and haunt them
That's all she learned in school
Books were for other girls
And the other girls were fools

I don't wanna know just exactly what you've found
Because tonight I'm goin' out on these streets and watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin'

Don't they fly by night
Yeah tonight I'm goin' out on these streets and watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin'

I'll be standin' on the corner watchin' the men folk go by
I don't wanna touch 'em honey, I'll look them in the eye
And say, ""Tonight I am out on these streets to watch the lonely hearts
Go flyin""

Oh, I never put a chain upon your heart or tried to make you walk the
Line for me
Only a fool would want a heart that needs a chain to keep it restin'
Here beside of me
You say you wished I cared what you did with your time
But what's your time is yours and tonight is gonna be mine
And I'm goin' out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'

I'm comin' out of your pocket and into my own
I'm gonna have a stronger heart when I round the bend for home
Now I'm goin' out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'
Don't they fly by night
I'm going out on these streets tonight
To watch the lonely hearts go flyin'

She hit the San Diego Freeway doing sixty miles an hour
She had a husband on her bumper
She had five restless children
She was singing sweet as a mockingbird in that Ford Econoline

[Chorus:]
She's the salt of the earth
Straight from the bosom of the Mormon church
With a voice like wine
Cruising along in that Ford Econoline

Now her husband was a gambler, he was a Salt Lake City rambler
He built a golden cage around his silver-throated wife
Too many nights he left her crying with his cheating and his lying
But his big mistake was him buying her that Ford Econoline

[Chorus 2x]

Now she sings her songs around this country
From Seattle to Montgomery
Those kids are grown and that rounder knows
You cannot cage your wife
Along the back roads of our nation, she's become a living legend
She drives a Coupe DeVille but her heart rides still
In that Ford Econoline
She drives a Coup DeVille but her heart rides still
In that Ford Econoline"

I look out on these shields of heather
Across the countryside
I wonder how they've grown together
While people live such separate lives
I think I'll stay inside for the winter
'cause the weather's in my bones
And this wind could shatter bone to splinter
Then howl me back home

Chorus
I'm fragile as the lady of the harbor
As fragile as her torch that glows
As fragile as these gulf stream waters
To the Texas coast to the Texas coast

I stared up athe faces in the mountain
Just a year ago
Laughin' in the spirit of America
And singin' in the snow
Now I wish I felt as strong as that mountain
Just carved in stone
I wish I was the gulf stream water
And I could sail you home

Chorus

I would give you all that's in me
Though part of me is gone
If I could have that day upon the mountain
For the snow and the song
But here's to love and all that it changes
When you're alone out in that storm
If I'd had a shield of heather
I'd have never loved at all

I would sail you home
To your Texas coast
I would sail you home
To the Texas coast"

From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow-capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes, It's the love of loves
It's the song of every man"

The wheels of thunder, they roll no more

The whistle sighs no more in the night...

The soul of America's pride

Toil of our fathers with foreign hands,
They laid the tracks and they opened the plains
They fought the mountains and they merged our seas
They set America free

Tell me,... Where is the blaze of the hobo's caldron?
The refuge for these poor and these fallen?
It rests in the lines, like a ghost in the music,
The soul of America's pride

Foreign father... American son, father see what your son has done
He's torn up the mountains
And reshaped the plains
The dreams he dreams aren't the same

To the fallen ones who may still be askin,
""Who'd take time to stir these ashes,
Who'll hear the lines of a ghost in the music
And kindle America's pride? ""

All by my own will

But it's just me and this old moon

They all want the captain's daughter
They want her beauty and her youth
To grace their bow out on the sea

Got a bank full of mother's dreams
Maybe mother just didn't see
That love would be the only thing
Her daughter would ever need

Oh, I am the heart not taken
The one thought not worth breakin'
I am the late blooming rose
With only her mother's dream to hold
On this less traveled road
Who really knows
Maybe the hearts not taken
Are truly made of gold

I'm gonna flip one more bottle cap up at the moon
I've got an early call with so much work to do
But, when I go inside I'm gonna let my back door slam

I love you, too

Could not get across

And I strive for purity
And I slip just like the stars

Puts me up a tree

When I was home
The days were sweet
The nights were warm
The seasons change the jobs would come the flowers fade

Made the Cavalry young Joe's enemy.

Oh, the oultlaws spilled the blood across

To defend you from your fantasies
Joseph wore that badge across the Kansas prairies
To save the railroads
But the heroes that we made, well, they were
Ruthless soldiers who'll kill for gold.

Don't believe in your American dream

And the child 'cross the isle is sleepin' away
While the soldier behind me lets his dreams roll and tumble
My way...

I would not be the woman that I am

Twenty years away from home.

But he's a man of sixty-five.
Where ain't a soul in El Paso
Who would give an old drunk a ride.

Now, he traded in his draftsman's pen
For a fishing pole.
And his mansion on the hill
Is an alley in El Paso.
The anchors of the fifties
Still hold to broken dreams
When his sorrows grow.

Twenty years away from home.

The whistle blew and now she's gone
West Texas dust beneath your nails

Searching for your broken heart and truth
She was all you ever had
And the only thing you ever had to lose

You're lining up your shots at half past noon
You threw your ring across the bar
And sang along to Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues

Like velvet 'cross your tongue?

Do you savor every line?
Or do they flow as one with your heartbeat
With your voice and your mind?

If you turn the light out in the hallway
Will your shadow lose it's way?
Or do we share these shadows in the darkness
And they move from place to place?

We could share a shadow in the darkness
As shadows have no face

Can you face the light of the day?

Oh, he made her eyes light up like the heavens on the fourth of July

She ran the numbers they say she ran 'em clean
Those porcelain hands could keep a ledger even in her sleep
While he worked the Seabees in the Philippines
They say she made more money than you or I will ever see

Chorus
Love was an anchor on the Jersey shore
If you were looking for love, boys, you could've found it in forty-four
''cause love wore a halo back before the war
When the men loved the women and the women knew what men were for

It was in the winter when he came home
He had to hold those porcelain hands just to keep her warm
So, they had a daughter they named her Stephanie Anne
Hey, they sent her off to Vassar to find herself a family man

Chorus

Now, she sold the hotel it belongs to me
I watch those sailors come and go like the waves in the seas
I've hung their portraits in the honeyoon suite
I hear they're fishin' their lives away in the Florida Keys

Though I have discovered that you love another
And hardly remember my name

My youth was so crazy... My heart was so lazy
Love never could stand me still
But, love's found a shoulder now that I'm older
With plenty of time to kill

[Break]

I wish you well for your new love
'Cuz true love is so hard to hold
You'll be the one that I dream of
'till I find a love of my own

If hearts were of wool I'd be warm
I've known some kind hearts and I've touched a few
Though I never claim one for my own

With your waltz in the mornin' and your neon at night
I've bathed in your loneliness, drank of your wine
And I lived on DiMaggio time

And hearts felled to paradise still rest in her eyes
She was no fading light

Oh, hot night in August, so long to the goddess
America's fatherless child
Immortal's forever, the queen of the camera
The master of winkin' a smile and leaving her shadow behind

So farewell you old tinsel city

Nanci Griffith,Michael's Song,/n/nanci+griffith/michaels+song_20565295.html,"(Nanci Griffith)

There's a light out on the freeway, says it's time to go
I'm wasting my time counting stains on a barroom floor
Thinking 'bout my hometown and the friends I'll leave behind
Mostly 'bout the man who writes his songs with smiling rhymes
And I'm holding on to a smokey view of his dreams in the midnight light

Michael counts his songs in the years of wasted miles
I used to think he was really part of that fantasy in rhyme
But looking back on all his tunes of butterflies and sunshine,
There was only one about the man he kept inside
About the time he crossed the line and let a tear come to his eye.

I used to hide out in his pretty smile,
And hope it would shine me through the morrow.
Until I learned the way it feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile without a soul to share his sorrow.

The light here at the freeway, well, it's turning green to gold,
The stains on that barroom floor ten miles back down the road.
Thinking 'bout how that old bar brought Michael back to mind,
And how I can sing his blues and be smiling here inside...
I guess a weary soul will always sing Michael's smiling rhymes.

I used to hide out in his pretty smile,
And hope it would shine me through the morrow.
Until I learned the way it feels to be the man
Who sings the world a smile without a soul to share his sorrow."

Is there enough frost left to write our names upon the pane?

Are you sleeping now?
It's midnight in Missoula

I am down in Rio where I cannot find the sky
Our savior on that mountaintop has taught my soul to fly
I am singing Gershwin and children's lullabies
And wondering of you
And if you're sleeping in Missoula tonight?

Sing Samuel Barber melodies with your viola sweet and high
But I am off to Liverpool on an early evening flight

When it's merely the whisper of a cloud
In a crazy storm, that pulls you on

Take a pill or you might take a loss
And the vicious circle tightens
But compromise comes with a cost
Maybe you can't see, but it's clear to me
Money changes everything
It changes everything

Make a little and it make's your day
And the heavens smile upon you
Make a bundle and you're blown away
to a different game, then the rules all change

Leave a husband or trade a wife
You've made the bigger picture now
take a country or take a life
If it's moolah's will, there's gold in them hills
Money changes everything

As the morning light stretched in across my bed
I thought of you
Remembering your laughing eyes and all we said
I love you too
As all my thoughts of you pass 'fore my face a thousand times
The way they race my heart I cannot say it all in lines

How the short time together lasts so long
Makes me strong
As two weeks came and went then you and I were gone
Living on
For it seems our love was destined to be caught in other nets
But the love we held so brief I'd chance again without regret

Yes, standing by the road has been my song before
Much too long
But now somehow I'm forced to see me there once more
And that's the song
For my waking thoughts of you are but extensions of the dream
Without you here beside me
I'll never know all that they mean

I give you my devotion
You left me heartsick

Now I'm tired of sharin' this bed of nails
So come first light I'm gonna be right
With the mornin' train

So goodbye lover, I'm goin' undercover
Crescent City's gonna swallow me
Gonna skip my ring 'cross the Mississippi River
When it sinks I wont' feel a thing
When it sinks I won't feel a thing

I'm gonna be stayin'
With a short time acquaintance
When I met him he was playin'
On the Gulf Breeze Circuit
He didn't play no hit songs or tv themes
He's a guitar man just a hired hand
From a local band

Chorus

The whistles blowin' clear and loud

When I hit the station
I'll take a taxi to the corner

Life's gonna be fine when I leave him behind

Letting go before she flies

Must I climb, must I climb
Ever blue

Barefoot over stones

Or you might walk alone
And you won't find that love comes easy
But that love is always right
So even when the dark clouds gather
You will be the light

And if you lose a part inside
When love turns around on you
Leaving the past behind
Is knowing you'll do as you always do
Holding you blind
Keeping you true

Youll never be the sun turning in the sky

All day you kept your ladder close to mine
We froze in Georgia burned up in Chicago

Sometimes I've wished that she was yours and mine
I could call my brother Milt in Cincinnati
And ask him for a loan but never mind

A little girl dreamer
Ribbons and long curls
Reflections of yesterdays past
Headlines and footlights
Wee hours and long nights
Keep everything moving so fast

It's taken a long time
And she's walked a fine line
For fortune and fame have arrived
She kept on striving
And half-way surviving
Till part of those dreams came alive

[Chorus:]
Now she wishes she looked like they tell her she looks all the time
What she'd give just to feel like she tells them she's feelin' just fine
All that money she makes every night ain't as much as it seems
Cuz it's a dollar a wrinkle and less than a nickel a dream

Well, her heart may be breaking
But she keeps on taking what she thought she wanted back then
It's too late to change her,
There's always a stranger to tell her she's someone again

Why do you ride for your money?
Why do you rope for short pay?
You ain't gettin' nowhere
And you're losin' your share

They married and have a good life
Oh, you sure missed the track when you never came back
She made the perfect professional's wife

Never seen a hawk on the wing
Never seen the spring hit the Great Divide

We met on a school bus rollin' thru the Autumn fields our Daddy's raised
Beneath a hot August sky... Our Mothers waved goodbye
My Daddy tipped his hat with a tear in his eye
When we left for the city where the sun rarely shines
It was a hundred and two in the shade

''cause I don't want to be standing here
Don't want to be talking here
And I don't really care who's to blame
''cause if love won't fly on it's own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say
Love is not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away from love alone
To pace the floor
Young or old
I say that love is still the same
You may walk away from love but you'll fall head and heel again

Chorus

Two lonely hearts in this airport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But, if love won't fly on it's own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane

That frown you're wearing's
Just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared back in the lost and found?
These broken wings are gonna leave me here to stand my ground
You can have this ticket for that lonely plane that's flying out

Oh she was high up there in the air
Caught still by a soldier's stare
Whenever it was men amongst men
Down upon the land
And she followed those mothers' sons
She felt the thunder of their guns
From a pearl's eye view, just a camera in her hand
She was born Georgette but the name
Didn't suit her well
So, she blew out of Wisconsin as Dickey Chapelle

So, she flew with a pilot's pride
The first witness to either side
She carried relief to the lost ones
Between the bombs
And we saw it all through her lens
She knew she'll go back again
When the call rang out once more from Vietnam
She's been through this before,
She'll tell ya war is hell
Her pearl earrings caught the light
On Dickey Chapelle

Oh, that's the way it was
She was the only one to tell
In 1962,
She blew the whistle loud and clear
Now we trace her wings
In her footsteps without fear
To the front lines where she fell
Where she lies still
But she's still there

It was 1965
Over Chu Lai in a free fall dive
In a dawn patrol to cover the dead zone ground
She tiptoed through the land mines
All along the enemy lines
But she never saw the one that took her down
She captured the bloody pearls of war so well
That war was bound to steal the end of Dickey Chapelle

Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)
Dickey Chapelle (from a pearl's eye view)

You spit as you slammed out the door

You know it drives me up the wall
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me, baby
I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams

You through a caution to us all
And now when the late night drinkers gather for their falls
Someone says they've seen you out there laughing at us all

You mourned the cause of discontent with those who couldn't lose the dark
From the broad of daylight to half spent stars just waiting dusk to fall
Tell me, what the hell were you saying?
Was there a point at to it all?
Oh, and did they really see you out there laughing at us all

You wore your causes on your sleeve like a beacon wears the dark

Now you are only dust for art
You're a shadow to recall
For all those late night drinkers in their ragged lonely bars

They're always white roses and she never asks why
She still doesn't know where he goes Thursday nights
But his wedding band rests, on the bedside that night

He was a soldier in the Vietnam war
He lost half his right leg whilst daydreaming of her
She lit a candle each holy hour he was gone
""You Were On My Mind"" was their favorite song

Chorus
Love is a mystery
From birth 'till we die
It's cross words of a morning
By evening entwined
It's all that we dream of, sometimes it's not right
Love is white roses and you never ask why

He's the hands of a draftsman, he's built a good life
She works for a season during irs time
Two children they've had though their boy has now died
When they wake of each morning, he's still on their minds

Their friends would all tell you they're like day and night
Their daughter's an actress, she is strong and she's bright
He meets with his pals from the war Thursday nights
She still treasures those roses every 4th of July

All the people gathered round while the band was a-tunin'
I can hear them now... Playin' 'Comin' Through the Rye'

They were dressed in blue and they looked so lovely
Just a gentle flower of a small town girl
Then he took mine hand and they danced to the music
With a single smile...  You became mine world

[Chorus:]
And we danced all night... To the fiddle and the banjo
Their driftin' tunes, seemed to fill the air
So long ago, but I can still remember...
When we fell in love, at the Roseville Fair

Now, we courted well, and we courted dearly
And we rock for hours on your front porch swing
Then a year went by... From the time that I met you
And I made you mine, at the Roseville Fair

Never saw the white line till I was leavin' you behind
Never knew I needed you till I was caught up in a bind
And I never spoke I love you till I cursed you in vain
Never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane

Never saw the East coast until I moved to the West
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off your breast
And I never saw your heart till someone tried to steal it away
Never saw your tears till they rolled down your face

Snowing - through Dakota I once drove
With the wife of my best pal
Who cloaks her heart from cold with gold
It was well into the winter
Of December in the cold
Off to see Mount Rushmore staring through the snow
And to gamble with the boys of Deadwood
As we drove

Chorus
Snowing - I am shaking out the snow
Oh, the cold that is within my heart
I'm gonna shake out all that snow
Riding years ago
Through those South Dakota roads
When the laughter could thaw Enderby
And shake me from the snow
Like a hurricane through Florida
I'll shake out all this snow

Snowing - one Christmas morn' when I was four
My brother told me it was warm
So a swimsuit I adorned
Then he sent me to the weather
And behind me locked the doors
A four year old in a swim suit and brand new plastic skates
Out into the snow to catch this cold
I cannot shake

Chorus

Snowing - yeah, it snows in Tennessee
The place where I now make my life
Is still snowing down on me
I'd prefer Antarctica
Perhaps the land of Enderby
Where the weather is my heart and I'm closer to the sea
Since I cannot ever seem to shake the snow
Out of me

Chorus

And all across the states you see the tractors and the plows
Clearing out the roads
And the bridges north and south
Something they did learn
And I just don't seem to know
How to clear a passage
And shake out all the snow"

Rolling with the river
Trying to keep time

It gives me strength in harder times
And reason to believe
Endless miles of highway

Play one for Papa, moan one for mama

I remember waving back at you through a silted window pane

I said, ""Fare thee well, sweet lips of wine"".
And you said, ""Fare thee well my Texas rose.""
And then you blew a kiss of innocence as the train began to roll
So long ago

You'd gone off to fight the war when I returned from school
I traded in my innocence when the springtime came to bloom
I married for my family one night I dreamed of you
And you were running from me in the rain down on Congress Avenue

I saw you once in a crowded bar it was Christmas time
I was frightened by the thunder of our hearts in sixty-nine
Because I live my life in whispers now and I choose to live alone

Coming real, but now it seems
That highways are for foolish travelers, always bonded, always shackled
By the prayer that they're remembered in our dreams.

Like the pages of my life.

It's heavy as can be.
I wish that I could find someone
Who would carry it for me;
Just to pay it some attention
And to handle it with care
Because it has been dropped and
Is in need of some repair.
Some things I know, some things I guess.
Some things I wish that I could learn to express,

And I remember your voice, and the sound of goodbye.

Maybe it's the rain,

And ask him his name.

Get all spilled down on the floor

Just waiting for the falling
And the hookers stand watchfully
Waiting by the door

With my slippery city shoes
Which lord I swore I would never do again
Through the the gray fog-bound straits
Where the cedars stand watching
I'll be far off and gone

This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening
How I wish that I could take us back to Germany
I would stay awake and you would talk to me
Yet for every drop of rain I hear
There's bound to fall another tear
Upon this page of song of my heart aching
Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go...
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening
Before you let it go...
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me

The name she gave was Caroline
Daughter of a miner
And her ways were free
It seemed to me
The sunshine walked beside her

She came from Spencer
Across the hill
She said her Pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low
And soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she'd come
To look for work
She was not seeking favors
And for a dime a day
And a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

But the times were hard Lord
The jobs were few
All through Tecumseh Valley
But she asked around
And a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's

She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied
Her Pa had died
The word came down from Spencer

So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man
Returned again
To lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died
Was a note cried
Fare thee well ... Tecumseh Valley

When I know a love is true
Don't keep your love for me

If you would say to me today
The time for love is now
Could I sway your love my way

He was standing by the highway
With a sign that just said Mother
When he heard a driver coming
About a half a mile away
So he held the sign up higher
Where no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by Boulder Dam that day

He was raised up in Milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singing songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in Boulder I don't know

Chorus
And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the morning sun
Back in Boulder he had told her
I don't know when, I've had a better friend

It was out in Arizona
That he heard the lady listening
To each word that he was saying
To each line that he would write
So he sat down at her table
And they talked about the weather
98. 6 and rising down by Boulder Dam that night

Chorus

Now he's traded off his Martin
Though his troubles ain't over
His feet are almost frozen and the sun is sinking low
Won't you listen to me brother, if you ever loved your mother
Please pull off on the shoulder, if you're goin' Milwaukee way
It's ten degrees and getting colder down by Boulder Dam today"

He was a flyer for the Air Force
On a plane from San Antonio
I was traveling to London
He was going off to Buffalo
Changing planes in Pittsburgh
We got grounded in a storm
Now, I would give anything
To be on that flyer's arm

We played cards, mostly blackjack
As we sat out on the tarmac
We sang songs we knew in Spanish
As we both loved songs of language
He'd heard me on the radio
I'd seen the flyers of San Antone
Now I would give anything
To have that flyer for my own

Chorus
God bless the flyer
Who would be flying home tonight
I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

He said he's never married
'cause, his heart was in the clouds
And I said I was too clumsy
That I broke the wings of the loves I found
He shouted out his name to me
As I ran to make my flight
Now, I would give anything
To see that flyer, flyin' tonight

One year I watched a war in London
In the airport leaving London
And I wondered if I'd know him
If I saw his wings in motion
Did I leave my heart in Pittsburgh
In the lightning of that flight?
I wish that you could tell me now
Will he be flyin' home tonight?

Look around, around, look around
Every time I turn around
I'm not who I ought to be
Down, down, it gets me down
Every time I look around
There is something haunting me

Every friend I am deserting and every danger I am flirting
Every word that ends up hurting, is like a ghost inside of me
Every heart I could be cheering and every love that I am fearing
Every cry I am not hearing, is like a ghost inside of me

Paled beneath flourescent lights
In a Greyhound station's cruel midnight
Where you can't afford the ride

Chorus
Oh, the power lines
They go from sea to sea
They carry voices
Love from him to me
The power lines you fall beneath
Are the rainbows you can't climb
And you will not climb the power lines
You are lost beneath the power lines

There's nowhere that you haven't been
And no place that you call your home
There's no place that you cannot go
With the gift within your hands
And the tools to build another's dream
That connects them to the power lines
You do not feel your need

Lost to me are how the lives of friends go
Like autumn leaves in Oklahoma wind
But it made me strong to be on my own
It never did me no harm to live all alone
Oh, but now and then
In the color of the evening
Drunken in a barroom
With a fan turning
I've come to miss a few

This afternoon was cloudy and the rains came
Third day of my first day San Miguel
Seems lately that I'm doubling as Storm bait
I've been followed like a shadow through the dell
But it made me strong to be on my own

See what I have done

They breathe a breath that's deadly stale
Since they tooled a song for me
I guess mechanics never really set the pace
Cause I'm back and I'm strong

We'll hide out in the subways,
And drink the poets' wine, oh,
But I had John, so you went and I stayed behind,
But you were home in time for the senior prom,
When we lost John.

The fantasies we planeed, I'm living them now,
All the dreams we sang when we knew how,
Well, they haven; t changed.
There's never been two friends like you and me, Mary Margaret.

It's nice to see your family growing, Margaret.
Your daughter and your husband there,
They really treat you right
But we've talked all night
And what about the light,
That glowed beyond our woods when we were ten?
You were the rambler then.

Who'll put no one above me

Now, no one thoght of leaving
'Til death stared them in the face
And the trains they all were loaded
The people were all leaving town
The trestle gave way to the water
And the trains they went on down

Chorus

Rain it was a' falling
Thunder began to roll
Lightning flashed like hell fire
The wind began to blow
Death the cruel master
When the wind to blow
Rode in on a team of horses
I cried, ""Death, won't you let me go""

Chorus

Hey, now trees fell on the island
And the houses give way
Some they strained and drowned
Some died in most every way
And the sea began to rolling
And the ships they could not stand
And I heard a captain crying
""God save a drowning man""

Chorus

Death your hands are clammy
You got them on my knee
You come and took my mother
Won't you come back after me
And the flood it took my neighbor
Took my brother too
I thought I heard my father calling
And I watched my mother go

Chorus

You know the year of 1900
Children, many years ago
Death came howling on the ocean
Death calss, you got to go

When she and Edwin fell in love
She touched his face, and shook her head
In disbelief, she sighed and said
""In many dreams, I've held you near.

Verse
He asked her for her hand for life
And she became a salesman's wife
He was home each night by eight
But one stormy evening he was late
Her frightened tears fell to the floor
'Til his key turned in the door
""Where have you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day.
Where have you been?
I'm just not myself when your away. ""
[Bridge:]
They'd never spent a night apart
For sixty years she heard him snore
Now they're in a hospital
In separate beds, on different floors
Clare soon lost her memory
Forgot the names of family
She never spoke a word again
Then one day they wheeled him in
He held her hand and stroked her hair
And in a fragile voice she said,
""Where have you been?
I've looked for you forever and a day.
Where have you been?
I'm just not myself when your away.
No, I'm just not myself when your away. """

All the birds are leaving
But how can they know
It's time for them to go
Before the winter fire
I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes
Who knows where the time goes

Your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know
It's time for them to go
I will still be here
I have not thought of leaving

For who knows where the time goes
Who knows where the time goes

And I am not alone
While my love is near me

Until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again

The sounds of the lover's song
And I've dreamed all the dreams a wayward girl dreams
In a thousand places gone
Dallas was my late night out
Radcliffe's served to roust me out
And Houston lay like Cleveland with the color removed
And all I ever wanted
Was to wander and be wooed
Like a Woman of the Phoenix
A welcomed Waterloo

I've seen the sun blaze the breast of the countryside
I've seen her huddled in a winter freeze
And I've run cross paths of a thousand lives
Among the cactus and the white birch trees
Avloc ran a waterfront bar
Vito, he was the king of thieves
And Michael was a rock'n roll hood from the Odessa plains
Now, all of them were my kind
Wild and damn near free
But, a Woman of the Phoenix is the medicine they need"

Keepin' my eyes away from the lights

To his home in the North woods

Touch a stone in the mine field
Could not touch the lightning

And we ran so blindly through the fields of summer cane
Now when I'm lonely... I send my heart down to New Orleans
To chase my memories alone down through my dreams

How I miss the clarity I left there in my youth
Will there be another heart who can endure my solitude?

Though I will always care for you

The shattered dream and broken heart

Made her old before her time
She's gonna take that final step
And leave her pain behind

All the sins that men commit before their done

She won't speak his name, it's too much to bear

Sure looked a lot like me (sure looked a lot like me)
Wooh ahahah wooh

Feelin' drunk and talkin' tough
But he wasn't really mean
Bumped into this sidewinder
Should have backed way
Gave him some lip
Turned out they were
The last words he would say

All the sins that men commit before their done
His killer backed into one smokin' silver gun
No one asked his name, nobody cared
But I saw his face as the blue smoke cleared

Devil came and said, Sinner finally you are mine
But pardon me Mr. Devil but I think I need more time,
I've got a lot of mendin' up in life to do

Before I came for you

Take this rope and wind it once for every lie
Once for every thoughtless act
And twice for tears they cried
Walk 50 miles naked in the desert sun
Praying for the souls that you have ruined, one by one

No one knew his name, nobody cared
But I saw his face as he was hangin' there

They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico

We fired our cannons till the barrels melted down,
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round.
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind,
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.

We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

As a fais-do-do on a Saturday night
Work your tail off all week long
But forget about your troubles with a party and a song

Boy I love those old time tunes
They can tickle your senses like a Cajun moon
Creole food sure tastes fine
When you wash it on down with that homemade wine

Chorus:

Get out the fiddle rosin up the bow
There's gonna be some music and I hope it ain't slow
Grab your baby dance 'til three down at the Bayou Jubilee
Grab your baby dance 'til three down at the Bayou Jubilee

There's Pierre and his girl Laverne
Dancin' so hot you'd think their shoes were burning
Grandma's in the corner shakin' it too
She's got her own version of a Cajun boogaloo  (repeat chorus)"

Many moons later, now we're giving up
I start the engine, you start to cry
It's a beautiful memory but a sad sad goodbye.

How many times have we wished on a star,
Wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car
We saw halley's comet in lunar eclipse
And I sure saw heaven when I tasted your lips.

So blow out the stars, turn off the moon
Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind
Another love story has come to an end

When our love was new as the first evening star
We both said I'll worship you just as you are
Then I tried to change you, girl, and I don't know why
You tried to change me, hey we might as well try.

To blow out the stars, turn off the moon
Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind
Another love story has come to an end.

Brings a glass of tea
And I can tell she's as pretty as a flower

She winds away the water
From my eyes and soothes my brain

And it won't rain for beans

A big storm is what it means

By workin' on the truck
We get to hang out together
Can't believe this luck

Glass is fine by the hour
But don't match with mine
It got wrecked playin' sailor in the shower
Last Christmas time
The song's written in another language
But the weather forecast is plain
It was blowin' in a brass sky

Til the wind turns 'round

Cooks up a kiss of death
Boilin' up mango, crab and coconut
And includin' cinnamon bread
But she drops the pan and says
Paranoia is out and breeds like a runaway train
And it was blowin' in a brass sky

Buy for me a sparrow, almost any flying thing.

And the temperature is 84 degrees.
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.

But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air
From telluride to boulder down below
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow

I remember christmases when I was just a boy
In the morning I would run to see the tree.
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.
Now the sun is setting in the california sky
And I can't find the spirit anywhere
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye
I'm going back home toook for christmas there

Reading romance novels and laying around the house
Dreaming that the good parts were written just for you
Then waking up saying this will never come true
Stop your hesitating go out tonight
You know he's out there waiting
To get you in his sights.

And what's in store after their honeymoon.

And I was grumblin' to the dancers
'bout how men and women ought to live apart
And how a promise never made can not be broken
And can never break your heart

A little girl came dancing 'cross the floor,
And all her crinolines were billowing
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.
Oh what a joy fell on the honored guests
As each of them was drawn inside her dream,
And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet
And hollered at her ""dance little jean""

Dance, little jean, this day is for you,
Two people you love, stood up and said ""i do""
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had
Was answered today
Your mama's marrying your dad

Well, my cynical heart just melted
'cause I knew what this get together meant
How it ended year of tears and sad confusion
That the little girl had spent.
Well they told the band to pack it up
About the time the couple cut the cake,
But we played as long as they stayed
For love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.

Lit up the room when she stepped on the stage
Came to la for some more

And thousands of people in line
To see her;
Knocking on door after door after all of this time,
Now she's not sure

Up in hollywood
Stayed with an agent she met in a bar
Laughed when he told her he'd make her a star
Where has she heard that before?

One night he told her that she'd never get anywhere
In her clothes
That's what it takes to play movieland musical chairs

Sunrise or sunset she won't be around
But they'll replace her with so many more

This will all work out
Don't let this dream die
There's a fire in the sky
It's like the light in your eyes
Thinkin' of you
And I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again

Now the night is dark with diamonds
And I'm standing inside the rain
Giving up your love
Was the worst mistake I made
There's a sound I hear in the distance
Seems it's calling out my name
Well I'll pay most any price
I just hope I'm not too late

Turn back the clock awhile
Things will all work out
That's what the dream is all about
There's a fire in the sky
It's like the light in your eyes
Oh, it's true
That I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love

Turn back the clock awhile
Things will all work out
That's what the dream is all about
I see a fire in the sky
Just like the light in your eyes
Thinkin' of you
That I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love"
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Fish Song,/n/nitty+gritty+dirt+band/fish+song_20101233.html,"Sat here by this stony brook until the grey day turned to dust
When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost.
He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read.

The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go

Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal.

Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home
They never caught me!

Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal
All want me for their own.

The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go

So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon.
The fish ran away with the moon
The fish ran away with the moon."

Shinin' thru the trees,
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs
Are floatin on the breeze
Baby get ready.....

Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stump road
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo

You and me going fishing in the dark,
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows.
Down by the river in the full moon light,
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow...

Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you...

Spring is almost over and the summer's come
And the days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along
Baby get ready.....

And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get ready..... Ooooooooooo.

You and me going fishin in the dark!"

Same these days, I think about her
Dream up ways to live with out her
We made vows that I can not excuse
Yes forever don't last the way it used too

We filled the church and hired a preacher
I raised her veil to reach her
Lives on the promise of her youth
But forever don't last the way it used too

Eternity can not be messed with
The law says you might confess to
Enough coals, hotter hell you fool
Then you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you choose
That forever don't last the way it used too

Hammers, razors fill the trash
You throw'em out when you use the last
Get a new form son, don't become confused
If forever don't last the way it used to

Forever don't last, forever don't last
Forever don't last, forever don't last the way it used too
Forever don't last, forever don't last

To make a fortune in the promise land
Got a job behind the counter
Of an all-night hamburger stand
She wrote faithfully home to mama:
""now mama, don't you worry none""
From small things, mama, big things one day come

It was late one friday
As he pulled in out of the dark.
He was tall and handsome;
First she took his order; then she took his heart.
They bought a house up on a hillside
Where little feet once had run
From small things, mama, big things one day come.

Good love is fleeting,
It's sad but it's true
But when your heart is bleeding,
You don't wanna hear the news

She packed her bags; went to wyoming with a real estate man
They drove down to tampa in an el dorado grande
She writes home ""dear mama, life is heaven in the sun""
From small things, mama, big things one day come

She shot him dead
On a sunny florida road,
But when they caught her asll she said was
She couldn't stand the way he drove.
Back home, lonesome johnny
Waits for his baby's parole;
He sits high up on a hillside,
Where the wyoming river flows.
At his feet, and almost grown now,
Sits a daughter and a handsome son.

Wrapped up in a world of pantyhose

Stacks of books and his chemistry set

Might as well take a ride
The rest of them were born to tears
Or hiding fears and never broke away

Screamed and hollered he was such a drag
Now you hear him on the radio
Sings songs and playing rock & roll
Rock & roll, rock & roll, rock & roll

Two hundred people trying to keep me down,
I've taken all I can, I ain't lookin' back.
Small town boy in a back yard lot,
Can't make a living with the luck I've got
I'm gonna leave it all, I ain't looking back.

That's the way I remember, it seemed to me when I was young.
But I can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground,
And the snow on the trees as the winter comes down.
Still I go home again in my heart.

My father worked hard on the railroad track;
37 years cut across his back,
He gave it all he had for what he believed.
Like every other kid that came before,
I grew up believing there was something more
And I still believe, I still believe.

That's the way I remember, it seemed to me when I was young.
But I can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground,
And the snow on the trees as the winter comes down.
Still I go home again in my heart.

But I can still see the lightning on a warm summer night
And the rain on the roof when I close my eyes;
I can still hear us laughing on the front porch in the dark.
There are days when I know that I've traveled so far
That I'll never find the road leading back to the start,
Still I go home again in my heart

And a sapphire belly

As to out shout the tele

By the side of the sea
Took odds to turn back
To the moon in the trees
Where a green cloud of birds
In a flock of a thou'
Yelled from one to another
It's morning out loud

It's morning, it's morning
It's morning they cried
From the edge of the treetops
To the edge of the skies
It's morning, it's morning
It's morning they cried
So open your heart
When you open your eyes

And the sound of their voices
Together did blend
Forming chords of awakening
If I'm not here again
For they shouted
Never again would they fly
In such numbers across
Such a primitive sky

And they noticed my heart
As it sank to the sand
Do not hurry they called
It's all part of a plan

You come again tomorrow.

The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas
She would stare across the water from the trees
The last time he was home, he held her on his knees
He said the next time they would sail away just where they please.

Jamaica, say you will
You help me find a way to fill
These lifeless sails and stay until
My ship can find the sea.

Jamaica was a sweet young thing, I loved her too
She was a comfort and a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together, the next thing I knew
They had brought her things down to the bay, what could I do?

Jamaica, say you will
You help me find a way to fill
These sails and we will sail until
Our waters have run dry."

Nothing but the man in the moon
Was standing in my way

I was drunk on the warm sweet air
Tangled up in her raven hair
I should've known but I didn't care
She'd be gone by the light of day

Cause her eyes were shining brighter
Than the light of the jealous moon
And the stars fell all around her
Well did I see you smilin'
When the morning came too soon
Did I see you smilin'
Jealous moon, jealous moon

Now the sun dances across my room
I can smell the wine and her soft perfume
The only thing that lets me know
That an angel wasn't here

You know I had this crazy dream
She flew away on stolen wings
But all she took was a pair of jeans
When see saw that the coast was clear

And her eyes were shining brighter
Than the light of the jealous moon
And the stars fell all around her
Well did I see you smilin'

Chair
beside my uncle john, my daughters 'cross the table there
I'd walked the docks in misty rain, a pain was in my legs
but I'd seen the dream of kinsmen in the boats of Killybegs

the banter of my uncle and my daughters filled the air and
The
gunning brothers?(Donegalers) next to us were glad that we
Were there
I was kind of quiet listening at the window ledge
for the music of the harbor, the birds of Killybegs

down the coast not far was Galway land of joys (Joyce) and
Kinnamar?
at their (after) supper and asleep we would visit? (be
Goin') there tomorrow
I worried if my words would e'er be sung by Irishmen
or out (rot) here on the docks??
like the fish of Killybegs

a radio was playing though we never heard a word (I don't
Think this phrase is right)
but the rhythm of the music was familiar if absurd
and harkning
(a heightening) intensity? for silence did I beg
oh what a song was playing in the air of Killybegs

I couldn't quite believe it for it sounded rather strange
the instruments were different and the key had been changed
I reached to turn the volume up then teetered on my legs
A girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Leon Mcduff,/n/nitty+gritty+dirt+band/leon+mcduff_20241585.html,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
I come before you to plead for the life of Leon McDuff
Ladies and gentlemen on the jury
I asking you to be the judge of when enough is enough

Now Leon McDuff has worked on his daddy's farm everyday since the day that he was born
Plowing in the fields and hoeing in the garden and helping pick the cotton and the corn
Then came the time of the Mississippi floods and all of his work went down the drain
The land was parched by the sun and blown by the wind and finally washed away by the rain

So he went to his friends to get some help from them but their crops and their money was all gone
So he went to the bank to mortgage his home but the bank wouldn't give Leon a loan
He could not decide how his family would survive with no crops and no money to buy food
And as he struggled with his hands to rework his land the notice came that said his land tax was due

Chorus

Now in an air-conditioned office on the other side of town sat a government official with a frown
'Cause he'd been trying for so long to find land to build a summer home but cheap river land could not be found
Then in the middle of his gloom his boss walked in the room and said I've got some real good news for the house you've planned
There's a farmer who's so poor and who's luck has run so sour that he can not pay the taxes on his land

So just you wait a week or two 'til the money's over due then go to the cashier down the hall
With his deed in your hand pay the taxes on the land have the sheriff give Leon McDuff a call
Have him tell Leon to move by the last day of July because the taxes on his land are overdue
Tell him he has to move away 'cause the taxes were not paid then all his river land belongs to you

Chorus

Now in that air-conditioned office in about a week or two came the sheriff saying I've got some bad news
That Leon McDuff says he's had some bad luck and he'll try to get the money but he aint agonna' move
That official he jumped up and grabbed the sheriff by the arm he said we're going down to take that land today
So he and the sheriff drove down to Leon's farm to tell the McDuffs to move away

There stood Leon on his land with a shotgun in his hand, his eyes narrowed 'neath the brim of his hat
He said ""I've worked hard on this land as a boy and as a man I aint gonna lose it to no god damned bureaucrat.""
Well that bureaucrat got mad and grabbed the gun in Leon's hand and in the struggle an explosion cracked the air
And when the smoke and dust had cleared and the ringing left their ears, the sheriff lay a dying on the ground

Chorus

Now on this table I will lay, this gun ""Exhibit A"" with two sets of fingerprints as you can see
But other hands were here unperceived by eye or ear that helped trigger off this awful tragedy
Now to me it's still unclear just what really caused the problem here
There's much too much we've got to know before we know enough
So we can't find out today where all the guilt should lay but it shouldn't be on Leon McDuff

Up the highway through the past
I was torn betwwen the future
And the memories of the past

Fell in love for the wrong reasons
Gave our hearts then lost control
So I eased it up past sixty
Turn away and let it roll

We had the plan to stay together
You with your dreams me with mine
With the promess of forever
We would stand the test of time

Like the hot winds come in summer
Trouble waited at the door
Time to leave this all behind me
Turn away and let it roll

Chorus
Let it roll the way these heart aches
Let it roll away theses fears
Let it roll away the reasons
We've been crying all these years

Every mile that comes between us
There's a cleansing in my soul
Throw away the rear view mirror
Adios and let it roll

Now everybody takes their chances
Everybody has to choose
But when love hangs in the balance
There's an innocence you lose

I don't know what lies before me
But I'm sure I have to go
Feel the tears slowly descending
It's my last so let it roll

Chorus
...
Time to leave this all behind me
Adios and let it go"

Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
Where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
For what few coins the congregation could afford

Dressed in all our Sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
And ""When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll Be There""

Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my lifes cornerstone
It was there in that little mountain church house
I first heard the words I based my life upon

At the all day Sunday singing, with dinner on the ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While the brothers and the sisters who've gone on to Gloryland
Slept in peace in the maple grove nearby"

But I'll never get used to living without you

Now I got used to tenderness, we'd hold each other tight
And I got used to happiness, we'd make love day and night
And I'll get used to mornings, eating breakfast all alone
Sitting in the evenings, when there's no one else at home

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run
I thought by now that I'd be realizing, what's done is done

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion,
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.

But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,
And somewhere in between I must have grown
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.

Now I know, it's a long hard road

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,
When the sun-up came, we got up and went
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent
Singin' songs along with gramma's radio.

Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,
Livin' in my memories all in vain
'cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.

Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where my name is known.

Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard road
Yes, I know, it's a long hard road."

While in the gutter you were makin' yourself quite a name
The loneliness is all that I regret
Losin' you might be the best thing yet

Dance in the kitchen till the morning light
Lousianna saturday night

Awaitin in the front yard
Sittin' on a log
A single shot rifle and a one eyed dog
Yonder come my kin folk in the moon light
Lousianna saturday night

Well you get down the fiddle
And you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes
And you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light
Lousianna saturday night

My brother Bill and my other brother Jack
Belly fulla beer and a possum in a sack
Fifteen kids in the front porch light
Lousianna saturday night
When the kin folk leave and the kids get fed
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed
Gonna have a little fun when we turn out the light
Lousianna saturday night

Well you get down the fiddle
And you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes
And you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light
Lousianna saturday night

Well you get down the fiddle
And you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes
And you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light

I was her guy
She was the light of my life
Well of all the silly games
We used to play
Love was the first thing we prized
So unexpectedly became a thief
I heard these things happen
But never to me
Left me walking in shadows
Stumblin' blind
Searching for ways to get by
Got to find me a girl
Who can change my world
And make, make it all worthwhile
Take it all away
And my heart see clear
Love is the last thing
It's just the last thing
Love is the last thing to go
See all the lights laid out
Below my feet
The city's so quiet tonight
Someone is waiting for me down there
It's time to get back in this life
Got to find me a girl
Who can change my world
And make, make it all worthwhile
Take it all away
And it's all so clear
Love is the last thing
It's just the last thing
Love is the last thing
Oohoohooh
Oh, it's just the last thing
Love, love is the last thing to go
Love, it's the last thing"

I already know, and darlin' I still care,
But we're crippled every time I close my eyes.
I know it's hard when you're all alone,
And you always come back home
Looks like we're hurtin from your lovin' on the side

I think I've prob'ly seen her, believe I know her name,
Darlin' does it make you satisfied?
She's the one who's feeling happy, I'm the one who wants to die
I think you've gone just a little too far this time.

So I just want to clear the air
I already know, and darlin' I still care,
But we're hurtin' from your lovin' on the side

I'm not saying that I approve, or that I can stand it,
But I know I've got to give us one more try.
I keep prayin' you still love me, but soon my prayer will die,
If every time we talk, you hide your eyes.

So I just want to clear the air
I already know, and darlin' I still care
But we're crippled every time you close your eyes
I know it's hare when you're all alone,
And if you really want to come back home,
Stop this hurtin', stop your lovin' on the side
Stop this hurtin', stop your lovin' on the side."

There's something here we should discover
Let's make a little magic
Before the night is through

Oh, you've seen it all before
And heard the same lines,
But if you're willing just to take a chance
It could be all right, so fine
We'll find ourselves dancing by firelight.

So don't you try to change the subject
Or try to put yourself above it,
A boy could get pneumonia sitting next to you
That's true

A little sleep is all we're losing
It's up to us to do the choosing
Let's make a little magic before the night is through
Make a little magic before the night is through

Ooh, to the blue skies
Where no one can reach us
It may sound crazy but just hold on tight,
Never has a love run deeper
Baby my heart is true
Baby my heart is true

A little sleep is all we're losing
It's up to us to do the choosing
Let's make a little magic before the night is through.

Let's make a little magic
Let's make a little magic
Make a little make a little"

And a youngun's dream of growin' up to ride,
On a freight train leavin' town, not knowin' where I'm bound.
And no one could change my mind but mama tried.
One and only rebel child from a fam'ly meek and mild
My mama seemed to to know what lay in store,
'spite all my sunday learnin' towards the bad I kept on turnin',
'til mama couldn't hold me anymore.

And I turned twenty-one in prison doin' life without parole,
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried.
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
And that leaves only me to blame, cause mama tried

Dear ole' daddy, rest his soul left my mom a heavy load,
She tried so very hard to feel his shoes,
Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused.

And I turned twenty-one in prison doin' life without parole,
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better but her pleading I denied
And that leaves only me to blame, cause mama tried"

And with the sweetest smile she'd kiss the child goodnight
At the mill she'd work her fingers till they were raw
For the sake of her son and the daddy he never saw

Mary danced with soldiers
She stepped a light quadrille
Shawl across her shoulders
To keep away the chill, to keep away the chill

It was a rebel boy who brought her joy they say
Though the years had passed the memories stood fast each day
Before a bullet crushed the life of their romance
He gave her a shawl and a parasol from France

Mary danced with soldiers
She stepped a light quadrille
Shawl across her shoulders
To keep away the chill, to keep away the chill

They came around to the tavern in town that night
And with silent cries Mary never tried to fight
They cut her hair and left her body torn
Her spirit slipped away before the dawn

Mary danced with soldiers
But now her body's still
Shawl across her shoulders
To keep away the chill

Mary danced with soldiers
She stepped a light quadrille
Shawl across her shoulders
To keep away the chill, to keep away the chill"

Had a flat on her stingray with nobody around
I helped her out, she said climb in
So I ditched my ol truck just to see where the party would end.

We spent the weekend in reno in the honeymoon suite,
Never saw the casino, barely took time to eat.
I never dreamed she would take me this far
But by sunday that lady had taken a hold of my heart.

It's a modern day romance, a new kind of game
With no time to slow dance in the fast lane.
I tried to love her without any strings
But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain.

She never said good-bye, just a note by the phone
Said ""thanks for the good times, but it's time to move on.""
Well I'm out here walkin' with my thumb in the air
Wondering where she might've gone and why I even care.

It's a modern day romance; old fashioned pain"

With silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants, the old soft shoe
He jumped so high, he jumped so high,
Then he lightly touched down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was - down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life, he laughed, slapped his leg a step

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He said his name, Bojangles, then he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants a better stance, oh, he jumped up high,
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh,
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Through out the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years how his dog and him
Had traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died, after 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit'
He shook his head and as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him 'Please'
Please ..........

We walked on the beach till sunset, then we sang
And the songs we played were a promise of love that'll honor beyond the grave

Oh what a song, learned from the sea taught slowly to the young
Oh what a song, to cast away the rain
Oh what a song, to break the bonds of fear and still the sound
Oh what a song, I believe I can sing again

The family would gather out at grandpa's house.
With supper over and the dishes done
It was then the best time came
At an old upright piano that only grandma played.

She played beautiful dreamer, my wild irish rose;
She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note.
Grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang,
At the old upright piano that only grandma played.

Grandpa was a stubborn man, they said it was his style.
Grandma called him ornery, but she said it with a smile.
Even he could not disguise the love he felt so strong;
We all could see it in his eyes when she played his favorite song.

She played beautiful dreamer, my wild irish rose;
She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note.
Grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang,
At the old upright piano that only grandma played.

I was almost 17 when my grandma died;
I stayed all night with grandpa; the old man never cried.
He sat at her piano, there was nothing we could say
It was the first time in my life I ever heard my grandpa play.

It wasn't beautiful dreamer or my wild irish rose
It was a song he played from memory & he never missed a note
I sat right there beside him until the morning came
What a friend we have in jesus was the only song he played.

She played beautiful dreamer, my wild irish rose;
She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note.
Grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang,
At the old upright piano that only grandma played."

She scratched on the back of a bill
As we climbed past the road to the schoolhouse
On the burnt crust browning pan hill
To where they don't take sad for an answer,
A place at the corner of your heart,
Where music meets with memories,
So you can recognize the feeling from the start

How I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket?

Fan the flames as the beat gets strong

So good that's lasted so long

Well I saw a story in the paper
Suddenly the band's big news
The critics all like our records just fine
But they seem a bit confused

Is it folk or rock or country
Seems like everybody cares but us
So just leave us an early wakeup call
So we don't miss the bus

But my first wife's second marriage blew up

THERE'LL Be a high lit celebration
We'll string colored lights through pine
There'll be a party on the mountain
If you say that you'll be mine

Be a party on the mountain
COLESLAW, pickles; SWEETENED dill
We'll roast ham and turkey
Make purchases from the Still
There'll be A red potato salad,
Deviled eggs and custard pie
There'll be a party on the mountain
If you say that you'll be mine

Women clear the dishes
As the sun was goin' down
Then some ladies suggested
It was time to hit the town
No way Jose, we'll stay
And with the fire glowin', WITH the music groovin'
It's too late for slowin' down

We'll party on the mountain
There'll be dancing on the hill
Our song will reach across the valley
Take a day off from the mill
Be a high lit celebration
We'll string colored lights through pine
There'll be a party on the mountain
If you say that you'll be mine

Be a party on the moutain
If you say that you'll be mine"

The kind of girl you are.
And a smile that covers teardrops,
The way your head yields to your heart.
Of things you've kept inside
That most girls couldn't bear,
Well, I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.

Yes, I've known of all the heartheaches
And I've known of all the pain,
I've seen you when the the sun shines
And I've seen you when it rains.
I've seen you make a look of love
From just an icy stare.
Well, I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.

I know I've been blind,
To not have loved you all this time.
To not have loved you all this time.
But the image of you wasn't clear.
I guess I've been standing too near.

It's taken me a while
But I have finally found
What you are to me
And that's what really counts,
And what you are to me
Is something we can share.
Well, I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.
Yes, I've known you for a long time,

Eyes like the beacons on a rocketship
Just about the bottom of a bottle of gin
She baits her hook and she reels'em in

She's got a black leather jacket, with a patch on the back
No imitation cajun gonna get to that
Got a red bandana and a rose tattoo
She got a mind of her own, nobody tells her what to do

Diamonds, pearls hey hey hey
They're for all the other girls
Some women just don't need'em
You can keep'em

She goes putt putt, that's my queen
Putt putt, on her big machine
Putt putt, when the light turns green
Putt putt, she's so mean
Nothin' can stop my queen of the road

Now if you wanna roll the dice, you can try your luck
She can melt the ice of an ice cream truck
Can't holler uncle, when you've had enough
Her own brother won't fight her, cause the girl's so tough

Devil of an angel, she's a one of a kind
She's got a knucklehead harley and a one track mind
Roadhouse reputation everywhere she goes
As a big sled rider, she's a queen of the road

From Pamona to Daytona, hey hey
And every highway in-between
There's not a one of'em she ain't seen
Wooh you know what I mean

And.. [Chorus:]

Now when the party's over and the lights come on
Don't have to try to find her cause the girl is gone
She slithered into second and away she goes
My motorheaded mama is the queen of the road

It seemed more was never enough
So I called my creditor up
Said ""all I need is that cadillac car,
I'm heading for a brand new start""


I was in way to deep
Straightened out my priorities
I'm a man of simple needs
Just rent, groceries, and gasoline


I got a trailer sturdy and cheap
Hot time, job work when I please
Goin' to mexico next week
Gotta feel that ocean breeze
I might settle down sometime
Right now, it ain't on my mind
Got a pretty girl along for the ride
She's the adventurous kind


I got everything I need
Straightend out my priorities
I'm a man of simple means
Just rent, groceries, and gasoline

Got a full tank and some food to go
Check the map and we'll hit the road
In the flicker of the dashboard lights
I feel my life unwind

I got everything I need

He's riding alone

To touch him or guide him
Turn 'round his head
On the darkest of days

He still sits beside her
Remembers her smiling
Whispers to her
That old song he would play

Please lay down beside me
How I love you

No red river ever ran deeper
Than this old cowboy's love
Than this cowboy's love that runs true"

To the morning, my woman and love

Blue spruce flaming on the grate in the evening
Takes the chill away fine
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same

There's an old red chair by our window
That we found at a sale down the lane
Some old women said they needed more room for the winter
People like to pull out the stuffing when they sit down
So it passes the time
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same

Blow like a bubble on a windy day
Start to flutter when I hear you say
That you feel to good to go away
And you make me feel fine
You've made my world a warmer place
By the sparkle of your diamond face
On a frayed spot, put a little lace
And you make me feel fine
Warm as the mountain sunshine
On the edge of the snowline
In a meadow of columbine

Oh, little jennifer, I'd give a penny for
What you've got on your mind
It seems like most of the time you're lying here dreaming.
Maybe in your vision you've seen how our mission is slightly less than divine
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same

Yep, now rippling waters flow through pipes
In the walls and they're keeping me warm
And the closest I've been tomy family for days is our music
You can silently stare in themorning sky
It's like hearing her calling my name
Cut the telephone line and the story might change"

Get their corn from a jar.

Trapped like a duck in a pen.

Boy at home you should of stayed
Than to follow me and learn the life of looking back
But he'd spit and slap his side
Just to see if he's alive
Then he'd sing his banjo song of Santa Rosa

He said whoa-oh, singing oh Santa Rosa
Whoa-oh, high and low-oh-oo
Then one day, sang ol' Craig,
I'll be free to go my way
And be standing by the bay at Santa Rosa

Now one time late at night
Mickey lit no fire light
Cause he feared the posse close behind might flush us out
But he picked a bit 'fore sleep
To the tune of Cripple Creek
He was murdered by a man from Santa Rosa

And he sang whoa-oh, singing oh Santa Rosa
Whoa-oh, singing oh Santa Rosa

Telling wheter independence runs free/where the weather & independence run free

And that's where I wanna be

In the evening shadow of red butte
Up the lane from the slaughter house bridge
The first cabin the moonlight strikes as it crests the cleft in hunter crick ridge
Up frombetween old red and smuggler
Rising high on a piano bench there
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And what lies between beware
What lies between, beware

And the red sandstone sentinels rising high on either side
As I follow the eagle valley
Through the canyon where the saints reside
In mt snowmasss majesty south

Dark cloud is coming
Headed straight for your heart
Might get just a little bit crazy, baby
Might try to tear us apart

When the storm blows over
Only the strong love remains
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow
We have to stand a little rain

Everybody wants love to be easy
But it's never been that way
Each love starts out with blue skies
Sometimes those blue skies turn grey

When the storm blows over
Only the true love remains
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow
We have to stand a little rain

The thunder rolls
And the lightning strikes
Hold on, darling
It's gonna be alright

'Cause when the storm blows over
I swear my love will remain
If we're ever gonna see a rainbow
We have to stand a little rain

If we're ever gonna see a rainbow
We have to stand a little rain"

Work all winter in the tomboy mine
Dreamin' of what we'll do
When the snow finally ends
And the spring breaks through
We'll load up the wagon & set the little one by our side
Take the gold into telluride

I'd like to lay you down on a cannonball bed
Put a soft feather pillow down by your head
Intertwine flowers into a maiden's veil
Wake you in the morning
Now she's wailing take the gold into telluride

Ain't nothing'll stop an avalanche when it's sliding
Once the wagon starts to roll, you can't turn the mule and the brakes don't hold;
You end up in the valley with the little one by your side
Take the gold into telluride.

Dreams torn from a catalog page.
We may wander where the wind blows
You change your views but our love won't change
She gonna climb you high on top of a hill
Fall asleep laughing with the whipporwill
Intertwined flowers in the matrons ring
Wake you in the morning
Now she's singing take the gold into telluride

I loved my winter with a teenage bride
Dreamin of what we'll do
When the snow finally ends
And the spring breaks through
We'll load up the wagon, set the little one by our side
Take the gold into telluride
Take the gold into telluride"

I left Tennessee very much alive
And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-ridin that Tennessee stud

I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

Chorus:
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

We drifted on down into no man's land
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande
I raced my hoss with the Spaniard's foal
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and the gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

Well I got just as lonesome as a man can be
A-Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue
Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too

We loped right back across Arkansas
I whoop her brother and I whoop her pa
When I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was A-ridin' that Tennessee mare (whoa, boy)

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud

Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide
We came into Big Muddy then we forded a flood
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud

There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor
A little hoss colt playin' 'round the door
I love the girl with golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare (They'se good hosses)

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
And he had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud"

I set out on the narrow way
Many years ago,
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road.
I got lost a time or two,
Wiped my brow, kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you.

Every long-lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were just northern stars,
Pointing me on my way, into your loving arms.
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent
I'd like to find the time I lost and give it back to you.
You just smile and take my hand; you've been there, you understand,
It's all part of a greater plan that is coming true.

Every longlost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were just falling stars,
Pointing me on my way, into your loving arms.
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you"

Always part of everything that's going down
Just looking for another fool to lean upon
In the center ring and everyone's your clown

Lord knows that it ain't for the money
Cause he's broke almost every day,
And it ain't for the fame or the glory
Guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play
Guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play.

He's been in the saddle since he was a kid
The rodeo came but he keeps it well hid
And someday he'll have to set his pony free
But 'til he does he'll be riding the dream.

Lord knows that it ain't for the money,
'cause he's broke almost every day,
And it ain't for the fame or the glory
Guess he'll do it cause he still loves to play;
Guess he'll do it, cause he still loves to play.

We ain't getting no younger and that is the truth
But these games we keep playin, ' they're our fountain of youth.
From boston to boulder and down to orleans
From highlights to lowlife and everything in between

Well I guess we could grow up and quit wearing our jeans
But we still feel like playing and living the dream.

From uncle charlie and his dog teddy, liberty records, c1976

Christopher robin and I walked along,
Under branches lit up by the moon.
Posing our questions to owl and eeyore,
As the days disappeared far too soon.
Now I wandered much further today than I should,
And I can't find my way to the three-acre wood.


So help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at pooh corner by one.
You'll be surprised, there's so much to be done,
Count all the bees in the hive,
Chase all the clouds from the sky,
Back to the days of christopher robin,
And pooh.

Winnie the pooh doesn't know what to do,
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose.
He came to me asking help and advice,
And from here no one knows where he goes.
So I went in to ask of the owl, if he's there,
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear.

So help me if you can I've got to get,
Back to the house at pooh corner by one.
You'll be surprised there's so much to be done,
Count all the bees in the hive,
Chase all the clouds from the sky,

Suitcases and shuffling feet
I found my way to a windo seat
I love to watch the world go by
Made friends with a family
Bound for sault ste marie
They said good bye at sudbury junction
Guess I hated to see 'em go
Thought about 'em as it started to snow
Time stops for nothing or no one

This train keeps rollin along
From here to the great beyond
Black somke, pistons churn
Steel rails, big wheels turn
This train keeps rolling along

Across the endless plrairie land
Mighty buffalo used to stand
The cree and the blackfoot lived and died
?? ? The rockies, nestled in the trees,
I fell in love with lake louise
Smiling with her sparkling emerald eyes

Soon we'll reach the sea
And there I'll stand
With nothing but the blue between me and japan
Now I'm at the end of the line,
Out of track, out of time,
Conductor makes his final round
All the people and places past
They went by just a little too fast
How I wishi could've slowed this engine down.

Steel rails, big wheels turn

Born two rainy day lovers

Of thunder and lightning

Always brings a sparkle to your eye

So many broken dreams
Too many lovers lost

Come on wheels take this boy away.

Chorus:
We're not afraid to ride, 
We're not afraid to die
So come on wheels take me home today
Come on wheels take this boy away.

--- Instrumental ---

When I feel my time here is almost up
And destiny is in my right hand
I will turn to him that made my faith so strong
Come on wheels make this boy a man.

Chorus:
We're not afraid to ride, 
We're not afraid to die
So come on wheels take me home today
Come on wheels take this boy away."

Not a chill wind will blow, disturbing the sky
But there's no peace in me, I'm burning for you
I'm walking the floor in the devil's shoes.

When I get my rewards, I will bring them to you
I shall ask for your love, and swear mine is true
Will you cast me aside, and see me no more?
How can I win your heart when I get my rewards?

They say that your hair can never touch mine
That a poor boy can't hope for a woman so fine
But I work till I fall, determined to win
Driven by need to see you again"

With the blue sky above me and the valley down below.
I want to hold my head up high, and listen to the wind
'cause when it's gone, it won't be back again

I want to sing the kind of songs that my dad sang to me,
And try to be the man he hoped that I would be
He said you only get one chance, you'd better do the best you can,
'cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.

I want to wear my sunday coat, and hold your hand in mine,
And hear you say you'll love me until the end of time.
I want to find forever in every moment that we spend,
'cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.

I want to wear my sunday coat
And hold your hand in mine
And hear you say you'll love me
Until the end of time

I want to stand upon a rock, like I did when I was young,
And hold you close beside me, and watch our children run
'cause you only get one chance to listen to th wind,
And when it's gone, it won't be back again
We only get one chance, so listen to the wind,
Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again."

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtles so bright with the emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in each crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning no words of farewell

Oh he taught me to love him and call me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
How I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected his pale wild wood flower"

On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go

Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Wishing well, time will tell
I can see that there are so many
Lonely faces stare from your pool
And I can't bear to see a fool tonight
So make it right wishing well

Wishing well, could you tell, as I stood beside her
Did you know she would go
Then why did you hide it
If you knew then I'd be without her now
You could have let me know somehow
Can't wish and tell, wishing well

Wishing well, cast a spell, send her love's sweet emotion
Do your part, touch her heart with truest devotion
If there's a chance, I won't believe we're thru
Show me wishes still come true
It's up to you, wishing well

Tried hard to borrow but there was no help
Now I've got nowhere to go.

I need a job for these two hands
I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

One last look at my land
Auctioneer with his gavel in hand
And he says ""it's got to go.""
Worked this peice all my life
It broke my heart and it took my wife
Now I've got nothing to show

I need a job for these two hands
I'm a workin' man
With nowhere to go

Wandered aimless in the city
With my dirt workin' boots and my old straw hat in hand
Singing a song by woody guthrie
This land is your land; it ain't my land
I'm a workin' man, with nowhere to go

I was born to the sunrise
Breaking back all day
Now I've got something to say
I am broke but not broken
And I am not alone
Cause there's a lot of folks
With nowhere to go

Are they ever gonna understand?
You can't leave a workin' man
With nowhere to go.

Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction

For somebody's life is now through

Their soul has been called by the Master
They died in a crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying

And why do we call ourself 'niggaz 4 Life'.
'Cause if we die we still gon' be some dead niggas.

""You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?""
""We haven't spotted them yet.""
""But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity.""

[Mc Ren]
A 100 Miles and Runnin'.
Mc Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck.
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers.
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers.
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past.
Point blank - They can kizz my black azz.
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police"".
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace.
Now it's broken and can't be fixed.
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall.
Runnin' like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all.
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air.
'Cause mc Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'...

""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.""
""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed""
""100 miles to their homebase, Compton.""

[Eazy E]
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear.
So I can tell you why...

[Dr. Dre]
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon.
Runnin' on but never runnin' out.
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out.
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do.
But nobody's pickin' up a nigga Witta Attitude.
Confused...
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose.
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds.
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes.
And Dre is back from the C-P-T.
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees.
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass.
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past.
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick.
Now the fbi's all over my dick.

[Eazy E]
Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock.
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block.
A 100 Miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch.
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch.
Yeah, back to Compton again.
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen.
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time.
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind.
Runnin' like I just don't care.
Compton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there.
Archin' my back and on a straight rough.
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out.
>From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass.
A 100 Miles and Runnin'...

Interlude:

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the fbi has a little message for you:
""Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide.""
Good luck brothers.

[Mc Ren]
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the fbi wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts.
So I'mma run til I can't run no more.
'Cause it's time for mc Ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls.

[Dr. Dre]
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'.
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me.

[Eazy E]
One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!

N.W.A,8 Ball,/n/nwa/8+ball_20097502.html,"Verse One: Eazy E

I don't drink brass monkey  like to be funky
Nickname Eazy E your 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking  to show my shit
Rap a hole in my dick  boy  I don't quit
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
I got a six shooter yo I'm mean and brave
Rolling through the hood to find the boys
Kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers  I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
And I say to myself, ""They can kiss my ass""
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the east side south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

Verse Two: Eazy-E

Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw
Turned down the sound to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tip cause I was drunk
See a sissy ass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigger what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 Ball rolling

Verse Three: Eazy-E

Olde English 800 cause that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can
Drink it like a madman yes I do
Fuck the police and a 502
Stepped in the park I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said, ""Eric your breath smells!""
40 ounce in hand that's what I got
""Yo man you see Eazy hurlin' in the parking lot?""
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your hoe
Asked her to dance and she said, ""Hell No!""
Called her a bitch cause that's the rule
Boyz n tha Hood trying to keep me cool
Tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get on up
I start dodging the dogs and watch you fall
Just dumb full of cumn got knocked out cold
""Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick!
Now your fly bitches all over his dick! ""
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

Verse Four: Eazy-E

Pass the brew mother fucker while I tear shit up
And you all listen up close to roll call
Eazy-E's in the place I got money and juice
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so goddamn funky
Do the Olde 8 fuck the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes, that I say
Hail to the niggas from cia
Crazy D is down and in effect
We make hard core jams so fuck respect
Make a toast all you punks to the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling"

A female with a disease of character and attitude
If you will a snob
However in the view of NWA

A bitch is a bitch
So if I'm poor or rich
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title bitch don't apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in 'em
It's like a disease that plagues their character
Taking the women of America
And it starts with the letter B
It makes a girl like that think she better than me
See, some get mad and some just bear it
But, yo, if the shoe fits wear it
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear that's why
When you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'
Are you the kind that think you're too damn fly?
Bitch eat shit and die
Ice Cube coming at you at a crazy pitch
(Why?) I think a bitch is a bitch

Who the fuck you think you calling a bitch you little sorry motherfucker
I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
Let me tell you one motherfucking thing, I'm not no-

Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money
She look good and the bitch walk funny
She ain't no dummy, she's rather conniving
Yo bitch, fuck what I'm driving
See a young nigga that's striving
You're through without a BMW
That's why a bitch is a bitch I guess
Or either P-M-S

And I bet you dissing niggas is her hobby
And after she finished the test
Grade today of B-I-T-C-H
And watch her get mad cause she know it's true (She know it)
But a nigga like me'll say ""fuck you""
Do like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch (word)
Cause a bitch is a bitch

""Why I gotta be a bitch?""
I ain't call you no bitch, if you listen 
To the goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is
""Fuck the song cause I'm not no motherfucking bitch""
I didn't say you was a bitch, if you stop acting like a goddamn bitch

Fuck you, bitch! You sloppy-ass, scandalous-ass ho!
""Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?""
Fuck you! Suck my dick, bitch!

About who's fucking who and who's getting fat
Look at yourself for me (Look, bitch)
Now do you fall in this category?
Or you the kind that won't blink
Cause you don't think your shit stink
Lucky I haven't had a drink
Cause I'd down your ass
Then I'd clown your ass
Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich
We'll all say ""Fuck you bitch!""
Now what can I do with a ho like you
Bend your ass over and then I'm through
Cause you see Ice Cube ain't taking no shit
(Why?) Cause I think a bitch is a bitch

There you have it, the description of a bitch
Now ask yourself are they talking about you?
Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous, stuck-up
Hair piece contact wearing bitch?
Yep, you probably are

And we on this lay back track
And we doin' this well kinda smooth

Kick it! And so on let the shit flow on
Because I need somethin' to go off on
The mothafuckin' D-are-E servin' a death wish
So I'ma hit you like this
Early in the morning hop into the B-enz
I got 44 wayz of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll up the Compton blocks
To skoop up Ren I heard shots -
1 2 3, Then I see a nigga
Hop in de Benz and it was Ren on the mothafuckin' trigger
He got in the Benz and said
""Dre I was speakin' to your bitch O'shey""
And as we roll on I seen the patrol on creep
So we got ghost because they beat
Me and Ren in de black ce, yo,
Poppin' some funky shit by de D. O. C
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry see
I gotta have it if I'm not paid fully
I start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga'z alwayz into somethin'

I hear a dope beat
Somebody told me that buck did it
But if Dre did'nt do it I can't fuck with it
Nwa is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggaz with big dix
You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit and shit but the killin'
For a nigga labled as bein' - A mothafuckin' Villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
I was so afraid I'd be a mothafuckin' faliure
Real niggaz gotta have top rankin'
I hooked up with 3 more niggaz and started makin' -
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want a conferntation
Real niggaz don't play -
Yella, Eazy, Me and the nigga nigga Dre
Yo, alwayz makin' sure that my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into something

Yeah, the world's most dangerous group
Definetly in this mothafucka
Sendin' a shout-out to all the bitches out there
Yo you can get in the pick up and suck a dick up 'till you hick-up
You know what I'm sayin'
Yo, 'cause I'm a nigga for life
And I realy don't give a fuck
I'm goin' for mine - Every time
I see a fuckin' softy -
Punk strong as coffee
A nigga like that best to back up off me
Yo, 'cause these are the dayz and the times of the real nigga
False niggaz, nwa'z toss' niggaz
And that's on de real 'cause I'm a nigga that killz
Again and again so tell 'em what's up Ren

If I'm not no nothin' I don't feel like
So I grab de 9 n' de clip and go to murder mothafuckaz at night
Because I'm startin' to feel
I'm sittin' in a cell with a crime was too tragic it could'nt make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilizations over and over
Sayin' they told me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause I know my shit is pumpin'

Murder I heard her when she screamed the ""Drop!""
'cause it's on part of slung
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I ride to the rythem of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever thinks that what I say and betray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back 'cause they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggaz they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction -
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young doughter
A whole city of bitches they look sucked up
And the niggaz iz killin' it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayin'z for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction

"" .. you gotta know I'm talkin' to .. ""

The Appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought 'cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm de kamikazi
He took de swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
'cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I'm hittin' like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga they do not mean to understand
I'm from the streets so therefor
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggaz the niggaz the niggaz yo
And after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got A. 38 hittin' down the sleeve
And it's ready to go to work 'cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a milion niggaz and shoot one more
And that's the milion and one
They could'nt hang with the appetite
'cause they was'nt rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up de asses appetite for destruction

""Cops would'nt hurt you, on your ass, man, you know, they realy degrade you,
I suppose you don't believe that shit, don't believe in cops degrade you,
Oh come on, those biddin'z, those people was resistin' arrest""

Check it out yo, in de house yo
So I can show and flow and let the people know

Known as the thief and murderer:
First one -
I'm a be a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected, break your mothafuckin' neck

A crazy-ass nigga that remains hard core
Fifth one -

I pull out my gun that will keep me on the run

N.W.A,Approach To Danger,/n/nwa/approach+to+danger_20097524.html,"Eazy:
What you want is an unexpected approach,
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence,
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted.

Approach to danger, don't move;
It's hard to predict what will happen next.
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy.

Ren:
You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking,
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinking.
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge,
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge.
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme,
They're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream.
One vision was of life, the other was death,
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath.
So you burn in my pit that I call hell,
Where you got send because your shit don't sell.
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke,
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke.
I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em,
Do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em.
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger,
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger.

Eazy:
If you can be seen, you can be hit.
If you can be hit, you can be killed.
(He's on the line! Shoot him!)

Dre:
Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler,
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.
With everybody thinking of death I kept working,
To be one of the last niggaz left.
So many people looking for hope, they're broke,
Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.
A heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me,
So figuring to see the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetary,
So it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing,
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off,
And starts killing motherfuckers,
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga,
When I approach to danger

Approach the motherfucking danger,
Come back to hell and send me some time... (this is it y'all)

Eazy:
Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,
Another dead body and you wanna keep running.
But even the rain turns black,
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.
No prison, nobody makes bail,
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.
Think about death, taking your last breath,
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,
Even though they wanna make a crime.
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,
Because it will release the fucking police.
Fuck 'em, I approach to danger,
Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up.
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye,
Cause in the long run... (we'll all die)"

Just thought that I had to be in compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front 'nback, and side to side
Then I let the alpine play
Bumpinnew shit by nwa
It was ""gangsta gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this:

Cruisin' down the street in my 6 4
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the ho's
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh el camino rollinkilo g
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that gta

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

[]

Dolla b'z in the place to give me the pace
He said my man jb is on freebase
The boy jb was a friend of mine
'till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly mothafucka pull out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gage
One sucker dead, L. A. Times front page

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

[]

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there - makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6 4 impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin'
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho'
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

[]

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the 6 4 'round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I see the g ride
Now kat is drivin' kilo on the side
As they busted a you they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green nova
Kat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in his head for rippin' his guess
Now g is caught for doin' the crime
For the fence on the boy, he'll do some time

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

[]

I went to get the mouth but there was no bail
The fellows start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo g on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six years sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo g looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came suzi

The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'

She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget
Of course i had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling
I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King
Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip
And asked the DOC do you mind if i nibble this
No, i took her to the back of the studio
And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio
I told the bitch yo please don't bite me
Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
So i slapped the bitch for goin out like a sucker
My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker
To make her stop i pulled up on her extentions
And i left Jimmy standing at attention
The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner
Now i look back on the day I should have peed on her

-Chorus-
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was  a girl that i screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

So you know bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC
And you know i'm still out to get the pussy
Tried to be nice cuz i didn't wanna diss her
Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler
Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee
Then i could tell that she wanted to fuck me
She said Lets skip dinner and i had a fit
At ten dollars a plate i said fuck that shit
Thats the whole reason our relationship was stormy
Why cuz Bridgette was too fuckin horny
She said please excuse me for a minute
To powder my nose i said ya i'm with it
She took a long time the food came and i'm chewin
Thinkin to myself what the fuck is she doin?
Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin
Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin
Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang
But i flipped cuz it was Bridgette gettin gang-banged

-Chorus-
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was  a girl that i screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

So you know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She says she wants to come over and see me
And do any thing to fuck the DOC
She said she loves me but i didn't say i love her
Went to the store and bought me some rubbers
Then i made a phone call up to the guys
Boy this bitch is in for a big suprise
When she came in i put on a stone record
Said a few lines and the bitch got naked
Later on the bed i told her to suck my dick
And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet
Turned her ass over layed the ho on her back
Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin Amtrak
Dre had the back and Easy had the front
I'm behind Ice Cube cuz thats where the line started
Bitch gettin dogged bye the DOC and NWA
Dogged the bitch out in each in every way
Thats what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette
The dumb ass ho she liked the shit

(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was  a girl that i screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz

N.W.A,College Girls Are Easy,/n/nwa/college+girls+are+easy_20609430.html,"Chorus------Anywhere I go a fly girl will please me
East to west college girls are easy

This story's kinda funny
It's one about the hunnies
Now Debbi was the girl who used to do it like a bunny

And how about Mona?
Her hips was like a mota
I heard she likes to do it in the back of a Toyota

And then there was Amy
Now how can you blame me
She wanted it so bad she offered to pay me

And Vicki gettin Weazy
Both a bit sleezy
Cause all college girls are just to easy

[Chorus:]
Anywhere I go a fly girl will please me
East to west college girls are easy
Anywhere I go a fly girl will please me
East to west college girls are easy

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days a week the college girls be beggin
To get a guy that sexually performs
So whenever I get horny I go to the dorm

Went to the dorm sunday around midnight
I saw a hunny and she gave me an invite
To her room and said that she had been scopin
Me in english class and now she was hopin
Just to talk (yeah right) but now instead
Since we was alone she'd rather get me into bed
I nibbled on her ear and said I hope your in condition
Then she got down in a yoga like position
Took off her clothes and said her name was Dianna
Her chest was bigger than the state of Indiana
She said let's get busy, I don't want to lose ya
And needless to say I knocked it like a Hoosa

Chorus

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursay, Friday and weekends
That's when I'm hangin out with my friends
Why just the other night lookin for a party we
Went to the house of some girls in a sorority
The music was live and the party was a rock-up
Not all the girls were cute but they all had big knockers
Well I was just scopin and hopin and glancin
At the college hunnies on the dance floor dancin
That's when I saw the cutie (cutie)
With the little booty (booty)
I introduced myself as Jeff she said her name was Judy
I knew that she adored me but my friends warned me
Judy was the type of girl that's wild and horny

Poppin' that shit, get the fuck out my face
Knowin' that they never even seen the place
Claimin' my city is my city they claim
Mothafuckaz we're about to put some salt in your game..

Yeah I'm tired of these mothafuckerz runnin' around town, talkin' about
They're from Compton and shit, tryin' to get on the bandwagon..

Talkin' about..

What do you call A crew that can rap like that...?
Yo nwa call 'em mothafuckaz wack..

With a fucked up style and a fucked up show
Hey yo Ren, what about the scratchin', is it def?
Fuck no!

Won't you tell 'em what your name iz?

[Mc Ren]

Mc Ren is the mothafuckin' Coroner
I'm gettin' rid of mothafuckaz as if they was a foreigner
Show no crip to pretend when I'm seen
I punch you can block it but I'm a still get in
This ain't a tk yo in the first
But it's some shit from a nigga in black it's much worse
Then a beat from Tyson 'cause Ren is not nice and
Your ass is better off just rollin' a dice and
Findin' you a number for luck
'cause you all need it when you see I don't give a fuck
My identity, and the shit is gettin' shown
Without a video I'm still gettin' on
I'm at a show then my picture is takin'
One click of the flash and punk niggaz are breakin'
To the door, tryin' to join my fan club
Lipstickin' over one of my dubs
And it's the minimal scratch for the moment
Until I fuck up the so called opponet
That's standing in the zone of the twilight
Sayin' how in de fuck did he get mixed up in my fight
It was'nt a mistake, it was a set-up
So until I'm finished poppin' my lyrics you should shut up
And don't attempt to speak
Because it's bad enough you rollin' up shit quick
With a nigga like Ren about the hit
Now lemme hear you mothafuckaz talk some more shit
I'm a bust your ass in your mouth,
Yo, unless you're sayin' ""Compton's in de house""

[Dr. Dre]

Who realy cares - about a sucker on a take off
Bust de move, we can have a shake n' bake-off
Me and you can go 'cause I don't care yo
Rap fight or guerilla warfare
We can rumble, 'cause when my lungs go in and out
I kick rhymes in a bundle to win about
Or scarier scaffle
I just muffle the eye position, there's no competition
Let 'em know that Dre is gettin' stronger
Compton's in de house but now it's some' longer
I won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up
You can say uncle and I still won't let up
'cause Dre is the mothafuckin' doctor
And if me and Ren's on the mike it's like propaganda, no doubt
""Boy you should've known by now""..

Compton's in the house
Yeah, it's time to put Compton on de map, don't ever think you can get it on

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit;
""Dopeman, please, can I have another hit?""
The dopeman said: ""Cluck, I don't give a shit;
If your girl kneels down, and sucks my dick!""
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her;
Nigga living in cash, ain't nothing but a smoker.
That's the way it goes, that's the name of the game;
Young brother getting over by slangin' caine.
Gold around his neck 14 k, has it;
Bitches sucking on his dick, 24-7.
Plus he's makin' money keepin' the base heads waiting;
Rollin 6-4 with the fresh-ass daytons.
Livin' in Compton, California, ca
His Uzi up your ass if he don't get paid.
Nigga begging for credit, he's knockin' out teeth;
Clockin' much dollars on the 1st and 15th kay shizze is a real fuckin g
Big lot of money, nothing less than a twenty;
Yo, you want a five-oh, the dopeman got plenty.
To be a dopeman, boy, you must qualify;
Don't get high, off your own supply!
From a kid to a G, it's all about money;
10-piece, 4-10, base pipe comes free.
If people out there ain't hip to the fact;
If you see somebody gettin' money 4 crack,
He's the

Wait a minute, wait a minute! Who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am? Man, I can't believe this shit.
This bitch is tryin' to gank me!
I'll slap you up side your head with 9 inches of limp dick!

Verse Two: (Ice Cube)
You need a nigga with money, so you get a dopeman;
Juice that fool for as much as you can.
She likes his car, and he gets with her;
Got a black-eye coz the dopeman hit her.
Let that slide, and you pay it no mind;
Find that he's slapping you, all the time!
But that's ok, coz he's so rich,
And you ain't nothin' but a dopeman's bitch.
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut;
Poppin' that trash might get you fucked up!
You'll sit and cry if the dopeman strikes you;
He don't give a fuck, he got 2 just like you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life;
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife.
She's called 'The Strawberry' and everybody know;
""Strawberry! Strawberry! Is the neighbourhood hoe.""
Do anything for a hit or two;
Give the bitch a rock and she'll fuck your whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick;
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick.
Strawberry, just look you'll see her;
But don't fuck around, she'll give you gonnorhea.
If people out there ain't hip to the fact;
Strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack to the,

Verse Three: (Ice Cube)
If ya smoke 'caine, you're a stupid motherfucker;
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucka.
Doin' that crack with all the money ya got;
On ya hands & knees, searching for a piece of rock.
Jonzing for a hit, now ya lookin' for more.
Doug stole a Alpine outta Eazy's 6-4.
Ya need ya ass whooped coz it's outta this Earth;
Can't get a 10-piece, need a dollar fifty's worth.
Knucklehead nigga, you turned into a crook;
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked.
You beat ya friend up and you whooped his ass long;
Coz he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone!
You robbin' and stealin', bugging and illin';
While the dopeman's dealing.
What is killin' your pain? Cocaine? This shit's insane;
Yo, E, she's a berry, lets run a train!

Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch!

Me neither, hoe go home and wash out ya beaver;
And nigga's are out there, messing up people's health;

Well, I'm the dopeman, yeah boy wear corduroy;
Money up to here, but unemployed.
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket's getting bigger;

Yeah, high rollin', big money, I'm foldin;

Strong strawberry, jockin' me so early;
Hoe, ya wanna hit? Ya gotta get your knees dirty.
Well that's my life, that's how it's cut;
""Hey Dopeman!"" bitch shut the fuck up!
Gotta make a run, it's a big money deal;
Gankers got the fake, but you can get the real,
From the...

Chorus:

Yo, Mr. Dopeman, you think your slick;
Ya sold crack to my sister, and now she's sick.

But scared to kick reality.
Yo Dre, you've been doing all this dope producing.
You had a chance to show 'em what time it is...
So, what you want me to do?
Express Yourself...

I'm expressin' with my full capabilities,
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities,
Cause some don't agree with how I do this.
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flava, my behaviour is hereditary,
But my technique is very necessary.
Blame it on Ice Cube... Because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate.
Add it on a dope beat
And that'll make you think.
Some suckaz just tickle me pink
To my stomach. 'Cause they don't flow like this one.
You know what? I won't hesitate to this one
Or two before I'm through.
So don't try to sing this!
Some drop science
Well I'm droppin' English.
Even if Yella
Makes it a-capella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or assess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage
Nuthin'
But makin' a sucker and you equal.
Don't be another sequel...

Come on and do it...

Ice Cube, is not for the pop chart
So where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself
My boy'll show you how
Yo Dre
What Up?
Drop English Right about
Now, gettin' back to the pg.
That's program, and it's easy.
Dre is back. Newjacks, I mean hollow,
Expressin' ain't their subject
Because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend,
The records I spin.
Again and again and again
Yo, you on the other end.
Watch a brother playin' dope rhymes with no help.
There's no fessin' and guessin'
While I'm expressin' myself.
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be. But not me!
Ruthless...
Is the way to go
They know.
Others say rhymes that fail
To be original.
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts,
Forget about the ghetto
And rap for the pop charts.
Some musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity
When up on the microphone.
Yeah, they want reality.
But you won't hear none.
They rather exaggerate, a little fiction.
Some say no to drugs and take a stand,
But after the show they go lookin' for the dopeman.
Or they ban my group from the radio.
Hear nwa and say ""Hell no!"".
But you know it ain't all about wealth.
As long as you make a note to...

Express Yourself...
Express Yourself...
Come on and do it...

Express Yourself...
Express Yourself...
Come on and do it...

A lyricist
Yo Dre is the name for that makes somethin' dope on a record
That's what he came for
Kickin reality understand himself but it's important that you keep it in mind to...
Express Yourself...
From the heart.
Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it.
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise.
Full of rigor mortis.
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo.
Or a lesson - all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin' -
I got a Smith and Wesson
For you.
I might ignore your record
Because it has no bottom.
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical.
Doin' the job
Nwa is the lynch mob!
It's so macabre
But you know you need this.
And the knowledge is growin'
Just like a fetus, or a tumor.
But here's the rumor:
Dre is in the neighborhood
And he's up to no good.
When I start expressin' myself,
Yella, slam it!
Cause If I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage.
Or I'mma be too hyped,
And need a straight jacket.
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it.
So, when you see Dre, a dj on the mic,
Ask what it's like.
It's like we gettin' hyped tonight.
Cause if I strike
It ain't for your good health.
But I won't strike if you just...

As I tell you a tale bout this big fat pimple
I was chillin on the ave, drinkin some booze
Saw a fatty comin my way, so what was I to do?
I busted a you, went tha other way again
But forgot that tha Avenue was a dead end
I turned around, here she came, stride for stride
Funky fat like that, bout two thirty-five
Stampede was rushin, I double looked
And she had more chins than a chinese phonebook
Five four three ugly as can be, she said

Hello Eazy E. Do you remember me? (I said no)
Huhu yes you do suga
My name is Bertha but you can call me booga
Remember the time when you were drunk at a party

Oh my God got a fat girl on my jock

She gave me tha grin, I showed tha frown
And with a bare hug picked me off tha ground
Squeezion me tight, atttempted to bug me
Grabbed me by tha rear, said [Love me, hug me!]
I was hell, victim of a scandal
Coz this girl's too much for E to handle
Broke tha bee's grip, started to run
Back to tha crib, grabbed tha elephant gun
She's grubbin, thighs rubbin in a hot pursuit
I loaded up tha gun bout ready to shoot
She kept on comin because of addiction
Legs on fire because of friction
My gun broke, now I was doomed
Dropped tha double barrel, grabbed tha harpoon
As I swung, tha fat girl fell
Lyin on tha ave just like a beach whale
That's tha story, it's quite ill
And all fat girls y'all besta chill
All overweight freaks stay off my block
Cause it's eerie to have a fat girl on your jock

I smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her
That's the kind of nigga that you're listenin' to
Talk to you for a minute get my dick in you.. Yo
Now every single bitch got A price to pay
Up on the dicks of N. W. A

I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D. O'
Yo, I take a ho' to the hotel
To the motel
To the holiday inn [say what??!]
If that bitch start fuckin' up, yo
I'll just fuck her friend...

Now M. C. Ren [what up] my mellow [a check it out] it's on you so what
The fuck you're gonna do?

Now gather 'round yo
And check it out yo
And all the bitches come and suck up all my balls yo
And take a ticket to play with it like a slicky
So put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie
And you swallow all the nut
If you bitches are smart
To make my dick pop up like a pop-tart
But after I nut I might leave you
But first I must decieve you, because bitch I don't need you
And don't say that you love me too
'Cause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew
You're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'
So I have to let you know..

At a hotel
And a motel
And a holiday inn [say what??!]
Because if that bitch starts fuckin' up yo, I'll just fuck her friend"
N.W.A,Fuck Tha Police,/n/nwa/fuck+tha+police_21133569.html,"[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

[Hook]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

Fuck tha police!"

Here's a little somethin' bout a nigga like me
Never shoulda been let out the penititary
Ice Cube would like ta say
That I'm a crazy mutha fucka from around the way
Since I was a youth  I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mutha fucka that ya read about
Takin' a life or two
That's what the hell I do  you don't like how I'm livin
Well fuck you!
This is a gang  and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left you're toothless
And then you say goddamn they ruthless!
Everwhere we go they say [damn!]
N W A's fuckin' up tha program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeah!
To drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mutha fuckin role model?
To a kid lookin' up ta me
Life ain't nothin but bitches and money.
Cause I'm tha type o' nigga that's built ta last
If ya fuck wit me I'll put a foot in ya ass
See I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin

Chorus:

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
""It's not about a salary, it's all about reality"" - krs One
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
""Hopin you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say""

Verse Two: Ice Cube

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggaz start breakin out
Cause you know, they know whassup
So we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin
""I got a boyfriend"" bitch stop lyin
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nuttin but a dyke
Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like
Walked over to em, and said, ""Whassup?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit em in the jaw
Ren started stompin em, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said, ""Let's start some shit!""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin niggaz out with a flurry of buckshots
Boom boom boom, yeah I was gunnin
And then you look, all you see is niggaz runnin
And fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin
And cussin, I stepped back, and I kept bustin
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N. W. A. Is wanted for a homicide
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

Chorus:

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
""He'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a fuckin thing back""

Verse Three: Ice Cube

Homies all standin around, just hangin
Some dope-dealin, some gang-bangin
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared, and hit the gas
Right then, I knew I has to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With six niggaz in a car are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin
We all said ""Fuck you bitch!"" and kept goin
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nuttin at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but I won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

Interlude: Ice Cube, Dr. Dre

[Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit]
{Man whatcha gonna do now?}
""What we're gonna do right here is go way back""
[How far you goin back?]
""Way back""
""As we go a lil somethin like this"" - Slick Rick

Here's a lil gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy E cold runnin shit

Verse Four: Eazy E, mc Ren

Well I'm Eazy E the one they're talkin about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
Wit the ""Diamond in the back, sun-roof top""
Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin to you
""We want to fuck you Eazy!"" I want to fuck you too
Cause you see, I don't really take no shit
[So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin with]

N.W.A,I Ain't Tha One,/n/nwa/i+aint+tha+one_20097484.html,"Intro: girl, Ice Cube

[Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get
my hair done?] How short's your hair right now?
[Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails
done too] Look, I'ma tell you like this

Verse One:

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin?""
See I'm only down for screwin, but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slippin, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're gettin their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messin with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't the one

Interlude One:

[Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money
you can honey.  Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't
do nothin for me but get out of my face.]

[I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin right jumpin off
unless he got dollars]

Verse Two:

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's gettin juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
Cause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out
Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster huh?  I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done...
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

Interlude Two:

[I don't care how they look if they got money,
we can hook up but they ain't gettin none.]

[Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some,
play up they mind a lil bit, and get that money.]

[Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?]

Verse Three:

Give you money why bother
Cause you know I'm lookin nothin like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave em and love and stay above em
I used to get no play now she stay behind me
Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used
But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it
Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

Outro:

[But you said you love me!]
I don't see no rings on this finger
[Why you doin me like this?  I love you!]
Yeah you love my money, I got what I wanted -- beat it"

Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage
So whenever I'm steppin cover your head like an ostrich
Groupies been waitin for this, suckers been hatin for this
You know why? Because so many are relatin to this
Jealous is how they feel it intentionally
But they start to love it becoz I made it eventually
Pumpin the music I keep the music like pumpin
Coz Ren ain't in here for nuthin, I keep the average crowd jumpin
Yo, you know the color, the villain's in black
Always down to make noise, and attack
So you better get back unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
You're screamin with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin
You're wakin up in a sweat coz Ren is givin bad dreams and
I'm not schemin, I'm just tellin the facts
That's how it is when N. W. A. Starts to jack
So brothers that wanna scrap with me
That sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me
Especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
Coz when it comes to Ren there's no comparison
And if you try to be me, it's quite embarassin
But I understand coz you're mentally slow
Coz I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go

If it aint' ruff it ain't me (scratch)
[Tha gangsta's black and he's about to attack]
If it ain't ruff it ain't me (scratch)
Lemme bust a freestyle here [Allright then]

I can tell that you're afraid to fight me
Simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
Becoz you're sweat as a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat
I'm a threath, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that calls acne
It's ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Until ya A G-A-T that's known as a flow
I'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin
Like, see, I'm hatin the fakin I keep the suckers like shakin
Scared to speak with a tongue and they're chozen
The sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen
This is a battle to the death, it's like the [?? Same ol'??]
Against a brother on a tip, with [??]
Givin a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin
But I'm comparin and tearin'em but I'm makin a livin
With the hype of a 9 Volt battery
And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
Meanin I'm a flow
I'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go

If it ain't ruff it ain't me [Yo Ren]
[Tha gangsta's black and he's about to attack]
If it ain't ruff it ain't me
[Man whatcha gonna do now?] [get funky]

The 'do not disturb' sign is in effect
While I'm thinkin of a fool to select
To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
Slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell'em they're guilty, and beep out the bailer
And get a new track o' drums so I can play with
Percussion; pumpin it loud when I perform
Yo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform
It ain't a rule in the book you have to go by
Hey, coz when it comes to cheatin yo you should know I
For fear in the hearts coz it's the hearts full of fear
Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
The hump was incredible yo but Ren he was super
But now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper
But a soldier with a top rankin
Givin dope material, the hell with the gankin
So play like an airplane and just jet
And keep your blood pressure low coz I'm a [??], if not
I'm afraid of the show
That you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go

If it ain't ruff it ain't me [Yo Ren]
[The gangsta's black and he's about to attack]
If it ain't ruff it ain't me [Yo Ren]

N.W.A,Just Don't Bite It,/n/nwa/just+dont+bite+it_20097486.html,"Homeboy:  godamn, now lick my balls, oh shit.
Bitch:    You like that?
Homeboy:  Put 'em off
Bitch:    It's good?
Homeboy:  Ouch, shit, godamn bitch you bit' my damn, shit I said suck the
Mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!
Narrator: Has this ever happend to you?
Does her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?
Does she know how to suck a dick?
Well, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and buy
Nwa's new book entitled ""The art of sucking dick"".
Bitch:    Lesson 1 - First you grab the dick, next you gently lick it up
And down, then insert it into the mouth. Take it slow, don't rush
It, and before you know it..
Splash!

Eazy E:

It goes one for the treble, two for the bass, She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it...

Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow
As I produce and illustrate you to a ho'
Cought on the late night, Stampin' on the base-pipe
She's a hype to get you on the late flight
But back in school she was a cutie, yo
Then after graduation started givin' up the booty
In school, stuck her head in a feather
Every time I asked her what's the time
It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'
I wanted a date, she would'nt even be my friend
But now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me
'cause she's got a gang o' kidz knuckle-heads and all dirty
And she's givin' pimp by a nigga that's 30
I saw her hangin' in the alley
Raggin' to her friends how she's ho'in' in de valley
All by herself, doin' on the whole strole
Commin' back home late night with the bankrob
You know a bitch like that makes me sick,
But I've heard that she sucks a good dick

Chorus:
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]

At a high school dance -
Me and the niggaz bailed in
I saw her sittin' with her friends, With the clan,
So s***, thought she was all that
She would'nt even look it up because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doorz
On the streets she's a late night feature
Walkin' home from school saw her suckin' a nigga'z dick, another bleacher
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut could'nt escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw her
There was'nt a nigga on the block
Late at night not gettin' done
So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course 'cause my dick you it's harder than a telepole
Then again it don't concern me
'cause there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot de ho'
I mean checkin' with de quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from gettin' sick -
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick

Chorus:
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]

Now I was at a club on a late late sunday
Peepin' at the bitches 'till the next day monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch who lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I locked her
She was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up
Back at the house she was bitch n' be ignorin'
And when she start to talk the ho' was kinda borin'
Yo, but now I got to dawn, see
Now she's dancin' on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shakin' that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans -
Just while I'm a take her to a room
But yo I mean a rest room
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grabbed her hand and she's with it
Oh and when she turned sobber should'nt have had admit it
So while she's dropped I'd better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick..

Chorus:
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
Lick de big dick, baby, I wanna fuck this one
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it
""So there you have it - a job well done, but for now let me get back to what
I was doing""
She swallowed it.. She swallowed it..
Get it all baby, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy
Suck this diiiiiick
Oh, she swallowed it.. Get it all, suck this dick for daddy..

Hey mothafuck, I want you to suck Dre's dick,
Then I want you to suck Yella dick
You already sucked Ren's dick..

You boyz are disgusting!
Just suck my dick bitch"

""Lose Yourself""
*8 Mile Soundtrack out now

Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted...One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo...

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that is he? No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

HOOK:

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

HOOK

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not, this maybe the only opportunity that I got

Here's what they think about you!

Hello? I was at celebreality, and I was wonderin'
How that punk Ice Cube got his ass beat by ATL!

Yo! Dat nigga was sayin' he from Compton, he ain't from Compton
He from a planet called: ""Punk!"" It is full of pussy protein and pearl tongue

All I wanna know is why y'all let his punk-ass in the group in the first place
when you knew what kinda bitch he was?

Yeah, I was in the New Music Seminar in New York!
And I watched that punk muthafucka run

N.W.A,Natural Born Killaz,/n/nwa/natural+born+killaz_20815155.html,"Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind state with a heart full of terror
I see the Devil in the mirror, buck, buck, lights out
'Cause when I get my sawed off, niggaz get hauled off

Barrel one touches your motherfuckin' flesh
Barrel two shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec 9, so if you try to wreck mine, fool
It's your bad time

Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infrared aimed at your head like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitatin', I ain't hesitatin' to put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome

I'm hot like lava, you got a problem?
I got a problem solver and his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag and you’re frozen inside a body bag

Nobody iller than this graveyard filler
Cap peeler 'cause I'm a natural born killa
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma 'cause I scare her

I'm quick to blast, motherfucker
(Yeah, what's up?)
It feels like I'm bustin' a nut when I open you up
'Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss

'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb ass raps to make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep 'cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose

Ain't seen the sun in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever, ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre like A. C. Is down with O. J.

So fuck how you're livin'
I'm the unforgivin' psycho drivin' murdera
It's authentic, don't panic, I can't stand it, goddamn it
Schizophrenic, so fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick and I'm dancin'

Mass murderer, natural born killa
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna, I don't wanna die

I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine

'Cause motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold and they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain, migraine headache
I can hear his bones break

He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'ma pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal just like Nirvana

Tic, toc, toc, tic, toc, tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keepin' niggaz in order, makin' their life shorter
Ready to slaughter 'cause, to me, a life ain't worth a quarter

Or a dime, mushroom's got my mind hallucinatin'
Ain't no debatin', I'm creatin' an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scot free, so don't even think about tryin' to stop me
'Cause I can't wait, I'm out the gate on the for realla
A thrilla or a natural born killa

Gigi, gigi, gaga, they call me 'Dada'
6 million ways to murder, choose one, lose one
Soul bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggaz goin' bump in the night

Should I peel her, should I kill her?
Am I iller than a natural born killa?
Should I peel her, should I kill her?
Am I iller than a natural born killa?
Should I peel her, should I kill her?
Am I iller than a natural born killa?"

Well it's because motherfuckers want to blast me
And run me outa my neighborhood
They label me as a dope dealer
Yo! And say that I'm no good
But I can't find jobs so niggers wouldn't have to go out
Gave up some dope on the corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A fifteen year old black kid will go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest

Why do I call myself a niggaare, you ask me?
I guess it's the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin a job was murder
Fuck flippin burgers
'Cause a deserve a nine-to-five I can be proud of
That I can speak loud of
And to help a niggaare get out of.
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin paid like a mother fucker
A young brother who don't give a fuck about another

Why do I call myself a niggaare, you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get faced down in the street
They throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President

Why do I call myself a niggaare, you ask me?
Because my mouth is so mother fuckin nasty
Bitch this, bitch that
Niggaare this, niggaare that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin fat
Gettin paid to say this shit here
Makin more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So, why not call myself a niggaare?
It's better than pulling the trigger and goin up the river
And don't I get called a niggaare anyway?
Booked as a motherfucker and locked away
So... So, cut out all that bull shit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life

Niggaare. Niggaare
Niggaare, please
I'm treated like a fuckin disease.
You say: why can I call myself a niggaare so quick?
Cause I can reach in my draws and pull out a bigger dick
Yo! Niggers say niggaare we cool
But, cracker say niggaare not to fuck up
But I got to be a fast niggaare
Not to be the last niggaare
Or I have to beat your ass, niggaare
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later
In a verse I curse
Because I [?] with this to keep my shit straight bumpin'
Murder created by the streets of Compton
I get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it
Because I know it
And if you think I'm fucking your wife
Your mother fuckin' right
Yo! Because I'm a niggaare for Life

Niggaare, this
Niggaare, that
The actual fact is that I'm black
And bound to attract
The attention of another
I mean the other
But I'm a mother fucker that'll have them running for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothing
Except getting paid, getting bitches, and [?] with stitches
Which is all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say
The nigger's here to stay
But what about the fake niggers, the house niggers
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But nwa is outta your mother fuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a mother fuckin' thing

I call myself a niggaare 'cause my skin won't whiten
I call myself a niggaare 'cause the shit that I'm writing
Hypes me, hypes other mother fuckers around me
And that's the reason why they want to surround me
And ask me: why do I call myself a niggaare-o
Ain't none of their fuckin' business 'cause I'll let the trigger go
So get out of my presence, and get out of my sight
'Cause mc Ren is a niggaare for Life

You're a niggaare 'til you die
If you're a poor niggaare, then you're a poor niggaare
If you're a rich niggaare, you're a rich niggaare

I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucker whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest she was a hooker
So I took her, a 100 yards, to the blvd
I told her ""I'll take care o' you, you take care o' me""
You've gott a P I M P and all I want is the money
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin' yo
She had the biggest ass that you ever seen

All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vikky concerned me
Her husband was the District Auterny
So, before he found out he was crossed up
'Bout his bitch I was fuckin' I had to tossed her
And put you slick, some nigga never forget
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about

'Cause I said ""fuck it""
Loped and Choked and Smoked to the ho' like this :
""Bitch, it's all about Dre
 The money money money and this all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me
And remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
'Cause niggas knew that she was someone
A little later though she called 1
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done?
So what?
One less bitch you gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out

Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the motherfucking trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with sea net shoes
I knew my money was comin' up sho'
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get cought
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with the other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like the mother ho's
I told the 2 motherfuckers to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a 9 so they couldn't refuse
I shot the nigga he was outa there
And tied the bitch to the Muthafuckin' chair

Money hungry scandlist groopy ho's that's always riding on a nigga's dick.
Always in a nigga's pocket and when the nigga runs out of money

I use to see 'em on stage
Earnin money like a thief, but without a guage
Until I got full, of clockin the lame gettin pull
(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)
Nah that's bullshit!  They like it stylistic
And I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashin, when I'm in action
A photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion
Pure simplicity, see it's elementary
You hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
Parental discretion is advised

[Mc Ren]
Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous
Some shit I don't take it, not even in a toliet
And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe, the motherfuckers will learn
I'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince, cause I'm a principal
I'm engineerin; the shit that you're hearin
Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steerin
Silly you say, I say you're silly when you say it
Rushin to the eject, to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not givin a fuck, while I'm damagin ya
It's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'll win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised

[Ice Cube]
I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see, read it in braile
It'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex
Of a genius, my rapid-stutter-steppin if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But if played, made the grade or high-top fade
It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guess it was a test of a different style
It's just another motherfucker on the pile
Drivin your ass with the flow of your tongue
You hung yourself short, the after-knowledge was brung
To your attention, by the hardest motherfuckin artist
That is know for lynchin any sucker in a minute
Stagger 'em all
When I start flowin like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must

[Eazy-E]
Little did they know, that I would be arrivin
And it's surprisin, rockin it from where I been
But it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made
In the trade where funky ass records are bein played
Fuck the regular, yo as I get better the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get 'em hot, thinkin they're gonna get it
As they sit, rubbin their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny, but
There's no service of beef, without money
So slip the C-note, and you can choke
On a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay; to me ain't shit
When you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick
Of the Eaze, if you can deal with the size
But if you can't, parental discretion's advised! {*echoes*}

{*bass guitar and piano solo for a minute*}

N.W.A,Prelude,/n/nwa/prelude_20097532.html,"Dre:
The motherfucking saga continues...

All of you who don't believe in the real gangsta shit,
Cause when it comes to the real niggaz,
It makes the shit they're much harder to deal with.

Yeah, above the laws in this motherfucker,
Like Mafia for life, down with the real niggaz 4 life.
Ha-ha, yo sweet-talk, tell 'em what the fuck we're here for...

Well I write ya, use, Compton, Watts, The Wood,
All across the motherfucking usa.
They know I'm walking through the valley of real niggaz,
I should fear no man on the motherfucking planet, hit me one.
Cause I've been to the mountain top y'all,
And I have been seeing through the eyes of a real nigga.

Yo, what you think about the real niggaz 187?

Yo, they make some of the coooooolest shit I had never heard,

Yo, when we came, G, I almost gave it up,
To the ruthless motherfucking gangstas.
Fear no man...

... Because you're shit man yourself,
Time to put the world at yourself man.
Me not seeing bobba-clot mobbing to see a pussy-clot run,
Bob-bob-bob-bob-bob, keep Babylon on the run, see...

Ren:
The real niggaz is back, cause there's to many bullshit records out,
Niggaz beat it for what we put out.
But you don't have to wait no longer,
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger.
So many groups made three albums or more,
And their weak-ass shit is still sitting in the record-store.
They wonder why it never sold,
Niggaz rapping since the seventies and still never went gold.
Our first record sold two million copies,
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy.
You came out the streets and crossed over,
And after that your career is fucking over.
Because after that you're not around,
So shut the fuck up, and witness the sound of some real niggaz.

Eazy:
Yeah, motherfucker.
Keeping all you busters on the run in ninety-one, kick that shit Ren.

Ren:
Most niggaz can't understand,
And never will if they ain't part of the ruthless Mafia-clan.
Niggaz is dedicated to the streets,
With hyped fucking lyrics and a dope ass beat.
The songs will never come soft, because I come off,
So don't get in my way or motherfucker you'll be cut off.
And it's something you can move your lips to,
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you.
And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K,
All day that's with no play.
Cause ain't no rap group out, that I know,
That makes me wanna listen to the radio.
All I hear is motherfuckers trying to make a comeback with lovesongs,
And that shit is whack.
And that's why your ass ain't around,
Cause you don't have the motherfucking sound of a real nigga."

[eazy e:] yo ren!
[mc ren:] whassup?
[eazy e: take] [one] [mc ren: yo] [hit it]

[mc ren:]
Ruthless, plenty of that and much more
So at the party, ren is controllin the floor
That you step and do your danceroutine
It aint a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene
With a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back
[ruthless gangsta] cold killin
You wanna know what it's means? [definition... Villain]
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin
And a look that keeps you all starin
And wondering why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts while I'm constructin the ground
That makes yall move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a dyin
[dr. Dre: yo ren, tellem what they do when you start rhymin]
I go to the party. I hip a hop the spot
I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot
Aspirin like they're on fire and
Their so-called boyfriends withem are retirin
And for this reason I'm a walkin threath
So when I'm on stage I want...[ssssht]

[eazy e: quiet on tha set]
[light, camera, action]
[eazy e: N. W. A. Take] [two]

[mc ren:]
Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that I'm referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
But don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up
Anyway I keep the clappin along
Coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
[?? Huh? ? I'm? ?? ] who could ask for anything more
When N. W. A. Is cold rockin the floor
Like stupid, actin like a retard
Waitin for a bumrush, gettin to the good part
It tips me so with temptation
Writin my lyrics with this hyped information
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
[eazy e: boy you should have known by now] it's mine!
Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed
Its irresistable, meanin that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat
But after I rip it up I want...[ssssht]

[eazy e: quiet on tha set]
[light, camera, action]
[eazy e: N. W. A. Take] [three]

[mc ren:]
I can be loud as hell, think I will? [never]
[ssssht] [eazy e: quiet on tha set] yeah I like that better
[?? Huh? ? As what I can do? ? ] I think I earn respect
And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect
Coz if it aint ruff it aint me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See, I'm just me standin at the top of the pile
And doin soft known tunes it aint my style
And this concludes our program
Of how N. W. A. Makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to dre, and the boy gets dumb
Its no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
All kinda lyrics that's promised to play
To make everybody say:
[they can be cold and ruthless no question about that,
But sometimes it's more complicated...]
[eazy e: yo dre] [you know what I want you to do? ]
[public enemy: bring that beat back, bring that beat back]

Now mc ren is here workin like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm always thinkin o you
Coz I'm the pusher, supplyin the fix
And this jams so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm makin obstacles of enemy traps
To catch any mcs with the weak-ass raps
Crucifyin their [?? Huh? ? ] like just for usin my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing o the game
If they try to retreat, I catchem one at a time
Coz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme
So, you're in the back of me just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my sideman wants to give a preview
So at my next concert I wanna see you
There not sittin in a chair
Standin on yo feet, with yo hand in the air
Now I'm about to get out but I'll be back
But next time expect the more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion
The beat that I'm [?? Hype? ? ] and you know that's bad
Now continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set"
N.W.A,Real Niggaz,/n/nwa/real+niggaz_20097488.html,"Ren:
Prisoner, like a hostage yo,
You should've covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich.
Deep in the dirt cause you'se a sucker,
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker.
Don't try to hang, you best avoid,
Cause my foot'll be so far up your ass you'll get hemorrhoids.
Before you try to fuck with Ren,
I'll put two in your ass, and you'll be shitting in size ten.

Dre:
First come, first serve,
Who else got the nerves, step up and give what you deserve.
From the word of a motherfucking hip-hop maniac,
Braniac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back.
Now how the fuck you think a rapper lasts,
With your ass ain't shit, that is said in the past.
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy,
Get off the dick, you motherfucking call-the-coppy.

Ren:
Falling deep in the drums, with many of styles,
That's one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles.
Cheating and out, beating the crowd, I kept seating,
But weak motherfuckers biting off, and they kept eating.
Styles they got are full of bull, cause their vocals are local,
In nightclubs, and not getting paid in full.
They got the nerve to cuss,
Only reason niggaz picking your record is cause they thought is was us.

Dre:
Yo, give 'em what I gotta give, do 'em what I gotto do,
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you.
You can't harm me, alarm me,
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army.
The niggaz With Attitudes if you didn't know,
We blow, flow, and didn't move slow from the get-go.
Yo, time for some taking,
Yo fuck this shit, Yella kick the break in.

(Aaaah!) It's the real thing,
You are now (real, real) niggaz! Niggaz!

Ren:
You can run, but you can't hide, you know I'ma find ya,
Cause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya.
Don't look back because you're shaking and all scared,
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare.
So sleep with the lights on, forget that the mic's on,
Don't step on the motherfucking stage with our nights on.
Don't see a psycho, and then you just might go,
Mentally fucked up when I let the rifle blow.
Dre:
All these niggaz with the gibber-jabber,
But couldn't kill a fly with a motherfucking sledgehammer.
Gangsters in black are out there,
But only because, yo, it's the shit that we wear.
On my motherfucking dick,
But I'ma love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick.
So yo, step up, go to bed, cause if you're misled,
You'll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead.

Eazy (Ren):
Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, see,
I love streetwise, nigga you know me.
Rolling with some real niggaz, playing for keeps,
But you motherfuckers know who run the streets.
With that hardcore, hip-hop, rap-shit,
(Now how much harder can another nigga get).
Trying to be like us, sound like us, drift like us,
(Ashes to ashes and dust to dust).
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please,
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees.
Cause I'm a motherfucker that's out to kill,
Eazy E, a nigga that's real.

Ren:
Real niggaz, straight off the streets of Compton.
Quick to getting your shit without a second thought.
And if your ass gets smoked, it's my bullet you caught.
So if you're talking shit about the niggaz in black,
Bow down to the kings, and raid a half.
They're played out, that's what niggaz were chatting,
One nigga left, and they said we ain't having it.
People thought we was finished and done with,
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit.
Catch, so cover your ears, and wipe off your tears,
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas.
And when the new record comes, don't come like a fucking bum,
Asking for fucking money to buy you a fucking crumb.
You're on the dick so far, niggaz not one,
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one.
So braze yourself, to make sure you don't get fucked up,
Cause if I let you slide, it's just cause you're locked up.
Don't come up my face again, because I'ma floor ya,
And if you're a bitch, I'ma fucking ignore ya.
Because my attitude's a little bigger,
Cause mc Ren is one of the real niggaz.

Dre:
Lost in the motherfucking world of madness, sadness,
But Dre is just a nigga that's glad it's
Sucker motherfuckers like you making whack jams,
Because it only you shows you how dope I am.
Never try to ignore us,
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of riggermortis.
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure,
You could break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger.
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart,
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play.
We started out with too much cargo,
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arto.
Yo, N. W. A., criticized for what we say,
But I'ma do this shit anyway.
Cause I'm the motherfucking doctor, never faking,
Yo Yella, kick the motherfucking break in.

(Aaaah!) It's the real thing,
You are now (real, real) niggaz! Niggaz!
(Aaaah!) Yeah motherfucker, it's the real thing,
You are now (real, real) niggaz! Niggaz!

So me and my ace we got a taste
Of a muthafukers billy club he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said nigga start running
So tell me what's the next episode
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me and waste me
I thought run nigga run but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I get hit hard real but still muthafuker said
I want another black muthafuker dead
Niggaz ain't good for shit for me
'Cause this is a race for second class
So get your ass up against the wall bitch
And then he tried
They jumped me but the punk became a victim of a
Walkby
Fuking wit Dre, you get a foot up your asshole
It's just another way to let you know
I never said, I never said, I never said a buck
Can't fuck wit me
Real muthafuking G (Got that)
Straight from the streets of the cpt
Telling you why real niggaz don't die

[Chorus:]
I just want to celebrate (2X)

(Mc Ren)

Real niggaz don't die 'cause they eventually
Multiply
The niggaz I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong, got to stay so
Strong
Niggaz got to keep going on and on
And don't let no pail face, they throw your ass in
A snail race
Have your residents occupying a jail space
That's what they want to do 'cause the system is
Fucked around
I try to let you know what the record it's
Underground
They don't give a fuk about a nigga
They would rather pull the trigger
And have you in front of a barrel smiling saying
Cheese
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not wit that black just so I'm not gonna nail
That
All I see is niggaz getting harrass
We can't do nothing about it but get a foot in the
Ass
Yo, but a very nigga grabbed a nine
And started shooting muthafukers, it would put them
In line
And that's how it's suppose to be
When the pussy ass niggas try to fuk wit me
Yo because it's useless to try
To kill a nigga cause nigga a muthafuking real
Nigga don't die

Only the good die young, so they make me young and
Bad
Putting ass kickings on the niggaz that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuk wit
So how can a nigga die when he's causing the
Bloodshed
By shooting muthafukas in the head
Trying to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never want to hear me
So I'm a let 'em know how a nigga's living
Checking for muthafukas cause nobody ain't giving a
Damn thing
To a nigga, a real nigga
So I'm living by the muthafuking trigger
Cause a nigga ain't afraid of being locked up

To kill a nigga like me but muthafucking real niggaz

[Get paid back] You're motherfucking right  yo

Verse One: Dr. Dre

Fuck the motherfucking police!
They don't want peace  they want a nigga deceased
So he'll cease to be a problem  and by the way the perform
It seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform
And yo the black police, the house niggaz
They gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure
you made out, good to go, but you didn't know
They would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo
To kill another nigga, catch him with crack, in fact
Freebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place
But the brothers ain't stupid, remember that
You got a gat, I got a gat, so whassup with that
A to the motherfuckin K
The last words you hear, then the smoke appears
Tears, from your motherfuckin family
They're starin at me, but I'm goin gun happy, fuck em!

and fight for what's wrong, fuck what's right!

Episode One:

Yeah that shit's hittin man, where the volume at?
Hold-up, hold-up, hold-up, one-time, one-time, one-time
Put the joint out! Put the joint out!
Hey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?
Don't you know it's against the law to play music so god damn loud? Shut
the fuck up! Go to jail? Gimme that shit you was just smoking

Motherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat
And that's some shit you betta not forget

Verse Two: Eazy-E

Eazy E's the name feared by most
When, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
But on the streets there's two kinds of people
White rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
Pull over to the side, routine for me
Tearin up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine
But they never find the shit
Ain't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit
Thinkin everything is stolen
But can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin
Making more money than they ever make
Taking more shit than they ever take
Yo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and
keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
Cause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin
So let me explain a lil somethin, yo

See, I got this problem, a big problem...
Cops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops

Chorus:

Fuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police
Fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck the police
[Fuck the police!]

Episode Two:

Get out of the fuckin car!
Wait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?
Hey just shut the fuck up black bitch
Wait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair! Let
go of my motherfuckin hair!
Hey just step the fuck back and shut up!
Get your motherfuckin hands off of me!
Calm down, calm down now... listen, we're gonna go around this corner, and
you're gonna suck me and my partner's dicks, or you're gonna
be one black dead nigger bitch

Police brutality is common in my neighborhood
That's why I hate them motherfuckers

Verse Three: MC Ren

I said fuck the police but with a little more force
And maybe now I get my point across
It's a lot here that's goin on, just open your eyes and look
Everyday a young nigga is took
Off the face of the street by a police
It's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
You can't leave out the city that they shacked up
Cause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up
It's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do
is say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote
So what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head
til you're dead with the steel toe boot
Harassin me with some kind of mind game
Actin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name
You call that right but when you're black there's no right
Some recreational shit was only a gang fight
So shootin at the cops was a street thing
To waste time have to explain don't do cocaine
But everything was done just for peace
To retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin

Chorus:

Fuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police!
Fuck
Fuck the police! Fuck, fuck the police!

Episode Three:

Hey Juan, look at the piece of ass man
Watch out watch out watch out homes!
Oh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car

Slow is the tempo
Now talkin' about a nympho
So peep it up here goes the info
This is the bitch who did the whole crew
She did it so much we'd make bets on who's the ho's
We'd love to go through
And for the shit that she does give her a drum role
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And'll let you video tape her
And if you got a gang of niggaz, the bitch would
Let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut
And she even take de broomstick at the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take"" She asked
""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shake""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and
It was very Irresistable

To be with 6th nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it
So I told de bitch I was with that I'm goin' to de

And got de fuck out de car.
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggaz that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next

But was it passin' up the chance of my dick gettin'

Now I'm a break it down with a fact -
Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't
Know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they could'nt quit
Cuz ninty percent of ' the bitches today they love
The shit
And those are the main one's that say they don't do
It
But MC Ren knowz the bitches are used to it
So fellows, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick punch the bitch in the
Eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth -
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck a meet off a
Chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nutt out of a dick just like
Dreino
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is at that with the same shit
De next night
Because she just can't quit
Cuz she's addicted, addicted, addicted, addicted
she's addicted, addicted, she's addicted to suck a
Good dick

""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!

""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!"

[Dre] Hey, yo Yella Boy, why don't you kick me one of them
Funky beats?
[Ren] Yo, we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house
[Dre] Compton's definately in the house. Yo Ren, whatta we gonna
Call this? Tell'em what yo name is?
[Ren] Yeah something like that
[Dre] Allright, let's kick this shit on the one
Kick it

[Ren]
Back by demand, now it's big as fuck
Because you as the public, you should know what's up
""Compton's in the House"" was more than gold, it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
But that was a part of showbizz
[Dre]
Hey yo homeboy, why don't you tell'em what your name is?
[Ren]
Well for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain
And strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon
On ""Gunsmoke"", but not a man of the law
I'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See, I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my bloodpressure high but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mass, while I was waitin' to axe

The sucker-motherfucker stopper
Back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
So now, let's get the motherfuckin' session
Goin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin'
Rhymes. So keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'
Cause I'm a start showin' the time
Never sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to stop runnin' off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
It's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple
To create something funky that's original
You need to talk about the place to be
Who you are, what you got, about a suck mc

[Dre] Oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, Ren,
You know what I'm sayin'?
[Ren] Yeah, I know what you're sayin', Dre, but you
Still ain't told'em enough, man
[Dre] Allright, Allright
Well, let's kick one more verse right here, allright
Kick it

[Dre]+[Ren]
This is portable, something to fuck with yo ear
Ren and Dre will appear when the sound is clear
To fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick
Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the Compton slang
Compton's back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip
Waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
Or stupid rhymes set be Dre and Ren
Well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin', like hell, as we move past the
Suckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Cause we're positive and they're on a negative type
And if think we're about to quit...
Motherfucker you ain't heard shit

[Dre] Yeah, that shit was funky, you know what I'm sayin', Ren?
[Ren] I know what you're sayin', this is mc Ren and Dr. Dre
Cold kickin' it in the place
[Dre] Ah yeah, my mellow Eazy E in the house
Yella Boy in the house
My boy Ice Cube
Arabian Prince cold rockin' shit

N.W.A,Straight Outta Compton,/n/nwa/straight+outta+compton_20097490.html,"You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Verse One: Ice Cube

Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called niggaz With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if ya fuck with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin out
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at yo ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
Ak-47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherfuckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin niggaz out tha box, daily
Yo weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin
But when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Eazy E] Yo Ren
[Mc Ren] Whassup?
[Eazy E] Tell em where you from!

Verse Two: mc Ren

Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, s***, you're composed to
A crazy muthafucker from tha street
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit
Mc Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull a ak off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
Are-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin
That's takin place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton...

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...

Verse Three: Eazy-E

... Straight outta Compton
Is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother
And make ya sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot?  Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch?  I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

N.W.A,The Dayz Of Wayback,/n/nwa/the+dayz+of+wayback_20097537.html,"What we gonna do right here is go back...

Now this is some shit that's from the Dayz of Wayback,
When niggas in Compton first started to jack.
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drug,
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged.
They always loved that shit. They want a nigga that's sellin' Ks.
But nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's.
But in the Dayz of Wayback
I couldn't be laid back,
Because I needed ends and I made that.
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' muthafuckas, just like cowboys and indians.
Anything it took to get paid.
A nigga like Ren already had the plane made.
And I was in it to win it and not to lose.
And shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse.
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin'em.
But not with no money - Yo, I was frayin'em.
And never get caught because nobody is snitch,
But one hoe did - so Ren had to shoot the bitch!
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and
'Cause everybody knows who's the bossin':
That black nigga that they call Ren.
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10.
So listen to me as I reminisce the Dayz of Wayback...
So check it out y'all...

It was once a time in the Dayz of Wayback
When niggas was gettin' jacked.
In fact it was one I used to pass through up,
And kickin' ass through up.
Muthafuckin' Compton Massacre...
Now let me tell you a little something about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in.
Yo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm.
Now it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam.
Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin',
Niggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'.
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin',
Livin' like he livin',
Killin' after killin'.
Murder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man
Was the best plan 'cause a dead man never ran.
But now your best friend is your worst friend.
Greed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'.
So now your shit is stolen
And you and your niggas start rollin'.
Yo, to get your shit back ain't a word of.
Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder.
They wanna make you think that it's a crack thang,
Or a black thang
Or some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang...
But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up.
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Rememberin' the days that's past me...
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest.
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test.
And number one way for you to pass,
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass.
They never in the wrong though,
So I made a song so
Muthafuckas had know
If, yo, livin situations make you wanna get a gat...
That's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback..."

Check this out, we've come to the last and final record
This is Dr. Dre in full effect and we gonna kick it off a little some this like this
We got my mella yella boy on the drums, We got Stan ""the Guitar Man""
Dropping the rhythm. We got LA Dre on the keyboard and I want the whole
Posse in this motherfucker to rock on this funky ass beat we're gonna drop
Alright, So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this motherfucker , run it

[Ice Cube]
Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My melody is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scatter, it'll make ya throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tearing shit up
Like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast some solid ass Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sitting in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, yo' body twitch, your eye's explode
Out your skull 'cause being dull on a flow
Is an N-O, niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 paces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on the grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, yea that was funky but we need the motherfucking villian to speak
So kick it

[MC Ren]
The grand finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak motherfuckers turn to dust
If you're weak it ain't my fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turn into a pillar of salt
And niggas that's biting just to taste me
I make the punk motherfuckers buckle up for safety
And on the dope they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange the motherfucking face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say that I scare you, I can tell 'cause your shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I say fuck the police, yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp, bitches making my dough
In a different stage, I must of went on a rampage
Me and the D.O.C. are always hitting the front page
For what, for stealing and stepping up to the sheriff
And when I enter the party, niggas shit in a (cell pimp)
For what, maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking the grande finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, y'all know what time it is. Easy motherfucking E is in the house doing
Damage

[Eazy E]
The name is Eazy for me to come off like the inforcer'
Mass murder motherfuckers in a course of
An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck the car, I do a motherfucking walk-by
Eazy-E and the D.O. to the C. and
Run house and there won't be no disagreeing
'Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I'm arrested (For what) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and the hoes boo hooing
Why 'cause they're addicted to my dick
The pleasure of pain, the wing-ding and flipped it
(Yea) and never forget when done in bed by
Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool but local like loc never broke
'Cause they're paid to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal wit a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all the other bullshit money ain't jack
Eazy but not that Eazy to deal wit
Especially if you're popping bullshit
Put the E-A-Z-Y and to the E
Expression of thought on the motherfucking grand finale

[Dr. Dre]
Yea, that shit was funky, last but not least is the motherfucking D.O.C.
This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it

[The D.O.C.]
Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping up the man wit the (swig tan) movement
Proving if you're grooving then it cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. and I would've been down wit rock
But I was smart, the D.O. to the C. now on the formula
It's rough, I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen after that and this and
D-O-N-'T M-O-V-E wit out permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be dumb if a sucker can
Ever compete wit the elite
Much less beat, it's like dancing wit 2 left feet
Never smile when the D.O.C. is in the room
Or I'm a send ya ass to the temple of doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now wit NWA on the motherfucking grand finale

Neil Diamond,A Modern Day Version Of Love,/n/neil+diamond/a+modern+day+version+of+love_20253493.html,"And the night was filled with laughter
Echoing through plaintive smiles
And I knew each morning after
I never loved, was never touched
Gave not at all, got back as much
In the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove
Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste
Of lips that ask so-o much of me
Still I wonder with every embrace
Could I give, and not break
Should I care, and forsake
All the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove
Close my eyes and keep on runnin'
Realise it isn't gonna work anymor-ore
For me, yeah-eah
I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything
Before, not before ...
Baffled child on streets of sinner
Sleeping child, a morning call
Playful spring, look face the winter
Take thy hand, taste the kiss
Leave behind, emptiness
And the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove"

All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
That's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you
I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rare
Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer
Of a stranger in Paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"

With their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply

And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we found
I hear a hundred goodbyes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Young bird flyin'
And a soft wind blowin'
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes and see the flowers growin'
As you lay sleeping in my arms

In silly waves

To hang on to
Too many words you say
Not the words
Connecting me to thy

We both just let it fly
Didn't see it leave
Didn't do and try
I only knew
That we were moving on
Suddenly it's gone
Never knowing why

Don't have a reason
I can give
At least not one
That I can understand
Just somehow disappeared
Slipped beneath
The fingers of my hand
Was on a day
That time forgot
Another day
That time forgot

Oh no
Oh no

Had it once but
We just let it fall
Should have held it close
Could have had it all
I'm thinking 'bout the life
We could have made
Lost what we had
Somewhere along the way

Oh no
Oh no

A wake up
Call alone again
Half remembered dream
Inside my head
You took me
Through the day
Followed me
At night into my bed
Another day
That time forgot

A sigh is just a sigh

As time goes by

They still say, ""I love you,""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate

A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Now ev'ry time I'm around

I ask my heart ev'ry day
Can there be some other way?
Tell me, what can I do
To change my blue destiny?

First you decide
That our love will always be true,
Next thing I know
You're running with somebody new
Once you were mine alone
Now you're just someone I've known
Tell me, what can I do
To change my blue destiny?

And there were times
When love was new
And both our hearts were gay
But now the signs says we're through
And bound for separate ways

And how can you love
When your love doesn't want you at all?
Girl, when you turn me away
Got my back to the wall

Still I'd forgive all your lies
'Cause darlin', I realize that it's you
Only you, can change my blue destiny
Baby you, only you
Can change my blue destiny"

Gonna take that blue highway and leave this sorry town. Stayed too long, but now I'm gone, and I know where I'm bound. I don't wanna take the interstate; it represents all the things I hate. I'm rollin' down that blue highway.
So long, confusion; it's time to slow things down. Say goodbye to my old friends, ease on out of town. I made me some money here but paid for ev'ry day. And ev'ry mile just makes me smile, 'cause I made my getaway.
Gonna take that blue highway and leave this sorry town. I've stayed too long, but now I'm gone, and I know where I'm bound. I've had it up to here with worry. From now on, I'm in no hurry, rollin' down that blue highway.

They rain, they snow on everyone.
So many things I would've done
But clouds got in my way.

I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds' illusions I recall.
I really don't know clouds at all.

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels,
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real.
I've looked at love that way.
But now it's just another show.
Leave 'em laughin' when you go.
But if you care, don't let em' know
Don't give yourself away.

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall.
I really don't know love at all.

Tears and fears and feeling proud,
Say ""I love you"" right out loud.
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way.
But now old friends are acting strange.
They shake their heads and say I've changed.
But something's lost when somethings gained
Living everyday.

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall.
I really don't know life at all."

Hurry on

And I see two boys
Racin up two flights of staircase
Squirmin into papas embrace
And his whiskers warm on their face
Wheres it gone
Oh, wheres it gone

Two floors above the butcher
First door on the right
Life filled to the brim
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn roads

I can still recall
The smell of cookin in the hallways
Rubber drying in the doorways
And report cards I was always
Afraid to show

Mamad come to school
And as I'd sit there softly crying
Teacherd say, he's just not trying
Hes got a good head if he'd apply it
But you know yourself
Its always somewhere else

I built me a castle
With dragons and kings
And I'd ride off with them
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn roads

Thought of going back
But all I'd see are strangers faces
And all the scars that love erases
But as my mind walks thru those places
Im wonderin
What's come of them

Does some other young boy
Come home to my room
Does he dream what I did
As he stands by my window
And looks out on those
Brooklyn roads"

To the outside of town

Sits a ragged tent
Where there ain't no trees

Telling you and me

It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show (halle, halle)
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
'Cause everyone knows
Brother Love's show

Room gets suddenly still
And when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat, he walks in
Eyes black as coal
And when he lifts his face
Every ear in the place is on him

Starting soft and slow
Like a small earthquake
And when he lets go
Half the valley shakes

It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show (halle, halle)
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
'Cause everyone knows
'Bout Brother Love's show

Now you got yourself
Two good hands (halle hallelujah)

And when your brother is troubled
You got to reach out your one hand for him (hallelujah)
'Cause that's what it's there for (halle hallelujah)

And when your heart is troubled
You gotta reach out your other hand (hallelujah)
Reach it out to the Man up there
'Cause that's what He's there for (halle hallelujah)

Take my hand in yours
Walk with me this day
In my heart I know
I will never stray

Can be turned away

It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

Can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

That we got this far

Shepherds and wise men
Will kneel and adore him
Seraphim round him their vigil will keep
Nations proclaim him
Their Lord and their Saviour
But Mary will hold him
And sing him to sleep

Firelight and star glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn

A child with his mother

Me and and you underneath a mysterious spell,
Nothin' I could do
And it suddenly felt like a bolt outta hell,
I'm tellin' you.
To the sound of the beat I was hangin' on
Like a powerful truth it was bangin' on me,
Wouldn't lemme go, like a shot in the dark
She was hot like a spark,
I only know,
Neither one of us tryin' to hold it down,
Neither one of us takin' the middle ground,
Wasn't how to make sense we were thinkin' of,
Just the two of us bent on delirious love.
Me and you bein' spent on delirious love.

Like a ride on a rocket it took us up,
Didn't want it to stop and it shook us up good.
We were movin' fast just ahead of the law,
We were beggin' for more,
And what a blast.
Comin' round to a new kind of view of it,
Never did it before we were doin' it now,
And I gotta say it was easy to give,
Was a reason to live another day.
Neither one of us stoppin' to figure out,
What the roll and the rockin' was all about.
All we knew was that we couldn't get enough,
You and me in the heat of delirious love.
I can feet it, I can feel it, we can feel it.

Comin' down had a new kind of view of it,
Wouldn't do it before we were doin' it now,

It was the third of june
On that summer's day
Well I became a man
At the hands of a girl
Almost twice my age
And she came to me
Just like a morning sun
And it wasn't so much
Her words as such
As the way they were sung
It was the way they were sung

Desiree
Oh, desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long
Remember, desiree
Oh, desiree
Somehow I knew
I could only have you
'til the morning light
If only for that single night
Sweet desiree, you make it right

Then came the fourth of june
On that sleepless night
Well I tossed and I turned
While the thought of her burned
Up and down my mind
For she was there and gone
Without one regret
But she continues on
Like the words of a song
I could not forget
I could not forget

Desiree
Oh, desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long
Remember, desiree
Oh, desiree
And though somehow I knew
I could only have you
'til the morning light
The night was long, the time was right
Do you remember desiree"

It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart
You are never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

When it feels nice just don't think twice.
Some worry all day 'bout who they can trust, some worry all night 'bout money and lust.
Worry they do and worried they die--
And after they're gone just the bankers cry.

You do what you can to feel no regret.
You do what you can, forget about words, just go with the feelin' it usually works.

Dry your eyes and take your song out, it's a newborn afternoon.
And if you can't recall the singer you can still recall the tune.
Dry your eyes and play it slowly like you're marching off to war;
Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before.
And from the center of the circle to the midst of the waiting crowd,
If it ever be forgotten sing it long and sing it loud and come dry your eyes.

And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know,
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy and it was less than being free,
And if you can't recall the reason can you hear the people sing.
Right through the lightning and the thunder to the dark side of the moon,
To that distant falling angel that descended much too soon
And come dry your eyes.

The way I see it, I just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own game
You can't please them all
There's always somebody callin' you down
And I do my best and I do good business
As a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
And try and be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in paris, I was unfettered and alive
There was nobody to call me up for favours
Noone's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I'm taking on
? ? ? star makin' machinery
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone schemers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way, I'd walk thru that door and wander
Down the champs elysees
Going from cafe to cabaret
Thinkin' how I feel when I find
That very good friend of mine"
Neil Diamond,Freedom Song,/n/neil+diamond/freedom+song_21064349.html,"Two hundred years and more
And here we are today
With freedom still our guiding light
Defending it with all our might
We're never gonna change
Or ever look away
We stand for freedom everyday
They'll never take us down

Tho some may try
We're gonna stand our ground
It's do or die
The freedom that we've found
Can't be denied
And they can never take us down oh no
Our freedom is why

Got freedom to believe
And live the way we choose
Ain't that's what freedoms all about
It's something we can't never lose
And if we go astray
Let freedom be the light
That takes us through the darkest night

They'll never take us down
Tho some may try
We're gonna stand our ground
It's do or die
The freedom that we've found
Can't be denied
Our faith is like a light
That keeps us warm
It burns inside.

We've come this way before
A hundred times or more
But someone's watching over us
And we believe in God we trust
But if we hold on strong
We'll make it through the night
And walk in freedom's shining light

They'll never take us down
Tho some may try
We're gonna stand our ground
It's do or die
The freedom that we've found
Can't be denied
We know without a doubt
We'll get through this,
We've been through worse

They'll never take us down
Not now or any day
Our freedom don't come free
But it's worth the price we paid
The dream inside us all
It can not be denied
Together let us raise our freedom's flag
And let it fly

Never take us down
(No, oh no)
Oh no they won't
(Never take us down)
Praise our freedom now
(Let praise it now)
We know it's true

They'll never take us down
Tho some may try
We've only got to show
The reason why
Our road together's made
Of tears and pride
We know they can never take us down
And freedom's why
Together let's raise our freedoms flag
Where eagles fly"

The life that she believes in

And it' ain't a Front Page Story
Won't even make the papers

Won't ever make the headlines
Somebody's broken heart ain't new

What happened
He thinks of all the things
He might have done
Why shouldn't she believe him

He wakes up without her
And never really knows
Just what went wrong
But it's all wrong without her

Hurrying to get there
Ninety miles an hour
In two Plymouth wagons
The Avis lady gave us a smile

Tom's getting uptight
Max'll will make it all right
Ken's asleep in back
Artie's reading a map
That's takin' us where we're heading to
We should be there soon

There's a sign up ahead
Wash my face and get fed
And that voice in my head
Keeps sayin' I'm lonely
But I'm only payin' my dues
Holiday Inn Blues

Had a reservation, best accommodations
We get the word, they never heard
We were comin' by at all
See what they can do for me,
Only got one room free
Little bit confined,
But if you guys don't mind
We'll put you up in our bridal suite
The view can't be beat

And a fine view they got
Of a new parking lot
And I can't repeat what's in my mind
As I lay back resigned
And I kick off my shoes
Holiday Inn Blues

Time to put a show on
Gettin' time to go on
People call for more,
We do two encores
Take our bows and we're feelin' fine
We got to unwind

Want some coffee, but then
This town closes at ten
Looks like I'm gonna spend
One more night by the light
Of the late show
And Charlie Chans's crew

I feel so down

What am I gonna do?"

Neil Diamond,Home Is A Wounded Heart,/n/neil+diamond/home+is+a+wounded+heart_20098887.html,"Words and music by neil diamond

Home is a wounded heart, haven't you heard the story?
He's out for love and for glory and she's waitin' home by the fire.
And wasn't it yesterday, wasn't it me who said it?
I swore that you'd never regret it.
Now home is a wounded heart.

It's a complicated thing, not an ordinary thing
And my heart just breaks in two
'cause I can see you standing there.
You know that I can't bear your wounded heart.

Paint me a red balloon; give me a string and baby I'll tie it,
Give me a ring and baby I'll buy it and bring it on home to you.
Home is a wounded heart."

For another cup of wine

Got a bug  from you, Girl
But I don't need no  cure
I'll just stay a victim
If i can for sure

And the feeling is 'lay back'
Palm trees grow, and rents are low
But you know I keep thinkin' about
Making my way back

Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays, I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home, but it ain't mine no more

""I am,"" I said
To no one there
An no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am,"" I cried
""I am,"" said I
And I am lost, and I can't even say why
Leavin' me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names and a few other changes
I you talk about me, the story's the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried, but it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared for the sound of being alone

""I am,"" I said
To no one there
An no one heard at all
Not even the chair
""I am,"" I cried
""I am,"" said I
And I am lost, and I can't even say why

Neil Diamond,I Am The Lion,/n/neil+diamond/i+am+the+lion_20256521.html,"There was a flood and many poor men were killed.
And that is why our house is built on the top of a hill.
The plains are like a friend, why can't we live on them?
And if a flood should come, why can't we run?
I am the lion, bellowing out in the night.

We had a cow, I left it alone to graze.
And walked to the stream and when I returned, it was stolen away.
But now the cow is gone and we don't need a farm.
We have not one thing they
Would steal away.
I am the lion bellowing out at the night.

I am......the lion."

I believe in new beginnings
Extra innings, brand new starts
Loving hearts that care the way I do
All these things and happy endings too

Sad songs bring me right down with the blues
Glad songs take me wherever I choose
And I choose to be there
So that I
Can declare why

I believe in happy endings
You're the reason, love's the way
And I'll believe it till my dying day

I know the cost of tears and trouble
Some get lost, some make it through
Me, I made it, 'cause I always knew
That you believed in happy endings too

I know how much these little things can mean
But all that I can give you are my dreams

Billy takes you driving in his brand new car
Frankie takes you to the movie show

That they love you more
Look into my eyes and you will know
That I care enough to give the very best

Neil Diamond,I Dreamed A Dream,/n/neil+diamond/i+dreamed+a+dream_20712570.html,"There was a time when girls were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
It all went wrong

I dreamed a dream of time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

When I was young and unafraid
When dreams were made
And used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine un-tasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
And they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame....

She slept this summer by my side
She filled my days with endless wonder
She took my childhood in her stride
But she was gone when autumn came

And still I dream she'll come to me
That we will spend the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
But life can't kill
The dream I dreamed"

Just discovered what love is

And I've been regained

For I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've sung my song before
And I'm sure to sing my song again

Some people got to cry
Some people got to make it through
By never wondering why

Some people got to sing
Some people got to sigh

Nights just don't seem as long

You just picked me up when I was down
And I've never been the same

I never realized what I was missing
Until I came to know
The magic of your charms
I used to spend my nights
Alone just wishing
But now I'll spend my time
Alone in your arms

You must be an angel in disguise
My head's been in the clouds
Since you first came
You showed me the way to paradise
And I've never been the same

Took a drink from a glass of old wine

From another place

As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean

And every night she would say

Where the music wakes up with the city
To the bars by the railroad cars
On the neon side of town
Sang a song on the city streets
And people began to listen
Southern boy, sing your southern song
Take it like no one aound

Love never doubts or suffers or cries
Love shows no fear, love tells no lies
And love will never leave me in the dark
No, love never breaks my heart
Like you do, like you do

Love doesn't have unapproachable walls
Or a heart that beckons and then withdraws
And love would never steal my dignity
Love has never made a fool of me
Like you do, like you do

Oh, and I have known times
When love seems unsure
But when love is unkind
It is not love anymore

Love never threatens of frightens me
It's not held together with apologies
Love never screams my name
No, and love never turns away
Like you do, like you do

And I have known times
When love seems unsure
But when love maybe unkind
Love never turns away

Moving up to higher ground
Would you listen, listen, listen

Such were the plans I'd made
For she was a lady
And I was a dreamer
With only words to trade

You know that I was born for a night like this
Warmed by a stolen kiss
For I was lonely
And she was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
Ill sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

Ill weave this web of rhyme
Upon this summer night
Well leave this worldly time
On his winged flight

Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I'll sing to you
My longfellow serenade

Longfellow serenade
Such were the plans I made
But she was a lady
As deep as the river
And through the night, we stayed

And in my way, I loved her as none before
Loved her with words and more
For she was lonely
And I was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
Ill sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

And what more can I do
For your love burns
Warmer than you know
When love burns,
Never let it go away
And where do we go
Find a road to lead us
I'm searching in your eyes
A world beyond the skies
For your love burns
Brighter than you know
When love burns,
Never let it go away
Love burns
Brighter than you know
Oh, love burns
Never let it go away
Love burns when the spirit is wounded
Cut deep by the sound of rejection
Love burns in the soul of the seeker
Blue shadows in every direction
Love burns when the heart is uncovered
In the rage of the coldly storm
Love burns
Through the night and the morning
Till the frozen heart is warm
Love burns
Love burns
Love burns
Love burns

They haven't really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in the storm
And When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
Maybe blue skies above
But it's cool when your love's on the rocks

By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark

Hark, now hear the angels sing
New king's born today
And man will live for evermore

Watched their flocks by night

In worn out shoes
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high
He jumped sp high
Then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped
He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
He let go a laugh
Pushed back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
He danced for those in minstral shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him
Traveled about
The dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
He said I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him please
Please

I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you opened the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time to hold to
In my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you opened the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
Cause I know that my heart
Will go on and on
And on and on and on
My heart will go on and on"

I've searched alone
But your the only one
You're what I want
When things are said and done
I guess I only needed
Someone who was just like you
Someone who'd be
My special someone too

I stumbled down love's main highway
But not without takin' some falls
I've seen my illusions fly away
Until I had none left at all

And then you rescued
What was left of me
What maybe some would call a fantasy
But me, I'd have to say it only proves
How strange love moves
I need to be your special someone too

'Cause what I needed most
Is what she gave to me
And where she lays her head
Is where I want to be
There's something wrong with losing
What we finally found
Now when I've lost my way
I've got my special someone round

And when she needed love
She found it here with me
Now where I lay my head
Is where she wants to be
I've got a secret but it's one
That's hard to keep
I want to tell the world
That special someone is my girl
That special someone is my girl
She wants to be my special someone too"

I need my time with you

The day turn out alright
It's easy when I'm here with you

And when life is hard to understand
You reach out for the hand
Of someone who believes in you

And when I'm sure
I'm not worth anything at all
I need my time with you

When we're together,
All those troubles look so small
When nothing seems real
Then I need my time with you

Hard times,
City lights shine all over the sky
Don't you know in a dog eat dog world
We need each other to survive
I got to know if they storm the walls
I'll have you by my side

I turn the page
And see another restless day
I'll need my time with you
I'll keep believing
Till tomorrow fades away

Takes only that moment with you
It's never easy
When you got to keep it going
And your back's against the wall

As every dreamer knows,
It doesn't really matter
If you rise or if you fall
You can hand it all
To someone who believes in you
And cares for you,
And shares that time with you

I need and I want
And I love my time with you
I need my time with you"

Say that you'll eliminate the competition

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

Oh morning stars together,
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven

And the wind in my face
And it's good just to be alive

And if I'm lucky,
I'll find a young lady under the stars
And we'll dance the night away

Somebody wake me and say it's a dream
Leadin' me far from my home
And haven't you noticed
Despite what it seems
You can't deny it's you and I alone

Maybe spend my life just workin' the land
Maybe livin' from day to day

If I like it, I just might stay

Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Saying nothing, lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we've found
I, hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Now now now now now now now

Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms

Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before.
From the center of the circle to the midst of the waving crowd.
If it ever be forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud.
Come, dry your eyes.
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know.
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free,
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people sing,
Through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon,
To that distant calling angel who descended much too soon.
And come, dry your eyes.

Good times never seem so good
I made him climb to believe it never would

And now I, I look at the night, whooo
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two, oh
And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you

Oh, one, touching one, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Oh, sweet caroline
Good times never seem so good
Oh I made him climb to believe it never would

Ohhh, sweet caroline, good times never seem so good"

And I've been this way before
And I'm sure to be this way again
For I've been refused
And I've been regained
And I've seen your eyes before
And I'm sure to see your eyes again

For I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've sung my song before
And I'm sure to sing my song again

Some people got to laugh
Some people got to cry
Some people got to make it through
By never wondering why

Some people got to sing
Some people got to sigh
Some people never see the light
Until the day they die

But I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've been this way before
And I'm sure to be this way again

One more time again
Just one more time"

From the soundtrack of Until the End of the World.

It was a miracle I even got outta Longwood alive,
This town fulla men with big mouths and no guts,
I mean, if you can just picture it,
The whole third floor of the hotel gutted by the blast,
And the street below showered in shards of broken glass,
And all the drunks pourin' outta the dance halls,
Starin' up at the smoke and the flames,
And the blind pencil seller wavin' his stick,
Shoutin' for his dog that lay dead on the side of the road,
And me, if you can believe this, at the wheel of the car
Closin my eyes and actually prayin',
Not to God above, but to you, sayin',

Help me girl, help me girl
I'll love you till the end of the world
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls

Some things we plan, we sit and we invent and we plot and cook up,
Others are works of inspiration, of poetry,
And it was this genius hand that pushed me up the hotel stairs
To say my last goodbye,
To her hair white as snow, and her pale blue eyes,
Sayin ""I gotta go, I gotta go, the bomb and the bread basket
Are ready to blow, ""
In this town of men with big mouths and no guts,
The pencil seller's dog spooked by the explosion
And leapin' under my wheels as I careered outta Longwood on my way to you,
Waitin in your dress, in your dress of blue

I said thank you girl, thank you girl
I'll love you till the end of the world
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls

And with the horses prancin' through the fields,
With my knife in my jeans and the rain on the shield,
I sang a song for the glory of the beauty of you,
Waitin for me in your dress of blue

Thank you girl, thank you girl
I'll love you till the end of the world
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls"

Ah'm enquirin on behalf of his soul
Ah'd be beholdin to ya all
For a lil information, just a little indication
Just who'll dig the hole?
When ya done ransackin' his room
Grabbin any damn thing that shines,
Throw the scraps down on the street
Like all his books and his notes.
All his books and his notes and
All the junk that he wrote
The whole fucken lot right up in smoke
Ain't there nuthin sacred anymore
Won't someone will build a box for Black Paul?
And their shootin off his guns
And their shootin off their mouths
Saying 'fuck with us... And die! '
'fuck with us... And die! '
(Let's see that rat of fear go scuttle in their skulls)
'Cover that eye! Cover that frozen eye! '

Black-puppet, in a heap up against the stoning-wall
Black-puppet, go to sleep, ma-ma won't scold ya anymore

Armies of ants, wade up the lil red streams
They're headin for the mother-pool
O lord, it's cruel! O man it's hot! O man it's hot and
And some of them ants they just climb to the spot
Who threw the first stone at Black Paul?

'Don't ask us', say the critics and the hacks
The pen-pushers and the quacks
'We jes c** to git dah facks! '
'We jes c** to git dah facks! '
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Here is the hammer, that built the scaffold,
And built the box...
Here is the shovel, that dug the hole,
In this ground of rocks...
And here is the pile of stones!
And for each one planted, God only knows,
A blood-rose grown...
These are the true Demon-Flowers!
These are the true Demon-Flowers!
Stand back everyone! Blood-black everyone!

Who'll build a box for Black Paul?
Who'll carry it up the hill?

'Not I', said the widow, adjusting her veil
'Ah will not drive the nail
Or cart his puppet-body home,
For ah done that one hundred times before,
Yeah! Ah done that one hundred times or more,
And why should ah dress his wounds?
When he has wounded my dress, nightly,
Right across the floor'

Who'll build a box for Black Paul?
Who'll carry it up the hill?
Who'll bury it in the black-soil?
And from the woods and the thickets
Come the ghosts of his victims
'We love you! '
'Ah love you! '
'and this will not hurt a bit,
Outta my eyes was your rise to full glory Spring up from the corp(??) of life we'll go up, up, up, up, up into Death
Up, up, up, up, inhale its breath
O yes, Death favours those that favor Death'

Here is the stone, and this is the inscription it bare:
'Below Lies Black Paul, Under The Upper...
But Above and Beyond The Surface-Flat-Fall There. '

And all the angels come on down,
And all you men and women crowd around
And all the old widows weeping into their skirts
And all the lil gals and the lil Boys
And the scribes with their pens poised
All the hullaballoo, all the norse
All the hullaballoo, all the noise
All the hullaballoo, all of the noise
Clears his throat of black blood
Singin Black Paul like a lonely boy...

We-e-e-ll, ah have cried one thousand tears
Ah've cried a thousand tears, its true
And the next stormy night you know,
That ah'm still cryin them for you

Well, ah had a gal she was so sweet,
Red dress, and long red hair hangin down
And heaven yes ain't heaven
Without that lil girl hangin around

Well, ya know ah've beenn a bad-man
And Lord knows ah done some good things too
But ah confess, my soul will never rest
Until you've, until you've build
Until you've built a box for my gal, too.
My gal, too
My gal, too"

I want to sleep before the end
Which is impolite

If nothing crops up
I'll give you a ring
You can sing the end

All the little animals out of my room
Hit it! With a broom

Nick Cave,Abattoir Blues,/n/nick+cave/abattoir+blues_20483162.html,"The sun is high up in the sky and I'm in my car
Drifting down into the abattoir
Do you see what I see, dear?

The air grows heavy. I listen to your breath
Entwined together in this culture of death
Do you see what I see, dear?

Slide on over here, let me give you a squeeze
To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory
Can you hear what I hear, babe?
Does it make you feel afraid?

Everything's dissolving, babe, according to plan
The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land
I went to bed last night and my
Moral code got jammed
I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand

I kissed you once. I kissed you again
My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange
Do you feel what I feel, dear?

Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy
These things are not good for me
Do you see what I see, dear?

The line the God throws down to you and me
Makes a pleasing geometry
Shall we leave this place now, dear?
Is there someway out of here?

I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work
The need for validation, babe, gone completely
Berserk
I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out such a
Jerk
I got the abattoir blues
I got the abattoir blues
I got the abattoir blues
Right down to my shoes"

Sometimes I swear I can still hear her howl
Down through the wreckage and the ruins

And it ain't gonna rain anymore

And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone

Now the storm has passed over me
I'm left to drift on a dead calm sea
And watch her forever through the cracks in the beams
Nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams

And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone
And it ain't gonna rain anymore
Now my baby's gone

Now I got no one to hold
Now I am all alone again
It ain't too hot but it ain't too cold
And there is no sign of rain

Offers many reflections
And I won't be held responsible
For my actions

A Concord dive, to drink a beer

And cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Why silks and plumes of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties

And what shall she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties

For whom none will go mourning

A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries

Sadly, or in the depths of winter
And no more shall we part

And all of birds will sing to your
Beautiful heart
Upon the bough
And no more shall we part

And all of those birds would've sung to your beautiful heart

Are you my destiny? Is this how you'll appear?
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

As you've been moving, surely toward me
My soul has comforted and assured me
That in time my heart it will reward me
And that all will be revealed
So I've sat and I've watched an ice-age thaw
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built
Out of longing great wonders have been willed
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill
And lay your head upon my shoulder
Outside my window the world has gone to war
Are you the one I've been waiting for?

O we will know... Won't we?
The stars will explode in the sky
But they don't... Do they?
Stars have their moment and then they die

There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him
He said, ""He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in""
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting
And how every little thing anticipates you
All down my veins my heart-strings call
Are you the one I've been waiting for?"
Nick Cave,As I Sat Sadly By Her Side,/n/nick+cave/as+i+sat+sadly+by+her+side_20313284.html,"As I sat sadly by her side
At the window, through the glass
She stroked a kitten in her lap
And we watched the world as it fell past
Softly she spoke these words to me
And with brand new eyes, open wide
We pressed our faces to the glass
As I sat sadly by her side

She said, ""Father, mother, sister, brother,
Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece,
Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer,
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest
Earth and moon and sun and stars
Planets and comets with tails blazing
All are there forever falling
Falling lovely and amazing""

Then she smiled and turned to me
And waited for me to reply
Her hair was falling down her shoulders
As I sat sadly by her side

As I sat sadly by her side
The kitten she did gently pass
Over to me and again we pressed
Our different faces to the glass
""That may be very well"", I said
""But watch the one falling in the street
See him gesture to his neighbours
See him trampled beneath their feet
All outward motion connects to nothing
For each is concerned with their immediate need
Witness the man reaching up from the gutter
See the other one stumbling on who can not see""

With trembling hand I turned toward her
And pushed the hair out of her eyes
The kitten jumped back to her lap
As I sat sadly by her side

Then she drew the curtains down
And said, ""When will you ever learn
That what happens there beyond the glass
Is simply none of your concern?
God has given you but one heart
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers

And God does not care for your benevolence
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others
Nor does he care for you to sit
At windows in judgement of the world He created
While sorrows pile up around you
Ugly, useless and over-inflated""

At which she turned her head away
Great tears leaping from her eyes
I could not wipe the smile from my face
As I sat sadly by her side"

You must learn to serve me well

You strike my side by accident
As you go down to your goal
This cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold
He does not ask for your company
Not at the centre, the centre of the world

I who am on a pedestal
You did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me now
To kneel grotesque and bare
For I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare

You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn what makes me kind
The crumbs of love that you offer me
Are the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just a shadow of my wound

I have begun to ask for you
I who have no greed
I have begun to long for you
I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe

Do not dress in those rags for me
I know you are not poor
And do not love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure
It is your turn, my beloved one
It is your flesh that I wear"

For the turn of your mouth
Your body is a long thing
Heading South
And I don't know what I'm talking about

Seasons have gone wrong
And I lay me down in a bed of snow
Darling, since you've been gone
Well my hands, they don't know where to go
And all of my teeth are bared,
I got you so much I'm scared
Ah, baby I got you bad

With the sweep of my hand
I undid all the plans
That explode at the moment I kissed you
On your small hot mouth
And your caramel limbs
That are hymns to the glory that is you.
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad
Baby I got you bad

Smoke bilowing from the bridges
And the rivers we swim in are boiling
My hands are reaching for you everywhere
But you're not there, or you're recoiling
And a weary moon dangles from a cloud
Oh honey, I know it's not allowed
To say I got you bad.

I got you bad...
I got you bad...

Like an idea
Like an Atom bomb

We stand awed inside a clearing
We do not make a sound
The crimson snow falls all about
Carpeting the ground

Everything is falling, dear
All rhyme and reason gone
It's just history repeating itself
And, babe, you turn me on

When I was a wee thing, I heard my mother say
That I was meant for rambling and would easy go astray
And before that I would work, I would rather sport and play
With my Johnny on the banks of red roses


On the banks of red roses, my love and I sat down
He took out his tuning box to play his love a tune
In the middle of the tune, his love got up and cried
Oh Johnny, lovely Johnny, would you leave me?


So they walked and they talked until they came upon a cave
Where the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave
Aye, the night before her darling had spent digging on her grave
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of red roses


Oh no, oh no, cried she, that grave's not meant for me
Yes, oh yes, my darling, that your bridal bed shall be
Yes, oh yes, my darling, that your bridal bed shall be
And he's made her to lie down on red roses


And all on his way homeward, his heart was filled with fear
Every maid he came upon, he thought it was his dear
Yes, every maid he came upon, he thought it was his dear
Who he made to lie down on red roses"

And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair
And her black hair framed a happy heart-shaped face

And heavy-hooded eyes inside her black hair
Shined at me from the depths of her hair of deepest black
While my fingers pushed into her straight black hair
Pulling her black hair back from her happy heart-shaped face

To kiss her milk-white throat, a dark curtain of black hair
Smothered me, my lover with her beautiful black hair
The smell of it is heavy. It is charged with life
On my fingers the smell of her deep black hair

Full of all my whispered words, her black hair
And wet with tears and good-byes, her hair of deepest black
All my tears cried against her milk-white throat
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair

As deep as ink and black, black as the deepest sea
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow
Where her head and all it's black hair did rest
Today she took a train to the west
Today she took a train to the west
Today she took a train to the west"

And I am breathless without you

And it bangs about the new-made leaves
For it is breathless without you
The fox chases the rabbit round
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
For he is defenceless without you
The sky of daytime dies away
And all the earthly things they stop to play
For we are all breathless without you
I listen to my juddering bones
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
And I am breathless without you

From one thousand miles away
And come into my sleep
Come into my sleep oh yeah
As midnight nears and shadows creep
Come into my sleep

Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair
For I am sick at heart, my dear
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair
For all the sorrow it will pass, my dear

Take your accusation, your recriminations
And toss them into the ocean blue
Leave your regrets and impossible longings
And scatter them across the sky behind you
And come into my sleep
Come into my sleep
For my soul to comfort and keep
Come into my sleep

For my soul to comfort and keep - my sleep

Come on,
Come on,
Come on,

Horrors in her head
That her tongue dare not name
She lives alone by the river
The rolling rivers of pain

Crow jane ah hah huh
There is one shining eye on a hard-hat
The company closed down the mine
Winking on waters they came
Twenty hard-hats, twenty eyes
In her clapboard shack
Only six foot by five
They killed all her whiskey
And poured their pistols dry

Seems you've remembered
How to sleep, how to sleep
The house dogs are in your turnips
And your yard dogs are running all over the street

O mr. Smith and mr. Wesson
Why you close up shop so late?
Just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird
Measured. 32, . 44, . 38
I asked that girl which road she was taking
Said she was walking the road of hate
But she stopped on a coal-trolley up to new haven
Population: 48

Your guns are drunk and smoking
They've followed you right back to your gate
Laughing all the way back from the new town

Nick Cave,Darker With The Day,/n/nick+cave/darker+with+the+day_20187972.html,"As so with that, I thought I'd take a final walk
The tide of public opinion had started to abate
The neighbours, bless them, had turned out to be all talk
I could see their frightened faces
Peering at me through the gate

I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope of keeping track of it
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure
And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it

And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street
I stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd
And love followed just behind me, panting at my feet
As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud

Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God
I searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook

Babe
It seems so long
Since you've been gone away
And I
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun
It was a Good day and an Evil day and all was bright and new
And it seemed to me that most destruction was being done
By those who could not choose between the two

Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones
The streets groan with little Caesars, Napoleons and cunts
With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs down their fronts

I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers
The Magnolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands
Great cracks appear in the pavement, the earth yawns
Bored and disgusted, to do us down

Babe
It seems so long
Since you've been gone
And I
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

These streets are frozen now. I come and go
Full of a longing for something I do not know
My father sits slumped in the deepening snow
As I search, in and out, above, about, below

Babe
It seems so long
Since you went away
And I
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day"

She breathed in the future, by breathing out the past

It's been there for many days
There's a dead man in my bed

I ain't been feeling that good too much no more, she said, I swear
She pointed at the bedroom door and said I ain't going in there
She leaped out of her seat and screamed someone's not concentrating here
There is a dead man in my bed, she said
I ain't speaking metaphorically
His eyes are open but he cannot see
There's a dead man in my bed

The leaves outside the window waved, all brown, they were, and falling
Even I could tell the atmosphere in here was utterly appalling
The phone it rang incessantly but nobody was calling
There's a dead man in my bed, she said
And though he keeps on taking notes
I swear this ain't some kind of hoax
Dead man in my bed

Now she's in the kitchen, rattling those pots and pans
I'd cook him something nice, she said, but he refuses to wash his hands
He used to be so good to me, now he smells so fucking bad
There is a dead man in my bed, she said
I keep poking at him with my stick
But his skin is just so fucking thick

Falls down and does not mend

Just remember that death is not the end
When you're standing on the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end

And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there's no-one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
For the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation
Up in dark and empty skies
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
When you search in vain to find
Some law-abiding citizen

Her dress floats down the well and it assumes the shape of the body of a little girl

Yeah I recognize that girl
She stumbled in some time last loneliness
But I could not stand to touch her now
My one and onlyness.

Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.

Worms make their cruel design
Saying D-I-E into her skin
Saying dead into belly and death into shoulder
Well last night she kissed me but than death was upon her.

Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.

Now the killed waits for the killer
And the trees all nod their heads, they are agreed
This knife feels like a knife feels like a knife that feels like it's feed.
Yeah I recognize that girl
I took her from rags right through to stitches (pray for me now)
Oh baby, tonight we sleep in separate ditches.

Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging.

Love is for fools and all fools are lovers
It's raining on my house and none of the others
Love is for fools and God knows I'm still one
The sidewalks are filled with love's lonely children
The sidewalk regrets that we had to kill them."

Dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself
Laz'rus dig yourself

Back in that hole

Larry made his nest high up in the autumn branches
Built from nothing but high hopes and thin air
He collected up some baby blasted mothers who took their chances
And for a while they lived quite happily up there

He came from New York City man, but he couldn't take the pace
He thought it was like dog eat dog world
Then he went to San Francisco, spent a year in outer space
With a sweet little San Franciscan girl

I can hear my mother wailing and a whole lot of scraping of chairs

I don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs

[Chorus:]
(I want you to dig) 
Back in that hole
(I want you to dig)
(I want you to dig)

Meanwhile Larry made up names for the ladies
Like Miss Boo and Miss Quick
He stockpiled weapons and took potshots in the air
He feasted on their lovely bodies like a lunatic
And wrapped himself up in their soft yellow hair

I can hear chants and incantations and some guy is mentioning me in his prayers.
Well, I don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs

[Chorus: ]
(I want you to dig)[Back in that hole.]
(I want you to dig)

Well L New York City man, San Francisco, LA, I don't know
But Larry grew increasingly neurotic and obscene
I mean he, he never asked to be raised from the tomb
I mean no one ever actually asked him to forsake his dreams
He ended up like so many of them do, back on the streets of New York City
In a soup queue, a dope fiend, a slave, then prison, then the madhouse, then the grave
Ah poor Larry

But what do we really know of the dead 
And who actually cares?

Well, I don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs

Nick Cave,Do You Love Me,/n/nick+cave/do+you+love+me_20192296.html,"I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'll love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On and endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

She had a heartful of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
Band the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?

All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Like I love you?"

Where no man before could be bothered to go
Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes
And it's all downhill with a bullet
This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course
I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces
Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit
The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle


Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?


There's a man in the theatre with girlish eyes
Who's holding my childhood to ransom
On the screen there's a death,
There's a rustle of cloth
And a sickly voice calling me handsome
There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes
On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla
There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla
This is a secret, mauled and mangled
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle


Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?


The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood
The lights go down, the red curtains come apart
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart
And the coins in my pocket jingle-jangle
As the great screen crackled and popped
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped
And my handsome little body oddly propped
And my trousers ride down to my ankles
Yes, onward! And upward!
And I'm off to find love
Do you love me? If you do, I'm thankful


Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?


This city is an ogre squatting by the river
It gives life but it takes it away, my youth
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver
This is a fact. This is a stone cold truth.
Do you love me? I love you, handsome.
But do you love me? Yes, I love you, you are handsome
Amongst the cogs and the wires, my youth
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth
Memories that become monstrous lies
So onward! And Onward! And Onward I go!
Onward! And Upward! And I'm off to find love
With blue-black bracelets on my wrists and my ankles
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle


Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

To sit within a fragrant breeze
All among the nodding trees
That hang heavy with the stuff

He threw his arms around my neck
He brushed the tear from my cheek
And held my soft white hand
He was an understanding man
He did not even barely hardly speak

Easy money
Rain it down on the wife and the kids
Rain it down on the house where we live
Rain until you got nothing left to give
And rain that ever-loving stuff down on me

All the things for which my heart yearns
Gives joy in diminishing returns
He kissed me on the mouth
His hands they headed south
And my cheek it burned

Money, man, it is a bitch
The poor, they spoil it for the rich
With my face pressed in the clover
I wondered when this would be over
And at home we are all so guilty-sad

Easy money
Pour it down the open drain
Pour it all through my veins
Pour it down, yeah, let it rain
And pour that ever-loving stuff down on me

Now, I'm sitting pretty down on the bank
Life shuffles past at a low interest rate
In the money-coloured meadows
And all the interesting shadows
They leap up, then dissipate

Easy money
Easy money

Rain it down on the wife and the kids
Rain it down on the house where we live
Rain it down until you got nothing left to give

And the brown ape in a cage

He tossed the ape a mouse

Farewell

The villagers found out that Farmer Emmerich
Was nurturing a serpent
And descended upon his farm
All rabid in their blindness
They dragged the snake outside
Chopped it open with an axe
And the ground soaked
In the milk of human kindness

And was heard to roam the ranges
Clanking it's heavy chain
Down in the valley it sang to it's friend
Whom he may never see again"

So far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea

With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face

I keep hearing that you're doing best
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast
You are so far from me
Far from me
Far from me

There is no knowledge but I know it
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime
It's good to hear you're doing so well
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell
Did you ever
Care for me?
Were you ever
There for me?
So far from me

You told me you'd stick by me
Through the thick and through the thin
Those were your very words

You were my brave-hearted lover
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother
So far from me

All those treasures, my friend,
You don't need them anymore.
Your days are all through dying,
They gave all their ghosts away,
So kiss close all your wounds and call living life a day.
For the planets gravitate around you,
And the stars shower down around you,
And the angels in heaven adore you,
And the saints all stand and applaud you.
So faraway,
So faraway and yet so close.

Say farewell to the passing of the years,
Though all your sweet goodbyes will fall upon deaf ears.
Kiss so softly the mouths of the ones you love,
Beneath the September moon and the heavens above.
And the world will turn without you,
And history will soon forget about you,
But the heavens they will reward you,
And the saints will be there to escort you.
So faraway,
So faraway and yet so close.

Do not grieve at the passing of mortality,
For life's but a thing of terrible gravity.
And the planets gravitate around you,
And the stars shall dance about you,
And the angels in heaven adore you,
And the saints all stand and applaud you.
So faraway,
So faraway and yet so close."

And hope sometimes that maybe you will understand
There is no order here and there is no middle ground
Nothing can be predicted and nothing can be planned
A star is just a memory of a star
We are fireflies pulsing dimly in the dark
We are here and you are where you are
We are here and you are where you are"

Love comes a-knocking
Comes a-knocking upon our door
But you, you and me, love
We don't live here any more

Foi na cruz, foi na cruz
Que um dia
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus
Foi na cruz
Que um dia
Foi na cruz

A little sleep, a little slumber
A little folding of the hands to sleep
A little love, a little hate, babe
A little trickery and deceit

Foi na cruz, foi na cruz
Que um dia
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus
Foi na cruz
Que um dia
Foi na cruz

Dream on 'till you can dream no more
For all our grand plans, babe
Will be dreams forever more

You kno, she lives in Apt. 29
Why... That's the one right up top a mine
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry
O ah hear her walkin
Walkin barefoot cross the floor-boards
All thru this lonesome night
And ah hear her crying too.
Hot-tears come splashin on down
Leaking thru the cracks,
Down upon my face, ah catch'em in my mouth!
Walk'n'cry Walk'n'cry-y!!!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Ah read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizin every lil piece of dirt
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt
Fled outa the window,
And shinning it down the vine
Outa her night-mare, and back into mine
Mine! O Mine!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Cry! Cry! Cry!
She's wearing them bloo-stockens, ah bet!
And standin like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen ah kno it must sound absurd
But ah can hear the most melancholy sound
Ah ever heard!
Walk'n'cry! Kneel'n'cry-y!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
O tell me why? Why? Why?
Why the ceiling still shakes?
Why the fixtures turn to serpants snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound
And it's naggin at me like a shrew
But, ah kno, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her.
O o o then ya kno, that lil girl would just have to go!
Go! Go-o-o! From her to eternity!"

If I could sail a galleon ship, a long, lonely rider across the sky
Seek out mysteries while you sleep
And treasures money cannot buy
For you know I see you everywhere
A servant girl, an empress
My galleon ship will fly and fall
Fall and fly and fly and fall
Deep into your loveliness

[Chorus]
And if we rise my love
Before the daylight comes
A thousand galleon ships will sail
Ghostly around the morning sun

As the city rises up, as the city rises up, as the city rises up

[Verse 2]
For we are not alone, it seems, so many riders in the sky
The winds of longing in their sails, searching for the other side

[Chorus]
And if we rise my love
Oh my darling precious one
We'll stand and watch the galleon ships
Circle around the morning sun"
Nick Cave,Gates To The Garden,/n/nick+cave/gates+to+the+garden_20210089.html,"Past the ivy-covered windows of
The Angel
Down Athenaeum Lane to the cathedral
Through the churchyard I wandered
Sat for a spell there and I pondered
My back to the gates of the garden
My back to the gates of the garden
My back to the gates of the garden

Fugitive fathers, sickly infants, decent mothers
Runaways and suicidal lovers
Assorted boxes of ordinary bones
Of aborted plans and sudden shattered hopes
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden
In unhappy rows, up to the gates of the garden
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden


Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
To the garden


Beneath the creeping shadow of the tower
The bell from St. Edmunds informs me of the hour
I turn to find you waiting there for me
In sunlight and I see the way that you breathe
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden


Leave these ancient places to the angels
Let the saints attend to their keeping of the cathedrals
And leave the dead beneath the ground so cold
For God is in this hand that I hold
As we open up the gates of the garden


Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
To the garden"

Ever really happens
And God rides high up in the ordinary sky
Until we find ourselves at out most distracted
And the miracle that was promised
Creeps quietly by

Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world

Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!

The mighty wave their hankies from their
High-windowed palace
Sending grief and joy down in supportable doses
And we search high and low without
Merty or malice
While the gate to the Kingdom swings
Shut and closes

Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world

Praise Him till you've forgotten
What you're praising Him for
Praise Him till you've forgotten
What you're praising Him for
Then praise Him a little bit more

Yeah, praise Him a little bit more
Praise Him till you've forgotten
What you're praising Him for
Praise Him tillyou've forgotten what
You're praising Him for
Praise Him a little bit more
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more

Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Get ready!

I searched the seven seas and I've looked
Under the carpet
And browsed through the brochures
That govern the skies
Then I was just hanging around, doing
Nothing und looked up to see
His face burned in the retina of your eyes

Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world

Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!"

There goes the moonlit man
Got a suitcase in his hand
He's moving on down the road
Things tend to fall apart starting with his heart
He kisses you lightly and he leaves
Leaves your sleeping body
Curled and dreaming around your smile, your smile

The three bears watch the tv
They age a lifetime, oh lord
Mama bear holds the remote, papa bear he just floats
And baby bear, he has gone to the moon in a boat, on a boat
I'm speaking about love now
And how the lights of love go down
You're in the back room washing his clothes
Love's like that, you know, it's like a tidal flow
And the past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go
Won't ever let you go

If I could move the night I would
And I would turn the world around if I could
There's wrong with loving something you can't hold in your hand
You're sitting on the bed, smoking and shaking your head
Well there's nothing wrong with loving things that can't even stand

Well there goes your moony man
With his suitcase in his hand
Every road is lined with animals
That rise from their blood and walk
Well the moon won't get a wink of sleep
If I stay all night and talk, if I stay and talk"

Place for crime to hide
Our little church is painted white
And in the safety of the night
We all go quiet as a mouse
For the word is out
God is in the house
God is in the house
God is in the house
No cause for worry now
God is in the house

Moral sneaks in the White House
Computer geeks in the school house
Drug freaks in the crack house
We don't have that stuff here
We have a tiny little Force
But we need them of course
For the kittens in the trees
And at night we are on our knees
As quiet as a mouse
For God is in the house
God is in the house
God is in the house
And no one's left in doubt
God is in the house

Homos roaming the streets in packs
Queer bashers with tyre-jacks
Lesbian counter-attacks
That stuff is for the big cities
Our town is very pretty
We have a pretty little square
We have a woman for a mayor
Our policy is firm but fair
Now that God is in the house
God is in the house
God is in the house
Any day now He'll come out
God is in the house

Well-meaning little therapists
Goose-stepping twelve-stepping Tetotalitarianists
The tipsy, the reeling and the drop down pissed
We got no time for that stuff here
Zero crime and no fear
We've bred all our kittens white
So you can see them in the night
And at night we're on our knees
As quiet as a mouse
Since the word got out
From the North down to the South
For no-one's left in doubt
There's no fear about
If we all hold hands and very quietly shout
Hallelujah
God is in the house
God is in the house
Oh I wish He would come out
God is in the house"

Nick Cave,Grief Came Riding,/n/nick+cave/grief+came+riding_20483146.html,"A grief came riding
On the wind
Up the [Solemn] river Thames
I was sittin' on the bank with my mouth open
When I felt it entering

I began thinkin' about our wedding day
And how love was a vow
I was thinkin' about the chamber door
Only we can enter now

I began thinkin' about our ancient friends
And of kissin' them goodbye
And then the wind blew under Battersea bridge
And a tear broke from my eye

I started thinkin' about London
[How] nothing good ever came from this town
And if the Thames weren't so filthy
I would jump in the river and drown

Don't be afraid
Come on down
I'm just sittin' here
Thinking loud

[A grief came riding on the wind
Up the river where the bridges crouch
Blowin' people back and forth
From the marital bed to the psychiatric couch]

Blowin' people far apart
Blowin' others so they collide
Blowin' some poor bastard right out of the water
Blowin' another one over the side

Hear the ancient iron bridge
And listen to it groan
With the weight of a thousand people
Leavin' or returning home

To their failures
To their bordoms
To their husbands
And their [wives]
Who are carving them up for dinner
Before they even arrive

Don't be afraid
Come on down
I'm just sittin' here
[Thinking loud]

Now look there just [Below] the water
See the saviour of the human race,
[with] the fishes and the frogs,
Has found his final resting place

Don't be afraid
Come on down

I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning As a warning
As a warning

I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were I'll prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all it's teeth bared
All it's teeth bared All it's teeth bared
All it's teeth bared.

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud Like a shroud
Like a shroud

There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation That invitation
That invitation

Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home
Singing my song

Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry
Them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in

The tears are welling in my eyes again

Nick Cave,Hiding All Away,/n/nick+cave/hiding+all+away_20483142.html,"You went looking for nur, dear,
Down by the sea
You found some Iittle silver fish
But you didn't find me
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way

You went to the museum
You climbed a spiral stair
You searched for me all among
The knowledgeable air
I was hidden, babe, hiding all away
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away

You entered the cathedral
When you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the hell
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away

You asked an electrician
If he'd seen me round his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away
I was not there, dear, hiding all away

You went and asked your doctor
To get some advice
He shot you full of Pethidine
And then he billed you twice

But I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
But I was hiding, dear, hiding all away

You approached a high court judge
You thought he'd be on the level
He wrapped a rag around your face
And beat you with his gavel
I was hiding, habe, hiding all away
I was hidden, dem, hiding all away

You asked at the local constabulary
They said, he's up to his same old tricks
They leered at you with their baby blues
And rubbed jelly on their sticks
I had to get out of there, babe, hiding all away
I had to get out of there, dear, hiding all away

You searched through all my poets
From Sappho through to Auden
I saw the book fall from your hands
As you slowly died of boredom
I had been there, dear,
But I was not there anymore
I had been there, now I'm hiding all way

You walked into the ball of fame
And approached my imitators
Some were stuffing their faces with caviar
Some were eating cold potatoes
I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
I was hiding, dear, hiding all away

You asked a famous cook if he'd seen me
He opened his oven wide
He basted you with butter, babe
And made you crawl inside
I was not in there, dear, hiding all away
I was not in there, dear, hiding all away

You asked the butcher
Who lifted up his cleaver
Stuck his fist up your dress
Said he must've been mad to leave you
But I had to get away, dear, hiding all away
I had to get away, dear, I was hidden all away

Some of us we hide away
Some of us we don't
Some will live to love another day
And some of us won't
But we all know there is a law
And that law, it is love
And we all know there's a war coming
Coming from above

There is a war coming
There is a war coming"
Nick Cave,Higgs Boson Blues,/n/nick+cave/higgs+boson+blues_21051888.html,"Can't remember anything at all
Flame trees line the streets
Can't remember anything at all
But I'm driving my car down to Geneva

I've been sitting in my basement patio
Aye, it was hot
Up above, girls walk past, the roses all in bloom
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson blues
I'm goin' down to Geneva baby, gonna teach it to you

Who cares, who cares what the future brings?
Black road long and I drove and drove
I came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson,
With a ten dollar guitar strapped to his back,
Lookin' for a tune

Well here comes Lucifer,
With his canon law,
And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil man
Don't know who's gonna rip off who

Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singin' the Higgs Boson blues,
I'm tired, I'm lookin' for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis now
In the Lorraine Motel, it's hot, it's hot
That's why they call it the Hot Spot
I take a room with a view
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yea
Making the hot cocks in the flophouse bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
And a bellhop hops and bops
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues

If I die tonight, bury me
In my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
That the caliphate forced on the Jews
Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat?

Hannah Montana does the African Savannah
As the simulated rainy season begins
She curses the queue at the Zulus
And moves on to Amazonia
And cries with the dolphins
Mama ate the pygmy
The pygmy ate the monkey
The monkey has a gift that he is sending back to you
Look here comes the missionary
With his smallpox and flu
He's saving them savages
With his Higgs Boson Blues
I'm driving my car down to Geneva
I'm driving my car down to Geneva

Oh let the damn day break
The rainy days always make me sad
Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake
And you're the best girl I've ever had
Can't remember anything at all"

The kid with a bat face appeared at the window then disappeared into the headlights
I was halfway to the pacific coast
I had left you in your longing and your yearning like a ghost
There's little room for wonder now, and little room for wildness too
We crawl into our wounds
I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
I'm gonna buy me a house up in the hills
With a tear-shaped pool and a gun that kills
Cause they say there is a cougar that roams these parts
With a terrible engine of wrath for a heart
That she is white and rare and full of all kinds of harm
And stalks the perimeter all day long
But at night lays trembling in my arms

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my place in the sun
And I'm just waiting now, for peace to come

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And we hide in our wounds and I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
And I know my time will come one day soon
I'm waiting for peace to come
And I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
Oh babe we're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run
Halfway down the Pacific coast
I left you sleeping like a ghost in your wounds

Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Somewhere, don't know

Now I'm standing on the shore
All the animals roam the beaches
Sea creatures rise out of the sea
And I'm standing on the shore
Everyone begins to run
The kid drops his bucket and spade and climbs into the sun

Kisa had a baby, but the baby died
Goes to the villages, says my baby's sick
Villagers shake their heads and say to her
Better bury your baby in the forest quick
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
Kisa went to the mountain and ask the Buddha
My baby's sick, Buddha said don't cry
Go to each house and collect a mustard seed
But only from a house where no one's died
Kisa went to each house in the village
My baby's getting sicker, poor Kisa cried
But Kisa never collected one mustard seed
Because every house, someone had died
Kisa sat down in the old village square
She hugged her baby and cried and cried
She said everybody is always losing somebody
Then walked into the forest and buried her child
Everybody's losing someone
Everybody's losing someone
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind

Nick Cave,"How Long, How Long Blues",/n/nick+cave/how+long+how+long+blues_20100247.html,"Leroy Carr

A traditional song which was a likely inspiration for The Train Song.

How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?
How long, how long, baby how long.

Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain.
How long, How long, how long.

If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back.

I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me.

I can see the green grass growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill.

I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me.

The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me."

Up there in your leather babe
With your ivory and [?]

Things down here are fragmatic
In fact they've exploded all over the room
I think everything's a little off-center, babe

You said, that to love me you must set me free
Now, that may all be very well
Still I miss you baby
More than words can ever tell

Sometimes I can not sleep
The greatness of my hate for you
Sometimes I can not sleep
For I miss you

May your day be bright as the eyes
Of the girl that I once knew
May your sun be happy yellow, babe
And your sky be baby blue

I miss your manic scratches
And your howling at the moon
Ten steps behind me
With your dustpan and broom

I hope you wish for me
All the things I wish for you
Health, hope and happiness
The sun and the moon

Who really don't have a clue
I'll be calling you soon

I had a dream, joe
You were standing in the middle of an open road
I had a dream, joe
Your hands were raised up to the sky
And your mouth was covered in foam
I had a dream, joe
A shadowy jesus flitted from tree to tree
I had a dream, joe
And a society of whores stuck needles in an image of me
I had a dream, joe
It was autumn time and thickly fell the leaves
And in that dream, joe
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick
And pointed his finger at me

I had a dream,
I had a dream,
I had a dream, joe

I opened my eyes, joe
The night had been a giant, dribbling and pacing the boards
I opened my eyes, joe
All your letters and cards stacked up against the door
I opened my eyes, joe
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack
In the window, joe
And I thought of you and I felt like I was lugging
A body on my back

I had a dream,
I had a dream,
I had a dream, joe

Where did you go, joe?
On that endless, senseless, demented drift
Where did you go, joe?
Into the woods, into the trees, where you move and shift
Where did you go, joe?
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit
Where did you go, joe?
With that strew of wreckage
Forever at the heel of your boot

I woke up this morning with the sun out shining in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag but then
I tripped on a cloud and fell eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in


I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then i followed in
I watched myself crawling out now, as i came crawling in
I got up so tight i couldn't unwind
I saw so much, i broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in


Somebody painted april fool in big black letters on a dead end sign
I had my foot on the gas as i left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles out of memphis and i got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in"

A life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole

We will meet again, my love

If you're in heaven then you'll forgive me, dear
Because that's what they do up there
If you're in hell, then what can I say
You probably deserved in anyway
I guess I'm gonna find out any day
For we'll meet again
And there'll be hell to pay

Your face comes to me from the depths, dear
Your silent mouth mouths, 'yes', dear
Dark red and big with blood
They're gonna shut me down, my love
They're gonna launch me into the stars
Well, all things come to pass
Glory hallelujah

Are we that blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?

And the world turns
And the hungry little boy with the runny nose
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun and steals a car
He tries to run but he don't get far
And his mama cries
A crowd gathers round an angry young man
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto

Oh people don't you understand
This child needs a helping hand
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day

To make bright and clear your path
And to walk, like christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms

Suddenly I realize nobody knows me

Where yesterday the multitude
Screamed and cried my name out for a song
Today the streets are empty
And the crowds have all gone home

I pass a million houses
But there is no place that I belong
All I knew to give you
Was song after song after song

All the truths I tried to tell you
Were as distant to you as the moon
Born 200 years too late
And 200 years too soon

I'm a child of this age
Locked into the pages of your book
And when I am but dust and clay
And all the children stop to take a look

Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform
And the heights I did aspire
Or will they tear out the pages of the book
To light a fire

With the rain on my face
There is no place that I belong

And did you forget my song?"

Why, only Jennifer knows that now.
And the officer, without a word,
Left all his junk and just moved out.

So don't try to reach out
And don't let the ship's flag down
Point the figure-head at the glass
Smash! Smash! Into shards
Don't stop and don't touch!
And don't let the veil drop... Behind Jennifer's veil

Oh God! Frankie! Is that really you!
Get back! Don't reach out!
Get back, and get that lantern out of my room!

Don't try to reach out
And don't let the ship's flag down
Down, down over her, like a shroud

And let her sail on the sea like a stone.
Don't touch and don't touch
And don't let the veil drop
Another ship ready to dock... The rigging comes loose..."
Nick Cave,Jesus Met The Woman At The Well,/n/nick+cave/jesus+met+the+woman+at+the+well_20100124.html,"(Traditional, Arr. The Alabama Singers)

Jesus met the woman at the well
Jesus met the woman at the well
And he told her, everything that she'd done, that she'd done

And he said, woman, look-a here woman,
Tell me where is your husband?
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't have one

He said, woman, look-a here woman,
They tell me you have five husbands
And that man you have now sure ain't one

She went running, crying, God help me
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you must be the prophet
Because you told me everything that I've done"
Nick Cave,John Finn's Wife,/n/nick+cave/john+finns+wife_20100043.html,"Well the night was deep and the night was dark
And I was at the old dance-hall on the edge of town
Some big ceremony was going down
Dancers writhed and squirmed and then,
Came apart and then writhed again
Like squirming flies on a pin
In the heat and in the din
Yes, in the heat and in the din
I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad john finn

Well, midnite came and clock did strike
And in she came, did john finn's wife
With legs like scissors and butcher's knives
A tattooed breast and flaming eyes
And a crimson carnation in her teeth
Carving her way through the dance floor
And I'm standing over by the bandstand
Every eye gaping on john finn's wife
Yeah, every eye gaping on john finn's wife

Now john finn's wife was something of a mystery
In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty
I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife
Over near the bandstand with john finn's wife
She got perfumed breasts and raven hair
Sprinkled with wedding confettis
And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares
Armed, as they were, with machetes
And the night through the window was full of lights
Winking and awatching at john finns' wife
Winking and awatching at john finns' wife

Next came the cops, all out on the town
But it don't look like no trouble there
As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits
And I slip my hand between the thighs of john finn's wife
And they seemed to yawn awake, her things
It was a warm and very ferocious night
The moon full of blood and light
And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight
As I plotted in the ear of john finns' wife

Enter john finn in his shrunken suit
With his quick black eyes and black cheroot
With his filled-down teeth and a hobnail boot
And his fists full of pistols in his pockets
Aiming at me and aiming at his wife
The band fall silent fearing for their lives
And with fear in my guts like tangled twine
Cause all I got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife
And mad john finns' wife is all
And the three of us walk out of the hall

Now the night bore down upon us all
You could hear the crickets in the thickets call
And guns did flare and guns did bawl
And I planted my bolo knife in the neck
Of mad john finn. I took his wretched life
Now I'm over near the bandstand
Every hand moving on john finns' wife
Every hand moving on john finns' wife

And john finns' wife
Took all the flowers down
From her hair
And threw them on the ground
And the flies did hum
And the flies did buzz around
Poor john finn
Lying dead upon the ground
Lying dead upon the ground"
Nick Cave,Jubilee Street,/n/nick+cave/jubilee+street_21051884.html,"On Jubilee street there was a girl named Bee
She had a history, but no past
When they shut her down the Russians moved in
Now I am to scared to even walk on past

She used to say:
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Here they are to practice what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I’m pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I’m pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Streets
I look at them now

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well a girl’s gotta make ends meet
Even down Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to &#7767; ractice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a foetus on the leash

I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
Curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I’m transforming, I’m vibrating, I’m glowing
I’m flying, look at me
I’m flying, look at me now"

We went to take an evenin' walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
""Oh Willard dear don't kill me here I'm unprepared to die
""She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me with it her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and round
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down go down you Knoxville girl with dark and rollin' eyes
Go down go down you Knoxville girl you can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville got there about midnight
My mother she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying ""Dear son what have you done to bloody your clothes so""
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding at my nose

I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed, and in my eyes could see

They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away downb in this dirty all jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so well!"

Take this bread and take this wine

But the world you left behind
Well, do not breathe, nor make a sound
And behold your mighty work
That towers over the uncaring ground
Of a lesser, darker world

Let the bells ring
He is the real thing
Let the bells ring
He is the real, real thing

There are those of us not fit to tie
The laces of your shoes
Must remain behind to testify
Through an elementary blues
So, let's walk outside, the hour is late
Through your crumbs and scattered shells
Where the awed and the mediocre wait
Barely fit to ring the bells

She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me


Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me


The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife


Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near
She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries on my bones"

Yeah, it makes a long time man feel bad
Well I ain't had no love since I don't know when
It sure makes a long time man feel bad


We was down in Jacksonville
A cold winter night
My baby and I, we began to fight
I heated up, and I grabbed my gun
I get so cold on those nights down south


She was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor
She looked up at me and began to smile
Her gasping words: ""Baby, I love you""
Then she closed those baby blue eyes

Sometimes I hear you call my name in the dead of the night


I ain't had those arms around me
I ain't had those lips, those lips, around me


It sure makes a long time man feel bad
So bad"

I'll apply them all to thee. ""

""I can't get down and I shan't get down,

She murdered mortal he.

""Get well, get well,"" said she.
""Oh don't you see my own heart's blood
Come flowin' down so free? ""

And also by his feet.
She plunged him into well water, where
It runs both cold and deep.

""Til the flesh rots off your bones.

Will mourn for your return. ""

Would kill a little bird like me. """

Love letter, love letter
Go tell her, go tell her

A wicked wind whips up the hill
Hand full of hopeful words
I love her and I always will
The sky is ready to burst

Said something I did not mean to say
Said something I did not mean to say
Said something I did not mean to say
It all came out the wrong way

Love letter, love letter
Go get her, go get her
Love letter, love letter
Go tell her, go tell her

Rain your kisses down upon me
Rain your kisses down in storms
For all will come before me
In your thin and fading forms

Out of my mind
Will leave me standing in the rain
With a letter and a prayer
Whispered on the wind

Come back to me
Come back to me
Oh, baby, please come back to me"

There she stands, there she stands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her hands
So I asked this lovely creature
Yes, I asked. yes I asked
Would she walk with me a while
Through this night so fast
She took my hand, this lovely creature
Yes, she said, yes, she said
Yes, I'll walk with you a while
It was a joyful man she led
Over hills, this lovely creature
Over mountains, over ranges
By great pyramids and sphinxs
We met drifters and strangers
Oh the sands, my lovely creature
And the mad, moaning winds
At night the deserts writhed
With diabolical things
Through the night, through the night
The wind lashed and it whipped me
When I got home, my lovely creature
She was no longer with me
Somewhere she lies, this lovely creature
Beneath the slow drifting sands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her hands"

The moon it was low
It was the end of love
Of misery and woe

Then suddenly above me
Her face buried in light
Came a vision of beauty
All covered in white

Now the bell-tower is ringing
And the night has stole past
O Lucy, can you hear me?
Wherever you rest

I'll love her forever
I'll love her for all time
I'll love her till the stars
Fall down from the sky
Now the bell-tower is ringing
And I shake on the floor
O Lucy, can you hear me?
When I call and call

Now the bell-tower is ringing
And the moon it is high
O Lucy, can you hear me
When I cry and cry and cry"

And he wears them in his face
And Macheath has got a knife
But not in such an obvious place

Now see the shark, how red his fins are
As he slashes at his prey
Mack the Knife wears fancy gloves
Which gives a minimum away

By the Thames' turbid waters
Men abruptly tumble down
Well is it plague, or is it cholera
Or because Macky's in town?

And the child bride, in her nighty
Whose assailant's still at large
Violated in her slumbers
Macky how much did you charge?

In the ghastly fire in Soho
Seven children had a go
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife
But he isn't asked and he don't know

In the crowd stands Mack The Knife
But he ain't asked and he don't know"

My camel skin was torture
I was in a state of nature
The wind, sir, it was wicked
I was so alone
Just as I predicted
My followers were gone

And I cried 'Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I got down on my knees

Thrown into a dungeon
Bread and water was my portion
Faith - my only weapon
To rest the devil's legion
The speak-hole would slide open
A viper's voice would plead
Thick with innuendo
Syphilis and Greed

And she cried 'Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I told her to get down on her knees

In a garden full of roses
My hands, tied behind me
My cousin was working miracles
I wondered if he'd find me
The moon was turned toward me
Like a platter made of gold
My death, it almost bored me
So often was it told

And I cried 'Mercy'
I cried mercy on me
Cryind 'Mercy'
Have mercy on me"

I was no match
I was fired from her crutch
Now I sit around and watch
The mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks
They are beyond our touch
I watch and watch
Wave at me
They wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

All the ones who come
All the ones who go
Down to the water
All the ones who come
All the ones who go
Down to the sea

I believe in God
I believe in mermaids too
I believe in 72 virgins on a chain (why not, why not)
I believe in the rapture
For I've seen your face
On the floor of the ocean
At the bottom of the ray

I do drive a relentless course
I do husband alertness course
I do mermaid alertness course
Watch them out on the rocks
Wave at me
Wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

All the ones who come
All the ones who go
Down to the water

I saved you the best seat in the house
Right up in the front row
The stars have been torn down
The moon is locked away
And the land is banked in frozen snow

You are a forte of nature, dear
Your breath curls from your lips
As the trees bend down their branches
And touch you with their fingertips
They're bringing out the dead now
It's easy just to look away
They are bringing out the dead now
It's been a strange, strange day

We could navigate out position by the stars
But they've taken out the stars
The stars have all gone
I'm glad you've come along
We could comprehend our
Condition by the moon
But they've ordered the the moon not to shine
Still, I 'm glad you've come along
I was worried out of my mind
Cause, they keep bringing out the dead
It's easy just to look away
They're bringing out the dead, now
And it's been a long, strange day

You can move up a little closer
I will throw a blanket over
We can weigh all the tears in one hand
Against the laughter in the other
We could be hanging around here for centuries
Trying to make sense of this, my dear
While the planets try to get organised
Way above the stratosphere
But they keep bringing out the dead, now
It's easy if we just walk away
They keep bringing out the dead, now
It's been a long, long day

Look away
Look away"

Where he had often been before.


He said, ""Missy Mouse, are you within?""
""Yes kind sir, I sit and spin.""


He took Missy Mouse upon his knee
And said ""Missy Mouse, will you marry me?""


""Without my Uncle Rat's consent""
""I wouldn't marry the pres-I-dent.""


Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides,
To think his niece would be a bride.


When Uncle Rat gave his consent
The weasel wrote the publishment.


Where will the wedding supper be?
Way down yonder in a holler tree.


What will the wedding supper be?
Two green beans and a black-eyed pea.


The first guest in was a bumblebee
He danced a jig with a crook-backed flea.


The owl did hoot, the birds they sang
And through the woods the music rang.


They all went sailing 'cross the lake
And got swallered up by a big black snake


There's bread and cheese upon the shelf
If you want any more you can sing it yourself."

Turn my back on what I've left below

Nick Cave,Nature Boy,/n/nick+cave/nature+boy_20483132.html,"I was just a boy when I sat down
To watch the news on tv
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
She moves something deep inside of me

I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion,
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek

She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
And through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again

She moves among the sparrows
And she walks across the sea
She moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me

She moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
And she moves right up close to me"

All to protect myself, you see
From the demon that was coming from the East
Or from the west

And when at last the demon came
From the East or from the West
And awoke me from my sleep
And awoke me to a particular point of view
And the needle-boy stuck him in the eye
And the money-man chocked him with coins
The spider-child bit him on the ankle

Did hover unearthly
In banners of fire
I kneit in the garden
Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes

Said you wouldn't be the first

To a bottle on the shelf

Her little daughter siobhan
Pulled beers from dusk till down
And amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke
But she pulled the best beer in town
I swooped magnificent upon her
As she sat shivering in her grief
Like the madonna painted on the church-house wall
In whale's blood and banana leaf
Her throat it crumbled in my fist
And I spun heroically around
To see caffrey rising from his seat
I shot that mother fucker down
Mmmmmmmmmm yeah yeah yeah
I have no free will, I sang
As I flew about the murder
Mrs. Richard holmes, she screamed
You really should have heard her
I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept
I panted like a pup
I blew a hole in mrs. Richard holmes
And her husband stupidly stood up
As he screamed, you are an evil man
And I paused a while to wonder
If I have no free will then how can I
Be morally culpable, I wonder
I shot richard holmes in the stomach
And gingerly he sat down
And he whispered weirdly, no offense
And then lay upon the ground
None taken, I replied to him
To which he gave a little cough
With blazing wings I neatly aimed
And blew his head completely off
I've lived in this town for thirty years
And to no-one I am a stranger
And I put new bullets in my gun
Chamber upon chamber
And I turned my gun on the bird-like mr. Brookes
I thought of saint francis and his sparrows
And as I shot down the youthful richardson
It was st. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows
Hhhhhhhhhh mmmmmmmmmmmm
I said, I want to introduce myself
And I am glad that all you came
And I leapt upon the bar
And shouted out my name
Well jerry bellows, he hugged his stool
Closed his eyes and shrugged and laughed
And with an ashtray as big as a fucking really big brick
I split his head in half
His blood spilled across the bar
Like a steaming scarlet brook
And I knelt at it's edge on the counter
Wiped the tears away and looked
Well, the light in there was blinding
Full of God and ghosts of truth
I smiled at henry davenport
Who made an attempt to move
Well, from the position I was standing
The strangest thing I ever saw
The bullet entered through the top of his chest
And blew his bowels out on the floor
Well I floated down the counter
Showing no remorse
I shot a hole in kathleen carpenter
Recently divorced
But remorse I felt and remorse I had
It clung to every thing
From the raven's hair upon my head
To the feathers on my wings
Remorse sqeezed my hand in it's fradulent claw
With it's golden hairless chest
And I glided through the bodies
And killed the fat man vincent west
Who sat quietly in his chair
A man become a child
And I raised the gun up to his head
Executioner-style
He made no attempt to resist
So fat and dull and lazy
Did you know I lived in your street? I said
And he looked at me as though I were crazy
O, he said, I had no idea
And he grew as quiet as a mouse
And the roar of the pistol when it went off
Near blew that hat right off the house
Hmmmmmm uh uh
Well, I caught my eye in the mirror
And gave it a long and loving inspection
There stands some kind of man, I roared
And there did, in the reflection
My hair combed back like a raven's wing
My muscles hard and tight
And curling from the business end of my gun
Was a query-mark of cordite
Well I spun to the left, I spun to the right
And I spun to the left again
Fear me! Fear me! Fear me!
But no one did cause they were dead
Huh! Hmmmmmmmmm
And then there were the police sirens wailing
And a bull-horn squelched and blared
Drop your weapons and come out
With your hands held in the air
Well, I checked the chamber of my gun
Saw I had one final bullet left
My hand, it looked almost human
As I raised it to my head
Drop your weapon and come out!
Keep your hands above your head!
I had one one long hard think about dying
And did exactly what they said
There must have been fifty cops out there
In a circle around o'malley's bar
Don't shoot, I cried, I'm a man
Unarmed!
So they put me in their car
And they sped me away from that terrible scene
And I glanced out of the window
Saw o'malley's bar, saw the cops and the cars
And I started counting on my fingers
Aaaaaah one aaaaaah two aaaaaah three aaaaaaah four
O'malley's bar o'malley's bar"
Nick Cave,Oh My Lord,/n/nick+cave/oh+my+lord_20100270.html,"I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My kids lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
Kissed her softly on the brow
Tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, or something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her
Oh Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I'd lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion,
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see, the way they stared at me
The Spear of Destiny are sticking right through me
Oh Lord
Oh my lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord
Oh lord
Oh My Lord

Now I'm at the hairdresser's
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, ""What are you looking for?""
I scream, ""The plot, the plot!""
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, ""Leave us alone!"" I say ""Hey, it's only me""
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see

Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but to pray with care
For the tears you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, o where the spike and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma!
Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all!
For what they went and done to you
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord"

Down at the port I watch the boats come in

And the kids gather around with an outstretched hand
And I toss them a diram or two

Well, I wonder if my children are thinking of me
Cause I am what I am, and what will be will be

And I smile and I sip my opium tea

At night the sea lashes the rust red ramparts
And the shapes of hooded men who pass me
And the moan of the wind laughs and laughs and laughs
The strange luck that fate has cast me

Well, the cats on the rampart sing merrily
That he is what he is and what will be will be
Yeah, the cats on the rampart sing merrily
And I sit and I drink of my opium tea

I'm a prisoner here, I can never go home
There is nothing here to win or lose
There are no choices needed to be made at all
Not even the choice of having to choose

Nick Cave,Oxford Tragedy,/n/nick+cave/oxford+tragedy_10192252.html,"From english folk songs from the southern appalachians, sharp. collected from mary wilson and mrs. townley, kentucky, 1917


Once there was a little tailor boy
About sixteen years of age;
My father hired me to a miller
That i might learn the trade.


I fell in love with a knoxville girl,
Her name was flora dean.
Her rosy cheeks, her curly hair,
I really did admire.


Her father he persuaded me
To take flora for a wife;
The devil he persuaded me
To take flora's life.


Up stepped her mother so bold and gay,
So boldly she did stand;
Johnny dear, go marry her
And take her off my hands.


I went unto her father's house
About nine o'clock at night,
A-asking her to take a walk
To do some prively talk.


We had not got so very far
Till looking around and around,
He stooping down picked up a stick
And knocks little flora down.


She fell upon her bended knees,
For mercy she did cry:
O johnny dear, don't murder me,
For i'm not fit to die.


I took her by her lily-white hands
A-slung her around and around;
I drug her off to the river-side,
And plunged her in to drown.


I returned back to my miller's house
About nine o'clock at night,
But little did my miller know
What i had been about.


The miller turned around and about,
Said:"" johnny, what blooded your clothes?""
Me being so apt to take a hint:
By bleeding at the nose.


About nine or ten days after that,
Little flora she was found
A-floating down by her father's house
Who lived in knoxville town."
Nick Cave,"Papa Won't Leave You, Henry",/n/nick+cave/papa+wont+leave+you+henry_20100044.html,"I went out walking the other day
The wind hung wet around my neck
My head it rung with screams and groans
From the night I spent amongst her bones
I passed beside the mission house
Where that mad old buzzard, the reverend,
Shrieked and flapped about life after your dead
Well, I thought about my friend, michel
How they rolled him in linoleum
And shot him in the neck
A bloody halo, like a think-bubble
Circling his head
And I bellowed at the firmament
Looks like the rains are hear to stay
And the rain pissed down upon me
And washed me all away
Saying

Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Well, the road is long
And the road is hard
And many fall by the side
But papa won't leave you, henry
So there ain't no need to cry

And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road

Well, the moon it looked exhausted
Like something you should pity
Spent an age-spotted
Above the sizzling wires of the city
Well, it reminded me of her face
Her bleached and hungry eyes
Her hair was like a curtain
Falling open with the laughter
And closing with the lies
But the ghost of her still lingers on
Though she's passed through me
And is gone
The slum dogs, they are barking
And the rain children on the streets
And the tears that we will weep today
Will all be washed away
By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow

Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
For the road is long
And the road is hard
And many fall by the side
But papa won't leave you, henry
So there ain't no need to cry

And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road

And I came upon a little house
A little house upon a hill
And I entered through, the curtain hissed
Into the house with it's blood-red bowels
Where wet-lipped women with greasy fists
Crawled the ceilings and the walls
They filled me full of drink
And led me round the rooms
Naked and cold and grinning
Until everything went black
And I came down spinning
I awoke so drunk and full of rage
That I could hardly speak
A fag in a whale-bone corset
Draping his dick across my cheek
And it's into the shame
And it's into a guilt
And it's into the fucking fray
And the walls ran red around me
A warm arterial spray
Saying

Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Well, the night is dark
And the night is deep
And it's jaws are open wide
But papa won't leave you, henry
So there ain't no need to cry

And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road

It's the rainy season where I'm living
Death comes leaping out of every doorway
Wasting you for money, for your clothes
And for your nothing
Entire towns being washed away
Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways
Lynch-mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains
The mad heat and the relentless rains
And if you stick your arm into that hole
It comes out sheared off to the bone
And with her kisses bubbling on my lips
I swiped the rain and nearly missed
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
Singing

Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Papa won't leave you, henry
Papa won't leave you, boy
Well, the road is long
And the road is hard
And many fall by the side
But papa won't leave you, henry
So there ain't no need to cry

And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
And I went on down the road
He went on down the road
Bent beneath my heavy load
Under his heavy load
Yeah, I went on down the road
Yeah, he went on down the road

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
And I went on down that road"

I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good

We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made pour vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds

The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the sunday newspapers
And never read a single word

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking it's fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all

To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good
To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good

It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're I'll of health
They bury you when you go and die
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'd stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit

Nick Cave,Rainy Night In Soho,/n/nick+cave/rainy+night+in+soho_20100114.html,"(S. Macgowan)

I've been loving you a long time
Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into heaven
And some of them fell into hell

I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all it's charms

I sang you all my sorrows
And you told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song
To all those little girls and boys
Those little girls and boys

Now the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
But there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams
The measure of my dreams

These last two verses are not sung by Nick, but are part of the original song as written by Shane Macgowan:

Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The gingerlady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you in my head

I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the fist time
I never think about the last

Now the song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
Still there's a light I hold before me
You're the measure of my dreams
The measure of my dreams"

Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
Heal your shrinking soul
Hey buddy, you know you're
Never ever coming back
He's a god, he's a man,
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand

You ain't got no money?
He'll get you some
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one
You ain't got no self-respect,
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
Red right hand

(Organ solo)

You'll see him in your nightmares,
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
On the tv screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand

(Organ solo)

Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack):
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't
Getting near much as he will take.

He's a...

He's mumbling words you can't understand
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand."

I'd still be your rock of gibraltar

The best thing I done
Was to make you the one
Who I'd walk with down to the altar

You'd stand by me
And together we'd be
That great, steady rock of gibraltar

Under the big yellow moon
On our honeymoon
I took you on a trip to malta

And all through the night

All the plans that we laid
Could soon be betrayed
Betrayed like the rock of gibraltar"

My balls, oh rye whiskey, will stick to your ass,
Like grapes on a hedgehog that rolls in the grass.

Si tengo un saguaro, no me has de culpar,
Pues un gran saguarazo te ha de gustar.
Ay! Tequila, tequila, tequila nomas,
Si me das el tequila yo te doy el compas!"
Nick Cave,Sad Dark Eyes,/n/nick+cave/sad+dark+eyes_20100280.html,"[As sung by Mick Harvey; Nick's live versions deviate from this.]
Credits: Humphreys/Lovett/Richards/Lynch/Anderson/Lpa

I look at you in your sad dark eyes
And your gypsy face with your spanish grace
With your words like rhymes and your voice like chimes

Darling, I want to kiss your burning mouth
Your sad dark eys and your ghostlike soul
Darling baby say that you'll be mine

Put your ring on my finger
And comb your long red hair
Put on your sad eyes
And tell me that you care
That you'll be mine, you'll be mine
Until the end of time"
Nick Cave,Sad Waters,/n/nick+cave/sad+waters_20191930.html,"Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
We go down to the river where the willows weep
Take a naked root for a lovers seat
That rose out of the bitten soil
But sound to the ground by creeping ivy coils
O Mary you have seduced my soul
And I don't know right from wrong
Forever a hostage of your child's world

And then I ran my tin-cup heart along
The prison of her ribs
And with a toss of her curls
That little girl goes wading in
Rollin her dress up past her knee
Turning these waters into wine
Then she platted all the willow vines

Mary in the shallows laughing
Over where the carp dart
Spooked by the new shadows that she cast
Across these sad waters and across my heart"
Nick Cave,Sail Away,/n/nick+cave/sail+away_20100281.html,"I climbed the hill, lay in the grass
A little dark-eyed girl drifted past
She said all the best is come, it could not last
And the worst, it has come true


Her hands are small and fluttered up
I lay amongst the buttercups
I pulled on my coat and buttoned it up
For the worst, it had come true


Sail away, sail away
To a place where your troubles can't follow
Sail away, sail away
Save all your tears for tomorrow


Orphans of the city moved toward us
And the swallows swooped and the starlings warned us
And the peril in everything
It assured us that the worst had come true


And all my sorrows made their bed beside me
The shame, the disgrace and the brutality
And she whispered then ""Let laughter flee.""
For the worst, it has come true


Dry your tears, forget while we're here
Leave all your sorrows behind you
Never lose heart, all things will pass
To a place where your troubles can't find you


She came beside me amongst my coat
Her breath was warm against my throat
We clung to each other so very close
For the worst, it had come true


Sail away, sail away
To a place where your heart will not shame you
Take my hand through this night without end
For the worst, it has come to claim you


Sail away, sail away
To a place where no one can betray you
Take my hand through this night without end
For the worst, it has come to claim you"

Born of its ever-changing, never-changing murky water
Oh riverboat just rollin' along through the great great greasy city Huck standing like a Saint, upon its deck
If ya wanna catch a Saint,
then bait ya hook, let's take a walk...


'O come to me!, O come to me!' is what the dirty city
say to Huck... HUCK


woah-woah, woah woah!
woah-woah, woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!


Straight in the arms of the city goes Huck,
down the beckonin' streets of op-po-tunity
whistling his favorite river-song...
And a bad-blind nigger at the piano
Buts a sinister blooo lilt into that sing-a-long
Huck senses somthing's wrong!


Sirens wail in the city,
and lil-Ulysses turn to putty
and Ol Man River's got a bone to pick!
and our boy's hardly got a bone to suck!
He go, woah-woah, woah woah!
woah-woah, woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!


The mo-o-o-on, its huge cycloptic eye
watches the city streets contract
twist and cripple and crack.
Saint Huck goes on a dog's-leg now
Saint Huck goes on a dog's-leg now


You know the story!
Ya wake up one morning and you find you're a thug
blowing smoke rings in some dive
Ya fingers hot and itchin, ya cracking ya knuckles
Ya bull neck bristling...
Still Huck he ventures on whistling,
and Death reckons Huckleberry's time is up,
O woah woah woah!
Saint Huck!
O woah woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!


Yonder go Huck, minus pocket-watch an' wallet gone
Skin shrink-wraps his skeleton
No wonder he gets thinner, what with his cold'n'skinny dinners!
Saint Huck-a-Saint Elvis, Saint Huck-a-Saint Elvis
O you recall the song ya used to sing-a-long
Shifting the river-trade on that ol' steamer
Life is but a dream!


But ya traded in the Mighty ol' man River
for the Dirty ol' Man Latrine!
The brothel shift
The hustle'n'the bustle and the green-backs rustle
And all the sexy-cash
And the randy-cars
And the two dollar fucks
O o o ya outa luck, ya outa luck
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Saint Huck! Huck!


This is the track of deception
leads to the heart of despair
Huck whistles like he just don't care
but in the pocket of the jacket is a chamber
Lead pellets sleeps in there
Wake Up!


Now Huck whistles and he kneels
and he lays down there
See ya huck, good luck
A smoke ring hovers above his head
And the rats and the dogs and the men all come
and put a bullet through his eye
and the drip and the drip and the drip of the Mississippi cryin' And Saint Huck hears his own Mississippi just rollin' by him Woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah

Woah-woah-woah-woah

To the little girl tree.
This wall I built around you
Is made out of stone-lies.
O little girl the truth would be
An axe in thee.
O father look to your daughter
Brick of grief and stricken morter.
With this ring
This silver hoop of wire
I bind your maiden mainstream
Just to keep you as a child.
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.
O you know that I must say goodbye
To my little girl tree.
How fast your candy bones
Reached out for me.
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones
Crying out for me.
O you know that I must say goodbye.
O goodbye.
Even though you will betray me
The very minute that I leave.
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree.
I rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots
Into her laden boughs
And amongst her roping limbs
Like a swollen neck vein branching
Into smaller lesser veins
That must all just sing and say goodbye
And let her blossom veils fly.
Her velvet gown.
Down down down.
Down down down.
Down down down and goodbye.
For you know that I must say goodbye.
To a rhythm softly tortured
Of a motion back and forth.
That's a rhythm sweetly tortured
O that's the rhythm of the orchard.
And you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree.
O goodbye.
Yes goodbye.
For you know that I must die.
Down down down.
Down down down.
Down down down and goodbye.
For you know that I must die.
Yes you know that I must die.
O-o you know that I must die."

She fell away
Left me holding everything
Once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no
Sometimes
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me th the brink
The fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all

Who was trying to put the wrong hand into the wrong glove

Are you leaving, dear? Are you leaving, dear?
Are you leaving, dear? Are you leaving, dear?

So you start reading all her books, all her magazines
Just to get a better understanding
Your brain feels like it's dead
Your eyes are hanging out your head
You were hoping for something less demanding
Well what you see staring out at you from a photo book
A man with an eyepatch and a bent, bloody hook
You wished to God that you never went and took a look
Cause it's in that moment that you know that

She's leaving you
Yeah she's leaving you

Well now she's taking you to bed
Her legs wrapped round your head
You're losing her to some crazy kind of motion
You keep coming up for air
You look around and stare
Find you're swimming into completely different oceans
You're wondering if she's thinking about some other man
She says, ""C'mon, baby, you know you are my loverman""
You're going nuts you don't know exactly what to say
She says, ""Don't worry, baby, this is just my little way

Of leaving you""
Oh, man, she's leaving you

Guitar solo!

She keeps saying, ""Hey, don't hate me""
She keeps saying, ""Hate is just some kind of failure of the imagination""
She keeps saying things like this
Now she's giving you a kiss
Now she's got you dragging her to the station
The sun just slipped out of the sky, this is a black letter day
Her train is moving down the platform, and is drawn away
You're crying buckets, she gives her glove a wave
She says ""Oh c'mon, baby, that's no way to behave

When I'm leaving you""
Oh yeah, she's leaving you
Oh yeah, she's leaving you
Yeah, she's leaving you
She's leaving you

Up ahead

All the crocodiles have been hunted
From your dreams

Sheep may safely graze
While the lambs are gambolling
By the streams

Sheep may safely graze
All the lost children will be found
In time

Sheep may safely graze, my boy

Your daddy is by your side

And if by chance, you wake at night
The hollow sorrow that lingers
And you grab at the tails of your dreams
But they scuttle through your fingers
All you can hear outside
Is the roar of a city being raised
That's just the powers that be
Making it safe to graze

Sheep may safely graze
The bluebirds have chased the vultures
From the sky

Sheep may safely graze
The day has merely gone now
And closed its eyes

Sheep may safely graze, my boy
All the fishes are leaping
Into the net

Sheep may safely graze

This is as good as it gets

Sheep may safely graze
All the lost children will be found
In time

Sheep may safely graze, my boy
Close your eyes
Your daddy is by your side

And you should wake tomorrow
The fences are all torn down
The woods are full of howling beasts
And there ain't nobody around
And everything seems foreign
To your little ways
That's just the Gods above
Making it safe to graze

The bird has its nest
But the sun out has no place
To lay his head and graze"

Sends a nervous shiver down my spine,
Down my spine.

I keep her photograph against my heart,
For in my life she plays the starring part.
Our love could hold off cigarettes,
There's no room for cheap regrets.

Allow me to impose on you
I have no place to stay
And my bones are cold right through
I will tell you a story
Of a man and his family
And I swear that it is true
Ten years ago I met a girl named joy
She was a sweet and happy thing
Her eyes were bright blue jewels
And we were married in the spring
I had no idea what happiness and little love could bring
Or what life had in store
But all things move toward their end
All things move toward their their end
On that you can be sure
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Then one morning I awoke to find her weeping
And for many days to follow
She grew so sad and lonely
Became joy in name only
Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow
And a dark and grim force set sail
* farewell happy fields *
* where joy forever dwells *
* hail horrors hail *
Was it an act of contrition or some awful premonition
As if she saw into the heart of her final blood-soaked
Night
Those lunatic eyes, that hungry kitchen knife
Ah, I see sir, that I have your attention!
Well, could it be?
How often I've asked that question
Well, then in quick succession
We had babies, one, two, three
We called them hilda, hattie and holly
They were their mother's children
Their eyes were bright blue jewels
And they were quiet as a mouse
There was no laughter in the house
No, not from hilda, hattie or holly
No wonder, people said, poor mother
Joy's so melancholy
Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home
I was visiting a sick friend
I was a doctor then
Joy and the girls were on their own
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Joy had been bound with electrical tape
In her mouth a gag
She'd been stabbed repeatedly
And stuffed into a sleeping bag
In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives
Method of murder much the same as my wife's
Method of murder much the same as my wife's
It was midnight when I arrived home
Said to the police on the telephone
Someone's taken four innocent lives
They never caught the man
He's still on the loose
It seems he has done many many more
Quotes john milton on the walls in the victim's blood
The police are investigating at tremendous cost
In my house he wrote * his red right hand *
That, I'm told is from paradise lost
The wind round here gets wicked cold
But my story is nearly told
I fear the morning will bring quite a frost
And so I've left my home
I drift from land to land
I am upon your step and you are a family man
Outside the vultures wheel
The wolves howl, the serpents hiss
And to extend this small favour, friend
Would be the sum of earthly bliss
Do you reckon me a friend?
* the sun to me is dark *
* and silent as the moon *
Do you, sir, have a room?
Are you beckoning me in?

No awakening, no flaming dart
No word of consolation
No arrow through my heart

A glimmer from afar
That I cling to with my fingers
As we go spinning wildly through the stars

And I'm full of love
And I'm full of wonder
And I'm full of love
And I'm falling under
Your spell

The wind lifts me to my senses
I rise up with the dew
The snow turns to streams of light
The purple heather grows anew
I call you by your name
I know not where you are
But somehow, somewhere, sometime soon
Upon this wild abandoned star

And I'm full of love
And I'm full of wonder
And I'm full of love
And I'm falling under
Your spell"
Nick Cave,Spinning Song,/n/nick+cave/spinning+song_1719543.html,"Once there was a song, the song yearned to be sung
It was a spinning song about the king of rock 'n' roll
The king was first a young prince, the prince was the best
With his black jelly hair he crashed onto a stage in Vegas
The king had a queen, the queen's hair was a stairway
She tended the castle garden, and in the garden planted a tree
The garden tree was a stairway, it was sixteen branches high
On the top branch was a nest, sing the high cloudy nest
In the nest was a bird, the bird had a wing
The wing had a feather, spin the feather and sing the wind
The king in time died, the queen's heart broke like a vow
And the tree returned to the earth with the nest and the bird
But the feather spun upward, upward and upward
Spinning all the weather vanes, and you're sitting at the kitchen table, listening to the radio

And I love you, and I love you, and I love you, and I love you
And I love you, and I love you, and I love you
Peace will come, a peace will come, a peace will come in time
A time will come, a time will come, a time will come for us
Peace will come, a peace will come, a peace will come in time
A time will come, a time will come, a time will come for us"

Stagolee
Bad man Stagalee when he bad,
He bad wid a gun
Stagalee, Stagalee --- you must-a been a sinner
Ev'ry- Christmas eve they give Stagalee a dinner
Bad man Stagalee, when he bad
He bad wid a gun.

Don't you remember you remember
One dark stormy night
Stagalee and Bill O. Lion
Dey had dat noble fight.

Bill O. Lion tole Stagalee
Please don't take my life
I got three little children
And a dear lil' lovin'wife

Stagalee told Billy O. Lion
I don't care for your three lil' children
Or even your lovin' wife
You stole mah Stetson hat
And I'm goin to take yo'life

Stagalee pulled out his forty-four
It went boom boom boom
It wasn't long' fore Bill O. Lion
wvere layin'on de flo'

Stagalee's woman she went to her boss
Said, ""Please give me some change.
Dey got my baby in de station house
An'mah business mus'be'ranged. ""

Stagalee asked his woman
""How much change has you got?""
She run her han'in her stocking feet
And pulled out a hundred spot.
She had to get mo'money.

From Southern Folk Ballads, Mcneill Collected from Vera Hall, al 1947

Stagolee
Stagolee was a bad man,
Ev'rybody knows.
Spent one hundred dollars
Just to buy him a suit of dothes.

He was a bad man
That mean old Stagolee

Stagolee shot Billy de Lyons
What do you think about that?
Shot him down in cold blood
Because he stole his Stetson hat;

He was a bad man
That mean old Stagolee

Billy de Lyons said, Stagolee
Please don't take my life
I've got two little babes
And a darling, loving wife;

You are a bad man
You mean old Stagolee.

What do I care about your two little babes,
Your darling loving wife?,
You done stole my Stetson hat
I'm bound to take your life;

He was a bad man,
That mean old Stagolee.

The judge said, Stagolee,
What you doing in here?,
You done shot Mr. Billy de Lyons,
You going to die in the electric chair;

He was a bad man
That mean old Stagolee.

Twelve o'clock they killed him
Head reached up high
Last thing that poor boy said,
""My six-shooter never lied.""

He was a bad man,
That mean old Stagolee.

Stagolee
Chorus: Stagolee, Stagolee, he's the meanest man in town
When that boy starts gamblin', better lay your money down
Down in New Orleans where they got that Lyon's Club
Every step you step you're steppin' in Billy de Lyon's blood

I remember one September, on a cold and stormy night
Billy de Lyon and Stagolee, Lord, they had a great big fight
Billy shot a seven, and Stack he said he'd pass
Stack said to Billy de Lyon, ""Brother,
You done shot your last""

The woman asked the sheriff, said ""How can this be?
You got all them bad men, but you can't get Stagolee""
Deputies took their badges and they laid them on the shelf
""If you want to get that bad man, you get him by yourself""

Now send for the policemen, a hundred thousand come
Loaded down with rifles and a great big Gatling gun
On Friday we condemned him, the judge he lowered his head
On Saturday we hanged him, I was glad to see him dead"
Nick Cave,Stagger Lee,/n/nick+cave/stagger+lee_20100054.html,"It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a colt. 45 and a deck of cards
Stagger lee
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
Had a '28 ford, had payments on that
Stagger lee
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, never ever come back no more
Stagger lee
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the
Mud
Till he came to a place called the bucket of blood
Stagger lee
He said mr motherfucker, you know who I am
The barkeeper said, no, and I don't give a good
Goddamn
To stagger lee
He said, well bartender, it's plain to see
I'm that bad motherfucker called stagger lee
Mr. Stagger lee
Barkeep said, yeah, I've heard your name down the
Way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day
Mr stagger lee
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said
'cause stag put four holes in his motherfucking head
Just then in came a broad called nellie brown
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to stagger lee, she starts to flirt
With stagger lee
She saw the barkeep, said, o god, he can't be
Dead!
Stag said, well, just count the holes in the
Motherfucker's head
She said, you ain't look like you scored in quite a
Time.
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime
Mr. Stagger lee
But there's something I have to say before you
Begin
You'll have to be gone before my man billy dilly comes
In,
Mr. Stagger lee
I'll stay here till billy comes in, till time comes
To pass
And furthermore I'll fuck billy in his motherfucking
Ass
Said stagger lee
I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one
Fat boy's asshole
Said stagger lee
Just then billy dilly rolls in and he says, you
Must be
That bad motherfucker called stagger lee
Stagger lee
Yeah, I'm stagger lee and you better get down on
Your knees
And suck my dick, because if you don't you're gonna be
Dead
Said stagger lee
Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
And stag filled him full of lead
Oh yeah."
Nick Cave,Still In Love,/n/nick+cave/still+in+love_20100065.html,"The cops are hanging around the house
The cars outside look like they've got the blues
The moon don't know if it's day or night
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes
You're making coffee for everyone concerned
Someone points to this and someone points to that
Everyone is saying that you should lie down
But you ain't having none of that
And I say to the sleepy summer rain
With a complete absence of pain
You might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Hide your eyes, hide your tears,
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you"

And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running

Bottled light from hotels
Spilling everything
Wet hand from the volcano
Sobers your skin
Stranger than Kindness
You caress yourself
And grind my soft cold bones below
Your map of desire
Burned in your flesh
Even a fool can come
A strange lit stair
And find a rope hanging there
Stranger than kindness
Keys rain like heaven's hair
There is no home there is no bread
We sit at the gate and scratch
The gaunt fruit of passion
Dies in the light
Stranger than kindness
Your sleeping hands journey
The loiter
Stranger than kindness
You hold me so carelessy close
Tell me I'm dirty
Stranger than kindness"

I lay in the forest amongst the butterflies and the fireflies
And the burning horses and the flaming trees
As a spiral of children climb up to the sun
Waving goodbye to you and goodbye to me
As the past pulls away and the future begins
I say goodbye to all that as the future rolls in
Like a wave, like a wave
And the past with its savage undertow lets go

[Chorus]
Come on everyone, come on everyone
A spiral of children climbs up to the sun, to the sun, to the sun
And on each golden rung, a spiral of children climbs up to the sun

[Verse 2]
And a man named Jesus, he promised he would leave us
With a word that would light up the night, oh the night
But the stars hang from threads and blink off one by one
And it isn't any fun, no it isn't any fun
To be standing here alone with nowhere to be
With a man mad with grief and on each side a thief
Everybody hanging from a tree, from a tree
And everybody hanging from a tree

[Chorus]
Come on everyone, come on everyone
A spiral of children climb up to the sun, to the sun, taking everyone
A spiral of children climbs up to the sun

There is nothing more valuable than beauty they say
There is nothing more than love
And I lie amongst the leaves and the burning trees
And the fields of smoke and the black butterflies
And the screaming horses and your bright green, so beautiful
And your bright green eyes, so beautiful

Look for me in the sun
I am beside you, I am within
In the sunshine, in the sun"

Wednesday's in a chains
Tuesday gathers up the crumbs under the table
Wednesday dare not complain
My heart has collapsed on the tracks of a run-a-way train
Just whisper his name
And here comes Sunday's slave

The hands in the stable are willing and able to pay
If you feel at a loss, man, just who is the boss-man
Ask the blood of one of it's bad days
For his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery
He insists that he piss in your fist
But he still takes the money anyway

But don't tell Sunday's slave

O. K. So Friday's gonna pay

Fire eating drag-queens dressed as society whores
Crazy two timing bitches running round
Ghetto blasting blasters, blasting magnificently
Blossoms falling from the cherry trees
That's what jazz is to me

High buildings with crippled backs circle around my dreams
I clutch at the greasy tails of my dreams
White blossom falling from the cherry trees
That's what jazz is to me

Ten bottles standing in a row military style
With hats pulled low over their brows
A thousand wasted hours
Skeletons entwined fucking and braying? Fields
Blossoms falling from the cherry tree
That's what jazz is to me

History repeating itself like a
All the great cars of the world in one massive collision
All the doctors swallowed up by one incompetence
All the great theorists and teachers eaten alive...

Blind fish being used as musical scales
Sharks puffed for fish and whales
I long to be by the sea where a blossom falls from a cherry tree
That's what jazz is to me

Three forms, four forms, five forms, six forms,
Seven forms, eight forms, nine forms,
A blossom falling from the cherry tree
That's what jazz is to me

As Einstein said about his theory
I love, I love, I love, I love jazz

Who was standing by the door
And a little bald man with wing-nut ears
Was waiting in the car
Well Robert Moore passed the frog-eyed man
As he walked into the bar,
And Betty Coltrane she jumped under her table.

""What's your pleasure?"" asked the barman
He had a face like boiled meat
""There's a girl called Betty Coltrane
That I have come to see""
""But I ain't seen that girl 'round here
For more than a week""
And Betty Coltrane she hid beneath the table.
Well, then in came a sailior with
Mermaids tattooed on his arms,
Followed by the man with the wing-nut ears
Who was waitin' in the car
Well, Robert Moore sensed trouble,
He'd seen it comin' from afar
And Betty Coltrain she gasped beneath the table.

Well, the sailor said ""I'm looking for my wife,
They call her Betty Coltrain! ""
The frog-eyed man said ""That can't be;
That's my wife's maiden name. ""
And the man with the wing-nut ears said,
""Hey, I married her back in Spain!""
And Betty Coltrain crossed herself beneath the table.

Well, Robert Moore stepped up and said
""That woman is my wife.""
And he drew a silver pistol
And a wicked bowie knife;
And he shot the man with the wing-nut ears
Straight between the eyes
And Betty Coltrain, she moaned under the table.

The frog-eyed man jumped at Robert Moore,
Who stabbed him in the chest
And as Mister Frog-eyes died he said
""Betty, your the girl that I loved best!""
The sailor pulled a razor,
Robert blasted it to bits
""And Betty, I know you're under the table.""

""Well have no fear,"" said Robert Moore,
""I do not want to hurt you!""
""Never a woman did'na love me
Half as much as you.
You are the blessed' sun, girl
And you are the sacred moon. ""
And Betty shot his legs out from under the table!

Well, Robert Moore went down heavy
With a crash upon the floor
And over to his trashin' body
Betty Coltrain she did crawl.
She put the gun to the back of head
And pulled the trigger once more
And blew his brains out all over the table!

Well Betty stood up and shook her head
And waved the smoke away.
Said, ""I'm sorry Mr Barman
To leave your place this way. ""
As she emptied out their wallets she said,
""I'll collect my severence pay.""
And then she winked and threw a dollar on the table."

Now it begins, now that you're gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching that clock till you return
And lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins, day after day
This is my life ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say:
Love will appear and this time will stay

Each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
This time the big hurt will end

Now it begins, now that you're gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
So if you don't come back again
I wonder when, oh when will it end?

Oh my love, the dawn is breaking
And my tears are falling rain
For the carnival is over
We may never meet again


Like a drum my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine


Now the cloak of night is falling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die"

Take one of those and two of these
Then watch the walls begin to breathe
I can taste the color of the lines
Wings are growing out of me
The floor is floating underneath
I can see the future burning bright
Yea … the future burning bright! 

The ceiling has us mesmerized
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof

Insanity is setting in, reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
And suddenly we’re traveling
A Million Miles an Hour A Million Miles an Hour
We’re going A Million Miles an Hour
A Million Miles an Hour

When shadows all start breaking free
No longer held by gravity
… How did we get so far from the ground?
Speaking to the galaxy
Received and sending back to me
I can finally hear the speed of sound
Hey … the speed of fucking sound! 

I like this everlasting pill
‘Cause time itself is standing still
Why’s the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no one calls
‘Cause you and I are trippin’ balls
I can still hear ringing in my brain

Insanity is setting in, reality is getting thin
See no signs of ever coming down
And suddenly we’re traveling
A Million Miles an Hour A Million Miles an Hour
We’re going A Million Miles an Hour
A Million Miles an Hour

Insanity is setting in, reality is getting thin
Molecules are dancing all around
I can’t deny the hardest thing for me
Is finding time to finally breathe
Ain’t no signs of ever coming down
Another wave is coming in

A Million Miles an Hour A Million Miles an Hour
We’re going A Million Miles an Hour
A Million Miles an Hour A Million Miles an Hour
Insane insane
A Million Miles an Hour A Million Miles an Hour
Insane insane
A Million Miles an Hour"
Nickelback,A Promise Fufilled,/n/nickelback/a+promise+fufilled_21043294.html,"Let's meet in the city where
The rivers cross bridges there
Let's float down into the stream
Of rich and poor pioneers
A kid from a western town
Wants to be seen and go out
Let's borrow my parent's car
Let's stay out all night up there
And Burnside will be our street
Where the kids and the hookers meet
Diners and strip club junk
Bookstores and punk rock clubs
Water, Building and Sin
(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)
Big Oregon city draws you in
(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)
A promise fulfilled or not
(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)
We'll make our home water-tight
Work all day, play all night
And hope we're not washed away
By deceit or tragedy
And Joan of Arc rules Northeast
Where the poor and the hipsters meet
The grid that divides us all
The river makes final call
Out at the edge of town
Where airfield runs water down
Coyote crosses the tracks
And hops on the Light-Rail Max
Water, Building and Sin
(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)
Big Oregon city draws you in
(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)
A promise fulfilled or not
(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)
And if you wanna be a friend of mine
Cross the river to the east side
Find me on the eve of suicide
Tell me the city is no place to hide
Take me out into a sunny day
Through the grotto or the promenade
You came to me in the nick of time
Thankful for the things I left behind
Oh dirty river, come let me in (3X)
Oh dirty river"
Nickelback,After The Rain,/n/nickelback/after+the+rain_21128615.html,"All  your life scramble and scurry
Take your time rather than hurry
Never too late to write the rest of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandonment
A ticket to life as my mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older)

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Old mistakes committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a debt that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Gonna have to come after the rain (rain, yeah)
Gonna have to come after the rain (rain)
Rain, yeah
Rain
Gonna have to come after the rain"
Nickelback,Animals,/n/nickelback/animals_20483037.html,"I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'

[Chorus:]
No, ain't never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple animals

So come on baby, get in
Just get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in

You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch

I'm screamin'

[Chorus:]

So come on baby, get in
Just get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered ""what was that?""
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
""That's my dad outside the car!""
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
We were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'

[Chorus:]

So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple animals
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
We're just a couple animals
Get in, just get in"

Just drive, you slam the door and so do I
Tongue tied from all the little things
And they're the reason that I scream

I needed you
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head
Cause I needed you
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead

Your turn, you'd rather leave than live and learn
That's why, you want an end and so do I
This time, I believe I'll leave it all behind
Tongue tied from all the little things

Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head

I swore not to come, but I m here after all

Doctor could you be my priest

You laugh as you lie through your teeth

Feel that I've been there
I didn't need this
Would somebody help me breathe

Just face to facing
Each other another day
Who wins
Well who cares

What I see
If I could drag my life in a moment
Wanna know do you want me to go
Gonna keep it all never ending
Never stop myself from pretending
That you always knew that I never could

Equal treatment never ever comes
And there they go again

So perfect
So worthless

I would

Each bone broken in his back
All the money and all the gold
Couldn't buy my love at 8 years old
Now I'm in love with a girl that's wrong for me
Ask her, she will disagree
Her father was a small time man
With small time dreams and small time hands
But
But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I dunno
Gone for good in fact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought

Easy enough to just look at her
Whole world on a silver platter
Was that that bad for me
If I was there the scotch is free
Won round one but it's not over
He don't care cause he don't know her
True love is not the same
If I could lend a hand in shame

But I was there when there was nobody home
Please believe me when I say I dunno
Gone for good infact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought

If I was big
So much easier to see
Don't hide from me
That which I've already seen
You lie to me
More than occasionally
Don't lie to me
You lied to me

I'm as high as I'll ever be
I don't mind, Stay and see
They've all gone, Why don't we
Holding hands, you and me
But I'm as high as i'll ever be
But later on, lies to see
My past is gone, only from me
I'm alive

But I was there when there was nobody home
Please belirve me when I say I dunno
Gone for good infact but what does it mean
Within a year they always sold and bought

Remember when it was me
Driving come down just for me
And then we'll try as we've been"

See her face

Let it slide
And I will
Watch her die...
To run through fields
To find, and I will
Hold, then lead, then lie
And I will... No I won't

Is it now really time?
Can I just give mind, if
I can simply trade
Deal Made

And I will
See her face
No reason
Let it slide
And I will

Desouled, to seek, decide
And I will, no I won't

Run through fields to find
Hold then lead, then lie
And I will
Run, desouled, and
Hold, to heal, to find

Just to keep them happy for awhile

Fairly tied up too

And yell in the air like lifelong enemies

World quarrels and grandkids on your knee

Sitting side by side in the full moonlight
I pull her close just to hold her tight
And the both of us could tell it just felt right
She looked at me in the sweetest way
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say
Musta took a while just to find the words
Cause she cut me off and finally said it first

Eight minutes and I'm losing it a little bit
Five minutes and your description may be starting to fit
Three to go and I'm forgetting all that I've even know
I won't be standing up for long, I better learn how to crawl

Not like I need to depend upon anyone
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
One more anthem for the know it all
I won't be standing up for long, I better learn how to crawl
Learn how to crawl
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
I can't stand up at all
Can't see nothing at all
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor"

Where do bad men go when they die?

Wings for her and I and I don't mind
Cause I have always wanted to learn to...
Fly... learn to

Brother, tell me somethin'
If I take this, am I going to die?
And he says no, so then I figure what the hell
I'll try cause it's my life
So light the match and you and I will...

And someday I'll be there I swear to you, God, as my witness
For all the trusts I've broke and, let justice know, it's just that easy
Cause I'm a liar, I conspired, I'm a liar...

And father tell your son,
It's not your gun and bloody hands
Don't hide behind locked doors
In dresser drawers those bullets wait to fly...

Fly... wait to
Fly... wait to
Fly... wait to
Fly...

Cause I'm on my hands and knees
I've crawled eternity to beg forgiveness
And someday I'll be there I swear to you,

You can shoot me in the leg

You can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home

You can make a couple calls
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Put a bounty on my head
And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found
You can steal me the keys
To your daddy's Cadillac
You can tamper with the brakes
Call it a mistake
And pray I'm never coming back

And try and stick me in the ground
You can tie me to the bed

Underneath the tractor wheel

Rolled on my back and died of thirst

Bought me a map, showed me where to look
Carved of stone or made of wood

Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Another one down and headed off the deep end

And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one

Still a little down home, there was never a doubt

You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some

Everywhere she goes there's an instant party

By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you

Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to

And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you
I'd crawl across this world for you
Do anything you want me to
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you
You know I'll always come for you"

Our only light in paradise
Would show the world they were wrong

We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

Nickelback,If Today Was Your Last Day,/n/nickelback/if+today+was+your+last+day_20766918.html,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each days a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned
Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
If tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have
If today was your last day

Going against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts cause there's no second try
So live it like you're never living twice
Don't take the free ride in your whole life

If today was your last day
If tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have
And would you call old friends you never see
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies
And would you find that one your dreaming of
Swear up and down to god above
That you'll finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark
On ending a broken heart
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
Cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
If tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday
Would you live each moment like your last
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have
And would you call old friends you never see
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies
And would you find that one your dreaming of
Swear up and down to god above
That you'll finally fall in love

With scars on both his lips, his fingertips...
Were melted to the bone.

When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night.

To get high-igh, igh, igh (high-igh, igh, igh).

Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating,
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing,
And pretended not to know...
He started stealing, to supply the feeling,
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife...
And held it to her throat.

You can sing along

Give me lessons on how to breath

That overlooked the water

And now the ring is on my hand

And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher"

Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring where the sun don't shine

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've never failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale

Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've never failed
Your life's a fucking fairy tale"

She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him
Clenching his hands
She's just a woman
Never Again

I hear her scream, from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all
She cries to me, Go back to bed
I'm terrified, That she'll wind up dead
In his hands, She's just a woman
Never Again

Been there before, but not like this
Seen it before, but not like this
Never before have I
Ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never Again

Just tell the nurse, you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you, she wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room
With those hands
Lookin just as sweet as he can
Never Again

Seen it before, but not like this
Been there before, but not like this
Never before have I
Ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never Again

Father's a name you haven't earned yet
You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard ""Don't hit a lady""?
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure

He's drunk again, it's time to fight
Same old shit, just on a different night
She grabs the gun, she's had enough
Tonight she'll find out how fuckin'
Tough is this man
Pulls the trigger fast as she can
Never Again

Seen it before, but not like this
Been there before, but not like this
Never before have I
Ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never Again

Seen it before, but not like this
Been there before, but not like this
Never before have I
Ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never Again

No, Never Again"

Down the hall the baby boy just born
Rosary around a crown of thorns

Bury her cause her time was cut thin
All the while you just stood and stared
Never cared to help we just got carried away

It occured to me on the inside I guess so have I

How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now then it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.

I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door

Take it all back
Search for justice, don't live there anymore

A congressman would call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile

Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best

Gone forever from a loaded bullet

The next line I write down
And there’s a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain’s supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I’m standing on

I write lines down then rip them up
Describing love can’t be this tough

I could set this song on fire
Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river watch it sinking slow
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world but it won’t mean much
Unless I sing this song to you

I’m dying to show you
This could end up happily ever after
There doesn’t ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along

I write lines down then rip them up
Impossible describing love..

Send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river watch it sinking slow
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon

Unless I sing this song for you

Sing this song to you
(I could set this song on fire)

Lite this old guitar on fire
I’d still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water I’d still hear its ghost
Singing with somebody else but we’d be out of tune
Play it for the world but it won’t mean much

Send it up in smoke

How it's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk

Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out, we still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Long time, let's walk, let's talk"

How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?

[Chorus:]
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more

And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go

But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to

Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more

[Bridge:]
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
Tonight I'm dying to tell you

That trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, from what we're fighting for
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more"

Well, tonight is the night that you can
Just get this done and by dawn's early light
You can finish the fight you began

This time we're in it to stay
Think about seizing the day
Think of that train as she rolls into old Santa Fe
Tell 'em I'm on my way

See old man Pulitzer snug in his bed, he don't care if we're dead or alive
Three satin pillows are under his head, while we're beggin' for bread to survive
Joe, if you're still countin' sheep
Wake up and read 'em and weep
You got your thugs with their sticks and their slugs
Yeah, but we got a promise to keep

Once and for all something tells me the tide'll be turnin'
Once and for all there's a fire inside me that won't stop burnin'
Now that the choices are clear
Now that tomorrow is here
Watch how the mighty will fall
For once and for all

This is for kids shinin' shoes in the street with no shoes on their feet every day
This is for guys sweatin' blood in the shops while the bosses and cops look away
This is to even the score
This ain't just newsies no more
This ain't just kids with some pie in the sky
This is do it or die, this is war!

Once and for all we'll be there to defend one another
Once and for all every kid is our friend
Every friend a brother
Five thousand fists in the sky (five thousand fists in the sky)
Five thousand reasons to try (five thousand reasons to try)

Better to die than to crawl

Mother daughter father son
Guess that everything you heard about is true
So you aint got any family
Who said you needed one
Aint ya glad nobody's waiting up for you

When I dream on my own
I'm alone but I aint lonely
For a dreamer nights the only time a day
When the city's finally sleeping and my thoughts begin to stray
And I'm on the train that's bound for Santa Fe
And I'm free like the wind
Like I'm gunna live forever
Its a feeling time can never take away
All I needs a few more dollars
And I'm outa here to stay
Dreams comes true, yes they do
In Santa Fe

Where does it say that you gotta live and die here
Where does it say a guy can't catch a break
Why should you only take what your given
Why should you spend your whole life livin'
Trapped where they aint no future even at 17
Breaking your back for someone else's sake
If the life don't seem to suit ya how bout a change of scene
Far from the lousy headlines and the deadlines in between

Santa Fe are you there
Do you swear you wont forget me
If I found you would you let me come and stay
I aint getting any younger
And before my dying day
I want space not just air
Let them laugh in my face
I don't care
Sante Fe
I'll be there

So that's what they call a family
Aint ya glad you aint that way
Aint ya glad you have a dream called

Talking to a cute fair skinned brunette
I asked her if she wanted to have a beer and if she liked our set
I noticed that her hair was longer in the back
I figure that's cuz she's Canadian
That's why I was surprised when she told me she was fully lesbian

That's when I realized it was Sara, or maybe it was Tegan
I'm pretty sure that it was Sara
Cause Johnny Sampson said she was the cooler one

I told her I was a big fan of her band
She asked me if I had a favorite song
I admitted that I'd never actually heard them, but I like K. D. Lang

I told her this Jew knows about the Juno's
And how they got robbed three times in a row
And then I asked her if she knew of anyone who was selling pills or blow

That's when I creeped out Sara or maybe I just pissed her off
When I asked her if her sister and her had ever had a threesome?
Where they both ganged up one girl, a forgy or a fivesome?
Do they think strap-ons are groovy, and had they ever seen the movie
Bound and did they like Jennifer Tilly, did they like Jennifer Tilly?

Sara said she preferred Gina Gershon, Angelina Jolie
In the Gia movie that was on hbo
And ""If These Walls Could Talk"" made Tegan cry a lot
After that I forgot what she said
That's the problem with Diazepam, so many things I don't remember
But I've got a sinking feeling, it's not that I'm a clairvoyant

But I think that I creeped out Sara, I was creeping out on Sara
I hope it wasn't Tegan, cuz Matt Skiba said she is the cooler one"

Got the cultivating music that be captivating me
When you listen, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get a mackin to this bitch named Sadie

Eighty degrees, when I tell that chick please
In a dog pound, feelin' the breeze.

My homey dr. Dre came over with a gang of tanqueray
And a fat ass g, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke

Bang around and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin, I'm still poppin

To serve me, not with a cherry on top

You put on Survivor and I put on some headphones
And cheated with my first love rock and roll

I took back my Replacements and grabbed my E13,

They may all have been smashed to bits

For the future of mankind

Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold

For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave

Do it better, higher, faster

If I go up it will be slow

I've been to where it leads

And our differences exposed,

Now we got a big father and an even bigger mother.

This aristocracy gives a fuck about you.
They put the mock in democracy
And you swallowed every hook.

You'd rather follow the school into the net
'cause swimming alone at sea
Is not the kind of freedom that you actually want.

Go bask in the warmth of your diaper.

Would be me.

Now I know she needs me
There to share
I'm nowhere.

Seems they've dried up all my tears.
And while she runs free and fast, 
Seems my wild days are past.

But I miss the mountains.
I miss the dizzy heights.
All the manic, magic days, 
And the dark, depressing nights.

I miss the mountains, 
I miss the highs and lows, 
All the climbing, all the falling, 
All the while the wild wind blows, 
Stinging you with snow
And soaking you with rain
I miss the mountains, 
I miss the pain.

Mountains make you crazy
Here it's safe and sound.
My mind is somewhere hazy
My feet are on the ground.

Everything is balanced here
And on an even keel.
Everything is perfect
Nothing's real... 
Nothing's real.

And I miss the mountains.
I, I miss the lonely climb.
Wand'ring through the wilderness.
And spending all my time
Where the air is clear
And cuts you like a knife

Screaming to be heard...

Not a single word.

At her side
When she called, 
When she cried.
How could she
Leave me on my own?

Will it work?

They told me that the wiring
Was somehow all misfiring
And screwing up the signals in my brain.

And then they told me chemistry - 
The juice and not the circuitry - 
Was mixing up and making me insane.

What happens if the burn has healed
But the skin has not regrown?
What happens if the cast at last comes off
And then you find the break
Was always in another bone?

They tried a millions meds and
They strapped me to their beds and
They shrugged and told me that's the way it goes.

And finally you hit it.
I asked you just what did it.
You shrugged and said that no one really knows.

What happens if the medicine wasn't really in control?
What happens if the cut, the burn, the break
Was never in my brain, or in my blood, but in my soul?

Giant spiders learn how to swim
With whales they form a united kin

Snakes say hello to the rats on the ground
In the meadows play merrily the fox and the hound

The prey and the hunter
Survival of the fittest

Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain.
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron,
Hope is only an illusion & Ocean Soul's nothing but a name...

The Child bless thee & keep thee forever"
Nightwish,Bye Bye Beautiful,/n/nightwish/bye+bye+beautiful_20652996.html,"Finally the hills are without eyes
They are tired of painting a dead man's face red
With their own blood

They used to love having so much to lose
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins

Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?
Did we play to become only pawns in the game?
How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting

Bye bye, beautiful
Bye bye beautiful

Jacob's ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead siblings walking the dying earth

Noose around a choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells

""I need to die to feel alive""

Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?

How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting

Bye bye, beautiful
Bye bye beautiful

It's not the tree that forsakes the flower
But the flower that forsakes the tree
Someday I'll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words

... How blind can you be, don't you see...
... That the gambler lost all he does not have...

The dark rain from her eyes still falls
Breathtaking butterfly
Chose a dark day to live

Save one breath for me

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath

Why do I miss someone
I never met, with bated breath I lay
Seawinds brought her to me
A butterfly, mere one-day miracle of life
And all the poetry in the world
Finally makes sense to me

Save one death for me

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath

Put to rest all that's not life
Drink for beauty and fill my blank page

Sometimes a dream turns into a dream

A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath"

Live twice only for us

With me
With you
In war for the love of you

Holding us now the lovecropper's hand

Saw the blessed land
We cared, you took
You fought, we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood

Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Our home in peace and war and death

Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and

Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago

The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me

Sing what you can't say
Forget what you can't play
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes
Walk within my poetry, this dying music
- My loveletter to nobody

Never sigh for better world
It's already composed, played and told
Every thought the music I write
Everything a wish for the night

Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin
Died for the beauty the one in the garden
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom
Failed in becoming a god

Never sigh...

""If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears
For I've given this it's strength and it has become my only strength.
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew
The sweet piano writing down my life""

Show me love, hold the lorn
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me

Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies
Returning swans and sedulous mice
Writings on the gardens book, in the minute of a lover's look

Building a sandcastle close to the shore
A house of cards from a worn out deck
A home from the fellowship, poise and calm
Write a lyric for the song only you can understand

Come, drink deep let the dam of mind seep
Travel with great élan, dance a jig at the funeral

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman's noose

Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep

Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast

Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I'll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love

My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I'll bleed forever"

The magic ride, the mermaid cove?
Never met a kinder heart than yours

Leave a footprint on every island you see

I am the painted faces, the toxic kiss
Sowing of doubt, troll beneath the bridge
Come across
Death by a thousand cuts
Believe it, we live as we dream/scream

I am the desert-scape, the sand inside your hourglass
I am the fear and abuse, the leper children
Every eye sewn shut

We will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will be our last ride
We will go down he will drown drown, deeper down

Never loose your heart

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young.
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary,
The ringing of the division bell had begun.

Along the Long Road and on down to the causeway,
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground,
To a life consumed by slow decay.

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounding
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of the bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse at our great lose of the other side
Steps taken forward but sleepwalking back again,
Dragged by force of some inner tide

But the highest altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition,
There's hunger still unsatisfied,
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon,
Though down this road we've been so many times.

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dark mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever [x2]"

Drown without inhaling

But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword

Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings

Where's dear Alice knocking on the door
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare

Where is the wonder where's the awe
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for
Before the years take me
I wish to see
The lost in me

I want my tears back
I want my tears back now

A rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa"

Taking a step to a world unbound
Spinning my fantasies all around
Freed from the gravital leash
I swear the heaven's in my reach

Dancing with the spirit of the air
In this ocean so open and fair
Making love to the gods above
On my maiden voyage so bold

Landing safely to the blue lagoon
Don't know if this is the earth or the moon
Joy of living is no more a mask
The Eden I found will forever last

Migrating with the geese
My soul has finally found peace
Doesn't matter that man has no wings
As long as I hear the nightingale sing..."

Didn't feel the smallness under the stars
Once I got bars in my cradle
As a prisoner I write a letter from there

My Lord, let me come to you, let me become what my child thinks I am *
In you is the beauty of the world, of which death made me an artist
My Lord, let me come to you, let me become what my child thinks I am

My own heaven I created here
Let me get away

Amidst the burden the scale will prevail
Showing what's worth being here
Storyteller by a hearth of stone
A white little creature purring me
My childhood kingdom gone in time
The islands filling my mind with blue
The one in special, heaven's court

All the joy unforgiven by this task

An errant soul, homeless and foul
All gone but the will to
Live to tell the tale

The days are filled with anxiety
Frustration, one right note a day
Where to find a perfect tune
Just do the work and take a step back

All the joy unforgiven by this task

An errant soul, homeless and foul
All gone but the will to
Live to tell the tale

Dark chambers of my mind
Locked around the neck of my love
None of you understand
And it doesn't matter
To a broken marionette like me (me)

An errant soul, homeless and foul
An errant soul, homeless and foul
All gone but the will to
Live to tell the, to tell the tale

Tell me why
No heart to cry
Hang me high

The kiss of faith is what I beg
A loving heart 'n soul for sale

Tell me why
No heart to cry
Hang me high

Leave me be
And cease to tell me how to feel
To grieve, to shield myself from evil
Leave me be
Od of lies is killing me
Romanticide
Till love do me part

See me ruined by my own creations

Leave me be

To grieve, to shield myself from evil
Leave me be
Od of lies is killing me
Romanticide
Till love do me part

Dead Boy's alive but without sense
I need a near-death experience
Heart once bold
Now turned to stone
Perfection my messenger from hell

Wine turns to water
Campfires freeze, loveletters burn
Romance is lost
Lord, let me be wrong in this pain

Temporary pain, eternal shame
To take part in this devil's chess game
Spit on me, let go, get rid of me
And try to survive your stupidity"

Lies an angel in the snow
The frozen ficure crossed by tracks of wolves
An encounter, symbolic, yet truthfull
With a hungry choir of woods
An agreement immemorial to be born

Dulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest
Accompany all charming tunes
Of a sacrament by a campfire
A promise between the tameless
And the one with a tool
Tonight the journey from the cave begins

I want to hunt with the tameless world
I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar
We will honor the angel in the snow
We will make the streams for allour children flow

Wrapped in furs beneath the nothern lights
From my cave I watch the land untamed
And wonder is some becoming season
Will make the angel melt in shame

I want to hunt with the tameless world
I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar

The deep breath I took still poisons my lungs
An old oak sheltering me from the blue
Sun bathing on it's dead frozen leaves

A catnap in the ghost town of my heart
She dreams of storytime and the river ghosts
Of mermaids, of Whitman's and the ride
Raving harlequins, gigantic toys

A song of me a song in need
Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me a verse in need
Of a pure-heart singing me to peace

All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing

All that great heart lying still
In silent suffering
Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end
What is left for encore
Is the same old dead boy's song
Sung in silence
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angel wing

A midnight flight into Covington Woods
A princess and a panther by my side
These are territories I live for
I'd still give my everything to love you more

Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me a verse in need
Of a pure-heart singing me to peace

[4. Love]

I see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street,
With a begging bowl in his shaking hand.
Trying to smile but hurting infinitely. Nobody notices.
I do, but walk by.

An old man gets naked and kisses a model-doll in his attic
It's half-light and he's in tears.
When he finally comes his eyes are cascading.

I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley. He tries to bite me.
All pride has left his wild drooling eyes.
I wish I had my leg to spare.

A mother visits her son, smiles to him through the bars.
She's never loved him more.

An obese girl enters an elevator with me.
All dressed up fancy, a green butterfly on her neck.
Terribly sweeet perfume deafens me.
She's going to dinner alone.
That makes her even more beautiful.

I see a model's face on a brick wall.
A statue of porcelain perfection beside a violent city kill.
A city that worships flesh.

The first thing I ever heard, was a wandering
Man telling his story
It was you, the grass under my bare feet,
The campfire in the dead of night,
The heavenly black of sky and sea.

It was us,
Roaming the rainy roads, combing the guilded beaches.
Waking up to a new gallery of wonders every morn,
Bathing in places no-one's seen before,
Shipwrecked on some matt-painted island,
Clad in nothing but the surf - beauty's finest robe.

Beyond all mortality we are, swinging in the breath of nature,
In early air of the dawn of life,
A sight to silence the heavens.

I want to travel where life travels,
Following it's permanent lead.
Where the air tastes like snow music,
Where grass smells like fresh-born Eden,
I would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or rapture,
I would bathe in a world of sensation,
Love, goodness and simplicity.

(While violated and imprisoned by technology)

The thought of my family's graves was the only moment
I used to experience true love
That love remains infintie,
As I'll never be the man my father is.

How can you ""just be yourself""
When you don't know who you are?
Stop saying ""I know how you feel""
How could anyone know how another feels?

Who am I to judge a priest, beggar,
Whore, politician, wrongdoer?
I am, you are, all of them already.

Dear child, stop working, go play
Forget every rule
There's no fear in a dream!

""Is there a village inside this snowflake?""
- a child asked me.
""What's the colour of our lullaby?""

I've never been so close to truth as then,
I touched it's silver lining!

Death is the winner in any war,
Nothing noble in dying for your religion,
For your country,
For ideology, for faith,
For another man. Yes!

Paper is dead without words,
Ink idle without a poem,
All the world dead without stories.
Without love and disarming beauty.

Careless, realism costs souls.

Ever seen the Lord smile?
All the care for the world made Beautiful a sad man?
Why do we still carry a device of torture around our necks?
Oh, how rotten your pre-apocalypse is,
All you bible-black fools living over nightmare ground.

I see all those empty cradles and wonder
If man will never change.

I, too, wish to be a decent manboy, but all I am
Is smoke and mirrors.
Still given everything, may I be deserving.

And there forever remains that change from G to E minor."

Caress the tales
And they will dream you real

Limitless chest of tales

The world as I wish it to be

Home inside but lost for life
Human heart longing for love
Slave to the toil, this mortal coil
The strife, the suffering, the void

Wind in the wheat
Kiss by a hearth
A dead calm winter morn, 
Morning birds, and a smile of a stranger

Frozen moments in time
Little hideaways, the marrow of life
Little hideaways for a lonely heart

Wind in the wheat
Kiss by a hearth
Little hideaways for a lonely heart

Silent night surrounding me
On the shore of wistful sea
A kindest heart made me believe
The world as I wish it to be."

Gazes the horizon
With seawinds in his face
Tempest-tossed island
Seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted
And a ship without a name

Sea without a shore for the banished one unheard
He lightens the beacon, light at the end of world
Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
The ones on their travels homeward from afar

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind long ago

The albatross is flying
Making him daydream
The time before he became
One of the world's unseen
Princess in the tower
Children in the fields
Life gave him it all:
An island of the universe

Now his love's a memory
A ghost in the fog
He sets the sails one last time
Saying farewell to the world
Anchor to the water
Seabed far below
Grass still in his feet
And a smile beneath his brow

This is for long-forgotten
Light at the end of the world
Horizon crying
The tears he left behind so long ago"

Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell

One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there 'n then
Those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway

With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath

Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the pain, beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

""I'm afraid, I'm so afraid.
Being raped again, and again, and again
I know I will die alone.
But loved.

You live long enough to hear the sounds of guns,
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night,
Long enough to see your friends betray you.

For years I've been strapped unto this altar.
Now I only have three minutes and counting.
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give
Me a death I always longed for. ""

As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned, upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway

I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you

Far across the world
The villages go by like dreams
The rivers and the hills
The forests and the streams

Children gaze open mouth
Taken by surprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes

We're surfing in the air
We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by

Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep

We're walking in the air
We're floating in the midnight sky
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

I wish you'd find the lost in you
Grateful for the pain
It proves we're alive
Can you feel it?

I can't make you want the truth
It's up to you! 

Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope

Feed me to pigs in your fantasies
Your sea roars bitter elegies
Like narcissus who bribes the pool
A hollow voice, ruin with a roof

Stop! Life is now, still all for you
Turn from the hate
Turn from the smoke
I see the parchment of your soul
The note, the song
Join your voice

I can't let you have the world
It's all for you! 

Yours is an empty hope

On your hands and your knees

Should have happened by now
Got these lines

So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all

I wake up
On the floor
Start it up again
Like it matters anymore
I don't know
If it does
Is this really all
That there ever was?
Put the gun
In my mouth
Close your eyes
Blow my fucking brains out
Pretty patterns
On the floor
That's enough for you
But I still need more

You'll never get inside,

And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.
Sometimes I don't believe them myself and I decided I was never coming
Down.
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.
It was just about too small to see.
But I watched it way too long.
That dot was pulling me down.
Chorus: I was up above it.
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
Shut up.
So what what does it matter now.
I was swimming in the hate now I crawl on the ground.
And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me.
I try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works
Out.
I guess the jokes on me.
Chorus
I used to be so big and strong.
I used to know my right from wrong.
I used to never be afraid.
I used to be somebody.
I used to have something inside.
Now just this hole it's open wide.
Used to want it all.
I used to be somebody.
I'll cross my heart and hope to die.
But the needle's already in my eye.
And all the world's weight is on my back and I don't even know why.
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory.
I looked him right in the eye and said ""goodbye.""

Or was it the war
But I've never been quite the same
Little white lies like ""I was there""

Come to Zom-Zom's a place to eat
Like it was built in one day
You can watch the humans
Trying to run

Oh look there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if he'd look the other way
You wouldn't believe

We are not romantics

It runs even deeper

And in a dream I'm a different me
With a perfect you
We fit perfectly
And for once in my life I feel complete-
And I still want to ruin it
Afraid to look
As clear as day
This plan has long been underway

I hear them call
I cannot stay

Do you know how far this has gone?
Just how damaged have I become?
When I think I can overcome
It runs even deeper
Everything that matters is gone
All the hands of hope have withdrawn
Could you try to help me hang on?
It runs...

I won't crack

If only I knew what I know today

I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I want to call you but I know you won't be there

I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just want to hide 'cause it's you I miss
You know it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back

I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
If I had just one more day, I would tell you how much that
I've missed you since you've been away

Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line to try to turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself

By hurting you"

You know how this world can beat you down
I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way
I'm always falling down the same hill
Bamboo puncturing this skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm
Drowning in
2 feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel
I stay inside my bed
I have lived so many lives all in my head
Don't tell me that you care
There really isn't anything now, is there?
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste
Like that means something
And oh so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel
I want to know everything
I want to be everywhere
I want to fuck everyone in the world
I want to do something that matters"

Just leave them laying on the floor
The one posted on the door
Not over here
Not anymore
There was a place that could have been
Step over all that used to be
Since you have let yourself come in
Somethings I'd rather you not see

See I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well I think I would for you

Didn't it seem like something more
So long I can't remember when
All this has happened all before
And this will happen all again
And I only have my self to blame

Everything is safer now
There's always a way to forget
Once you learn to find a way how

In the blur of serenity
Where did everything get lost?
The flowers of naivete
Buried in a layer of frost

The smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

Thought he had it all before they called his bluff
Found out that his skin just wasn't thick enough
Wanted to go back to how it was before
Thought he lost everything
Then he lost a whole lot more

A fool's devotion
Swallowed up in empty space
The tears of regret
Frozen to the side of his face

The smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes

I've done all I can do
Could I please come with you?
Sweet smell of sunshine
I remember sometimes"

As it crawls across a final time
And it feels like,
Like it was a friend.
It is watching us,
And the world we set on fire
Do you wonder,
If it feels the same?

And the sky is filled with light
Can you see it?
All the black is really white
If you believe it
As your time is running out
Let me take away your doubt
You can find a better a place
In this twilight

From dust to dust,
Ashes in your hair remind me
What it feels like
And I won't feel again
Night descends
Could I have been a better person
If I could only do it all again

And the sky is filled with light
Can you see it?
All the black is really white
If you believe it
And the longing that you feel
You know none of this is real
You will find a better place
In this twilight"

Them behind

To wind up back at-I'm back at the start

The closer we think we are
Well it only got us soo far
Have you got anything left to show?
No no I didn't think so

We cover ourselfs with lies
But underneath we're not soo tough
Love is not enough

Well it hides in the dark
Like the withered vien
We didn't give it a mouth
So it cannot complain

We'd never really make it through

I believed I could get better with you!

I want this right in your ear
You let me feel your danger
I let you make this feeling clear here

The heat of your breath
I wanna say all those things
That would be better unsaid
No

Will you please complete me?

Never be enough
To fill me up

Watch the white
Turn to red
It fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead
All my life
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead

The world is over and I realize it was all in my head

I can disappear

What if all the world you think you know is an elaborate dream?
And if you look at your reflection, is that all you want to be?
What if you could look right through the cracks?
Would you find yourself... Find yourself afraid to see?

What if all the world's inside of your head?
Just creations of your own...
Your devils and your gods and the living and the dead
And you really are alone
You can live in this illusion
You can choose to believe
You keep looking but you can't find words
Are you hiding in the trees?

I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all my bad parts
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear
Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid
Annie, hold a little tighter I might just slip away
It won't give up it wants me dead
Goddamn this noise inside my head"

This is the beginning

They can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark, see it in my eyes
This is the beginning
Well my reflection I don't recognize
This is the beginning

We think we've climbed so high
Up all the backs we've condemned
We face a consequence
This is the beginning of the end

You wait your turn
You'll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way
Cause I'm getting mine
This is the beginning
God helps the ones that can help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late as far as I can tell
This is the beginning

We think we've come so far
On all our lies we depend
We see no consequence
This is the beginning of the end."

Bye bye oooh
Find a place with the failed and forgotten
Bye bye oooh

There is a hate that burns within
The most desperate place i have ever been

I wish I could let it go

I'm trying to open my mouth wide
I'm trying not to choke and
Swallow it all, swallow it all, swallow it all, swallow it all

All your hurt sticks on me
And I keep it warm
They will make me stay, they won't let me leave
There are so god damned many of them it gets hard to breath

I built it up now I take it apart climbed up real high now fall down
Real far.
No need for me to stay the last thing left I just threw it away
I put my faith in god and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real wish there was something true
Wish there was something real in this world full of you

I'm the one without a soul I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell twenty-six years on my way to hell
Gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun
You know me I hate everyone

Wish there was something real wish there was something true
Wish there was something real in this world full of you

I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to"

She gets inside

It's in her kiss
As black as sea
And it runs deeper than you
Ever dared dream it could be

A wave goodbye
To what you were
The rules have changed
The lines begin to blur
She makes you hard
It comes on strong
You've find the place where you belong

I cannot go through this again [x4]

Just long enough to really make it hurt

[Chorus:]
Don't you fucking know what you are? [x3]
Go on get back to where you belong!

You better take a good look cause I'm full of shit
With every bit of my heart I've tried to believe in it

But you can't change anything
You can't change anything

They're starting to reach down through
And it feels like we're living in that split-second
Of a car crash
And time is slowing down
And if we only had a little more time
Then this time
Is all we have
Do you remember the time we
And all the times we
And should have
And were going to
I know
And I know you remember
How we could justify it all
And we knew better
In our hearts we knew better
And we told ourselves it didn't matter
And we chose to continue
And none of that matters anymore
In the hour of our twilight
And soon it will be all said and done
And we will all be back together as one
If we will continue at all

Shame on us
Doomed from the start
May god have mercy
On our dirty little hearts
Shame on us
For all we have done
And all we ever were
Just zeros and ones

And you never get away

And you never get to take the easy way
And all of this is a consequence
Brought on by our own hand
If you believe in that sort of thing
And did you ever really find
When you closed your eyes
Any place that was still
And at peace
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the lights start to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon if we
Will be anything at all

Shame on us
Doomed from the start
May god have mercy
On our dirty little hearts
Shame on us
For all we have done
And all we ever were
Just zeros and ones

May god have mercy
On our dirty little hearts
Shame on us (shame on us)

Baby mama love (that's what it is)
See I'll be damn if I let my son call another man Daddy
And if you feel like I feel, that's baby mama love

I know it's bad but I can't help myself

(talk to 'em man)
Went to da crib, did what we did, til about 6 in da mornin
Wasn't thinking bout havin no kids, just thinkin bout gettin in it on and
On and on and on and on
That's how I got where I'm at, right now
Lemme take it back, right now (let's go)
She was there for me everytime I needed, even when I got a lil lonely
Wasn't even like she was my gurl, she was more like she was my little homie she's more evil than you'll ever know
Sometimes you lose control
Hardest thing to get up out your system is that...

Hold on, it's gettin crucial, and bein truthful
I don't understand it
Oh I just won't have it
Have her out with anotha nigga out in tha bar
My self with anotha nigga in tha car
Gurl you ain't gonna play me
Cause I'm just gonna be toleratin this and payin dat
See I pay da bills, I pay da phone
If I catch you here again, homie we gon have a problem
Let it be known, I might not stay here but this is my home
Leave it alone, cause this child is my baby
No if and buts or maybes

The caterpillar, while it is in the cocoon, it is changing. Once the change has occurred the butterfly then has to get out of the cocoon. And during that exiting process, there is a huge struggle. If you alleviate the struggle, the butterfly will die, without ever flying. If we don't have the struggle, then we can't fly"

When you kissed me today
It was sweet but okay
That's a little much
And when we walk down the street
You'll be right under me
I can't move two feet without your touch

Ungreatful, oh no I am not
Most women would kill to have what I got (I know)
All I'm saying is that sometimes baby
There's nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe

Baby I just need a little space
A little break
From you today
Now I don't want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there (could you go over there x2)

When I'm getting ready
To go out with my peeps
You be looking at me
Like can I come too
Baby where are your friends
Aren't they off watching
Football or something
And waiting for you

Ungreatful, oh no I am not
Most women would kill to have what I got (I know)
All I'm saying is that sometimes baby
There's nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe

From you today
Now I don't want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there (could you go over there x2)

Just back up off of me
I'm not tryna be mean
But could you give me fifty feet
Only for a little while
I know you love to be by my side
And that's fine
But every once in a while
Take your space and give me mine

Write the lyrics, make a Milli,
Let another artist bring it,

Even got them Hip-Hop records drop back like that,
To make me better,
Bust it baby, pussy poppin,
Tell them mothers,

In languages I don't speak,

Write it in 15 minutes,
A milli stack up,
I've been writin 9 years,
Take your time and add up,

Not to mention my own,
There ain't many in my tax bracket,
Man I'm so alone,
Pack it up and send them home,
Pin on my microphone,
By the time they reach my level,
Man I'm already gone,

You ain't go this red dot is on your forehead,
My middle name is more bread,
And my last name is... Than your bread,

Hey, beating yourself up
Tryna figure up how you wound up out in the cold
Not only did you lose me, but the one that you was
Cheatin' on me also left ya alone, no, I can't speak for her
But that be mean(?) you had my mind and was clockin' my soul
But it fell apart cuz you couldn't recall first lie that you told

(Chorus)
Listen, baby, if you're gonna be a liar
At least try to be good at it
If you're gonna be a cheater
Our deal is not to be caught
Got her on the roots(?)
Or don't even play the game
Cuz you got me so high
Don't know what you doin'
Such an ameture

(Verse 2)
Beating myself up
Tryna figure out how you fooled me as long as you did
Mad at myself, so anxious for love that I wasn't payin' attention
But you got the best of me, gave you the best, best believe
Never again, said I'm way to smart, so believe me, baby, never again

(Chorus)
Listen, baby, if you're gonna be a liar
At least try to be good at it
If you're gonna be a cheater
Our deal is not to be caught
Got her on the roots(?)
Or don't even play the game
Cuz you got me so high
Don't know what you doin'
Such an ameture

(Bridge)
Smokin' mills(?), deception
Pillow saltin' tears, rejection
Your hopes and tears connect
When our heart is treated with no care or discretion
Ladies, what you fear is protection
From fellas that don't know about affection
But I'd try some love and affection
Only Mr. Smith and Weston(?)

(Chorus)
Baby, if you're gonna be a liar
At least try to be good at it
If you're gonna be a cheater
Our deal is not to be caught
Got her on the roots(?)
Or don't even play the game
Cuz you got me so high
Don't know what you doin'

Understanding what you have is bigger than this)

Feeling alone in the middle of the sea
That's what it feels like
Two weeks later and you're still not talking to me

Baby, the energy it takes
To act like I'm not there
We could be using that to make up
But you don't even seem to care

So let me try this again

I'm sorry for the wrong that I did
Why can't we just get over it?

Say it right
We're bigger than this
Bigger than this stupid fight
Baby girl, we're bigger than this
Bigger than this

Staying mad at me, for eternity
What's that gonna be?
So baby girl, try
What we got is so much bigger than this
Bigger Than This"

Nights full of fears, eyes full of tears
Cus you been hearin the same lies for 5 years.
Fresh out of high school he pursued his career
And you played the house wife roll for dude and his kids
But now you can't get a break no matter how hard you try,
Your life's on the line everytime you start up the ride
Cus you never got ur L's but its hard not to drive
When ur baby got a cold and the car is outside
Plus the hospital is far and ur dude ran out on ya
Just because he said that you had a mouth on ya,
Becus you would scream and holla
When he walk up in the room with maybeline up on his collar
And he didn't even bother to consider his child
He said he'd always be around but what's so different now?
You stressin now cause you can figure it out
But keep ur head in the clouds girl
Continue to smile girl
Cus baby you are a

Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down
Get up and just spread your wings and fly
Black angel

[Verse 2:]
He swept you off your feet when you met it was love at first sight
He didn't even curse, said he was the Church type
Was almost Mr. Right until ur first fight
And you found out he was worse than ike
Cus he hit you in the face so hard that I hurt to bite
Now your uncertain of this person you liked
But you keep making excuses for him being abusive
Cause you want it to work this time
So you convince your mind that it fine
But in time your gonna find
That real love aint defined with violence
And if you're crying every night
Just cause some guy decided its ahhite
To hit you in the eye then its time
That you learn from the mistakes
Of those that chose to stay
Cause most of em are gone today
And there's a gang of sistas
That would probably still be with us
If they would've just flown away Ne-yo gone and sang

[Chorus x 2:]
(you're fly)
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down
Get up and just spread your wings and fly
Black angel

[Bridge:]
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love
And start depending on the man above
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love
And start depending on the man above
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love
And start depending on the man above

Picture me and my gangsta girl, ridin' with the top back
Bangin' Ne-Yo, my neck free yo, my Sox hat
Tilted to the side like you know I get my grind on
Get my shine on, Jewelry Black in all rhinestones

Rims spinnin' like a globe, on these low pros
Do it big 'cause I'm supposed to floss
And that's the reason she break me off
'Cause I'm gangsta, and I'm ridin' with

Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman
Rollin' like a boss through, no matter the cost too
Kept tryin' to brag, what? Money not a issue
Don't let your girl see us that might make her diss you
'Cause if she roll with us, she won't even miss you

Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack
Before it hit the ground she throw it back
When I make it rain, that's chump change
That pay for the twenty six on my range
Range, range drive, drive

Take the wheel while I roll and slide
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze

And once again it's on
You should take a picture with your camera phone
Playa she not comin' home
And if I'm on her screen saver
That, that mean later we gone

If I let her take a picture, she gonna roll with me
If I let her take a picture, she gonna roll with me
If I let her take a picture, she gonna roll with me
Gonna roll with me, gonna roll with me

If you don't know by now, baby I'm a star
Look at my face, look at my car
Look at my waist then look at my scars
Look out the window, see where we are
In my Phantom, in my Rover, bangin'

Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman
She ain't never rolled in a car with the suicide
Girl, when it's you and I, they commitin' suicide
All of them want my girl
'Cause she pretty and thick in the thighs
Homie don't mastermind, do a song with suicide

She call me Jay, I call her B
We gettin' married to the streets
I'm chasin' money, she chasin' me
I'm right where I wanna be

With the B on my Bentley
The horse on my Lambo, crown on my Cadillac
Checks on my air max, haters better fall back
Before I put somethin' in your ball cap

That's my chick, I got her back like a bra strap
'Cause she fine and she cute
She think she all that, and she all that
That's my girl, that's my world

And once again it's on
You should take a picture with your camera phone
Playa she not comin' home
And if I'm on her screen saver
That, that mean later we gone

If I let her take a picture, she gonna roll with me

If I let her take a picture, she gonna roll with me
Gonna roll with me, gonna roll with me

We've been waitin' all night
Just to take a picture with you

Game, can you take a picture?
Ne-Yo, can you take a picture?
We've been waitin' all night
Just to take a picture with you

Grab the wheel take control
And let your hair blow inside my Lambo
Pull out ya phone, picture that
Take it home let ya man
Know I'm hitin' that, while I'm hitin' that

She send it back, she drop it low
We about to blow

So Be, she so Trina

I'm are Kelly, she remind me of my goldies
I'm cooly high, I'm cochi
She a thirty four D, I'm so pleased
I'm so so Def, she so Janet
I'm jd and she full of me

In the H2 we fold deep through the nyc off no sleep
I hate to drive but I break it wide
When I'm ridin' with my shawty
I'd kidnap her and never take her home

Ridin' off bangin' ne-yo sittin' on chrome
In that Mazaradi, see the paparazzi, they

But I told her though, ain't long ago
A relationship, I wasn't lookin' for
In and out of town and always on the road
But when I hit that city I called her though
And that's wrong, so wrong
She waited for me to come around so long, so long
And now that wifey material is wifey material
And if you ain't ready, the wife gotta let it go

So after this song
You gon' love me for my honesty
Or you gon' hate me for being me
Yeah, I'm sayin'
One of the two is gonna happen
With all that I can be
Is what I am and who I am

Chasing women when I should be recording
Invite a couple then I invite some more
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning
And I've only done one song
20k on champagne in the club
Then 20k more just because
That's 40k in 3 hours
But everybody watching my section
So it's alright babe, 
I know it may sound silly to you
Truthfully it's silly to me too
But that's what makes this song so true
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running in the dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look

[Chorus]
Then they will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah
They will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah yeah
So they will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah
They will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah

I ain't got a condom here
(Oh no)
Too lazy to run to the store
(And it's cold outside)
But you just met her 3 hours ago
Says the angel on my shoulder
See but the devil he could talk real loud
And on my decision I'm not proud
But by the grace of God I'm here right now
Help being good and older
So it's alright
I know it may sound reckless to you
Truthfully it's reckless to me too
But that's what makes this song so true
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be thankful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look

[Chorus]
Then they will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah
They will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah yeah

Oh I do a lot of stupid shit
Hoping I never have to pay for rent
It's like I become rather an idiot
Every extra million I get
I thank God for my family and my crew
'Cause I can be a lot to put up with
Much love to my people that don't mind
The cracks in Mr. Perfect

[Chorus]
So they will see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah
You can see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah yeah
You can see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah
Said you can see the cracks in mr. perfect
Yeah

[Outro]
And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson
Perfection is just glorified opinion
When in the grand scheming things it's our imperfections
That truly make us perfect
So do yourself a favor
Find the beauty in your cracks

First off let me say congratulations.
Heard that you just had a baby girl.
If she looks anything like her mother,
She's the prettiest thing in the world.
Swear that I'm not tryin' to start no trouble.
Tell your fiance he can relax.

There's a question I just gotta ask.

I straight made you girl
Gave you all the finer things in life

How you had me open for your lies
Every other girl I meet
Can't even trust, because I've seen
What you've done to me
Ain't no telling when I'd be ready

The harder it gets to deny it

Don't wanna love when you walk in the room
Don't wanna love everything to the click clack of your shoes
Don't wanna love when you put on sweats in the afternoon
And you curl up next to me as we watch cartoons

Is out working, and doing right by you
Not thinking that someday it would all catch up to me

And take advantage of the fact that you believe me
Because you love me, so I tell a few lies,

Every lie I sold her believing she bought,
And I slipped up in my game and baby got smart,

More Now Than I've Ever Had
Open My Eyes And Realized
That Nothing's Quite That Bad

I've Got A Different Approach
Of Dealin With Emotion
Keeping Control Of My Boat
While Drifting On This Ocean
Keeping My Head To The Sky
Keeping Tears Outta My Eyes
Girl, This Happiness Be The Reason
That I Just Haven't Cried

And Life's Too Short
To Dwell On All That's Wrong
Stand Up Now
Stand Up Now, 
And I Promise Not Before Long
Cuz You'll Be Feeling Better Today
Much Better Today, 
Much Better Today
So Much Better
Feelin Better Today..."

Feel you all over

Would be beyond understatement to
To simply say that I miss you
And the sky outside is blue
But my mind inside is too

Don't think about it
I only think about it
When gets old

When the sun goes down
And the moon comes up
And the stars come out
I can feel you all over
(Feel you all over)
All over
(Feel you all over)

Every time I breathe
Air into my lungs
I can close my eyes
And feel you all over
(Feel you all over)
All over
(Feel you all over)

God never makes mistakes I know
So there's a reason you had to go
There's a reason for no more lies
I just wish I knew what it was

Don't think about it
I only think about it
When gets old

When the sun goes down
And the moon comes up
And the stars come out
I can feel you all over
(Feel you all over)
All over
(Feel you all over)

Every time I breathe
Air into my lungs
I can close my eyes
And feel you all over
(Feel you all over)
All over
(Feel you all over)

And don't think about it, no
Suffer when the wind blows
Don't think about it
Suffer every time my heart goes

When the sun goes down
And the moon comes up
And the stars come out
I can feel you all over
(Feel you all over)
All over
(Feel you all over)

Every time I breathe
Air into my lungs
I can close my eyes
And feel you all over

Keep tellin' me you got a man, but he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing (Phally Phel on the track by the way)
He's showing you the minor things
Let me show you the finer things
Let me (I make my appearance) show you what you've been missing

[Kanye:]
Right about this time, raise your glasses
What's my motivation? That ass is
Start a conversation like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit

Go ahead and tell the dj ""play Swiss""
Now I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin' again, that's music to my ears
What you think my fuel was for all of these years?

I'm inspired when people don't like me
You keep me writing, so exciting
Man, the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson

Just to try the motherfuckers so you chain
Throw some cash, that's cake and icing
I ask her ""you blind?"" she said ""no, just sightseeing""
Maybe that's good, you just ain't found a right thing (yet)

Keep tellin' me you got a man, but he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing
He's showing you (allright) the minor things (uhuh)
Let (Cyssero) me show you the finer things (let me show you something)
Let (uhuh) me show you what you've been missing (If you knew better, you'd do better. You do better if you choose better)

[Cyssero:]
Let me show you what you've been missing
Guaranteed you'll be hooked like fishes
By the fisher man when he goes fishing
Lips made for kissing, body for caressing
Let me caress ya, let me undress ya,
I could be your professor, lemme just test ya
I'll be your ultimate sexer, and yes sir,
I'ma s** ya all through the semester

Hey, skip the lecture, I wanna get next to
You boo, boo, let me show you what it's like to ride with a G like me
I'll be where they can't go, see what they can't see
I could show you the finer things
I'm too major to know about the minor things (you dig?)
Obviously, you ain't found the right thing yet
I bet your man can't do it like me, check

Keep tellin' me you got a man
But he can't do what I can
Let me show you what you've been missing
He's showing you the minor things, (uhuh)
Let me show you the finer (uh) things (uhuh)
Let me (uh uhuh) show you (let me show you all) what you've been missing

We can parler, ball out all day
Yeah, I'm just trying to show you what the song say
Louis Vuitton sneaks, Louis Vuitton lay, Louis Vuitton Don and ridin' with Kanye
What did this bra say? ""Those heavy stones on your wrist"". She keeps askin how much do my arm weight
I replied back ""Boo, never mind that. I'm G4 jet. You ever fly that?""

The Paradise Island I was reclined back
In our bed, when we laying, you won't wanna fly back
You wanna try that, hit the mall and buy that?
But you'll miss out if you decide to sidetrack

I can have you by my side, ma, besides that
Hit it from the side, I took the decide to climax
Chain swing side to side and blind cats
Cyssero, Kanye and Ne-Yo, rewind that

Won't see her again till 12 noon and she don't smile like me

You kiss me once and I stand there stunned
I don't wanna break loose, baby
If I wanna break loose, baby
I'd be a fool to think I was the only one
I know you've got a few
So I try not to involve my emotions
It's just no use baby
Everthing that you do makes me
Just want you more

Baby, when I look at you
I just want you more
When you touch me like you do
I just want some more
Baby, baby you're forbidden fruit
And the fact that I can't have ya
Just makes me want you more

Verse 2:
You are temptation in everyway
You smile at me and (ooh)
When your around
I just can't behave
I don't wanna break loose, baby
But I know I need to, baby

I'd be a fool to think I was the only one
I know you've got a few
So I try not to involve my emotions

In the ghetto
Things don't always turn out the way
You would expect them to
That's how it goes
Its real life
Check it

She was a brick house bangin
Ill shoe game and
No regular cat could get that
She only wanted two things
A puppy and a man that
Wanted more than to just hit that

Well out on the block
What did she spot a
Pretty thug walkin a baby rot wiler

Pow
They caught eyes
It was love at first sight
Crazy how somethin that seems so right can go wroongg
See it didn't take too long
For her to see just what this dude was on

He was a good dude true and deep
But he liked to make his money runnin the street
So she hit him with its either the block or me
And the beautiful thing suddenly ugly

But that's how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesn't always have a happy ending

But that's how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesn't always have a happy ending
But that's how it goes

So she stay maintain and
She don't wana be alone
But every time he leave the house
She be worried bout
If hes even gona come back home

It seems no matter what she say
He must make that paper just
Gotta get his hustle on

But it hurts him to his heart cus his love is strong
And though hes tryna make things right for her
All she see's is wrong
All he can do is keep on
Cus she don't understand just what hes on

You see he loved her true and deep
But he had to make his paper in these streets
So she hit him with its either the block or me
And the beautiful thing suddenly ugly

But that's how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesn't always have a happy ending

But that's how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesn't always have a happy ending"

Or if you decide to give the male race a second chance
She said sorry but I'm taken

Of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking me, Earl James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty
But love for me, she didn't have any

Just not knowing, truly not knowing

Closing time, freak shop is over,
Candles burned down, bottles empty, no more champagne
So divine, did you enjoy yourself?
The look on your face says yes,
Eyes closed, biting on your bottom lip
You're reminiscing aren't you?
Thinking about what just took place,
The pleasure written on your face,
But it's over now, we've done the deed,
Headboard is broken, now it's time to go to sleep,

Suga you wore me out,
I know you're tired now,
Let's go to sleep,

And go to sleep,
And tomorrow we can run this thing back again,
But let's go to sleep, let's go to sleep, let's go to sleep, baby.

Verse 2:
Closing time, I must confess,
You backed up all that mess you talked for real,
I'm tired as hell,
I'm just laying here, staring at you,
Letting my eyes travel your curvaceous body,
Your lovin' was good, so soft and s***,
Girl I'm almost tempted to jump right back on you,
I'm just playing babe, don't mind me,
My back's hurting, you're out cold,
Now it's time to go to sleep.

Think I did pretty good

To bring to the house
Wanted to know

To be with me

Back here at home
Cause I need you
Back here at home
Find your way home

Did you know that
Nobody likes to be alone
On Christmas time
Christmas time is here
And all I really want
Is you

So
If you don't mind
If you don't mind
Could you
Think about me
How much I miss you
And how long
You've been gone
And please
Find your way home

(Chorus)

So
If you don't mind
If you don't mind
Could you
Think about me
How much I miss you
And how long
You've been gone
And please
Find your way home"

And everybody knows what it is that I need to do, 
Well, do me a favor let me worry about me and you worry about you! 
I don't need no one to put me down,

I try not to be so
Damn obviously overcome
When you smile at me
I try not to care that
You've become the air in my lungs
That I live to breathe

I love you

I don't care far away it is
When all I fear
This love will simply say it's not over again
I just can't believe how
Scared I used to be to say
What you are to me
I would surely die if
You were ever to fly away
Cuz I live to breathe you

Momma please, have more faith in me
You didn't raise a fool, I'm gonna stay by ya side
Though I know you don't want me to
So this letter reads
Momma, please understand

Momma, I'm sorry
You know I never meant to hurt you, no
But I'm in love with the boy next door
Momma, please understand
And momma, I'm so sorry
But I don't think that I can let him go
I'm in love with the boy next door

Nothing I can say to make you feel the way you feel
But finally I found the love that I know is real, really real
And I ain't gonna give it up, not for nothing
I ain't gonna give it up
(No)
So momma won't you please understand the way I feel
Please understand

Momma, I'm sorry
You know I never meant to hurt you, no
But I'm in love with the boy next door
Momma, please understand
And momma, I'm so sorry
But I don't think that I can let him go
I'm in love with the boy next door"

Normally I fall back just stay out of it

Girl, you're much too beautiful to be just ore on his list
You know what he is
Answer me this... 

Baby, think it's gonna start with you
Baby if you only knew
He gon' do what he wants to
With or Without You

I don't understand
Why sell yourself short (why sell yourself short, girl)
Giving your love to someone Whos only with you for sport
(You're just another contact, open your eyes)

He tells you this time it's love
This time it's real
(This time it's real x 2)
You know that he's lying
And yet you stay with him still
Are you foreal?
Tell me what's the deal

Baby if you only knew
He gon' do what he wants to
With or Without You

You're worth so much
So much more than just
His late night crush
Girl why can't you see that it's not love
He's broken so many hearts
Don't you be another one

She don't really drink much so she say
But by the way she was putting in the Malibu Reds away
She was either 'bout that life
Tryna front but tryna get right
Or maybe she work hard, everyday, at her job
And she feel like she deserve to turn up tonight
Either way, miss lady bad as a Toblerone sugar rush
I drew her near, whispered in her ear
""I think that I'm developing a little crush""
She said ""Nice try, but every short skirt that done walked by has successfully caught your eye
No thanks but I'm sure that you're a nice guy""
Damn, I had no reply, cause she was right
Newly single so I've been a little thirsty
She was more than just a booty in a skirt she
Walked a way I caught up to her in a hurry
I said ""Can I at least know your name before your dead me""
She turned around and said ""My name's integrity""
Integrity, can you answer this for me

[Hook] (x2)
Baby where do you wanna go?
I'll do what you say
She pointed to the top
She said take me all the way
Matter of fact I'll meet you there
Woah, I fell in love

Oh Integrity
I think that I need you and me babe

No it ain't like me to drop too hard
Or go out of my way to know who you are
Said if you're not one for chasing
But I'll admit
Something in you
Has got my attention girl
So if I can
Be a gentleman
Can I ask your permission girl

Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your name
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name
Can I know your name

Looking at you girl I see so much
So much potential for something better than that
Like maybe me and you becoming us
I'm not trying to scare you
But in your eyes
I can see why
People write love songs
And if God allowed
I could see how
I could love you for so long

Hear me when I say this to you,

Crying in two empty shot glasses,
Cheers to herself then drink them down,
I should've just walked away,
But there was something about her,

Took a seat and said,
(So, you from outta town?)

I should've known she was crazy,
I've seen it in her eyes,
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
I did not realize
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
(She's crazy)

She looked at me,
And I swear the blood froze in my veins,
Her eyes pierced my heart and made it stop,
The room started spinning,
All of a sudden my vision was blurred,
And it got cold as I felt the temperature suddenly drop,
I'm getting scared now,
But I don't show it,
But it's like she's looking through me,
So I think that she know it,
That's when she pulled me close,
Holding me so tight,
Said I don't care about tomorrow,
But your mine tonight,

[Chorus:]

I should've known she was crazy,
I've seen it in her eyes,
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
I did not realize
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
(She's crazy)

[Harmonizing]

Crazy (crazy)
What you do to me,

[Chorus:]

I should've known she was crazy,
I've seen it in her eyes,
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
I did not realize
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,

And what I wouldn't give to burn the popcorn and hear you tell me, ""baby that's okay""
Baby that's okay
Then you leave to go to the store and it's almost too much for me
Though I know it'll only be a minute
Then you come back through the door with a bag of all the foods that we're not supposed to eat
Now tonight that can't be beat
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you

I believe that love and trust are one in the same
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt
No matter what this person sayin, that person
You believe your man
Now you say you love me, but every time one of your little friends come at you with something
We gotta do this
Mama I'm tryin, I'm trying to show you that I'm for real
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you

[Jennifer Hudson talking:]
Just shut up and listen

[Verse 1 - Jennifer Hudson:]
Two hundred and sixteen
That's how many times that I went
Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is
There's something about it
That don't feel right

[Bridge 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
Saturday she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me

[Chorus 1 - Jennifer Hudson]
You're leaving tonight
Out of my life
Everyone said you ain't no good
And you proved them right
You're leaving tonight
It's over and done
Ain't no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes
(You're leaving tonight)

[Verse 2 - Ne-Yo]
Baby now hold up
Lets just settle down
Cuz there's a perfect explanation
To this situation
That we're goin through
(This thing that we're goin through)
I swear I don't know that girl
But I seen her 'round
And she's expressed how much she want it
But baby I'm not doin' it
All of me is for all of you ooooh

[Bridge 2 - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson)]
Said I got a girl like a thousand times
(So you counted)
She kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry bout it)
Please believe I'm telling the truth
(I really doubt it)
Really wish you would believe in me

[Chorus 2 - Ne-Yo]
I'm not leaving tonight
Girl you're my life
All of your friends think I'm no good
Please don't prove them right
I'm not leaving tonight
Its over and done
Let's leave this alone, and lets make love
Till the morning come
(Not leaving tonight)

[Bridge 3 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
Oh I won't deny
That everything in my body
Wants to know that you're the one
(So what's the problem girl?)
See I can't take this serious when you're just having fun
(No, I'm not just having fun)
Steady running around making a fool of me
(Baby girl you can't listen to everyone
I'm your man, trust in me
Don't let them interfere with us being happy)

[Breakdown - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
(Love me girl)
I love you, that's a fact
(Say that you love me baby)
But I'll be dammed if ima let you up and disrespect who's been there from the start
(You not gon disrespect my heart)
You claim to not know (not know that girl)
But her name and number is in your phone
She even got a ringtone
You care to explain that part?

Go ahead let them be mad
So we gonna keep moving how we move
So let them be mad

Blog sites, media talking
I wonder why they telling me to be cautious
Filling the blanks while the drama is pouring
I don't pay attention, I don't really read it too often
Got niggas hating on me for years I holds it down
Talking bout the women I'm fucking and the money I spend
Why they tripping? already knowing that I'm destined to win
Use it to motivate the grind and they at it again
Damn, they mad at me, sneak... and throwing a little jab at me
See me and be mad happy
Half filled wine glasses as the time passes
Cooler breeze, eye cashing with the fine accent
Still on my shit though, remember when I was piss posed
So now I'm surrounded by powerful niggas that get dough
Huh, I prolly got your girlfriend wanting to get low
Infatuated by all the haters, I need to get more

[Refrain]

We get the jealousy and envy
Cause she can never be you
And he can never be me
And she mad at him cause he can never be me
And she mad at you because you better than she
They hit the blogsites to see the highlights
How lighter they life, talking bout our life
We doing things haters can only dream
This kinda be messing with they up esteem you know

Do me a favor, keep your nose up out my situation
Besides your angering mind, your time is what you wasting
Been through bs in life, can show a demonstration
But built my shit from the ground up, renovation
The past lurking, I see they hurting I stall them out
You where you at for a reason, nothing to talk about
The roads to success been a lot of ups and downs
Doing you up, they merry goes, they come around

Wait a minute, I didn't say I was coming home with you
Well I mean, you didn't necessarily say you wasn't
Stop tryna be cute
I'm just saying. I want you, it's clear that you want me
Conceded
Confident, there's a difference. And to deny our impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human
Spare me the game. It's clear that you want it, the question is, do you deserve it?
I can show you so much better than I can tell you, that is if I let you
Let you what?

Driver's Looking at me strange cause I got in.
Handed Him A Wad of Cash
Sat back and told him just drive.
I'm thinking bout the day you packed your things and left.
Saying you knew all Shanelle, Tiffany Tracey, Stephanie
You went away so I'm writing in the fog from the window to express myself and how I'm feeling

As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, That means I'm Lonely.

I see a woman walking with her man (Man)
Man with his woman
Smiling as they stroll into this little bar (bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands. I Get
Sick to my stomach
So jealous of how fucking happy they are
Lucky ass
There's A couple different people I could call right now.
But the one I want and don't want me at all right now
And That Hurts
Threw My Heart, My Mind And My Soul (Soul)

The more she would forget him
But then back around to scene he started coming
Now she's on the low, takin' phone calls from him

[Intro: Ne-Yo]
Oh, nights like these, I live for nights like these, yeah

[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
Start me up a vodka tonic
Sittin' at the bar in a
Hole in the wall on the east side
And the drinks don't cost me much
And there's never anybody there
Incognito suits me just fine, yeah, yeah

A man with a guitar, not tryna be a star
Stool in a small stage, singin' the pain away
Señorita get up and dance

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Oh, nights like these, I live for nights like these
When you ain't nobody but you and I'm just me, ayy
Not the lights, no glitz and glam, just good vibes and good company
Oh, nights like these, I live for nights like these

[Verse 2: Romeo Santos]
Sírvame un trago 'e Negroni
Locación está perfecta, puedo ser normal
Hoy deseo ser humano y desacatarme sin nadie opinar
Con la morena del vestido colorado quisiera bailar
(Hey, sólo escucha)

[Pre-Chorus: Romeo Santos]
Una noche sin ser Romeo
Y me doy un baño del pueblo
Bailo, sudo, me emborracho
Yo bailaría una bachata
Que no todas [?]
Sería algo tan especial

[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
Noches así que me hacen sentir
Son momentos que me incitan a vivir
No hay glamor, nadie es estrella, nadie brilla, ni una [?]
Por noches así me escapo y soy feliz

Where ain't nobody worried 'bout a spotlight
I'm nobody, you nobody and it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, ayy

Ne-Yo,Non-Fiction,/n/ne+yo/non+fiction_21094290.html,"[Intro]
The story you 'bout to hear is complete fiction. It is however made up of a group of stories, true stories about real people. Thus creating real characters going through real things. Thus making the story itself real, true and a real story, a true story, is non-fiction

Our story begins in a dark place. A place where you learn that everything that you wanted, could potentially be the very thing that leads to your destruction. The very thing you should fear. This is a lesson learned the hard way, experience being the only teacher. I mean you can't exactly tell a broke man that money is evil and expect him to listen to you now can you? Naw he's got to go down that road, he's got to face them demons himself before he can acquire that knowledge. The money solves one group of problems only to introduce another. Strangers become friends, friends become enemies. The fame, just like any other drug feels incredible until you realize all that adoration, all that love, ain't real. And the women, huh, the women, a drug you use that uses you right back. A high for a high so to speak. Which brings us to Tammy"

That'd be good

Is that I'm gonna try
And do better for you

That they're some faults

A bit harder than I do

I can see you looking at me,
You're thinking too little too late
Cause it was me that said that we shouldn't be
But that was before I could think straight
My pride, it made me lie, lie, lie
To you and to myself about what I need
So now I walk around with this lie, truly dying inside
Acting like I'm just fine, it's something I just can't do
Something just I can't do, keep pretending
That I'm okay without, just said something I just can't do
Something I just can't do
What if could I'm just no strong enough to, whoa
Not strong enough to who
Keep lying to you, babe,
I'm just not strong enough to, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

Said I'm trying to be honest, then making you a promise
I'm gonna be true to you
Cause me trying to deny that without you I would die

See you've probably been lookin' for way more out a weekend
Than freakin' and watchin' the Sun fly so high
But you feel so nasty and don't know why
You tried all the things that you weren't gon' try
Like kiss body parts if it wasn't on a guy
But your girl's in the bed and it wasn't undivided
And wasn't no ambition, and everybody wishin'
We'd have did this shit way back then, why we didn't?
Even if you went too far, it's forgiven
You were high when you did it, everybody was trippin'
Promised you'd forget it, but everybody didn't
You're like, this ass doesn't land in the air, body mitten
And I don't just be lookin' on everybody's kitten
But you get in the room and my dick in the room
Make your forget about all the chicks in the room, like that

Ain't gon' lie to you
I want you, how could I not with a booty so fat?
I don't wanna get on your nerves and test your patience
I ain't tryna do that, no
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
I would love the opportunity to rub your feet
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
If you with it, I got somebody sexy you should meet

Ne-Yo,Part Of The List,/n/ne+yo/part+of+the+list_20762118.html,"Style of your hair
Shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare...
As if you see, right through to my soul

It's your left hand and the way
That it's not quite as big as your right
The way you stand in the mirror...
Before we go out at night
Our quiet time... Your beautiful mind...

They're a part of the list
Things that I miss...
Things like your, funny little laugh
And the way you smile or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this...
I come up with
Something new, every single time
That I sit and reminisce

The way your sweet smell
Lingers when you leave the room (you leave the room)
Stories you tell as we lay
In bed all afternoon (all afternoon)

I dreamed you now every night
In my mind is where we meet (in my mind is where we meet)
And when I'm awake
Staring at pictures of you asleep

Touching your face... Invading your space

They're a part of the list
Things that I miss...
Things like your, funny little laugh
And the way you smile or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this...
I come up with
Something new, every single time
That I sit and reminisce

Oh, and you'll live in my
Memories, forever more I swear
And you'll live in my...
Memories, forever more I swear

They're a part of the list
Things that I miss...
Things like your, funny little laugh
And the way you smile or the way we kiss
What I noticed is this...
I come up with
Something new, every single time
That I sit and reminisce"
Ne-Yo,Piano,/n/ne+yo/piano_20777685.html,"Someone point me in the right direction
Tell me where's the nearest piece of mind?
I'm going crazy

Knight in shining armor in the distance
He sees the angel threatening my life
Why won't he save me?

All I want is somebody to give a damn
Notice that I'm struggling and lend a hand
They say
Everybody needs someone to understand
Well damnit that includes me too

And all I want is someone to be there for me
Someone that genuinely cares
But I'm just dreaming
It's like I'm silently screaming

Even though I'm totally surrounded
I feel like I'm in here by myself

How about you do it cuz you love me?
Not cuz you want something in return
Is that so crazy?
Crazy

In the middle of the sea of helpless
But see, I never learned how to swim
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

All I want is somebody to give a damn
Notice that I'm struggling and lend a hand
They say
Everybody needs someone to understand
Well damnit that includes me too

And all I want is someone to be there for me
Someone that genuinely cares
But I'm just dreaming
It's like I'm silently screaming

Somebody to catch me when I fall
Somebody to help me through it all
Someone I can trust
Tell me if I'm asking too much

All I want is somebody to give a damn
Notice that I'm struggling and lend a hand
They say
Everybody needs someone to understand
Well damnit that includes me too

All I want is someone to be there for me
Someone that I can genuinely trust

Silently screaming

I see your movements, I peep your mini macking
But there's a couple different ways that you can make it happen
You ain't the average running up on her as she walk
And plus you R&B so you ain't even gotta talk
Writing it down has always helped me out when trying to get up
So you don't gotta sweat her
Think about it, find a pen and put it in a letter

I'm not a star in her mind I'm her lover

She close her eyes
She can't stop it no
She hypnotised
My music playing in the background
She's almost there yeah yeah yeah
She turns it up
She lets my voice get her there
She use me as part of her masturbation

Hear my song and her legs just won't stop shaking
Yeah yeah"

Hey baby, sitting beside somebody
He just drinkin and treating you like nobody (nobody)
So wrong, I don't condone,
The misuse of a dime
I go outta my way,
Shootin my swag in your direction
In attempt to make a connection

She notice that I'm interested
And I can tell that she's interested
So girl, since we both interested
We should make this move
And the fella she came with,
Don't even notice,
He about to be alone
In the back of my mind, I felt wrong
But then I thought to myself,
Hold on

She don't want him
She wants me
She don't want him,
Not anymore (not anymore, no)
She came here with him,
But she gon' leave with me
She don't want him,
Not anymore, not anymore

Ooo so s*** to me
This dude is out his mind
Only a fool, would ever neglect
Somebody so dam fine, she dancin
She got a body that nobody can deny,
He poppin bottles, and ignorin her
That's why, before it's over she gonna be
By my side
No longer feelin that guy

She don't want him

Don't you hate a coulda, woulda, shoulda? (oh oh no, oh oh no)
Coulda did, woulda did, what you shoulda (oh oh no, oh oh no)

If I had a dollar for every should be you know how rich I would be
Like they say it is what it is, now what it could be, 
Can't cry feel guilt over spilled milk, 
I'm too fly, I'm too cool, word to versace silk, 
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds
I got good watches just bad timing
The chick I met at the club was cute, 
Still feel like I'm gettin' brain from the substitute, 
'Cause this ain't you and I ain't me, 
Complain you happy then why you're so mad at me, 
Can't hold on of what you had just what you got, 
You should be here, but you're not.

[Chorus - ne-yo:]
I'm doing it again, what I told myself I would not do, oh
It's 4:15 am I'm sitting here drinkin, reminisin' on you, oh
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't
You'd get blowed then we both get low
As I lay here with some girl I don't know
In the back of my mind, one million times
I tell myself it should be you, should be you, should be you
And me right now said it should be you, should be you, 
Should be you and me right now uhh.

As I watch her sleep, all that I can think
She's beautiful but she's not you
Love her just a night, then out of my life
Damn why can I do just right, when you told me you wanted to leave
I pretended it didn't hurt me, 
But if I here I can hardly breathe, 
Laying next to she when in reality, it should be

[Chorus - ne-yo:]
It should be you, oh, should be you, should be you
And me, right now, right now
Said it should be you, should be you, 
Should be you and me, right now ah
Uhh uhh should be you, should be you baby ahh

[Diddy:]
Check this out, 
My life lights cameras fame and action, 
Feeling dreams from all these private planes I'm catchin'
Willing to trade all the flashy chains and flashin for a night
Back for us exchangin pain and passion, 
Romances, tryin to like the phantom doors you used to ride
Cause it's tryin to open up it's like suicide, 
God teaches lessons every day, 
You is all I needed like meth and mary j
The sun don't shine forever
Any time that we fall that just means we just climb together, 
Guess we avoided what we couldn't went through
That don't change the fact that it should have been you.

Girl it's should be you

[Chorus - ne-yo:]
It should be you, oh, should be you, should be you
And me, right now, right now
Said it should be you, should be you, 
Should be you and me, right now aha
Uhh uhh, I said it should be you, it should be you baby ahh"

And I'm stronger then this

With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Leave me alone

Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Let it go
Turning off the radio

So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

The stars, see, are sparkling
Each giving off it's own light
Like the people on this planet
Yeah, so I, too
Want to shine particularly bright
I close my eyes and make a vow in my heart
And entrust my dreams to that shooting star

I'm in my usual park
I can see the night scenery
On the slide
That's been my special seat for years
Whenever I'm worried about something, I come here
Just like then, I'm on my way to my dreams
But unable to fulfil them
эgmaybe this is the end of the lineэh
There are days when I say weak things like that
But every time, I remember
That starry sky where I looked for a shooting star
The wish I made when I was little
Hasn't changed even now

When I look up at the sky
The stars, see, are sparkling
Each giving off it's own light
Like the people on this planet
Yeah, so I, too
Want to shine particularly bright
I close my eyes and make a vow in my heart
And entrust my dreams to that shooting star

Hiding out in the schoolyard at night with my mates
We climbed the wire netting
The field seemed to have a different face than during the day
We headed for our sea called the pool
We didn't have swimming trunks, so we were all stark naked
Someone jumped in with a strange yell
The splash echoed through the night
эgafter him! эh Everyone else piled in
We floated gently, looking up at the sky
Looked at the stars in front of us, and talked about heaps of dreams
And looked for that shooting star

When I look up at the sky
The stars, see, are sparkling
Each giving off it's own light
Like the people on this planet
Yeah, so I, too
Want to shine particularly bright
I close my eyes and make a vow in my heart
And entrust my dreams to that shooting star

Looking up at the sky, there are countless stars
The same number now that there was years ago
My dreams are endless and crazy
Incredibly bright, like that star

Hey! If you keep hanging your head like that
You won't even be able to see the things you can see
Look up at the sky, keep your head up!!
Hey! эgwhat do you think of the sky you see? эh
Someday, like that shining starэc
I wanna shine

When I look up at the sky
The stars, see, are sparkling
Each giving off it's own light
Like the people on this planet
Yeah, so I, too
Want to shine particularly bright
I close my eyes and make a vow in my heart

Sneaking out of the classroom, by the back door.
A man railed at me twice though, but I didn't care.
Waiting is wasting for people like me.

Mihatteru sora so full
Norikonda starting

Kore ga saigo no forever trip!

You are my friend,
Aa, ano hi no yume
Ima demo mada wasuretenain deshou?

You are my dream
Aa, hajimete bakka
Kimi wa my long lost friend

Whoa, ima tabidatsu yo!

Thank you my friend
Aa, ano hi no koto
Ima demo mada oboeteru kara

You are my dream
Aa, mou kondo koso mamoru my way

Whoa The Distance!"

Night Shift,Ang Sarap Mong Magmahal,/n/night+shift/ang+sarap+mong+magmahal_20733001.html,"Kung malayo ka sa akin
Hinahanap-hanap kita
Di ko alam ang aking gagawin
Laging laman ng isip ko'y ikaw

Marinig lang ang boses mo
Umaapaw sa tuwa ang aking puso
At sana'y lagi tayong magkasama
Mababaliw ako pag nawalay ka

Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napakalambing mo
Yan ang hinahanap ko
Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napapawi ang problema ko

Pag nagkatampuhan tayo
Alam mo agad ang gagawin
Alam mong mahina ang loob ko
Pinalalakas lang ng iyong lambing

Marinig lang ang boses mo
Umaapaw sa tuwa ang aking puso
At sana'y lagi tayong magkasama
Mababaliw ako pag nawalay ka

Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napakalambing mo
Yan ang hinahanap ko
Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napapawi ang problema ko

Lalo na pag magkasama tayo
Naiinlove lalo sa'yo
Kaya't wala ng hihigit pa
Ikaw lang talaga
Ikaw lang talaga

Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napakalambing mo
Yan ang hinahanap ko
Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napapawi ang problema ko

Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napakalambing mo
Yan ang hinahanap ko
Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napapawi ang problema ko

Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napakalambing mo
Yan ang hinahanap ko
Ang sarap mong magmahal
Napapawi ang problema ko"
