It's been nearly one year since
Our Rio
Nights of forever
Pictures of you and me
Dancing and memories

Through the masquerade
You led me by the hand
Whispered the words
""This Is Forever""
Said from the silver tongue
Thats where it started from

Oh Anthonio,
My Anthonio,
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?
Did you even know my name?
Did you ever really care?

Oh Anthonio,
My Anthonio,
Do you ever wonder why,
Or where I am now?
Do you ever feel ashamed?
Do you even feel a thing?

Oh

There I was under stars
Hearts made in the sand
Lying from the boy
From Ipanema
Tide comes rushing in
Time and time again

Now that summer has gone
Where did you run?
All my letters are
Returned to sender
For eternity
You're a part of me

Oh Anthonio,
My Anthonio,
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?
Did you even know my name?
Did you ever really care?

Oh Anthonio,
My Anthonio,
Do you ever wonder why,
Or where I am now?
Do you ever feel ashamed?
Do you even feel a thing?

Oh

Oh Anthonio,
My Anthonio,
You got everything you ever wanted from me,
I was just another girl
It was just another night

Oh Anthonio,
My Anthonio,
There is only one thing,
That I'm trying to say
It may come as a suprise
My baby has your eyes."

I don't know dudes when will we reunite
But I'm goanna miss you all infinite,
Each Memory is so precious...
It seems like heaven around us!
Splendid afternoon of campus
Guys freaked out with big fuss...
We had a different fun
'That would never turn
High dreams would fly
To touch the blue sky!
Without any reason
We celebrated every good n bad season
Come on, follow this concordant
Our college days are the best.

Among the crowd of million faces,
Torn memories are floating into pieces
Surely you'll also miss like me
All those crazy things we used to be!
The nap in between boring lecture,
And the classes we all bunked together;
Pretty was the desire of hot guy,
But the match doesn't imply...
Good girl concentrates on study!
She doesn't believe in flattery;
Demand for the expensive food
Payment is the part of rich dude!
Last min Copying assignments in an hour
N when we'd reach submissions would b over!
All those funny things would
One day cover some pages of my book;
Someday when I'll close my eyes...
This world will be beyond my sight;
The premises, that assembly of fest,
Emerged in fun, and we never cared
Yesterday may die, but tomorrow will never
Exams waiting for the next...
We always respect n remember
The dedication of our teachers
Though everything was frenzy
Since, we're proud of our decency
Come on, follow this concordant
Our college days are the best.

{Still recall that first day of college
The battle of seniors,
When we were afraid of being ragged
These were the interaction}
God knows from when
My breath touches the good rain
Tender wet red roses
My innocence and your promises
Love holds our hands silently
The weather was so cloudy
Twinkling of your eyes!
It's since like a surprise,
Whatever be the end
We'll always be friends
Nothing to lose, you're all in my heart
Here we got the most beautiful part
Convocation, the final gathering
Do you feel your tear's smothering?
Let's promise to be strong
Love, apology and this song
So don't be late...

Everywhere I turn I can see them

Night and day
I eat, sleep and breathe them

I'm an ordinary woman
With feelings
I'd like a man to nibble on my ear
But I'll admit
No man as bit
So how come I'm the mother of the year?

Little cheeks
Little teeth
Everything around me is little
If I wring
Little necks
Surely I will get an acquittal

Some women are dripping with diamonds
Some women are dripping with pearls
Lucky me! Lucky me!
Look at what I'm dripping with
Little girls

How I hate
Little shoes
Little socks
And each little bloomer
I'd have cracked
Years ago
If it weren't for my
Sense of humor

Some day
I'll step on their freckles
Some night
I'll straighten their curls
Send a flood
Send the flu
Anything that You can do
To little girls

Some day I'll land in the nut house
With all the nuts and the squirrels
There I'll stay
Tucked away
Until the prohibition of

But Brother,
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile!

Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly
They stand out a mile --
But Brother,
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile!

Who cares what they're wearing
On Main Street,
Or Saville Row,
It's what you wear from ear to ear
And not from head to toe
(That matters)

So, Senator,
So, Janitor,
So long for a while
Remember,
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile!

Ready or not, here he goes

Sapanon mein tu hi tu hai teri hi aarazu hai
O jaana hoon hoon

Dil mein hai tu dhadakan mein tu
Haan mil ke bhi kyon sanam milane ki aas hai
Pahale aisa na tha kaisa ahasaas hai
Ye aalam naya hai
Chhaai hai bekhudi main bhi hoon bekhabar
Sunate hain pyaar mein hota hai ye asar 
Ye kaisa nasha hai madahosh ho gai hoon
O jaana hoon hoon... 

Pahali nazar mein hi jaadu ye chal gaya
Deevaane dil ka to mausam badal gaya
Dil de de nazaraana
Haay chaahat bhari teri baahon mein jhool ke
Jhoome hai zindagi duniya ko bhool ke
Dil le le nazaraana
Main pyaar kar raha hoon kya zurm kar raha hoon
O jaana hoon hoon..."

Lead me in my dreams again
So what is it worth, i'll sell my soul
What is it worth, only you know

Like a dream
To save me from my mortality
Put on your dress white goddess
And settle in as the weather folds
Our lives will be entwined even when I die
You'll see me through 'till the end of time
No earthly bride
The most beautiful star in the world

In naked photographs
Your filthy lies

I was a fool to let you go
So what did I expect?
This is all that I
Have left

Those drunken fights
Injured in shards of glass
My stubborn stance
Could never let things pass

[Chorus]
So many words I now regret
So much for self-respect
This is all that I
Have left

[Bridge]
Sifting through these memories
Searching blindly for the key
To unlock the mystery
The reason why you had to leave
This enigma that remains
Through the laughter, through the pain
Is this all?
Is this all?

[Verse 3]
Unwanted books
Junk letters in your name
Your lingering ghost
A haunting sense of shame

To which we'll never get
All the pretty songs
That I could not forget
Oh, this is all that I
Have left"

Will make you stronger

So take courage
Take your chances
And one day you will find your answers

On its axis

It's sad but it's true so I must get on
With my short life meandering on and on
Into inexistance

I try so hard
But I can never have her back again
I lost it all and she heard me cry
And she knows so well

That it's sad but it's true so I must get on
With my short life been gathering on and on
Into inexistance

If you like me
If you're like me
If you're coasting
I will dream with you
Until you came around

Tender is the night
As you sing a lullaby
To the darkness

Yeah I find solace in your eyes
Can't face the silence from your side
The sky is starless, ease the darkness
Through the night till the morning light
I find solace in your eyes
Can't face the silence from your side
The sky is starless, ease the darkness
Through the night till morning light"

In a briefcase combination: 3, 2, 1 (which only I know)
And I've just seen my mentor, dr. No
""california sun"" is on the radio, let's go

I just wanna reach the radio star
It's a satellite off venus and it ain't too far

I was shooting up in my hotel room
When the phone started ringing - oh no
It was dr. No, he gave the password
He said, 'hey, man, haven't you heard? And I said 'no'
'the world's been invaded by alien life forms
Meet me at the airport, we've got to get out - let's go

I ran to the window and looked out, there were dead people lying all over the streets.
Within two minutes I had all my stuff together.
I jumped in my car and was speeding down the highway past all the deserted cars.
In five minutes I was at the airport but there at the gates I saw what I suppose was one of these 'alien life forms'.
I pulled my bazooka out of it's bag in the back of the car and blew it to hell.
As arrange dr. No was waiting for me in the terminal.
We got in his private jet plane and took off, two hours later landing in zaire, where we met up with fu manchu, hannibal lecter, the hooded claw and all the rest of the gang.
We boarded the rocket and soon we were shooting off for the stars and as we approached the space station I looked down and observed the earth, the us air force being annihilated and swarms of nuclear weapons soaring through the stratosphere destroying the earth - and I swear to God I laughed."

Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads it's wings
Light a candle in your heart
Light it to the spring
Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads it's wings
We can't keep a hold on time
Just recieve what it will bring

Mellow evenings in the spring
Full of warmth and hope
You are dreaming unaware
Unaware that you are letting go

Walking through this changing season
Sorrow spreads it wings
We can't keep a hold on time
Just recieve what it will bring
Walking through this lonely season
Sorrow spreads it's wings
Light a candle in your heart
Light it to the spring

Springtime's slipping away my love
Yeah springtime's slipping away
Heaven's slipping away my love
Yeah heaven's slipping away."

Got a fever burning and I don't feel right
Yeah my head's rushing right out of my mind
Went to the doctor and he gave me pills
Yeah they numbed my pain but didn't cure my ills
What's in the future cause I can't see
Fortune teller got me down on my knees

Go and see the fortune teller
Will she tell me all she knows
Go and see the fortune teller baby
Find out how it goes

I found myself living in a concrete hell
Found myself thinking don't need no-one else
I'm feeling damaged yeah I feel deranged
I need something to counter-act the pain
Can't see the stars but could they give me a sign
Yeah I need to know now don't tell me no lies
I've been completely going out of my mind
I feel beat up just like jesus christ
What's in the future cause I can't see

Down towards the cool calm river,
I can hear their song.

Sitting in our dreamy days by the water's edge,
On a cool summer's night.
Fireflies and the stars in the sky,
Gentle glowing light,
From your cigarette.
The breeze blowing softly on my face,
Reminds me of something else.
Something that in my memory has been replaced,
Suddenly it all comes back.

And as I look to the stars.
I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars,
I don't know if you knew that.
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,
Henri Winterman Cigars.
Though she never told me her name,
I still love you, Girl From Mars.

Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand,
Electricity in the air.
Twisting all through the night on the terrace,
Now that summer's here.
I know you are almost in love with me,
I can see it in your eyes.
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight,
And it almost blows my mind

And as I look to the stars
I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars,
I don't know if you knew that.
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,
Henri Winterman Cigars.
Though she never told me her name,
I still love you, Girl From Mars.

Today I sleep in the chair by the window,
It felt as if you'd returned.
I thought that you were standing over me,
When I woke there was no-one there.

I still love you, Girl From.. Mars
Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
I don't know if you knew that.
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards,

As your face is shining upon me

Out where the cold wind blows
It rocks my childhood sleep
And up in the starry skies
And further out to sea
Late in time when it will come

At night with the cold wind blowing
At night with the cold wind blowing outside
Gone the dream, it's all faded now
Gone the dream, it's all fade now
Take me home

Hours pass ticking slowly
Lying wide awake
All across the land the lights are out
Under an open sky
I feel for you and everybody
Dreaming in your beds I'm feeling lost, there is nothing
Nothing more than this

Going out where the cold wind blows
It rocks my childhood sleep
And up in the starry skies
And further out to sea
Late in time when it will come
I see it in my dreams

At night with the cold wind blowing
At night with the cold wind blowing"

This grand illusion vanishing
All I need is you close to me
I have seen it in my dreams
You can set me free
If you say those words to me

I woke up I was stunned and blind
I just can't get you off my mind

As cherubs let their arrows fly

Talking too long as the night came on

Her bee stung lips,
Kisses sweeter than wine
The things she whispered
With breathless sighs
The summer air was soft and warm
Her eyes were making silent demands
And as her hair came undone in my hands

Oh Yeah she was taking me over
Oh Yeah it was the start of the summer

Driving her home after midnight
I felt so good everything was alright
Her thoughts seemed so lost in the night sky
I remember everything
I don't know why these things ever send
I sometimes wish it was that summer again
I still see her in my sleep
And hear the sighing of the summer wind

How does it feel to be a renegade?
We're condemned for we are not the same
Visionaries in the cavalcade
No we can't be tamed

Original Lyrics
As I walk in the dirty rain
Acid seeping through my brain
Like a tragic paperback
How long until it cracks?

Water runs down the windowpane
As she sucks on a sugarcane
Down a lonely cul-de-sac
And I know there's no way back

We belong in the gutter singing
This song, all the bells are ringing

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

And it feels like a dirty dream
Like I'm walking to the guillotine
Feel the voodoo in my brain
Sipping on a hurricane

How does it feel to be a freak?
Oh so pale and so unique
To be travelling on your own
To be spat on and disowned

We belong in the gutter singing
Sing along, at the stars we're singing

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

How does it feel to be alone?
Stand apart from all the clones
To walk lonely in the rain
To be looked on with disdain

All your senses overthrown
As you walk to the unknown
We're the ones who can't be tamed
Who go against the grain

We belong in the gutter singing
This song, all the bells are ringing

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

We belong in the gutter singing
Sing along, at the stars we're singing

Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey"

I followed the rabbit and now I am lost and alone
Please, Caught in a dream
Locked in a nightmare that's all closing in on me

Is this the end of the line my friend?
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna go
Can't stop the fire burning in my head
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna know anymore
I don't wanna go

I, I feel paralyzed
Fetal position, I can't get you out of my mind
Fear, It's creeping near
Paranoid visions of two things becoming unclear

Is this the end of the line my friend?
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna go
Can't stop the fire burning in my head
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna know anymore
I don't wanna go

Is this the end of the line my friend?

Walking out on you again
Fighting with demons that I can't contain
Walking on but I wanna turn and run
Through the empty streets
Back through the misty New Year dawn light
Feel so lost
Can't take back all the pain and damage I've caused

I'm not talking
I bury it within
Until it turns into a hell in my head
A hell in my head

Confess
In silent panic I suppress
Vulnerable emotions that I cant express
Open up 
Why do I feel so insecure?
Lashing out at the only thing I'm sure of
So alone
Try to fit in this place but I just don't belong

I'm not talking
I bury it within
Until it turns into a hell in my head
A hell in my head

I'm not talking

I'm not talking
I bury it within
Until it turns into a hell in my head
A hell in my head

I'm not breathing
I gotta hold it in

Until I'm free to leave this hell in my head
This hell in my head

So take these tears than stain my face
Take this fear and in it's place
Forgive the past, forget your doubts
Take these words and let them out"

That smile on your face, the pale pale moon
All good times still left to come

Awoke by a phone call one cold night
In my dream you had been going to die
I felt so scared that I was going to loose you
When I answered the phone I already knew

I cried bitter tears you had been taken your own life

Down the corridor to the bedroom
I sit there in silence all alone
Alone is all I'll ever be
Except at night when you visit my dreams
It tears my mind I can't see you tomorrow."

You change your course like lighting as I tumble from the wall

Just let it all fade away

And the night is young
Let it go following this feeling

I think that I love you

The clouds have died gently, over the dew
Will you tell me how to remember the things I don't know
The summer is here now, the winter's let go-oh-oh

The time has come for me to say.
That I've never been happier than today
Maybe you could stay
We could watch the stars,
Will they go away, oh, man, it's ok.

We could get up in the morning, with the sun-rise
When the sun's above us, we can close our eyes
We can swim in the river with the joke flies.
When the day is over, it's just the night-i-ight, it'll be alright

We can look at the mountains, from the big hill
Where the wind sweeps around us, and blows through your hair.
We can follow the stream, to the old mill.
We can look into the orchard, from the windowsi-ll-ll.

The smile from God will be good.
As they always knew it would,
End up in this way
I saw you coming here for a day, oh man, it's ok.

And the fishes swim, and the fishes swim, around the little pond.
And me and her, we are like them. We are half way on top of the world.
So the birds fly, and the fishes swim. We are small, but we are free

It's near the end of summer, we had some year
The bees come near me, will not appear.
As the winter's falling we will go off home.
Life will be so happy, if only you could know-oh-oh,

It's now time to let go.
And we must all go home.
We can't face the winter falls.
We're cold, didn't the summer fly, it'll be ok."
Ash,The Sweetness Of Death By The Obsidian Knife,/a/ash/the+sweetness+of+death+by+the+obsidian+knife_10014839.html,"I've got a flight,
And it's leaving tonight,
Lord help me,
I'm feeling blue,
I'm leaving my life behind me,
When I go I'm leaving you,
I've got a flight,
And it's leaving tonight,
In the slipstream,
I will find my space,
Make my way to Tijuana,
Beneath the stars,
I will escape,
The vast ocean,
Of emotions are dead to me,
My mind is cold,
And my heart is numb,
Lack of sleep,
And low melatonin,
There's no shelter,
On the run,
You opened my arms,
To a million stars,
Took my heart,
And you tore it apart,
But there's no regrets,
No pain remains,
I've turned away,
And I can't stay,
The London rain,
Will remain a memory,
Locked away, in a blood red box,
Your voice only,
An echo inside of me,
I don't look back,
In my thoughts,
You opened my arms,
To a million scars,
Took my heart,
And you tore it apart,
But there's no regrets,
No pain remains,
I've turned away,
And I can't stay,
The sun will rise,
The tides will ebb and flow,
The days will come and the days will go,
I live only for,
What ahead of me,
Life is short,
Is all that I know,
The sun will rise tomorrow,
Of all things that is certain,
Though nothing in my life,
Is certain anymore."

There's something magic in the air
Emotional disorder, came out of nowhere
And took me unaware
The patterns of the oceans, lost in her emotions
You know that I don't care

On nights when the north wind blows through your heart
Dream of a new age
On nights when the north wind blows through your heart
All I can do is wait

There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be hoping for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be dreaming of

Cool evening falling, I can hear her calling
Cross the serpentine
Dark and chaotic, slow and hypnotic
She comes into my mind
And tonight nothing matters, no it doesn't matter
Everything will be fine

On nights when the north wind blows through your heart
Dream of a new age
On nights when the north wind blows through your heart
All I can do is wait

There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be hoping for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be dreaming of
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be wishing for

There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be hoping for
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be dreaming of
There's a star in the night sky
The kind of star we would be wishing for"

I'm thinking about you.
Thinking about you,
I'm thinking about you.
In the quiet hours before dawn,
Talking quietly in the hall,
Windows open on the street below,
As a light rain started to fall,
Thinking about you,
I'm thinking about you.
Thinking about you,
I'm thinking about you.
After a night beside you,
A night alone is cold and barren as before,
A constant aching,
Persistent raining,
Incessant longing all through the day.
In the soft half light of dawn,
Feel the closeness of every breath.
See the body outlined,
Your form, your silhouette.
I haven't seen you since this morning,
Still everywhere you remain,
A constant aching in my soul,
All through the rainsoaked day.
Thinking about you,
I'm thinking about you.
Thinking about you,
I'm thinking about you."

Does it matter anymore
If I listen will I learn

Trapped in silence
No one there to keep him sane
Clandestine pain
Coming back from the dead
Into a world of sorrow
Making no sense
Hear the voices in his head
See through his eye

Pass through the gateway of a banished citadel
No turning backwards
Pray for mercy to be free an unchained soul
Disembodied
When are you coming home
Youve been away too long
Too far you've wandered
Through the shadows and the dark depths of your mind

I'm still breathing, My hearts still beating (x8)

Benath the arches of a cold and distant sky
Held in rapture
Infinte number I am left to wonder why
Forever after
Through the darkness starring down
Your soul denied these warnings
Took no notice
Disbelieving with the end in clearest sight

I'm still breathing, My hearts still beating
I'm still breathing, My hearts still beating
I'm still breathing, My hearts still beating
I'm still breathing, My hearts still beating"
Ash,Uncle Pat,/a/ash/uncle+pat_20009456.html,"I sent off this morning
Down the road along the river
Which I take but once a year
My walk will take me by the shore
Then inland for a mile or more
From the cold sea spray

A small wood stands upon the hill
An old house near it lies in ruins
Forgotten long ago
And here in a clearing, overgrown with moss and ivy
Is your lovely grave

A dusk I will make my way
Along the lanes and through the fields
To where my cottage is
But before I step inside for bed
I'll look up at the stars as we had
All those years ago

So here's for Uncle Pat"

Innocence drowning in the flood

Tonight I place you safe from harm

Victorian repression, I fantasize
Chromium lips and metalic eyes
The reverse cowgirl death defies
Virginal sinners tell sadistic lies

Tonight I want you in my arms
It's not the end, no
Tonight I place you safe from harm
It's not the end, no

Soul searching on your knees
The time is always now for eternity
Black death market uniform
Submit unto my kiss and you'll be
Reborn

Erotic bombshell, she's the god

Give me cardinal sin, sensual head
Vapour trail vision, I'm glad I'm
Dead

And spring time change
Walking barefoot along the sand
I hadn't planned to stay

Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit

You are broke all summer
But you still sing
Don't need money when it's sunny
Don't need anything
Just need music and sun and laughter
And no currency
The sun on your bare shoulders
It comes for free

Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit
Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer
Why can't we just design
To live like this all the time
Why can't we just quit

Sand ran through my fingers
And the land was hot
Anointed by Apollo and his chariot
Disarmed by your charm
That night I felt it again
Addictive and consuming
Love's sweet pain

Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit

Our days are as the wind blows us
We are free
You've a quiet life out of town
Of coastal ease
The wind it has no pattern
We take life slow
And when the night has fallen
Our cup overflows

When the summer's gone and the room is cold
When you're looking at the rain and it just won't go
Remember when the sun was high up above
Remeber when the days were long
And we were in love

Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit
Yeah we've been walking barefoot all summer
Why can't we just design
To live like this all the time

Skating on fire,

Like a worm I'd eat dirt,
Just to be beside her,
Every single night,
Golf ball hail and thunder,
Rum and Stevie Wonder.
Warmer than fire,
Getting into you.
These memories,
Dear God I hope she's always next to me.
Picking and then peaking,
With the Costa Ricans.
Lying on a surf board,
Four weeks of the year.
She was in her cycle,
Crashed her motorcycle.
Broken toes in plaster,
Stitches in her arm.
These memories,
Dear God I hope she's always next to me.
When we're deceased,
Dear God I hope she's always next to me.

My face it grows a little paler every minute,
As I leave the turmoil of my home,
My heart,
Listen to my friends oh so far away,
Disappear but you're here,
Remember laughter with tears,
I can feel you out there somewhere,
But god it's vague so unreal,
What you do,
I thought that you knew,
As fresh as dew,
As dusk as you,
You fade more as the minutes shift,
Remain in fragments everywhere,
I love you but you wont give anything away,
There's nothing you need more than today,
You can trust me I've got much to say,
Now I'm coming back,
Back into the day."

And never hurt my people
I'd stay alert, and just to kill
I might even slip you something

i svako ide svojim putem
tateki piju i saplicu dok pijevaju
zene ih zaobilaze na mah
klinci ih rasturaju zbijeni u gomile
oni piju glasno i urlaju kao zvijeri

hej stari sjeti se i reci mi nesto o njoj
hej stari pati gem prijatelj si moj

tesko vrijeme za matore prijatelju moj
ljudi postaju nalik na kokosi
slabo vide i rano lijezu
a jutrom zure na kopanje
zbijeni u gomile duhana
dzepova usukanih od znoja dlanova
zalaze svuda i u sve gurasu nos

hej stari sjeti se i reci mi nesto o njoj
hej stari plati gem prijatelj si moj"

Dopusti sebi da se zaljubis
Baci cini na ideal
Ciji je grad bez ulica
Visoko iznad vlakova
Ja se zovem anarhija
Okreni se za mnom
Ponekad nista ne razumijem
Stropot teskih kljuceva
Budi me you svitanje
Okreni se za mnom
Ponekad zelim da ti govorim
Samo treptaj oka
You mukloj tisini
Pitat see you te da li znas
Zasto glupost dobija
Zasto hoces da zivis
You sjeni bogova"

Brother will use a gun

Just pointing it sad
It's bringing me down
It's driving me mad

We will be strong
I know we have the strength to carry on
(we have the strength)
I know my rights from wrong
(I know my rights)
I know you've lost I've won
We will be stronger

And getting stronger every day
Believe me when I say it
There is no other way to convey it
No other way you clown
Your thoughtlessness has brought us down
And that isn't right
That we should walk alone on the streets at night
Just checking the time
Wolking that very fine line
The humour is black
The plan is attack
Woman is away from me
Down on your luck
The shock it has struck
The weak ones will die
The questions are why why
Does anybody hear
Does anybody understand
Let me make it clear
Now's the time to take a stand
Now woman is away from me"

Opened up and shouted out ond never tried to please
Wondering if I've done it wrong
Will this depression last for long
Once we had a lonely ride and always talked the same
Time was on my side and we had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Is that me or happy days
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Ma and pa look back on all the things they used to do
Never had it easy and they always dreamed the truth
Daddy didn't need no fucki' toys
Mammy didn't need no criplle boys
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But then let's face it things are heavier today
Guess you need some bringing down

To share little bit of it.

That you'll be walking up to me in a while
And you smile and say: ""hello"" and
We'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right

Just a notion

If it's our destiny
There's nothing we can do

And I've always been under your heel
Holy christ what a lousy deal

Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways
And I ain't gonna take it no more
Oh, no no, walking out that door

Burning my bridges, cuttin' my tie
Once again oughta look into the eye
Being myself, having my pride
No one, baby, is gonna take me for a ride

Burning my bridges, moving at last

Wanna have peace now, we can be free
No one here will make a sucker out of me

Hamlet iii part 1
(instrumental)

Hamlet iii part 2
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold
Then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry

So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn's chilling winds were blowing through the trees
And rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place

Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
And rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

Det rдcker dдare
Ja
Nu hцare jag alltsе vдldigt lite frida!

Free as a bumble bee
I'm down
And I feel depressed
Sitting here
Just waiting
For next bus traveling
Down town
It's a cry and a shame
Isn't it
A beautiful weather?
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this
I know what I like to be

As free
As a bumble bee
Take a zip of
Every flower
Free
As a bumble bee
What a way
Each lazy hour

What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

Rubber ball man
A poster on the wall
Of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free

The hero of them all
You're a legend
I guess I never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be

Make the band stand
To a dream land, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands
And your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us screaming
Some of us dreaming
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man

Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man

Crying over you
I'm waiting for you, baby
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

I'm waiting for you, baby
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

Crying over you
I'm crying over you
Crying over
Little memories
Of things we used to do
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

Hдrligt!

Just like that
Just like that
He walked into my house as smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart

Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

But I lead him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone

Just like that
As though he'd only stopped a while for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

Givin' a little bit more
There's a gentleness to everything you do
And it's rubbing off on me, I feel it too
I'm a victim of my loneliness, I guess
When you call me on the phone
And I'm feeling so alone
When you ask me to come over, baby
You know I will
I could never stay on my own

Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you

Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before
I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you

And I'm always givin' a little more
When I'm with you

Givin' it all I got to give
I've never done that before

I'm always givin' a little more

And the look that he gave made me shiver
Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes

Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta get you near

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better

Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new

ABBA,Att Finnas Till,/a/abba/att+finnas+till_20598416.html,"Vad är det att leva livet
är det nöjen i en stor stad
Eller tystnad på en ö
Att finnas till det är för mig
Att se sommarängar blomma,
Lyss till vågor från en sjö
Att se ett hav i solnedgången
Att se ett segel ligga still
Sommarkväll - att förnimma alla dofter
Det är då jag känner jag finns till
Att finnas till - det är att njuta stunder
Att finnas till - det är så stort för mig
Finnas till - det är ett herrens under
Att finnas till - det är att va' med dig!
Finnas till det är att sitta
Med den vän man håller kärast,
Kanske läppja ett glas vin
Att finnas till då för varann
Medan staden redan sover,
Kanske tända stearin
Att ligga där och känna värmen
Från den man älskar - sådant vill
Jag nog tro många tycker är att leva
Det är då man känner man finns till
Att finnas till - det är att njuta stunder
Att finnas till - det är så stort för mig
Finnas till - det är ett herrens under
Att finnas till - det är att va' med dig!"

Burning my bridges, cutting my tie
Once again I wanna look into the eye
Being myself
Counting my pride
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride
Burning my bridges
Moving at last

Gonna have peace now

Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity, Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing though you're late that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in out sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe you really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I watched her ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in out sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe you really had the power

I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realise
It's a crazy world

Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys?
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
'there is something,' you said, 'that you may not know,
There's a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay,
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way.'

And I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl
And I realise
It's a crazy world
So I close my eyes
Never leave me, girl

High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
High, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (what a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please"

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podia escuchar
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

Se acercaban mas fernando
Y el momento que pasaba
Parecia eternidad
Y senti temor Fernando
Por la vida y juventud
Nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy verguenza al
Confesar que tuve
Ganas de llorar

En proteccion Fernando

Se durmio el tambor Fernando
Paraciera que fue ayer

Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me"

Sitting here just waiting
For next bus travelling
Downtown
It's a crying shame
Isn't it
The beautiful weather
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be
As free as a bumble bee
Take a sip from
Every flower
Free as a bumble bee
While away each lazy hour
What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw"
ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,/a/abba/from+a+twinkling+star+to+a+passing+angel_21001358.html,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the milky way
From afar
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.

Raindrops on a window pane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you

Curtins rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes it's way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you.

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes backs to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew

Half awake in half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room.

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warms my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room."

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No-one to hear my prays

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T. V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No-one to hear my prays

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...

When the air gets cold then I think of us
Of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I feel my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake

Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees
The rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
The rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days"

Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii

I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance
Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honololu, a greeting from happy Hawaii
It's so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii

How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives

And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway...

In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine...

We were like two young strands of driftwood
Caught up in a stream
We were destined for each other
From our very first hello
We came bustin' through that river dam
And made that river flow
We will sail upon the ocean
Til the shoreline meets the sky
Carried on the first trade wind
That favours you and I
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
Darling this time, we're on our way

'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here we'll stay
We will never throw this love of ours away

Life, oh life is a chance
We were the only two who spun the wheel
And never scored romance
If we'd stayed to play for fortune
We'd have broke the banks of gold
We'd have taken old Las Vegas
For every cent that she could hold
Love like ours was made in heaven
It was blessed by Lord above
We will spend our lives together
Forever hand in glove
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
Darling this time, we're on our way

'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away

We are here

And a million voices blend into a single voice

Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot

And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be

People feed me with their lives I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(let them wake me, let them have me, let them take me)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(all illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak"

Just a feeling that you're watchin' me
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind
Cause it's almost like you're touching me
There is no mistaking
Just a notion
That you'll be walkin' up to me
In a while
And you smile and say hello
Then we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on
Must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do
But tonight is very special
It's the night for me and you"
ABBA,Just Like That,/a/abba/just+like+that+_20003021.html,"Until that day
My life had been a river
Following the same, pre-destinated course,
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force.
My strongholds broke down all too easily;
I remember well,
How it did embarrass me;
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

And once again, the river's flowing slowly,
Following the same and uneventful course.
Now the tears have dried,
It's become a pleasant break,
I recall without remorse.
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit,
He had something that I miss.
I guess he was a rolling stone;
The only one I've known.

Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...

I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare fate and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you......

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear......

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do......

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion

Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room"

The sun was shining
Still the day was cool
Saw her waiting for a bus
As she was going home from school

Looking so cold
I took her home and
That was just the start
We would meet the summer through
And she was always in my heart

Love has it's ways
Like seasons come and go
And tomorrow there will be another day
Love has it's ways
And so before you know
When you turn around it may have gone away

Early that fall
I knew I loved her
More than anything
Gave her everything I had
She even got a wedding ring

But in the end
The mind was restless
And she had to go
And the love I'd thought would live
Was buried in the winter snow

Love has it's ways
Like seasons come and go
And tomorrow there will be another day
Love has it's ways
And so before you know
When you turn around it may have gone away

Like seasons come and go
And tomorrow there will be another day

Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight
How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

And I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight
You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight

He can drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer

Deals with the devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)

Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

ABBA,Move On,/a/abba/move+on_20002971.html,"""they say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.
A voyager, and a settler, they both have a distant goal.
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside.
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried. ""

Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on

I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive

Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)

How I treasure every minute (la la la la)
Being part of it (la la la la)
Being in it (la la la la)
With the urge to move on

The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)

Being part of it (la la la la-ah)
Being in it

You can see as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
'Cause I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be

Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day

So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
She don't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store

Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
She would like to play it every day

A vez al pasar, tu y yo
Migramos con el sol
Hacia un verano nuevo
Sin oscuridad
Hoy que todo termino

Somos dos, que ayer
Vivimos soledad
Nuestra union se quebro
Con toda dignidad
Aun buscamos cielo azul
En nuesro caminar
Gracias por un gran amor
Y la felicidad
Hoy que todo termino
No hay a quien culpar
Bien se da que al caer
Hay posibilidad
De surgir otra vez
Y ver la realidad
Todo claro al final
No hay nada por probar
En el cruce del camino
Solo un nuevo andar

No hay a quien culpar"

He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

I say if you ever want to know what's going on
Gotta keep on rockin baby till the night is gone

So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable

Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end

Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing

One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times

One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying

The feeling right, the paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the elysée
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like mona lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the notre dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is harry
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all

Place for you here
Like and old fashioned hero
You stand before me
You think our life is a movie
My world is real
I live and feel
And I can do without you
Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandana too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend
This is the end
For me and you
Now be a bold vacquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night
All dressed in white
Unchained and free without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet senorita
Somebody meek
Who'll never speak
Harshly to you
You're such a cavaliero
Proud, never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am
I need a man
Who is in rhyme
With his time

The hero of them all
You're a legend
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you

Make the bandstand to a dreamland, Rubber Ball Man

I guess I've changed, like people do, when things go wrong
But in the end, somehow I know, we'll get along

Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish to see the old house where I used to live
And all my friends, will they be there, when I come home
How I regret the day when I set out to roam

Aun me pertenece, pero menos
En ese mundo de su candidez

Feliz de compartir aun su risa
Y toda su ninez
Se me esta escapando al crecer
? Como lograr que se detengan
Hoy los minutos?
Se me esta escapando al crecer
Su gran fantasia cuidare
Y cuando la voy descubriendo...
Sigue creciendo
Se me este escapando ya lo se
Hay en las dos ella y yo sueno al desayuno
Y, sin querer, dejo al tiempo transcurrir
Cuando se va siento en mi alguna melancolia
Cierta culpa que no se fingir
? Por donde estan aquellas aventuras
Y los lugares que vamos a ver?

Algunas pocas cosas disfrutamos
Hay tanto por hacer
Se me esta escapando al crecer
? Como lograr que se detengan
Hoy los minutos?

Guardar el tiempo y su capricho en mi

Trousers too short

Cold as a stone

Until you tell me, jeanie jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, jeanie jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'cause I love you, jeanie jeanie on my mind

See me sitting in the palmtree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, jeanie jeanie on my mind

Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please

See me sitting in the palmtree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No-one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do
So won't you tell me, jeanie jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, jeanie jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down

Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
(slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did but most we didn't
And why I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers...

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile..."

Stirring in his restless sleep tonight
In the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold december
You and I have reason to remember

Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way
Taking a chance
'cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance

What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble?
Won't somebody tell me what I hear?
In the distance but drawing near
Is it only a storm approaching?
All that thunder and the blinding light
In the winter night
In the grip of this cold december
You and I have reason to remember

The songs that you and I don't sing

They drum their drums and look so strong

Scattered driftwood on the beach

Summer night city...

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
Aa-ahhh

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when the dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark

My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on tv
There's not, I think, a single episode of dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then I must have read a while
The latest one by marilyn french or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came"

And you make me feel

What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know......

The name of the game

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know......

Does it mean anything to you?

They struggled in the cold
In the heat and the snow and in the rain
Came to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

They came from the south
From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

He gave them a dream
He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
So they let him play
Play their minds away

We're all following a strange melody
We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon"

The sound so ominously tearing through the silence

Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me...

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling...

Now I hear them moving muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building and I'm close to fainting crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy there is no escaping now, I'm crackin' up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me...

Now I hear them moving muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm crackin' up

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all..."

He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages

At least not until the day
When something special he read
This is what it said:

Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one

(we may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)

He called the number and a voice said, 'alice whiting'
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, 'i read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat
I can't forget what I read'

Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for s**
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left to try
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done"

As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms

Here we almost, we almost knew what love was

There'd be no such thing as goodbye

As soon as we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner, and not a saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway? We're all the same

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of god at the rainbow, sweet Jesus
But we're holding on, hold on

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess times wasting, tick tocking lip locking
How do we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock them
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold on, hold love, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much ‘cuase she's an older you
I wish you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos we both ones and ones the oddest
Couple only human except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind

And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothin wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'cause he made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say""

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way

So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret

Just love yourself and you're set

Would you do the things that drive me crazy?

Oh I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That will break my heart to pieces

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh but it feels so right
So baby, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Oh, baby, I know loving you aint easy
But it sure is worth a try

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules?

If this is a lesson
Baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead us
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
Cause that couldd be the death of us, the death of us, baby

You know how to drive in rain
You decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue

Baby, Constantly crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

Hey, What happened to the buttlerflies
Guess they gettin kinda fast, that time
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we found it
We'll that's when it started turnin around
You're saying baby don't worry
But we're still going the wrong way baby

Even Angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohh I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right

'Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie

I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til these walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

Makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and
Take it through the night
And you should follow through
To make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em all
I want to see you rock to the piano,
The Piano

I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

And I could sing about cupid and a shooting arrow
In the end, you found out that my heart was better
Real hard (It's not hard)
So hard (So hard)
Real hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That it makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance

How I'm feeling good
And how it although it face my way
If I got my piano, then I know I'll be okay

Take it through the night
And you should follow through

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I’ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
For the night
Usually I would love it if you stay the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you  than I love your presence
And the best thing now is prolly  for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boy, so don't be dumb

Dear Santa
It's me Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need

See I really love him
And it's been kinda tough cause
He's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away
Away from me

I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you

[Chorus:]
Just make it snow in california
I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow
In Calif-orn-i-a

[Verse 2:]
Dear Santa
What happened to the plan we had
I checked the news and it said
It'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I I really need him to stay
For a couple more days
Can't you make his
Five o'clock flight delay
Won't you find a way

I don't need another gift
I just have one wish
This year can you

But I believe in miracles

So please, please

Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace

Ah, guess you're way above it now

I will leave my heart at the door

So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is...

Adele,Best For Last,/a/adele/best+for+last_20730072.html,"Wait, do you see
My heart on my sleeve?
It's been there
For days on end and
It's been waiting for you
To open up
Just you baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words
Roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

Why is it everytime
I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
Cause you're still
Not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances
And getting away
And though I'm trying
My hardest you back to her
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

But, despite
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
To persist
With this heartbreak
And running around
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
And we'll say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
And you'll be the one for me
And me the one for you"
Adele,Black And Gold,/a/adele/black+and+gold_20767598.html,"The fish swam
Out of the ocean
And grew legs
And they started walking
And the apes climbed down
From the trees
And grew tall
And they started talking

And the stars
Fell out of the sky
And my tears
Rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking
For a reason why
You even set my world
Into motion

'cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
But it's all
Just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not
Really here
Then I don't want
To be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

I looked up
Into the grey sky
And see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around
These golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel a way of something
Beyond them
I don't see
What I can feel
If vision
Is the only validation
Then most of my life
Isn't real

'cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
But it's all
Just a bunch of matter
'cause if you're not
Really here
Then I don't want
To be either
I wanna be next to you

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool

Even in the daylight when you're dreaming

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and turn me into a crumblin' fool
Tell me to run and I'll race if you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you and me gonna leave just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you, crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils a sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favorite mood

I keep on tryin' fightin' these feelings away

Hopin' you'll walk through and save me boy

Looks good when he when he walks,
He is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase,
But good to catch
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back,
Oh
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you through
There's no way I could describe him
What I'll say this, just what I'm hoping for

I'll be alive

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride,
What if I lose my heart and fail, declined,
I won't forgive me if I give up trying,

I didn't know a single word he said,
Not one resemblance to the man I met,
Just a vacant broken boy instead,

I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk,

Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday,
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait,
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late,

He won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk,
So I won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,

Blew me away It

Buried them away you, buried them away I

Wish I could lay down beside you When
The day is done And
Wake up to your face against the morning sun But
Like everything I've ever known You
Disappear one day So
I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Drop

You off at the train station Put
A kiss on top of your head Watch
You wave I
Watched you wave Then

I went on home to my skyscrapers Neon
Lights and waiting papers That
I call home I
Call that home I

Wish I could lay down beside you When
The day is done And
Wake up to your face against the morning sun But
Like everything I've ever known You
Disappear one day So
I spend my whole life hiding my heart away I

Woke up feeling heavy hearted I'm
Going back to where I started The
Morning rain the, morning rain Although
I wish that you were here That
Same old road that brought me here Is
Calling me home It's, calling me home I

Wish I could lay down beside you When

If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Which ever road I choose you go

I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling
Every word
I've imagined it all
You never know if you never try
To forgive your past
And simply be mine

I dare you to let me be, your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy
Giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy
Giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect
Just because trust me I've earned it

I dare you to let me be, oh
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who has
Walked that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts"
Adele,I Found A Boy,/a/adele/i+found+a+boy_20901457.html,"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here,
You and your charm creep closer, closer in here,
Like a fool for fire I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call.
You're the wise one, disguised from greed,
But I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.

So, you thought that I'd would crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you, crawling back to me
To whisper ""will you leave your man?""
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you.

Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.

I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look in your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

Well I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did before.
So stand beside the river you cry
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you."

Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do

But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby

It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight

But you pushed me in,
I've seen your face under every sky,
Over every border and on every line,
You know my heart more than I do,
We were the greatest, me and you,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Let me stay here for just one more night,
Build your world around me,
And pull me to the light,
So I can tell you that I was wrong,
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,

Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
I know I left you speechless,
I'll be waiting,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,

A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue and
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
You Know there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change
Are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love, To make you feel my love"

Right through me
I forgive you

To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one

Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand in reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry

I miss the air
I miss my friends
I miss my mother
I miss it when

Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they scared of me

I tried to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day.

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me

But I just wanna be drunk
So I can forget about you
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through
('cause you and me we're good)
Even when I've had too much, 
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough"
Adele,Now And Then,/a/adele/now+and+then_20746846.html,"Sometimes the hole
You left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through
The deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth
With words that I cry
How I'm still trying
To stay inside

Hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts
Our hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts

Every now and then
My memories ache
With the empty ideas
Of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on
And my age gets older
I love the ones I know
They're enough
To picture the rain

Cause heart break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts
Our hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts

You know
When to make me
I might
Just your heal (4x)"

To forgive your past, and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be, your
Your one and only

To hold in your arms

And give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
Do you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name

Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose you'll go

I don't know why I'm scared

I've imagined it all

To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile

Giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy
Giving up your heart (nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy (trust me I've learned it)

Filling up my heart with golden stories

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun

I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars

[Chorus]
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 2]
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you, love you

[Chorus x2]
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool

And everything you do's a game
When night comes
And you're all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

Cos' when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble
Back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least
When your at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
Cos' it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

Cos' who wants
To be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
I get excitement
In your bones
Even though
Everything's a strain
When night comes
And I'm all on my own

I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Verse 2]
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins

Reaching a fevered pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear, 
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare, 
See how I'll leave with every piece of you, 
Don't underestimate the things that I will do. 

There's a fire starting in my heart, 
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
I can't help feeling, 

We could have had it all, 
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told, 
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn, 
Think of me in the depths of your despair, 
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared, 

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep, 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door, 
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold, 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all.
(You're gonna wish you never had met me), 
It all, it all, it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.

Rolling in the deep.

You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumours?

People say crazy things,
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,
Just 'cause you heard it,

To stand in your arms without falling to your feet, 

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew, 
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true, 
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win, 

But I set fire to the rain, 
Watched it pour as I touched your face, 
Well, it burned while I cried, 
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name, 

When laying with you I could stay there, 
Close my eyes, feel you here forever, 
You and me together, nothing gets better,

Even now when we're already over,

Only yesterday, was the time of our lives.
We were born and raised in a summer haze, 
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

A kink
In the single life

Too much to think

What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell

So steady as she goes

When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue

Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

Steady as she goes

Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well

What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell

So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes

Settle for a girl

Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round)

Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down

Sell it to the crowd

That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey

One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls

I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone

In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me

And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere

Tried my best
Gave you everything I had
Everything and no less
Didn't I do it right
Did I let you down?

Maybe you got too used to
Oh having me around
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears.
It's gonna be an empty road
Without me right here

But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love

Maybe I should leave
To help you see
Nothing is better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over
Is this really it? You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home
I will adjust.
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do
Is for you

But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it
Take it all
With you
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool
Just take it all,

You close the door

That's it

We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Yeah she smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey

You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall

Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go

While you cut me down
It had only just begun
But now it's over now
And your
In the heat of moments
With your heart
Playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
Your were smiling
In the spotlight dancing
With the night
When I fell
Off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for and for and for
When I don't get nothing back
Oi, I'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking punching heartache
Only laughing at my smile
I get closer you
Obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back

Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back

Your open arms
I couldn't help
The leap that tripped me
Back into them, even though

मेनू invite करदा
तेरे कोल किवें पावां
Thought ये excite करदा

Listen
तेनु पहचान दी आं
habbit मैं जांदी आं
हर कुड़ी उत्ते मर्दा

तेरा ऐतबार नहीं
करना मैं प्यार नहीं
क्यूँ मेरा पीछा करदा

चला जाएगा तू मुझे तंग करके
दित्च वाली बातें मेरे संग करके
I wanna say you मैं नहीं रहना सोह्नेया
तेरे नाल नाल वे

क्यूंकि
मैं तेरा बॉयफ्रेंड
मैं तेरा बॉयफ्रेंड

मैं तेरा बॉयफ्रेंड
तू मेरी गर्लफ्रेंड
ओह मेनू कहन्दी
ना ना ना ना

तू मेरा बॉयफ्रेंड
मैं तेरी गर्लफ्रेंड
अब ना करुँगी
ना ना ना ना

रुक ते जा मेरी गल तू सुन ले
अब ना करुँगी ना ना ना ना

ना ना ना ना

Tere hothon ki ye nami,
Aur aise ke reh jaye,
Iss chori mein na kami,

Tere sinne mein mera dil dhadke,
Aur raat guzar jaye,
Meri awaara si nazron ko,
Shayad ghar mil jaye,

Maine socha ke chura loon,
Tere hothon ki ye nami,

Reshmi zulfon ke jharne khol do,
Pankhudi se labon ki kuch bol do,

Gardan ki iss surahi se,
Kuch jaam chalak jaye,
Meri awaara si nazron ko,
Shayad ghar mil jaye,

Maine socha ke chura loon,
Tere hothon ki ye nami,

Kuch kaho na abhi,
Hone do gunah,
Jism ko tum mere,
Khud mein do panah,

Koi chor hawa do jismo se,
Ho kar na guzar jaye,
Meri awaara si nazron ko,
Shayad ghar mil jaye,

Maine socha ke chura loon,

Sunta mein rahun naam apna.... Ooo..

Teri ungliyon se aasmaa pe
Khichu ik lambi laqeer
Aadha tera aadha mera
Is jahan mein hum do ameer

Koi nazar na aaye meinu
Tu duniya ton wakhri ho gayi
Utha tainu takkda jaawan
Tu hi meri naukri ho gayi
Koi nazar na aaye meinu
Tu duniya ton wakhri ho gayi

It was love-What made Him bleed and cling to a tree
It was love-Unlike this world has ever seen before
It was love-What made Him bleed and cling to a tree
And get nailed to the form of a lower case ""t""

To all my listeners; you're on my ""got to get with ya list""
Scripture gives the run down, come now you've got to picture this
The evolutionist would call this ridiculous
Story of a love, a true love that got promiscuous
The true lover was a King they called Elohim,
Digt it, He was exquisite, always existed
For designer clothes He sported shekinah robes
The kind that glows, baggy, you know the kind that flows
He was awesome majestic, flawless, perfect with
All this you might ask what could be next
His outcry zoomed throughout the counsel of the Triune
Crank the volume, when God speaks it's a fly tune
""Let Us make man in Our likeness and Our image""
He sparked it, even before He started He was finished
And since it's a fact that every kid needs a nursery
Before He made man He made a universe-a world to be
A playpen you know a place to chill, one to play in
Fields to lay in, earth to rule, one to stay in
He took dust in His hands made a man
Breathed life into his frame, said, ""Adam is your name""
It was all fun and games, no pain and no strain,
He named all the animals, they were pre-tamed
Man and his God chillin' like jellow with
Nothing to undermine the divine fellowship
[Repeat Chorus]
Curtain please, scene two, we see the surgery
Adam de-ribbed, now Eve lives, we see with certainty
God wanted the earth to be full so earth can see
God and glory go together like thermometers and mercury
Intertwined, Elohim was man's date
But it's a thin line between love and hate
And just like a person will be weary 'til rested
I guess love will always be theory 'til tested,
So check it, God put this tree off limits
He can do that, the earth is the Lord's and all that's in it
He meant it, He told Adam the truth about the one tree
He said if you eat the fruit then you're saying you don't want me
In other words you're saying, ""Bye"", I wouldn't lie
'Cause the day you eat from this tree you're surely gonna die
Why in God's name couldn't Adam maintain
No blame, if it was us we would have probably done the same thing
Satan tricked Eve, Eve gave to Adam,
Sin had them, death grabbed them, and on went the pattern
The earth got cursed on the day they dissed Jehovah
He said, ""I told ya, now our relationship is over!""
[Repeat Chorus]
It really gets to me, it really is a mystery
Why with foresight God even let us ruin history
But the love story gets deper
Holiness makes Him hide from sin but His love for men made Him a seeker
My heart is getting weaker, it's burnin' me bad
I earnestly ask why in eternity past
Did the Godhead agree that they would let man leave
Knowing the penalty-that they'd have to let man bleed?
But this is just a case of the lowliest
Questioning the infinite wisdom and the justice of the holiest
God's omnipotent and sovereign-""Yes I know He is""
And he's gracious and merciful-""The Bible told me this""
Took a human frame, Jesus was His human name
Doomed to hang on a cross casue we're His lost love
Resurrected just to get with you, if you get your cue
From Scriputre you can see he clearly pre-planned the switch-a-roo
He'd always planned to become a man, die as a substitute lamb,
Start a new fam of humans who can
Take the Son's hand in reply to
His proposal, ""Will you marry Me?""-we say, ""I do!""
[Ending Chorus]
Love-made Him bleed and cling to a tree
It was love-unlike this world has ever seen before
It was love-that made Him bleed and cling to a tree
Nailed just for you and nailed just for me"

If we are destined not to meet again
Let me hold your hand
So you would understand
And if this will be our last time
Look into my eyes before it's time to say goodbye
Baby hold my hand
Come feel and savor our romance

Let me take you back to that place
Place where we first had our dance
If moments we've shared
Faded to the past
And all the love that we've had
Just can't last

If this will be the last time
Let me say I love you

For the last time
Until we meet again
The time has come for us for the end
Though I can't have you in my life
But I'll just be an angel watching over you
From a distant sight

For the last time
Let me say I love you
For one last time
Just one last time"

With my heart on the floor
I must be out of my mind
To come back begging for more
But if you stay
If you just stay for the night
Swear that I'm yours
And I'll prove that I'm right

And these flies kept me sleeping
All my fears on their wings
And your grandfather clock is still ticking
But the chime never rings
And how long must I stay?
Will I lay by your side
Just to say that I'm yours
And you'll never be mine

With this love like a hole
Swallow my soul
Draggin me down
And there's blood on the covers
From the curses we uttered
To each other
You played your part in this

Why play hide and go seek?
Safe behind your veneer
Does it bury your burden baby?
Makes it all disappear
But those marks on your thighs
Don't they sting when you bleed?
It's the way that you are
And the way I'll forever be

With this love like a hole
Swallow my soul
Draggin me down
And there's blood on the covers
From the curses we uttered
To each other
You played your part

With this love like a hole
Swallowed my soul
Draggin me down
And I swear I'll stay with you
But I just can't forgive you
And I'll never be whole again"

That time to care

Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you
I'm so sick and tired
Of running away
When I know that the good times go
They never stay
So sick and tired of dancing
The night away
I've forgotten what it's like to wake up
Early and greet the new day

All my life I have been trying to find
Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you
All my life I have been trying to find
Someone that's always on my side
I believe that what you said is true
And God has shown me
That he won't turn away
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
It's just so hard to let go
And simply let him in
I've got to make the choice
Or be back where I've been"

Open up your eyes, open up your ears
Get together and  make things better by working together

Most every day
Any feelings I had left inside
Were ripped out of my chest after that night
It didn't take me long to recognize

I asked around and I
Can't find the reason why
So suddenly cold
It hit me hard at first
Was what you said rehearsed?
Was it your new friends?"

You don't have a clue if you never knew

Before I knew what hit me baby you were flowing though my vains...

Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Outta control,

When night blows in through the window,
Dances round the room...
Got me hipnotized,
I'm getting high on the perfume.
I couldn't live without you now,
Oh, I know I'd go insane,
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!

You drug my heart through the ground
Left it all battered and bruised
I'm done fighting this battle with you

I can't keep going in circles
Circles, going in circles
Round and round and round with you

I’m scared but I know what that caused
Leaves me with the deepest scars
Cut me open now I’m bleeding without no shine
Foolish of me to believe
Things would be different this time
Kept say I ain’t tried but will just keep living a lie
I’m sick of the same things over and over and over again with you

You drug my heart through the ground
Left it all battered and bruised
I'm done fighting this battle with you

I can't keep going round in circles
Circles, going in circles
Round and round and round with you

After all of the things we been true
Can’t imagine myself without you
Take me through all these changes
And to share you what you just can’t do
Taken all of my love for granted
Made me a fool
And I’m done with this breaking
I’m aching in circles with you

You drug my heart through the ground
Left it all battered and bruised

Go dance in the waters of all the tears we've cried.

Can you feel my heart beating so fast?
Now you're here now, know there's no turning back

Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough

I feel your hand in mine
No, I never felt, never felt like this before

Come on baby, don't give up on us (don't give up on us)
Choose me and I'll show you love (and I'll show you love)
Let me show you love
Let me show you love (let me show you)

If you're lost, I'll be there shining my light
And every touch lifts me up to the stars
'Cause nothing could ever keep us apart

Should have listened to what I say

Neon lights at the water, reflecting the city I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from's the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable cause wherever I go

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone

I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottemless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never, seperate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I still believe that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead
The streets of my backbone, until I get back home

I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not of the city, but out of the 'burbs
A river that's just dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying in church
A crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
A promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

Son, don't let this slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say

When you'll get older
Your wild life would live for younger days
Think of me as forever your faith

[Chorus:]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the night that never die
My father told me

These are the night that never die
My father told me
Hey, hey"

We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

Heart ache, heart break
All over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together

Ooooohh

[Chorus]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who couldn't ask for more
Keep them coming
Cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us
But not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

[Verse 2]
Out on the midnight
The wild ones howl
Last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of time

Time flew, cut through
All over town
You make me bleed when I look up
And you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together

Ooooohh

[Chorus]
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down place your bets
These are the days that we won't regret
These are the days that we we'll never forget

And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

Wish that I could stay forever this young

Juliet, I'll take you somewhere we can be alone

Need you more than anything, and I refuse to share you
Saw it in her eyes, she didn't know what to think
I knelt to the ground and I pulled out a ring

And said, marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone

Ryan :
I was born in 1974
On a calm meticulous street
Someplace in the sun
Oh the air was sweet
And enough lights sprang sparks
Through the window of the room
Not as raw to a ridiculous tune
Slightly out of key in the mother hour

Ryan & Alanis :
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
I'm busy breaking bones

Alanis :
I was born in 1974
In a breached feet-first way
My twin opened the door
My very first dose of chivalry
I was dawned princess potential potent
With gold star and matching impression
Big between two doors
Small and loved and proud and unthreatened

Ryan & Alanis :
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
I'm busy breaking bones

Ryan :
I bet you were strong
When you should have been weak
Like a dam that wanted to break
I wish I were the stones
Your river learned to roam
In whispering gaze

Alanis :
You were told in a kind North Carolinian way
To slow down, back up, or be hated
Thank god you did not
And thank god you did
An angel either way

Ryan & Alanis :
So leave us alone
So leave us alone
So leave us alone
We're busy being grown

I would never have tried to control
I would never have worn such 'fear lenses'
I would never have held on so tightly

I would have kept my boundaries set
My loving no's, my unwavering yes's
Risked abandonment and stood by that
And thereby felt constant connect

Torturous hindsight if I knew then what I know now
This mountain of remorse won't repeat with my understanding
This wouldn't have happened if I knew then what I know now

I would've gone slower
Pushed infrequent
Would not have rushed into such commitment
I would've shown restraint as my feet got wet
I would've baby-stepped into intimate

This fountain of regret, this looking back with twenty-twenty
This torturous hindsight if I knew then what I know now
This mountain of remorse won't repeat with my understanding
This wouldn't have happened if I knew then what I know now

I would've known much more
Known that time was all we had for future depth to unfold
I would've had more faith at every step
I would've kept intact through the whole process

Oh this fountain of regret is looking back with twenty-twenty

Do you not play dirty when engaged in competition?
Do you have a big intellectual capacity but know
That it alone does not equate wisdom?
Do you see everything as an illusion?
But enjoy it even though you are not of it?
Are you both masculine and feminine? Politically aware?
And don't believe in capital punishment?

These are 21 things that I want in a lover
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer

Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that
Loving someone can actually feel like freedom? Are you funny?
And self-depreciating self-deprecating? Like adventure? 
And have many formed opinions?

These are 21 things that I want in a lover
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer
I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter
These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover

I'm in no hurry I could wait forever
I'm in no rush 'cause I like being solo
There are no worries and certainly no pressure in the meantime
I'll live like there's no tomorrow

Are you uninhibited in bed? More than three times a week?
Up for being experimental? Are you athletic?
Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother? 
Are you not addicted? ... Curious and communicative..."
Alanis Morissette,8 Easy Steps,/a/alanis+morissette/8+easy+steps_20597904.html,"How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment
How to defer to men in solvable predicaments
How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you
How to have that not work and have them run away from you
How to keep people at arms length and never get too close
How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most
How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone
How to feel worthless unless you're helping anyone else

I'll teach you all this in 8 easy steps
In the course of a lifetime you'll never forget
I'll show you how to in 8 easy steps
I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best

How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist
How to play all pious when you're a real hypocrite
How to hate God when you're a prayer and a spiritist
How to sabotage your fantasies by fear of success

Chorus

I've been doing research for years
I've been practicing my ass off
I've been waiting my whole life for this moment, I swear to you
Culminating just to be this well versed leader before you

How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself
How to numb a la holic (?) to avoid going within
How to stay stuck in blue by blaming them for everything

Bacon is brought to the house in this mold
Born of your bellies I yearn for the cord
Years I have groveled repentance ignored

And I have been blamed
And I have repented

I am man who has grown from a son
Been crucified by enraged women
I am son who was raised by such men
I'm often reminded of the fools I'm among

And I have been shamed
And I have relented
I'm working my way toward our union mended
And I have been shamed
And I have repented
I'm working my way toward our union mended

We don't fare well with endless reprimands
We don't do well with a life served as a sentence
This won't work well if you're hell bent on your offence
I am a man who understands your reticence

I am a man who still does what he can
To dispel our archaic reputation
I am a man who has heard all he can
'cause I don't fare well with endless punishment

Alanis Morissette,Ablaze,/a/alanis+morissette/ablaze_1764789.html,"[Verse 1]
First thing that you'll notice thing that you'll notice is some separation from each other
Yes, it's a lie, we've been believing since time in memorial
There was an apple, there was a snake, there was division
There was a split, there was a conflict in the fabric of life

[Verse 2]
One became two, and then everyone was out for themselves
Everyone was pitted against each other, conflict ruled the realm
All our devotions and temperaments are pulled from different wells
They seem to easily forget we are made of the same cells

[Chorus 1]
To my boy, all that energy, so wild
Love your hues and your blues in equal measure
Your comings and your goings-away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Verse 3]
Second thing you'll notice thing you'll notice is that often we think that there's not enough
It might feel dark, it might feel lonely and you'll wonder why you're here
You'll be overcome with darkness and a sense of hopelessness
But it won't matter if you keep the core connected to the oneness

[Chorus 2]
To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Bridge]
And this cord is unbreakable
This pilot light is there in your pocket
And this bond, beyond unshakeable
Even if we all forgot, all at the same time
If we forget at the same time

[Chorus 3]
To my boy, my precious, gentle warrior
To your sweetness and your strength in exploring
May this bond stay with you through all your days
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Chorus 2]
To my girls, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

[Outro]
(To my boy) First thing that you'll notice is that everything is temporary
(To my girl) Next that you might know is that we will always be a family

Alanis Morissette,All I Really Want,/a/alanis+morissette/all+i+really+want_20005452.html,"Do I stress you out
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say how appropriate
I don't want to dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart you see
But I can't help it
There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter
And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Do I wear you out
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy
And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I am humbled by his humble nature
What I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses
Falling all around.... All around
Why are you so petrified of silence
Here can you handle this?
Did you think about you bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're going to die
Or did you long for the next distraction
And all I need now is the intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer
All I really want is some peace man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
All I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice....."

Give thanks for the murders of Chris Columbus
We kill our own and we vote for the men
The lesser of evils and us starring the role of victim

I wonder how we change if we can in this land
I wonder how many mountains we'd move if we bent together
Us priveleged Americans

We pass our revisions onto the next generation
We kneel to the Gods of corporation
We eat when we're full and we hoard all the rest
With our hands on remotes we say ""Yes, We're the best""

I wonder what we change in this land, cause we can
Even with western centricity this rampant
Us ugly Americans

Tired are not my hands
But see strangers and enemies as part of me, is real.
For me this awakening Canadian

We teach our offspring for themselves, every man
We shrug shoulders and create yet another -ism
We dissuade our young from using their imagination
We avert our eyes from this our very own manifestation

I wonder how many mouths we'd fill if we band together
Us awakening Americans"

Do you see me hanging on to every word you say
How soon will I be holy
How much will this cost guru
How much longer 'til you completely absolve me

In place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting
Kali kali frantically
I've heard them rotely repeatly your
Teaching with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and
Foreign sandalwood beads

I've seen them overlooking god in
Their own essence
I've seen their upward glances
In hopes of instant salvation
I've seen their righteousness
Mixed without loving compassion
I've watched you smile as
The student bow to kiss your feet

How much longer 'til you
Completely absolve me"

And I can't sleep should I call you instead

I think of you far too much 'cause you, you're one of a kind
I'm not like an open book
'cause I've got something in mind

Chorus:
You know I can't deny the way I feel inside
I won't be hiding my love
You know I can't disguise you're always on my mind
And now I can't get enough

Give me love, I know that you can
I like the strength of a confident man
It's in my blood and all through my veins
You feel it once and you're never the same

Whenever I close my eyes you're there. I feel it inside
But why am I holding in my love, I can't tell you why

Chorus

I think of you far too much 'cause you, you're one of a kind
I'm not like an open book 'cause I've got something in mind
You know I, you know I, I can't deny
Every day you're always on my mind
You know I, you know I, I can't disguise
Can't deny the way I feel inside

How would I explain?
How would I explain this to my children if I had them?

Because I can't not
Because I can't afford to be misread one more time
Would I be whining if I said I needed a hug?
Would you feel slighted if I said your love's not enough?
How can I complain?
How can I complain when I'm the one who reaches for it?
Because I can't not
Because I can't not
Because I cannot walk without my crutches
Because I can't not

Because I can't help wonder why you ask me
To all the unheard wisdom in the schoolyard
You think you're the right ones
You think you're the charmed ones I'm sure
How can you go on with such conviction?
And who do you think you are why do you question me?

My something something something
And I have never left this ambitious city
And I've only known a lust for VIP

I have studied long and hard had to proceed
Nothing but my name in bright lights called to me
And I display the perfect amount of en oui
I'll carve my face a bit, you'll indulge me

Give me celebrity my kingdom to be famous
Tell me who I have to be
Starting to be famous

Never wonder who's pulling strings above me
Cause I'm aware of wheels, heels, and vintage Gucci
I'm on my twentieth round of vitamin v
And I'll cut my weight until you'll have me"
Alanis Morissette,Citizen Of The Planet,/a/alanis+morissette/citizen+of+the+planet_20736965.html,"I start up in the north
I grow from a special seed
I sprinkle it with sensibility
From French and Hungarian snow
I linger in the sprouting
Until my engine's full

Then I move across the sea
To European bliss
To language of poets
As I cut the cord of home
I kiss my mother's mother
Look to the horizon

Wide eyed, new ground
Humbled by my new surroundings

I am a citizen of the planet
My president is Kwan Yin
My frontier is on an airplane
My prisons, homes for rehabilitating

Then I fly back to my rest
I fly back with my nuclear
But everything is different
So I wait
My yearn for home is broadened
Patriotism expanded
By callings from beyond

So I pack my things
Nothing precious
All things sacred

I am a citizen of the planet
My laws are all of attraction
My punishments are consequences
Separating from source the original sin

I am a citizen of the planet
Democracy's kids are sovereign
Where the teachers are the sages
And pedestals filled with every parent

And so the next few years are blurry
The next decade's a flurry
Of smells and tastes unknown
Threads sewn straight through this fabric
Through fields of every color
One culture to another

And I come alive
And I get giddy
And I am taken and globally naturalized

I am a citizen of the planet
From simple roots through high vision
I am guarded by the angels
And my body guides the direction I go in

I am a citizen of the planet
My favorite pastime edge stretching
Besotten with human condition
These ideals are born from my deepest within"

Come out, come out, no use in hiding
Come now, come now, can you not see?
There's no place here, what were you expecting?
No room for both, just room for me
So you will lay your arms down
Yes I will call this home

Away, away you have been banished
Your land is gone and given me
And here I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home

What's that you say?
You feel the right to remain?
Then stay and I will bury you

What's that you say?
Your father's spirit still lives in this place,
Well I will silence you

Here's the hitch, your horse is leaving,
Don't miss your boat, it's leaving now
And as you go I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home

I have no time to justify to you
Fool you're blind, move aside for me
All I can say to you, my new neighbor
Is you must move on or I will bury you

[chanting]

Now as I rest my feet by this fire
Those hands once warmed here
But I have retired them
I can breathe my own air
And I can sleep more soundly
Upon these pour souls
I'll build heaven and call it home
'Cause you're all dead now.

(Alanis)
And I live with my justice
And I live with my greedy need
Oh I live with no mercy
And I live with my frenzied feeding
And I live with my hatred
And I live with my jealousy
Oh I live with the notion
That I don't need anyone but me

Under the covers til the terror of the unknown is gone

Nor held up to be whipped or wept

Fortune
Hey I'm not mad at you guardian
I'm mad at myself for spending so much time with you and your jeckyl
And hydeness
I'm glad I firguratively slapped you on the wrist
You laughed a wicked laugh and said ""come here let me clip your
Wings! ""
(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you don't own him
Anything)
""raise the roof he yelled ""yeah raise the roof! "" I yelled back.
(Unfortunately you needed a health scare to reprioritize.)
No thanks to the soap box
Having my rile against them won't make an ounce of difference...
I'm in the front row the front row with popcorn
I get to see you see you close up

Many a sitch a friend a man's been left for you
Oh the books I've read for you
The tongues I've bitten for you many a new city for you
For you many a risk taken for you (not a single regret)"

Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I'm giggling again for no reason

I am dancing with my friends in elation
We've taken adventures to new levels of fun
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body
I can see the meltings of inhibition

Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face

I'm reeling jubilation
Triumphant in delight
I am at home in this high five

You've got to get down on your knees

You've got to want what you see and see what I'm givin' away

Hey, stick with me, I'm your momma

You put a bullet in your foot
You make it hard for us bitches inconsequential in your back bends
And your taste in men leaves something to de desired

They love you in your mini dress

You are looking gorgeous

You bow to kiss my hand and I ignore ignited flame

I moved to meet you
Untouched I do remain

To some it seems foreign
Why I would steely forge ahead
This land entrusted to me knows not of hallowed secrets
I'll keep it to myself
My own advicement in my head
Your charm can not distract me
From the path I'm born to tread

How I'm thrilled to know you
Affected, I remain(ed?) 
How I've learned to like you
Undeterred I do remain

Less daunting as team?
You unlikely king by my side
And me, so much better for trusting you
My hand over your heart
While you keep hindrances at bay
Color me surprised by how our union saves the day

How I've grown to need you
As my soul I just faiths
How I love to know you
And how I remain

Dirt on my feet I am dreaming again
I run I run I run far from
You to the lilac tree in my yard
No more swing set for the girl who is all grown up
No more tea parties parades or mothers in love
I hold my breath past the cemetery
My brother wins he can hold it much longer then me
Gravel roads make car keys rattle on steering wheels
Children and horses old barns and old automobiles
I run I run I run far from
You to the watered streets of Oregon
With a coffee cup half full in my hands
And I'm praying my savior would
Just place a gun in my hands
I run I walk I lie far from
Freaks and lying cheats on the tip of my tongue
The moon hides in the sky behind rows of tree tops
And I'm wishing I was somewhere up there
With the mermaids and stars
I run I run far from
Reality to escape who I've become
Insanity is close at my back
And I'm getting rather numb from the snakes
Who have blurred my vision"

Tell her or anyone

Minutes before
I died I'd be filled
With such regret before I took my last breath"" and I said ""You're
Willing to
Tell me this now
And you're not going to die any time soon""
And I said I haven't been eating chicken or meat or anything and you
Said yes
But you've been wearing leather and laughed and said we're at the top
Of the
Food chain
And yes you're still a fine woman I cringed
I was hoping I was hoping we could heal each other
I was hoping I was hoping we could be raw together
We left the restaurant where the head waiter (in his 60's) said
""good-bye sir
Thank you for your business sir you're
Successful and established sir and we like the frequency with which
You dine
Here sir
And your money"" and when I walked by they said ""thank you too dear"" I
Was all
Pigtails and cords
And there was a day when I would've said something like ""hey dude I
Could buy
And sell this place so kiss it""
I too once thought I was owed something
I was hoping I was hoping we could challenge each other
I was hoping I was hoping we could crack each other up
I too thought that when proved wrong I lost somehow
I too once thought life was cruel
It's a cycle really you think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you I
Think
You're insensitive
And I don't feel heard and I said do you believe we are fundamentally
Judgmental? Fundamentally evil?
And you said yes I said I don't believe in revenge in right or wrong
Good or
Bad you said
""well what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency room
Bleeding
After beating his kid
And she threw a shoe at his head.
I think what he did was wrong and I would've had a hard time feeling
Compassion for him""

And I have been missing the rapture this whole time
Of being forever incomplete

One day, my mind will retreat, and I'll know god and I'll be constantly one with her night dusk and day
One day I'll be secure, like the women I see on their 30th anniversaries

I have been running so sweaty my whole life
Urgent for a finish line
And I have been missing the rapture this whole time
Of being forever incomplete

Ever unfolding
Ever expanding
Ever adventurous and torturous
But never done

One day, I will speak freely
I'll be less afraid
And measured outside of my poems and lyrics and art
One day I will be faith-filled
I'll be trusting and spacious authentic and grounded and whole

Yes they're in shock they are panicked you and your chronic them and

If we were our bodied
If we were our futured
If we were our defenses I'd be joining you
If we were our culture
If we were our leaders
If we were our denials I'd be joining you
I remember vividly a day years ago we were camping you knew more then
You
Thought you should know
You said ""I don't want ever to be brainwashed"" and you were
Mindboggling you
Were intense
You were uncomfortable in your own skin you were thirsty but mostly
You were
Beautiful
If we were our nametags
If we were our rejections
If we were our outcomes I'd be joining you
If we were our indignities
If we were our successes
If we were our emotions I'd be joining you
You and I we're like 4 year olds we want to know why and how come
About
Everything
We want to reveal ourselves at will and speak our minds we never talk
Small
And be intuitive
And question mightily and find god my tortured beacon
If we were their condemnations
If we were their projections
If we were our paranoias I'd be joining you
If we were our incomes
If we were our obsessions
If we were our afflictions I'd be joining you

For you they live in a quiet monastery
For you they wear whatever you want them to as long as it is short
They count to ten when you tell them how to drive
And when they're afraid they let you speak for them

All hail the king of intimidation
Obeyer of Christian behavior

For you we'll wax nostalgic, and our legs
For you we chew our nails if we had any but fake ones to do it
We contradict him temporarily
And it was somethin' about how you talk down to me

All hail the king of intimidation
Obeyer of Christian behavior

The role of compromises for the family you now want some
There's only so much we can do to make you rest assured

I am single
I am weary
You're just jealous
You're just confused
You're just hungry
You're in sin now
You're not happy
You like kidding

All hail the king of intimidation
Obeyer of Christian behavior

He knows not of what he has wrongly done
So forgive his ignorant behavior

You are tortured
You are captured
You are busted
We were silent
You were tested
You did better
You are lonely
Was it worth it?
La,la,la,la"

There's a flag-pole rag and the wind won't stop

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall
That's my soul up there
There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall
That's my soul up there
There's a blue whale beached by a springtime's ebb
That's my soul up there
There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

There's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack
There's a black-winged gull with a broken back
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain

For sticky and raspy, unearthed and then gone

You are a gift promised sent with a wink
With tendencies for conversations that raise bars
You are a sage who is fueled by compassion
Comes to nooks and crannies as balm for all scars

You make the knees of my bees weak, tremble and buckle
You make the knees of my bees weak

You are a spirit that knows of no limit
That knows of no ceiling who balks at dead-ends
You are a wordsmith who cares for his brothers
Not seduced by illusions of fair-weather friends

You make the knees of my bees weak, tremble and buckle
You make the knees of my bees weak

You are a vision who lives by the signals of
Stomach and intuition as your guide
You are a sliver of God on a platter
Who walks what he talks and who cops when he's lied

You make the knees of my bees weak, tremble and buckle
You make the knees of my bees weak

Living under the same roof
So here these battles of wills
They beg for some proof
Of right versus wrong
Your approach seems better than mine
Though it's working for you all I feel is disconnection

So now it's your (your) religion 'gainst my (my) religion
My humble opinion 'gainst yours
This does not feel like love
It's your (your) conviction 'gainst my (my) conviction
And I'd like to know what we've seen
Through the lens of love... Love... Love... Love

And so now your grand assessment is that I'm not in your group that I'm not
Your kind
And so we're locked in a stalemate with you in your corner and me dismayed
In mine

And this lie remains about us being separate

Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it

Sentimental centipedes do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it,
So does every katydid do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

The most refined ladybugs do it,
When a gentleman calls,
Moths in your rugs do it,
What's the use of moth balls?

Locusts in trees do it,

Thrown out most of my things
Only kept what I need to carve
Something consistent and notably me

Tattoo on my skin
My teacher's in heart
My house is a home

Sense of myself
My purpose is clear
My roots in the ground
Something at last I can feel a part of

My brow is furrowed and my vision is blurred
And how I do love London
And how I do love London

The birds make guttural sounds and protect me
My friends come to visit and love me a lot
I don't have the energy to fill this
I am like flight attendants on a 12 hour flight
And how I do love London
And how I do love London

I am intriguied by the boy with songs
Sometimes they write sometimes they write a lot
The steam will smell of puke and left us in the shower
The hug will feel forced upon you inconsolable thing
And how I do love London
And how I do love London

Deep breaths will not make my brain stand still
To be loved and swallowed are single and depraved

We slept and were cold on the train out of france

What's the point of trying to dream anymore
I hear you're losing weight again Mary Jane

If that's the way
You insist on heading
Please be honest Mary Jane
Are you happy
Please don't censor your tears
You're the sweet crusader
And you're on your way
You're the last great innocent
And that's why I love you

Of man and angels?
Was it a failure of love?

From this human river
Too cruel for winter
Welcome to the gates
A rehearsal for the silence
Pray we do not enter

Under a sky of innocence
We bathe in the seduction
Beautiful
The light is unraveling now
We open our arms to it

It is close to ground zero

I am no one
Yet I am everyone

We are nothing, but we are all
When I am still, I am inspired

We are not yet born

But half choice

When I am still I can hear
You speak most clearly

And my boat is small

I don't want to be the glue that holds your pieces together
I don't want to be your idol
See this pedestal is high and I'm afraid of heights
I don't want to be lived through
A vicarious occasion
Please open the window

Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor

I don't want to live on someday when my motto is last week
I don't want to be responsible for your fractured heart
And it's wounded beat
I don't want to be a substitute for the smoke you've been inhaling
What do you thank me
What do you thank me for

Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh

Why do I still look outside me

Everything's right and it's how it should be
Why don't they just leave me alone
I've got to prove I can
Little girl with stars in her eyes they've
Got her all figured out and there's nowhere
To hide why can't they all see who I am
When will they understand

It may take some time they don't know how
It feels because they can't read my mind
They always say I'm too young and they
Feel they should help me
But I can make it all alone out here on my own

Every day I feel so in demand and all I
Wish I could find is a place I can land
One day I'll feel comfort inside cause I'll
Know who I am

I can hold the line if I know in the end
That I won't be left behind I don't regret
What I've done I don't think you can blame me
Now I'm standin' all alone out here on my own

I'm not thinking 'bout leavin' home
But I need to be on my own
Doesn't mean I have a heart of stone
I won't even ask them why
I can't ever let them see me cry
Here I'm standing all alone out here on my own...
Out here on my own

Feeling lost in a world full of lies
I can't help thinkin' that love is just
Passin' me by Hold on to what I believe
And keep an open hand

Can I have it all if there's no one to
Turn to when I stumble and fall
Is there a secret I need because no one
Has told me-all alone

It may take some time cause I know
How it feels to have a lot on your mind
I'll never feel all alone cause!
Know that I have me
Now I can make it all alone out here on my own"

We make some home made pizza
We do some funny bits back and forth
My knees buckle I laugh so hard

We might end three sheets to wind
And who knows where we'll wind up
All I know is there’s a car waiting
And we’ll figure that out after

I have to keep my eye
On my old friend from high school
We’ve known each other for the longest time
She has trouble with her dance so to speak

She can hoist a really good kick
In the butt when she's excited
She doesn’t do it so much anymore
'Cuz we’re all on to her

Bring on the tequila, oh
On fire on tequila, oh
Mostest most on tequila, oh
Bestest friends on tequila, oh

Then there’s my other pretty friend from high school
The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her
And now I've reeled it in
It’ll be interesting to see how much she’s done as well

Then there’s my friend from Chicago
God do I love all people from Chicago
All ready to light up the barbecue
And be harping on debauchery

Bring on the tequila, oh
On fire on tequila, oh
Mostest most on tequila, oh
Bestest friends on tequila, oh

Then there’s my Canadian friend
What a fabulous mom she’s become
She’s been tortured in this sense
For the last many of months for obvious reasons

She was like ""Hey, where was this part of you
When I wasn’t pregnant""
I laughed and did a shot in her honor
As I conversed with her belly

Bring on the tequila, oh
On fire on tequila, oh
Mostest most on tequila, oh
Bestest friends on tequila, oh

Then there’s my Cupid friend
She sure knows how to dress that one
She’s a wise and worldly girl
But you gotta watch that medication

My favorite beverage is taken
To a whole other level on it
I’m not worried about it
Or I’ll coast around the room
While I trust she’ll temper

My brother came to visit me
And now he’s used to hanging with me and cracking up
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance
No idea about how manipulative I’ve become

I would surreptitiously put it in front of him
Without him asking
In a pretty little shot glass
His smirk and cackle would only egg me on

Someone else will come along
And sock it to ya again

Satisfy you too
But how can I if you won't give me a chance
To prove my love to you?
Won't you give me just one chance?
I'll give you my guarantee that you won't be hurt again

All intense and kinetic, at best tolerated from afar

Though a start I am newly courted
I've just not been trusted with alters

I'm a sweet piece of work, well intentioned yet disturbed
Wrongly label-ed and under-fed, treated like a rose as an orchid

My friends, as they weigh in, get understandably protective
They have a hard time being objective
So inside we cancel each other out

I'm a sweet piece of work, well intentioned and unloved
Unlabeled and misunderstood, treated like a rose as an orchid

You've brought water to me, making sure my bloom rebounds
You know best of what my special care allows

So I've lived in my blind spot
Thought myself usual when I'm not
And your garden is a nice spot
As long as it is brave and where you are

For this sweet piece of work, high maintenance and deserted
I've been different and deserving, treated like a rose as an orchid
Sweet piece of work, overwhelmed un-observed
I've been bowed down to but so misread
Treated like a rose as an orchid"

I picture a different choice
Every time we're in a rut

My urgency to dream of softer places feels understandable

The only way out is through
The faster we're in the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately

Every time I'm confused
I think there must be easier ways
Every time our horns are locked on towel throwing
Every time we're at a loss, we've bolted from difficulty
Anytime we're still made of final bowing

My tendency to want to hide away feels easier and
The immediacy is picturing another place comforting to go

The only way out is through
The faster we're in the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately

We could just walk away and hide our heads in the sand
We could just call it quits, only to start all over again
With somebody else

Every time we're stuck in struggle, I'm down for the count that day
Every time I dream of quick fix I'm swaged
Now I know it's hard when it's through
And I'm damned if I don't know quick fix way
But formerly mistreat me silence now outdated

My tendency to want to run feels unnatural now
The urgency to want to give to you I don't want most feels good

To renew it's only a joke, leaves me a stranger

I give out, dedicate and now I need to acknowledge me

You mispronounced my name
You didn't wait for all the information
Before you turned me away
Wait a minute sir
You kind of hurt my feelings
You see me as a sweet back-loaded puppet
And you've got meal ticket taste

I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you

You took me for a joke
You took me for a child
You took a long hard look at my ass
And then played golf for a while
Your shake is like a fish
You pat me on the head
You took me out to wine dine 69 me
But didn't hear a damn word I said

I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you

Hello Mr. Man
You didn't think I'd come back
You didn't think I'd show up with my army
And this ammunition on my back
Now that I'm Miss Thing
Now that I'm a zillionaire
You scan the credits for your name
And wonder why it's not there

I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you
I walk right through you"

Now with post-demise at hand
Can't go to you for consolation
Cause we're off limits during this transition

This grief overwhelms me
It burns in my stomach
And I can't stop bumping into things

I thought we'd be simple together
I thought we'd be happy together
Thought we'd be limitless together
I thought we'd be precious together
But I was sadly mistaken

You've been my soulmate and mentor
I remembered you the moment I met you
With you I knew god's face was handsome
With you I suffered an expansion

This loss is numbing me
It pierces my chest
And I can't stop dropping everything

I thought we'd be sexy together
Thought we'd be evolving together
I thought we'd have children together
I thought we'd be family together
But I was sadly mistaken

If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
If I had a penny for all the possibilities I presented
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
My wealth would render this no less severe

I thought we'd be genius together
I thought we'd be healing together
I thought we'd be growing together
Thought we'd be adventurous together
But I was sadly mistaken

Thought we'd be exploring together
Thought we'd be inspired together
I thought we'd be flying together
Thought we'd be on fire together

With how much we've endured
With the state this land is in

You and me feel joined by only gender
We are not all for one and one for all

Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in

You and me estranged from the mother
You and me have felt impotent in our skin
You and me have taken it out on each other
You and me disloyal to the feminine

Such a pity to disavow each other
With how far we've come
With how strong we've been

You and me are on this pendulum together
You and me with scarcity still fueling

We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in

We may not have priorities same
We may not even like each other
We may not be hugely anti-men
But such a cost to dishonor a sister

You and me have made it harder for the other
We forget how hard separatism has been
You and me we can help change all their minds together
You and me in alignment until the end

Oh these little rejections how they seem so real to me
One forgotten birthday I'm all but cooked
How these little abandonments seem to sting so easily
I'm 13 again am I 13 for good?

I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved for someone so fine
I can feel so boring for someone so interesting
So ignorant for someone of sound mind

Oh these little protections how they fail to serve me
One forgotten phone call and I'm deflated
Oh these little defenses how they fail to comfort me
Your hand pulling away and I'm devastated

When will you stop leaving baby?
When will I stop deserting baby?
When will I start staying with myself?

Oh these little projections how they keep springing from me
I jump my ship as I take it personally
Oh these little rejections how they disappear quickly

Won't be mayhem if I'm led by my own rule-lessness

Inside box obeying, inside line coloring

For beating myself up and over functioning

No one's been cruller than I've been to me

For letting you decide if I indeed was desirable
For myself love being so embarrassingly conditional
And for denying myself to somehow make us compatible
And for trying to fit a rectangle into a ball

For treating me worse than I would anybody else

To whom do I owe the first apology?
No one's been cruller than I've been to me

Forgetting you or forgetting myself
Had I heeded the wisdom of the latter
I would've naturally loved the former

For ignoring you, my highest voices
For smiling when my strife was all too obvious
For being so disassociated from my body
And for not letting go when it would've been the kindest thing

I scratched my head

From hand to hand
Wrist to the elbow
Red blood sand
Could dad be god
Crosses cross hung
Out like a wet rag
Forgive you why
You hung me out to dry

Maybe I'm crazy
But laughing out loud
Makes the pain pass by
And maybe you're a little crazy
But laughing out loud makes it all subside
Holding, I'm holding
I'm still falling
I'm still falling

Spoon in spoon
Stirring my coffee
I thought of this
And turned to the gate
But on my way
Crack
Lightning and thunder
I hid my head
And the storm slipped away

Well maybe I'm crazy
And laughing out loud
Makes it all pass by
And maybe you're a little crazy
And laughing out loud
Makes it all alright


Laughing out loud

From time to time
Minutes and hours
Some move ahead while
Some lag behind
It's like the balloon that
Rise and then vanish
This drop of hope
That falls from his eyes

There're voices behind me saying
Sinners sin

And so you called and courted fiercely
So you reached out, entirely fearless
And yet you knew of reservation and how it serves

And I salute you for your courage
And I applaud your perseverance
And I embrace you for your faith in the face of adversarial forces
That I represent

So you were in but not entirely
You were up for this but not totally
You knew how arms length-ing can maintain doubt

And so you fell and you're intact
So you dove in and you're still breathing
So you jumped and you're still flying if not shocked

And I support you in your trusting
And I commend you for your wisdom
And I'm amazed by your surrender in the face of threatening forces
That I represent

You found creative ways to distance
You hid away from much through humor
Your choice of armor was your intellect

And so you felt and you're still here
And so you died and you're still standing
And so you softened and you're still safely in command

Self protection was in times of true danger
Your best defense to mistrust and be wary
Surrendering a feat of unequalled measure

I'm too exhausting to be loved
A volatile chemical
Best to quarantine and cut off

All these tapes in my head swirl around
Keeping my vibe down
All these thoughts in my head aren't my own
Wreaking havoc

All these tapes in my head swirl around
Keeping my vibe down
All these thoughts in my head aren't my own
Wreaking havoc

I'm a thorn in your sweet side
You are better off without me
It'd be best to leave at once

All these tapes in my head swirl around
Keeping my vibe down
All these thoughts in my head aren't my own
Wreaking havoc"

How about me not blaming you for everything
How about me enjoying the moment for once
How about how good it feels to finally forgive you
How about grieving it all one at a time

The moment I let go of it was
The moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it was
The moment I touched down

How about no longer being masochistic
How about remembering your divinity
How about unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How about not equating death with stopping

Thank you nothingness

Even if I went bankrupt
That I would be good
If I lost my hair and my youth

That I would be great
If I was no longer queen
That I would be grand
If I was not all knowing

That I would be loved

Alanis Morissette,That Particular Time,/a/alanis+morissette/that+particular+time_20005503.html,"My foundation was rocked my tried and true way to deal was to vanish
My departures were old I stood in the room shaking in my boots
At that particular time love had challenged me to stay
At that particular moment I knew not run away again
That particular month I was ready to investigate with you
At that particular time

We thought a break would be good for four months we sat and vacillated
We thought a small time apart would clear up the doubts that were abounding
At that particular time love encouraged me to wait
At that particular moment it helped me to be patient
That particular month we needed time to marinate in what us meant

I've always wanted for you what you've wanted for yourself
And yet I wanted to save us high water or hell
And I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt
And in the meantime I lost myself
In the meantime I lost myself
I'm sorry I lost myself. I am

You knew you needed more time time spent alone with no distraction
You felt you needed to fly solo and high to define what you wanted
At that particular love encouraged me to leave
At that particular moment I knew staying with you meant deserting me
That particular month was harder than you'd believe but I still left
At that particular time"
Alanis Morissette,The Couch,/a/alanis+morissette/the+couch_20005490.html,"You hadn't seen your father in such a long time
He died in the arms of his lover how dare he
Your mother never left the house
She never married anyone else you took it upon yourself to console her
You reminded her so much of your father
So you were banished and you wonder why you're so hypersensitive
And why you can't trust anyone but us
But then how can I begin to forgive her so many years under bridges
With dirty
Water
She was foolish and selfish and cowardly if you ask me
I don't know where to being in all of my 50 odd years
I have been silently suffering and adapting perpetuating and enduring
Who are you younger generation to tell me that I have unresolved
Problems
Not many examples of fruits of this type of excruciating labour
How can you just throw words around like grieve and heal and mourn
I feel find we may not have been born as awake as you were
It was much harder in those days we had paper routes uphill both ways
We went from school to a job to a wife instant parenthood
I walked into his office I felt so self-conscious on the couch
He was sitting down across from me he was writing down his hypothesis
I don't
Know
I've got a loving supportive wife who doesn't know how involved she
Should get
You say his interjecting was him just calling me on my shit?
Just the other day my sweet daughter I was driving past 203 I walked
Up the
Stairs in my mind's eye
I remember how they would creak loudly
She was only responsive with a drink he was only responsive by photo
I was only trying to be the best big brother I could
I've walked sometimes confused sometimes ready to crack open wide
Sometimes indignant sometimes raw
Can you imagine I pay him 75 dollars an hour sometimes
It feels like highway robbery
And sometimes it's peanuts
I wish it could last a couple more hours
So here we both are battling similar demons (not coincidentally)
You see in getting beyond knowing it solely intellectually you're not
Relinquishing your majestry
You are wise you are warm you are courageous you are big
And I love you more now than I ever have in my whole life"

Forget it, I am fine

If anything, a witnessing
Is all I needed that night

Until I get what I'm to get
He'll keep being compelled to flee
Until I out his false story
He'll keep playing the guy who leaves

Brother, oh, brother
Solo you did bust out
All I knew was you didn't invite me
So begin seeds of self-doubt

There is nothing as harrowing
As how I translate facts

Until I get what I'm to get
He'll keep being compelled to flee
Until I out his false story
He'll keep playing the guy who leaves

Baby, oh, partner
How well you've played this part
Similar, oh, how familiar
Reluctant truth you impart

And how you served necessity
Repeat 'til she sees light

Until I out his false story
I'll keep blaming the guy who leaves"

So it starts with the pauses
As singular and quiet
It's still and it is patient
Intended as it grows
And we go
From sunrise to sun falling
From daughter to sister
Angels through Maria

[Verse 2:]
Our reaching is daunting
But perfectly far reaching
And our mission is joined
With our children returning
There's blood and there's sweat
And there's fears unabated
And there's grief in the night time
While the phoenix is rising
Rising high leading me home

[Chorus 1:]
So this is the morning
We're more keen to blending
We're led by the senses
We're serving our family
We're graced by the tender
We're upping the ante
We can't help but orient
Homebound t'ward unity

[Bridge:]
And this sight of inclusion
This [?] protected
[?] safe by intention
Educate me far and wide

[Verse 3:]
And this small section of the world
It calls me to my highest
To true collaboration

[Alternate lyrics:]
Senses are delicate
And fashion toward the whole
The tales, they're high
The vibes, they're high
The tales, they're tall
My specialty
I am carrying by
This shaky arm

[Chorus 2:]
So this is the morning
We're more keen to blending
We're led by the senses
We're serving our family
And these are our sisters
And this our specialty
And this our commitment to whole

Alanis Morissette,The Time Of Your Life,/a/alanis+morissette/the+time+of+your+life_20005546.html,"Standing there on a road that leads to anywhere
Like a child left in the wilderness, standing there penniless
Wanting to be the best

Here's a place where life runs at a different pace
Where love is just convenient, none are obedient
And we are subservient

Look at me, I'm a girl that some may preconceive
Why do they try and generalize, why are they antagonizing me
But something I can't control that...

CHORUS:
I WANTCHA
You know I'll never stop 'til I've GOTCHA
You'll never be quite the same when I ROCK YA
I'm not the kind of girl that you thought I was
You'll have a good time 'cause I WANTCHA
I'm breaking down the walls 'till I have you, feel you
Show you the time of your life

Here we are and I wonder how we've come this far
In a world that does not recognize women are victimized
What does that symbolize

Why do I want the things I usually criticize
It may be self destructiveness, or maybe it's emptiness inside
But something I can't control that...

CHORUS

You'll have a good time...
It's a lonely road, and no one knows the way that I feel
I'm not giving up now... I'll never try to justify
They'll never understand, you'll be a happy man
You'll have the time of your life

It's something, it's something, it's something that I can't control
The time of your life...

Alanis Morissette,There Are Worse Things I Could Do,/a/alanis+morissette/there+are+worse+things+i+could+do_20005548.html,"There are worse things I could do, than go with a boy or two
Even though the neighborhood thinks I'm trashy and no good
I suppose it could be true, but there are worse things I could do
I could flirt with all the guys, smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance, make them think they stand a chance

Then refuse to see it through, that's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night, wait around for mr. Right
Take cold showers every day, and throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true
I could hurt someone like me, out of spite and jealously
I don't steal and I don't lie, but I can feel and I can cry
A fact I'll bet you never knew
But to cry in front of you, that's the worst thing I could do"
Alanis Morissette,These Are The Thoughts,/a/alanis+morissette/these+are+the+thoughts_20005439.html,"These are the thoughts that go through my head
In my backyard on a sunday afternoon
When I have the house to myself and I am not
Expending all that energy on fighting
With my boyfriend
Is he the one that I will marry
And why is it so hard to be objective about
Myself why do I feel cellularly alone
Am I supposed to live in this crazy city
Can blindly continued fear-induced regurtitated life-denying tradition
Be overcome

Where does the money go that I send
To those in need, if we have so much why do some people have nothing
Still why do I feel frantic when I first wake up in the morning
Why do you say you are spiritual, yet you treat people like shit

How can you say you're close to God, and yet you talk behind
My back as though I'm not a part of you, why do I say ""I'm fine""
When it's obvious I'm not, why's it so hard to tell you what I want
Why can't you just read my mind?

Why do I fear that the quieter I am
The less you will listen
Why do I care whether you like me or not
Why's it so hard for me to be angry
Why is it such work to stay conscious and so easy to get stuck
And not the other way around

Will I ever move back to Canada
Can I be with a lover with whom I am a student
And a master, oh why am I encouraged to shut my mouth
When it gets too close to home, why cannot I
Live in the moment"

Eleven songs, four full journals, thoughts of punishments
I've expanded
Not in contact, not unmet
Such communication, telepathic
You've been vilified
Used as fodder
You deserve a piece of every record.

But who's it hurting now?
Who's the one that's stuck?
Who's it torturing now?
With an empty knot in her stomach.

I wanna be big and let go
This grudge that's grown old
All this time I've not known
How to rest this bygone
I wanna be soft and resolved
Clean state and released.
I wanna forgive for the both of us

I come abandoned house
Dusty cupboard, furniture stll intact
If I visit it now
Will I simply relieve it
Somehow, into it us.

But who's still waking now?
Who's tired of her own voice?
Who's weighing down with no gift from time of said healing?

I wanna be big and let go
This grudge that's grown old
All this time I've not known
How to rest this bygone
I wanna be soft and resolved
Clean state and released.
I wanna forgive for the both of us

Maybe as I cut the cord
Veils will lift from my eyes
Maybe as I lay this to rest
This weight of my shoulders will rise

Here I sit much determined
Ever real equipped to draw this curtain
How this has entertained, validated and has served me well
Ever the victim

But who's done whining now?
Who's ready to put down?
This load I carried longer than I had cared to remember

I wanna be big and let go
This grudge that's grown old

How to rest this bygone

And show them what they're missin' listen
To what your heart could tell ya

Miss cracking up and wrestling
And our debriefs at end of day

These are not times for the weak of heart
These are the days of raw despondence

I miss your neck and your gait
And your sharing what you write
Miss you walking through the front door
Documentaries in your hand
Miss traveling our traveling
And your fun and charming friends
Miss our big sur getaways
And to watch you love my dogs

These are the days of raw despondence
I never dreamed I would have to lay down
My torch for you like this

One step one prayer
I soldier on, simulating moving on

I miss your warmth
And the thought of us bringing up our kids
And the part of you that walks
With your stick-tied handkerchief

These are things that I miss
These are not times for the weak of heart

Donde podia olerte.

Sin tu permiso.
No debría estar aquí.

Podrías perdonarme si bailo en tu ducha?
Podrías perdonarme si me acuesto en tu cama?
Podrias perdonarme si me quedo toda la tarde?

Me quité mi ropa
Y me puse la tuya.
Y en tu armario encontré tu colonia.
En el piso de abajo en contré tus cd's
Y escuché tu Joni.

No debería quedarme mucho tiempo
Tú estarás en casa pronto
No debería quedarme mucho tiempo
Podrías perdonarme si bailo en tu ducha?
Podrías perdonarme si me acuesto en tu cama?
Podrias perdonarme si me quedo toda la tarde?

Encendí tus cenizas
Tomé un bañó y luego encontré una carta en tu escritorio
Decía: hola cariño, te quiero tanto
Reúnete conmigo a medianoche"".

Esa no era mi letra
Debería irme pronto
No era mi letra

I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me and think solely
About themselves

My boy all alone for too long It's after eleven
Yeah I'm tired of waitin' and I'm gonna go home
Cause I don't need this

You never think twice before you break all the rules
You gotta be crazy if you think I'm a fool

Chorus:
I'll walk away and say good bye
If you don't want me anymore
I've bot my pride
I'll walk away and say good bye
If I don't get the love we had before
Not satisfied

He finally gets here I'm waitin' for him to ask me
Why there's a frown on my face He orders a
Cold beer he has an excuse about his car
Breakin' down but I don't buy it
You're givin' me sometin' I don't need anymore
Just gimme the word and I'll be slammin' the door

Chorus

His best intentians are never the same as what
He does of the end of the day. I'm feelin' the
Tension yeah Don't gimme no reasons cause you
Don't comprehend what am I feelin'
You never think twice before you break all the rules
You gotta be crazy if you think I'm a fool
You're givin' me somethin' I don't need anymore
Just gimme the word and I'll be slammin' the door

Chorus

So tell me now Just say the word
It won't be long
I'll be long long gone..."

Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be open wide, No
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died
Till you died, but you're still alive

And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face
How quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be open wide, No
And every time you speak her name

That was me and I'm not gonna fade

And every time I scratch my nails
Down someone else's back I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have

I bet you're wondering when my conditional police will force you to cough up
I bet wonder how far you have now danced you way back into debt
This is the only kind of love as I understand it that there really is

You can express your deepest of truths even if it means I'll lose you and I'll hear it
You can fall into the abyss on your way to your bliss I'll empathize with
You can say that you have to skip town to chase your passion I'll hear it
You can even hit rock bottom have a mid-life crisis and I'll hold it

At the top of my voice

Would you forgive me love if I laid in your bed
Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?
I took off my clothes
Put on your robe
Went through your drawers
And I found your cologne
Went down to the den
Found your cd's
And I played your Joni
And I shouldn't stay long
You might be home soon
Shouldn't stay long
Would you forgive me love if I danced in your shower
Would you forgive me love if I laid in your bed
Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon?

I ran a bath
I noticed a letter that sat on your desk
It said:
""Hello, love.
I love you so, love.
Meet me at midnight. ""

Arrogant Worms,Canada's Really Big,/a/arrogant+worms/canadas+really+big_20009383.html,"When I look around me,
I can't believe what I see
It seems as if this country
Has lost it's will to live
The economy is lousy,
We barely have an army
But we can still stand proudly
'Cause Canada's really big

We're the second largest country
On this planet Earth
And if Russia
Keeps on shrinking
Then soon we'll be first
(as long as we keep Quebec)

The usa has tanks
And Switzerland has banks
They can keep them, thanks
They just don't amount
'Cause when you get down to it
You find out what the truth is
It isn't what you do with it
It's the size that counts!

Most people
Will tell you
That France is pretty large
But you can put
Fourteen Frances
Into this land of ours
(it'd take a lotta work, it's take a whole lotta work)

We're larger than Malaysia
Almost as big as Asia
We're bigger than Australia
And it's a continent
So big we seldom bother
To go see one another
But we often go to other
Countries for vacation

Our mountains
Are very pointy
Our prairies are not
The rest is
Kinda bumpy
But, man, do we have a lot
(we gotta lot of land, we gotta whole lot of land)

So stand up and be proud
And sing out very loud
We stand out from the crowd 'cause
Canada's really big!"

And Lucifer's beside him
A demon's in the coolant

I got bats in the transmission
This Escort needs an exorcism
Pan is to blame

I put a tiger in my tank
I let a champ spark my gas

A pain in the ass
I think the seats are broken

Please please mister
Take your blessed wrench

Cast out this demon horde
And replace the brimstone stench
With the smell of gasoline
A heavenly muffled roar
I'll worship you oh Speedy man
Mister Goodwrench even more

Let it run

It roars just like a lion

Salads are only for murderers, cole slaw's a fascist regime
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just 'cause a radish can't

I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream scream
Scream)
Watching their skins being peeled (Having their insides
Revealed)
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)
Carrot Juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables grow)
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's as dirty as hell)
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade...)
I saw a man eating celery, so I beta him black and blue
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two
I'm a political prisoner trapped in a windowless cage
'cause I stopped the slughter of turnips by killing three men in a
Rage
I told the judge when he sentenced me, this is my finest hour
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower

How low as people do we dare to stoop
Making young broccoli's bleed in the soup
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes, let ptted plants free
Don't mash that potatoe
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream scream

Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir fry are
Sealed)
Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob)
How do you think that feels (leave them out in the fields)
Carrot Juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide)
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes your compost's a grave)

That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies

Man, I hate kids, especially their letters
Cuz I always give 'em some stuff, man, but they always say they want somethin' better
Well, maybe I'm getting cranky cuz I'm gettin' old

Ugly sweaters and bow ties and socks
(And twenty-two calenders!)

Along with all the money you need to pay the rent

You gotta look out for number one

It was the most dreaded time of year
My parents got me clothes that just weren't cool
When all I want is money to buy beer
There was a girl at church who I was sweet on
So in the Christmas play I was the ox
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus

Ripped your heart right out of your chest and spat on it too

You look disheveled and there's drool on your chin
You thought that this love would last
But she said, ""Merry Christmas, baby"" and she booted your ass

When Daddy barked on her face
So Mom asked God to bless the vomit too

I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword

I'd really like to do it
But I might get hurt
It's dangerous (too dangerous)
I don't feel like bleeding
On my brand new shirt
You might say I'm cowardly
Or say I'll full of fright
You might call me yellow
And baby you'd be right!

So I'd skip across volcanoes full of lava
I'd even grab a tiger by the tail
I would make fun of
A boxing champion's mother
But my courage and my bowels both would fail
I would fight off a bunch
Of angry Kosacks
I would stop a thousand
Bullets with my hand
I would laugh
As my leg was amputated..
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!

'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)
I use big words
But I never do the deed
It's dangerous (too dangerous)
I faint like a baby

Well off we go, our guns are loaded
And so's are we
We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces
And piss on the nice trees
And then we spot something moving an' a rustle
We pump it full of lead
And smile real wide as we hear it scream
And thud as it falls down dead

'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'

Well off we go to see what we killed
And watch the damn thing bleed
The first thing we see is a bright orange cap
And we shot down Ol' Charlie
But he don't to mind, he smiled all the time
He died real happy
But next time he should tell us
When he's goin' off to take a pee

'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
Maybe the neighbour's kids!
We're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
Maybe the neighbour's kids!

Well the sun goes down and we head back to town
And we hop in our pickup truck
Strap Charlie to the hood, start up the engine
Drive it home with any luck
Well what do you know, we run into a pole
But we're all still in one piece
And we get a free ride back into town
Courtesy of the police.

'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is

We argue about comic books and Internet connections
The biggest highlight of the year is the Star Trek Convention
Our town's not big enough to sign up any stars
But we once met a red shirt who was phasered by a Borg
(Man, he knew Mr. Sulu!) (What?)

It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd
We wear our Star Trek uniforms and talk like Captain Kirk

We have our own heroes who we try to emulate
I dream of one day being as sexy as Bill Gates
We hate watching sports 'cause we're reading Carl Sagan
But we'd watch the Olympics if they played Dungeons and Dragons
(I'm a Hobbitt! Ha ha ha ha!)

It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd
We think Tolkein was a genius and Shakespeare was a turd

We rarely get a date or get talked to by a girl
Unless they're having trouble with their algebra homework
We're emotionally bereft and we're sexually frustrated
But we can download photographs of Agent Scully naked

It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd
We know the truth is out there but we'd have to leave our room

We are the nerds in your neighbourhood
Polyester's a fashion statement
But there's more room on the beach for you
'Cause we're locked in our basement

It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd
We like to wear colours that do not appear in nature

It's great to be a
Poorly-dressed fashionless
Star trekking roleplaying
Ninety pound when wet down
Pasty skinned pop drinking
Underfed genius
Yes, it's great to be a nerd"
Arrogant Worms,Having Fun Is Bad For You,/a/arrogant+worms/having+fun+is+bad+for+you_20009362.html,"I used to go to all the parties
And make love to all the beautiful ladies
And I'd eat cheeseburgers with bacon and extra grease when I was
Hungry
And drink Windex Colladas until my skin turned blue
But now,the times they are a-changing
My lifestyle, it is rearranging
For debauchery may be fun and entertaining
But it is also very bad for you
Do you know how many diseases you can get
Making love to someone who has not had all their tests
So nowadays, I am celibate
And I wear a condom, in case I have dirty thoughts
I never drive my car past the speed limit
And I always wear my seat belt when I am in it
I traded my Lambourghini for a Honda Civic
Because it is more fuel-efficient and practical
Ay-yi-yi!  Ay-yi-yo!
Being boring is the way to go!
Ay-yi-yi!  Ay-yi-yo!
Having fun is bad for you!
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes
Because I found that they are a major cause of death
The tar and nicotine have not killed me yet
But if I got pregnant, they could hurt my baby
I used to love my sorry complexion (sorry?)
I tanned myself to perfection
But the sun can give you a cancerous infection
So now I'm white and pasty and I never leave the house
I used to eat like there was no tomorrow
But then I found cholesterol is full of sorrow
The last thing I want to do is to have to borrow
Somebody else's heart, because mine is full of fatty deposits
Ay-yi-yi!  Ay-yi-yo!
Being boring is the way to go!
Ay-yi-yi!  Ay-yi-yo!

Get a horse, I might make a nice centaur
Oh you'll see my face each night in your dreams
And when you go to the kitchen to fetch some ice cream
But don't worry honey, soon I'll be back on earth

A day where I haven't found love

Is the flavor of a broken heart
Then I saw you across the room
I gasp and my breathing stops
My heart's in my throat, or is it a potato?

I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her
My love is consumating, while I'm asphyxiating
Over her

When I wake up, I'm on the floor
Faint, dizzy and alone
My stomach hurts, I think my ribs are cracked
Not sure if I'm in a dream
I turn my head, and there you are
I call out and my breathing stops
It's her again, crushing my esophagus

I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation
Mouth to mouth

She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek
Helps me back on my stool
She's a waitress here, but in the night
She's a student at nursing school
She comes again with a smile and the bill
I pick it up and choke again
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure

I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her
For my lasting endurance, I'll need medical insurance
For my bill
For me to get some peace, I'll need a tracheotomy
And an airbag"

Arrogant Worms,Horizon,/a/arrogant+worms/horizon_20009320.html,"From the deepest, darkest depths of... Whitby!
Comes this sordid tale of speed...
Murderous mayhem..
Cataclysmic combustion...
Picturesque powered pistons...
Accellerating automotive alarms...
Stunningly stupifying stereo stunts!
One man... A dream... A car... A 1984... Plymouth... Horizon...

I loved the car from tail to grill
I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't trade the ashtray
For the Queen's engagement ring
But things they started going wrong
And went from bad to worse
The clutch went kinda funny
Then I couldn't use reverse
Still I loved my baby
And would not admit defeat
Just because it left a trail
Of rust along the street
It kept on running bravely
On duct tape and a prayer
Plus a monthly tribute to
The guy who did repairs
It all seems so unfair (The man was glad the day he bought)

Horizon!
Horizon!

Till one day on the parking lot
They called 401
My car became the meat between
A Buick-Honda bun
I saw some parts go flying
That you really need to drive
My car had become roadkill
Though it never was alive
Left a muffler in the passing lane
A hubcap in the slow
The windshield on the median
A headlight in the snow
And as I skidded off the road
The other drivers laughed
My middle-finger greeting
Would be my epitaph
Death would come at last (Here lies the man who dared to buy)

Horizon!

Now I look at my bent fender
The twisted wheel rim
I wonder if Horizon
Will ever drive again
But I know that this was not the end
Road warriors die hard
And I signed this Mr. Iacoca's
Organ donor card
The steel will get recycled
And they'll build another car
Bigger, faster, stronger
An automotive star
My quest will then begin
And revenge will soon be mine
As I drive my gleaming three-door
Orange Chrysler Frankenstein
Searching for that Buick
To try to end it's days
We'll settle off the score
And then we'll drive away (The sun will rise again on the)

Horizon!
My Horizon!
My Horizon!"

Are such a Delicious treat

He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine

Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped
As if trying to think of something but having no luck
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair

I said, ""Johnny where's your cranium?"" but he didn't seem to know
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye

For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead

Refusing to believe that he had split for good
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded

Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad

Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated

But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body

Said we'd wanna stop these folks moving in next door

They invited me to a friendly barbeque

My buddy Charlie never got off the robots' backs
Then one day, him and his whole house disappeared
I talked about it to my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus
They couldn't help me, but agreed that it was wierd...
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus

They had us over for an outdoor New Year's party
Though it was 10 below, there was food and drink a-plenty
They got excited as we counted down with them
And when we kissed them, our lips stuck to their heads (ouch)
I was watching the news last night, when I saw something funny
Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal
I wondered, could it be my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus?
Could it be them after all?
No.  They're so nice!  Yeah.

You were my favorite lab partner
Till you ran off with that brilliant young pre-med

My optic nerves are only seeing blue
My blood hates to flow
Because it has to go
Through the four-chambered heart that cries for you

I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue
And my pheremones can find no trace of you

You were as sweet as crystalline carbohydrates
The rods and cones in my optical receptors are filled with tears
I wanted to elope
So we could make some isotopes
With a half-life of a million thousand years

If I suspended my trachial dilations till you returned here
My muscles would need atp anarobic respiration
Adenine, cidozine, guanine, and thianine
Might make up my dna
But my love gene must be missin' from it's station

And my pheremones can find no trace of you

The metallurgist is the musicians best friend. This statement
Has been echoed throughout the ages, for without the metallurgist, we
Could not have such musical things as triangles, cymbals, margerine
Tubs, or guitar strings. Guitar strings are produced by the
Wire-drawing process, where solid metal is pulled through dies with
Progressively smaller diameters, until the desired diameter, or guage,
Is reached. The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility,
And seperates metals from other materials, such as wood, ceramics, or
Plastic milk jugs, which are made by the blow-molding process. You
Put the milk in later.

I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue

To spread the word of God
To everyone.

And he healed the lame
But he left the bald men
With their pain...

Oh mighty Lord
I've lost what I had
I've suffered the fate
Of my old dad.

I've looked in the hills
The valleys everywhere
But I cannot see
Why you took my hair.

I'm losing my hair (losing my hair)

Why couldn't you just
Strike me blind instead?

Will you forgive me

You pray to God to give you more hair. You wake up the next morning, you go in that shower, you look in that drain! And there's your hair. It ain't on your head no more.
But, you know, maybe your call's just not getting through. God's a busy man, and, and a lot of people try to get him on the intergalactic telephone. But, but maybe, maybe if we all pray together, we'll get God's phone to wing (ring)! Thank ya, so give me an Amen! (Amen.) Amen! (Amen.) Come on, Amen! (Amen.) Amen!
Oh yeah! The phone is ringing! The phone is ringing! God's picking it up, I think we might have woken him up, he might be a little bit grumpy. But it doesn't matter ?cause we're going to tell him what we want, aren't we? (Yeah.) Aren't we? (Yeah.)

I need help for my scalp. (Help for my scalp!)
Oh give me help for my scalp! (Help for my scalp!)

Follicle. Miracle.)

Oh mighty Lord
Up on your throne
I gotta know
Do you use a comb?

Is your hair wavy?
Is your hair blond?
Is it curly?
Or is it gone?

Is to be bald
To be the man?
?Cause all the monks
Have heads that shine.

If that's your way
Then I don't care.
I'd sell my soul
To get more hair!

With tangled hair upon my head
In every way I really was a kid
It happened without warning
When I woke up in the morning
I can't tell you just what happened but it did

I grew six inches in one day
It's painful when it goes that way
And now my skinny body's really achin'
And my skin just exploded
With an inch of oil it's loaded
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon

My voice is changing
Out of thin air
And body parts that once were smooth
Are growing bits of hair
My voice is changing
What does it mean?
I guess I'll be a real man
Before I turn 13

I buy two pairs of jeans a week
I'm such a tall and awkward geek
I fall down when I try to play a grounder
At dinner every night I eat
A giant heaping plate of meat
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders

And weird emotions come alive
My hormones are in overdrive
I've turned into a girl-watching creature
And all my friends their marks are shot
But they don't care because they're hot
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher

My voice is changing
I hate to hear it crack
I pray to God I won't inherit
Dad's hairy back
My voice is changing
When will it end?
And when will mom stop kissing me
In front of all my friends?

Pretty soon I bet I'll
Be right into heavy metal
But my parents say at least it isn't rap
I'll start wearing stupid clothes
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose
And tell my parents all they like is crap

The first girl that I ever kiss
Will be the one and who could miss
Our love forever written in the stars?
But I don't think our love will last
Unless the four years go by fast
Till I can use the backseat of the car

My voice is changing
Out of thin air
And body parts that once were smooth
Are growing bits of hair
My voice is changing
What does it mean?
I guess I'll be a real man
Before I turn 13

My voice is changing
I hate to hear it crack
I pray to God I won't inherit

""You shouldn't be nasty at this time of year!""
""What do you mean?"" I say in a rage

I said don't think about those problems when we rut
The deck's made of particle board
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Particle board, you could make a dresser
Or a shelf or a hutch or an ottoman
You could leave it like it is or paint it up
It's still gonna be made of particle board
Particle board, it's useful stuff
It's stronger than glue, it's better than fluff
It sounds like a simile and that's enough
To say that our love's a lot like particle board
Our love's a lot like particle board
Our love's a lot like particle board
Our love's a lot like particle board
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I'm having a lousy day
I burned my toast and spilled my coffee
On my best shirt. So I had to change and then
I'm late for work. So I rush into the meeting
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is
And I don't really give a damn
But I don't have another job
And so I lie and say

I'm proud to be a banker
I'm proud to be a banker
I'm proud to be a banker
'Cause I get to talk to stimulating people

I open up my mail
Hoping that it's not a bill but it's from the bank
Saying that I have only 20 hours to go
To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year
So I run down to the bank but there's a 20-mile lineup
And I'm yelling and I'm screaming
And I'm not wearing any pants ah ah ah ah ahhhhh

I'm proud to be a banker
I'm proud to be a banker
I'm proud to be a banker
'Cause I get to screw with other people's lives

I took out 40 bucks
From the automatic teller. It told me
That I couldn't 'cause I just had 10
But that can't be 'cause I just got paid on Friday
So I go down to the bank, wait an hour in the lineup
And I'm talking to the teller
She says ""Wait I'll get your last month's statement""
She comes back in 7 hours
Says I've got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill
That bounced and so they'll have to charge me 40 bucks for that
And for the box I never opened and I don't have overdraft protection
And I think I'll die before I pay off all that I owe and I don't even
Own a car

The most chilling visual

It's really really huge
It's a fat man in a Speedo
I'm walking on a beach in a tropical isle
Hoping to enjoy the sand and surf
When I see a mound of baby-oiled flesh
Rolling and a broiling in the foam
The only thing that's holding this
Explosion of Caucasian is
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread
I try to sink it in the sand
And entomb it in a castle but
It always manages to break free
The fat man in a Speedo
I'm having nightmares
I'm scared to open my eyes
I try to free myself
By going to the buffet
But there he is
He even eats in his Speedo
I take up a collection at the bar the next day
And everybody gives to the cause
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk
We have a celebration
In one of his indentations
And throw a bowl of jello in the air
We think we've escaped and our scenery is clear
But in comes a plane from Germany
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos!"

Police got calls on 911
About a red-suited man who weighed a ton
There was a clear trail of evidence pointing north
This was the seventh time it happened on December 24th

The Mounties reached the North Pole
They found it was outside their jurisdiction
They called up Interpol, the Finnish police
To facilitate the suspect's extradition
They knocked on the door of a well-marked shop
With a warrant for the owner's apprehension
Then Santa got arrested
Christmas Day

Santa was charged with B&E
His council advised he plead guilty
There was footage of the crime running on tv
And photographs of little children sitting on his knee

The judge expressed concern about the risk of recidivism
His sentence was commuted
He got a bond of nonassociation with the elves
And his reindeer licence was suspended
He says he's giving up all of his former life
And now he wants to be a dental assistant

Then he'd go down to the highway and pretend that he was dead
That just the way he was, creepy scary Ned

Ned loved Halloween 'cause he didn't need a mask
He'd steal the children's candy, he didn't even ask
He'd sit right down in front of them and then he'd start to eat
He'd tell them they were better off 'cause that stuff can rot your teeth

Ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned

A strange glow would come from his place late into the night
He'd watch T.V. 'til the dawn, you know that ain't right
If he started to get tired he'd rub sauerkraut on his head
That's just the kind of guy he was, good old scary Ned

Ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned

He had a face his mother didn't love
When people saw on the street they often said ""Uughh!""
Sometimes late at night he'd walk alone
He'd be reciting stuff
Bad sounding stuff
Icky awful stuff
But when you got to know him, he weren't so bad

Arrogant Worms,Shipwreck Balladeer,/a/arrogant+worms/shipwreck+balladeer_20218031.html,"I have been since seventeen a shipwreck balladeer
Tragedy and misery are what makes my career
Watery graves are my stock and trade, but it's getting harder
For all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour
There hasn't been a shipwreck scene since 1965
And I find I cry each time a crew returns alive
I only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster
They pass by, the boat survives, only my career's in tatters
They're building ships too good today, and I'm the one who suffers
They don't get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture
Not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away
There once were found, twenty in town, who wrote about shipwrecks
When boats sank lots, just like rocks, 'twas good as it gets
But the golden ages passed away and I'm barely survivin'
The balladeers are dead I fear and workin' in advertisin'
They're building ships too good today and it's hurtin' me
Why can't even one poor soul fall into the dark sea
And be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree
You may think it well and good, but my livelihood sails away
Oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me
That government bastard's been sent to take my job from me
That inspector's making sure the ships are seaworthy
He can try, no way will I ever give up hope
When he went by, I did pry a big hole in his boat
They're building ships too good today, so I helped one along
How sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song
Of a man afloat a sinking boat, who knows he will die today
You might think it bad not good, but my livelihood's here to stay
It's here to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay"

Swimming through my cranium
Suffocating all my thoughts
An auditory candy floss
This musical inanity
Driving me to insanity

There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike Mccormick.

Or if his bones weren't feeling right
Or if it looked like it was going to rain

And everyone around thought he was a jerk
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt

Mike: No.
Mike's dad: Oh.

His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough
Then go home and take a little nap

He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son
He just hung around and bothered everyone
Never drove a spike, not a single one
Though now and then he'd give a tap

Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan

Fist at some boys

Their feet in the water
Their hands on their

Marbles and playthings

There came a young lady
She looked like a

Pretty young creature
She sat on the grass
She pulled up her dress
And she showed them her

Ruffles and laces
And white fluffy duck
She said she was learning
A new way to

Bring up her children
So they would not spit
While the boys in the barnyard
Were shoveling

Refuse and litter
From yesterday's hunt
While the girl in the meadow
Was rubbing her

Eyes at the fellow
Down by the dock
He looked like a man
With a sizable

Home in the country
With a big fence out front
And if he asked her politely
She'd show him her

Little pet dog
Who was subject to fits
And maybe she'd let him
Grab hold of her

Small tender hand
With a movement so quick
And then she'd bend over
And suck on his

Candy, so tasty
Made of butterscotch
And then he'd spread whipped cream
All over her

Cookies that she had
Left out on her shelf

Arrogant Worms,The Canadian Crisis Song,/a/arrogant+worms/the+canadian+crisis+song_20009378.html,"Often on the weekend I'll jump in my car
I'll not fill up the tank although I'm going far
And if somebody asks me if I'm going to a bar
I'll say I'm shopping 'cross the border in the usa
I do not go down there to buy my groceries
I respect our farmers and our factories
I don't believe that local means it's poor in quality
It's just our goddamned prices are too high
(If he stays away for just two days)
I get one hundred dollars duty-free
(Though it adds two more, will I claim it or)
I don't declare the products if they're in my trunk
(He won't declare the products if they're in his trunk)
Although it is Canada that I call home
I don't cheer for the Yankees when I'm in the dome
I didn't swell with pride during the desert storm
It's just that I don't want to pay the tax
(It's just that he's too cheap to pay the tax)
(Yes it's just like this, he's a loyalist)
I'll only shop at malls that fly our flag
(And he'll tell Bob Ray that he just won't pay)
Unless I need my unemployment benefits
(Get a job!  Get a job!  Get a job!)
Now everybody's doing the same thing as me
They're doing what they can to beat the gst
They're lining up for miles at the duty-free
So I bought a J. C. Penney store in Buffalo
(So everybody come on down to Buffalo)
('Cause if you stay away for just two days)
You'll get one hundred dollars duty free
(Though it's not at par, it will still go far)
And it ends up in the pockets of our countryman
(It ends up in the pockets of our countryman)"

Christmas is here, let out a shout

Christmas, Christmas is here!
Everyone is wearing big smiles
They all try to act nice for a while
Then George calls his in-laws vile
Christmas, Christmas is here!

Always at one time of the year
When everyone's problems disappear
And everyone smiles from ear to ear
Christmas, Christmas is here!

George has been drinking a lot
He just can't keep out of the sauce
He says his wife's been screwing her boss
Christmas, Christmas is here!
Margaret throws her food in his face
People are hungry, it's really a waste
Then she screams, ""How does that taste?""
Christmas, Christmas is here!

Always at one time of the year
When everyone's problems disappear
And everyone smiles from ear to ear
Christmas, Christmas is here!

George picks up the carving knife
Weilds it around and starts to slice
Henry cocks his shotgun twice
Christmas, Christmas is here!
Henry says, ""Hey, what's the deal?
Just sit down and finish your meal
Or I'll pump you full of steel! ""
Christmas, Christmas is here!

Always at one time of the year
When everyone's problems disappear
And everyone smiles from ear to ear
Christmas, Christmas is here!

Police arrive just after eight
Responding to a noise complaint
Open the door, what a grisly fate
Christmas, Christmas is here!
Fa la la and deck the halls
Blood was spattered on the walls
Merry Christmas, one and all!
Christmas, Christmas is here!

When everyone's problems disappear
And everyone smiles from ear to ear
Christmas, Christmas is here!

Always at one time of the year

Said Derrick wearing the chinos
All I really want is a cup of coffee
So strong the spoon stands up just a cup of coffee
All I really want is a cup of coffee
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee, Derrick
You should try out biscotti
Or a low-cal cabbage cookie
This muffin's only 3.50
And what's super great is that it's fat free
Don't wanna smell like an espresso
With your coffee scented soap
Maybe you should have some chai tea
Or maybe join me in some tai chi
All I really want is a cup of coffee
In a non-biodegradable cup just a cup of coffee
All I really want is a cup of coffee
Give me a friggin' cup of coffee
Oh Derrick why won't you listen to me
I don't want a magazine or a CD
I don't want a latte or a frappe

But you don't need to have money
To get the things that you want to own
You just have to get a loan
When you buy, small or large
Just put it on your credit card
You can live like a king
Not paying for a single thing

Put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more, no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store

Every night I pray and thank
God above for creating the banks
They have been so kind to me
With their bounless generosity

If you cannot make your payments
Well, do like the national governments
And you can pay off what you owe
By taking out a bigger loan

You gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more, no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store

Now I seem to have men after me
From the collection agency
And the bank came by the other day
Took everything I own away

Now I think that it is plain to see
That I must declare bankruptcy
But things aren't really all that bad
I can borrow from my dad

And put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more, no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store

You gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more, no more

With my hot rod, I go out to cruise

I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down
'Cause I've got the fastest fishing boat in town
I open up my tackle box, it's so big!
Crank baits, sink baits, beer and jigs
Got my bobbers on, and my 10 pound test

Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree
It's a good thing that fish can't read
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store

Arrogant Worms,The Gaelic Song,/a/arrogant+worms/the+gaelic+song_20009356.html,"Through the ages, through war, pestilence and sleet, the Celtic culture has survived, it's songs and dances passed from father to son, from mother to daughter, from uncle to goat. And though few still speak Gaelic, the ancient language of the Celts, all hearts are still stirred by the beautiful tones of this mellifluous tongue.

And though other cultures tried to destroy them, driven no doubt by their jealousy of the Celts' fine fashion sense and edible cuisine, they did not surrender. Actually, they surrendered quite often, but they were never entirely wiped out, clinging to the corners of small islands, their voices raised in song, the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens.

With stupid hats and plastic plates
The fact that you were able to make
A trip around the sun

And the whole gang gathers round
With gifts and laughter to abound
And we let out a joyful sound
And sing this stupid song

Happy birthday!
Now you're one year older!
Happy birthday!
Your life still isn't over!
Happy birthday!
You've not accomplished much
But you didn't die this year
I guess that's good enough

So let's drink to your fading health
And hope you don't remind yourself
The chance of finding fame and wealth
Decrease with every year

Does it feel like you're doing laps
And eating food and taking naps
And hoping that someday perhaps
Your life will hold some cheer

Happy birthday!
What have you done that matters?
Happy birthday!
You're starting to get fatter
Happy birthday!
It's downhill from now on
Try not to remind yourself
Your best years are all gone

If cryogenics were all free
Then you could live like Walt Disney
And live for all eternity
Inside a block of ice

But instead your time is set
This is the only life you get
And though it hasn't ended yet
Sometimes you wish it might

Happy birthday!
You wish you had more money
Happy birthday!
Your life's so sad it's funny
Happy birthday!
How much more can you take?
But your friends are hungry now
So cut the stupid cake!

Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, dear...

Arrogant Worms,The Last Saskatchewan Pirate,/a/arrogant+worms/the+last+saskatchewan+pirate_20009381.html,"I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine
I had a little stretch of land along the C. P. Line
But times were hard, and though I tried, the money wasn't there
And bankers came and took my land, and told me ""fair is fair"".

I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no
""Hire you now,"" they'd always laugh, ""we just let twenty go!""
The government they promised me a measly little sum
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum

Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone,
I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan.

'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

You'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large
But just the other day I saw an unsuspecting barge
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser
I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer.

A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver
'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is waiting in the bay,
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay.

'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

Well, Mountie Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat
He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat,
But cutbacks were a-coming and the Mountie lost his job
So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob.

A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company,
I never pay my income tax and screw the G. S. T. (screw it!)
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon, the terror of the sea
If you wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!

'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

Well pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here
I heard that in Alberta there's a band of buccaneers
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort Mckay
And you're bound to lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way

Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze
I'll be back in springtime, but now I've got to go
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico.

'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

You probably assume I'm big and tough (big and tough)
But the trail's worn me down, I don't wanna hang around
I've just about had enough (had enough)
You see, I like a cup of espresso
And I like to read my People magazine
I coordinate my chaps but everybody laughs
And say they don't like that shade of green

Oh no, it's true
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do
Oh no, it's kinda strange
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range

Well I try to eat a healthy balanced diet
But they all eat their brown beans from the can
They all have to smoke about six packs a day
You'd think they was the Marlboro Man (*gasp* smooth *cough*)
And they don't like to go to see the opera
On Friday nights when they get paid
And they don't help me bring in the hanging plants
Every time there's a Native American raid

Oh no, it's true
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do
Oh no, it's kinda strange
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range

Cowboy life sure is different these days. Why brand yer cattle when you can just use bovine psychology? Why have a gunfight when there are so many good paralegals out there? Nobody drinks and bushwhacks any more. Besides, we're all switchin' over to eatin' salt-reduced tofu jerky. And if yer gonna ride off into the sunset, make sure yer usin' an effective sunblock.

Oh no, it's true
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do
Oh no, it's kinda strange
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on...

I'm not saying you have to but it's an interesting theory
Darwin said we all evolve from monkeys
If his theory is accurate and who am I to say?
Does the opposite work going the other way?
If it does I wanna devolve back to a monkey
I wanna be a monkey that's for sure
I wanna be a monkey like Curious George
I would sit around all day just eating bananas
I might be naked or just wear pyjamas
And make my money appearing in hilarious movies
Monkey see, monkey do
That would be my excuse
It's not my fault, I'm just a monkey who can see
I wanna be a monkey, that'd be nice
I wanna be a monkey, eating other monkey's lice
When they say it's so easy that a monkey could do it
I'd be more than happy to prove it
Then you'd know for sure if it was easy or not
And if you wanna see the home of Michael Jackson
I could provide some simian distraction
Cuz we all know monkeys are Michael's second biggest weakness
I wanna be a monkey yes I do
I wanna be a monkey and fling my poo
I wanna be a monkey
I'd be agape if I was an ape
What a thrilla to be a gorilla
It would rock to be a macaque

I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because that's part of the profession
But now I sit on my horse and tell American tourists the Parliament's in session
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every parade
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending my career in motorcades

I wanna enforce the law, I wanna wear normal clothes
I don't wanna have to smile for diplomats' home videos
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard
Oh no, the rcmp
Is not the life for me

I used to think that a mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble, strong and thrifty
But even though we don't break ranks, we get no thanks, they took us off the fifty (dollar bill)
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like guards in shopping malls, it's such a pain
Like someone's plotting the assassination of the Minister of Sports and Recreation, oh that's insane
Sometimes I just want to puke on Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Dudley Do-Right's such a jerk (Damn you, Snidely)
And though he tries with all his heart, my horse couldn't catch a shopping cart, some days I hate to go to work

And one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his share
He staggered on until he could no longer keep his feet
Then he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.
Oh, Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh
Ring di-diddle oh day
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.

Well later on two young and lovely girls just happened by
And one says to the other, with a twinkle in her eye
""Oh see yon sleepy Scotsman, so strong and handsome built?""
"" I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt.""
Oh, Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh
Ring di-diddle- oh day
"", I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt.""

So they creeped up to the sleeping Scotsman, quiet as could be
And they lifted up his kilt above the waist so they could see
And there behold, for them to view, beneath his Scottish skirt,
Twas nothing but what God had blessed him with upon his birth.
Oh Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh
Ring di-diddle-oh day
Twas nothing but what God had blessed him with upon his birth.

Well they marveled for a moment, then one said, ""We best be gone.""
""But let's leave a present for our friend before we move along.""
So as a gift, they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow
Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt lifted showed.
Oh Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh
Ring di-diddlee-oh day
Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt lifted show.

When the Scotsman woke to nature's call, he stumbled towards the trees
Behind the bush, he lifts his kilt, and he gawks at what he sees,
And in a startled voice, he says to what's before his eyes,
""My friend, I don't know where you've been, but I see you won first prize!
Oh Ring-ding diddle diddle aye-dee-oh

To before you had TV.
No hockey night in canada,
There was no CBC.

In 1812 madison was mad,
He was the president you know.
Well he thought he'd tell the british where they ought to go.
He thought he'd invade canada,
He thought that he was tough.
Instead we went to washington,
And burned down all his stuff.

And the white house burned, burned, burned.
And we're the ones that did it,
It burned, burned, burned.
While the president ran and cried,
It burned, burned, burned.
And things were very historical,
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa
In the war of 1812.

Those hilbilies from kentucky,
Dressed in green and red.
Left home to fight in canada,
But they returned home dead.
It's the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam.
And also the alomo and the bay of ham.
The looser was america,
The winner was ourselfs.
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812.

And the white house burned, burned, burned.
And we're the ones that did it,
It burned, burned, burned.
While the president ran and cried,
It burned, burned, burned.
And things were very historical,
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa
In the war of 1812.

In 1812 we were just sitting around,
Minding our own business,
Putting crops into the ground.
We heard the soilders coming,
And we didn't like that sound.
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground.

Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming,
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago.
We fired once more and the yankies started running,
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.
They ran through the snow,
And they ran through the forest,
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn't go,
They ran so fast they forgot to take they're culture,
Back to america, and gulf and mexico.

So if you go to washington,
It's building clean and nice,
Bring a pack of matches,
And we'll burn the white house twice.

And the white house burned, burned, burned,
But the americans wont admit it.
It burned, burned, burned...
It burned and burned and burned
It burned, burned, burned
I bet that made them mad.
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa
In the war of 1812."

The lady to my left was talkin bout her grandchildren.
Two kids behind me were screamin for their mum.
She was screamin back,

So I try to watch the movie, but it starred Kevin Costner.
Earphones hurt my head, and the reading lamp was dead,
Then the pilot said ""Turbulence is on the way.""
My food try was now on my lap,
The old lady beside me had a heart attack,
Children screamed so loud I thought my skull would crack,
Buisness man turned blue, blew up on my back!

I just wanna kill someone!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladders full, my back's a pain
Next time I have somewhere to go,
Think I'll just rent the video!

After seven hours I can take no more.
So I try to open the Emergency door,
But the flight attendant, tackled me to the floor,
She said ""Go back to your seat dear.""
I said ""I'd rather get off here.""

I got the worst seat on the plane,
I think I am now insane,
My legs are both completely numb, and,
I want to kill everyone!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladder's full, my back's a pain.
The next time I get Wonderlust,
I think that I'll just take the bus.

I got the worst seat on the plane,
Got the worst seat on the plane,

I got the worst seat on the plane (Yeah!)

Arrogant Worms,Things Are Looking Bad For Santa,/a/arrogant+worms/things+are+looking+bad+for+santa_20009343.html,"When Christmas rolls around Santa's in his shop
Managing his elves and trying to cut costs
His plant is out of date, it needs modernization
He has quite a large debt accumulation

Elves are expensive, they do not come cheap
You would not believe the bills for the heat
Santa stands to lose everything he owns
If he defaults on yet another of his loans

Things are looking bad for Santa
He can slip down chimneys but he can't balance accounts
Things are looking bad for Santa
If he wrote a cheque it probably would bounce

He hires an accountant to come and advise
The accountant says that he has been unwise
Even if the costs were cut down drastically
It's still hard to make money giving things away for free

Santa Claus decides to wipe the slate clean
Lays off half the elves and buys modern machines
Then he auctions off all unnecessary stock
He gets a lot for Rudolf from Ripley's Believe It Or Not

Things are looking bad for Santa
He's made all sorts of changes but it hasn't fixed a thing
Things are looking bad for Santa
Misses Claus has left him and the elves are picketing

Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! The big fat pig has got to go!
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! The big fat pig has got to go! (He's gotta go!)

Santa's had enough, he locks the elves outside
Butchers all the reindeer and sells off all their hides
Sells his shop to Disney and leaves the north pole
To go find cheaper labour down in Mexico

Feliz Navidad (Ho Ho Ho )
Feliz Navidad (Ho Ho Ho )
Feliz Navidad, la la la bamba, Feliz Navidad (Another margarita, senorita)
Feliz Navidad (Have you been a good girl this year?)
Feliz Navidad (Here's a couple of extra pesos)

Ho ho ho!"
Arrogant Worms,Tokyo Love Song,/a/arrogant+worms/tokyo+love+song_20009368.html,"We had a love that was so bright
I used to dream of her each night
And rush to her side every morning (Whoooo!)
I had her all to myself
We never noticed anyone else
We didn't even hear the radio warning

Our love was no joke you know
It was the talk of downtown Tokyo
We'll be happy forever, I promised her
But just as I proposed
Her feet were made to touch her nose..
As she was crushed by a Japanese monster! (Ahhh.. ahhh.. ahhh.. ahhhh!! GODZILLA!!)

Our love was so true
But now she's three-foot-two
And she used to be five-foot-eleven
Her death was unintentional
But now she's two-dimensional
My angel is truly in Heaven.

She's the one I'd kiss and hug
Till she was crushed like a bug
I guess it's hard to
See a monster above you.

She said she'd save her heart for me
But now it's there for all to see
And her last words to me
Were ""I.....ARGHHH!""

Our love was so true
But now she's three-foot-two
And she used to be five-foot-eleven
Her death was unintentional
But now she's two-dimensional
My angel is truly in Heaven.

Take it, George!

She was young (so young)
And sweet (so sweet)
But now she's part (she's part)
Of the street (the street)
I want (so much)
To have her back (come back)
So I'll get a putty knife so I can scrape her from the crack.

Ewww.. You might need a wire brush.

Our love was so true
But now she's three-foot-two
And she used to be five-foot-eleven
Her death was unintentional
But now she's two-dimensional
My angel is truly in Heaven.
My angel is truly in Heaven..
My angel is truly in Heaven!"

Thought it was only people's imagination
But now I'm forced into some reconsideration
'Cause something's happened to my cat
That deserves some explanation

William Shakespeare's in my cat
My kitty is the bard
He used to be a playwright
Now he's digging up the yard
He's still a cat in most respects
He likes to meow and purr
But now I introduce him as the cat
That wrote Richard the third

I took him to see Phantom
He said it was quite nice
But he can't go see Miss Saigon
Until he kills some mice
(Until he kills some mice)

William Shakespeare's in my cat
It sometimes seems so deep
The guy who wrote Twelfth Night
Chews on my socks while I'm asleep
I'm really quite impressed
I own the cat who wrote Macbeth
But if something's rotten in this state
It's just his fishy breath

'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!

William Shakespeare's in my cat
He rarely ever talks
He makes his loudest statements
Standing in the litter box
He sleeps on all my shelves
And throws my books about the house
It doesn't sound like prose
When he bats his squeaky mouse

Sam Beckett's plays are witty,
Same thing for Bernard Shaw,
Oscar Wilde is pretty,
But none of them have paws
(None of them have paws)

William Shakespeare's in my cat
He chases bits of fluff
John Milton's in my goldfish
But I never liked his stuff
I'm thinking that Franz Kafka
Really came back as a bug
And I hope Andrew Lloyd Webber
Will stay underneath my rug

'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!

Take it, Trevor!
(Trevor's solo on what sounds like a Jew's-Harp-style instrument)

And the chow mein's three days old

So fill that plate, no mistake, there's no holding back
I won't stop until I got a packed digestive tract

A Wong's, no meal is a loss
At Wong's covered in red sauce
At Wong's, everything is battered
And what's inside doesn't even matter

Stop! Ooooohhhhh. Second plate! Huh! Third plate! Oh.
Fourth plate. Ooooohh. Dessert. Uuuuuuugg.
Fortune cookie. I ate the fortune.

I try to leave, I want to heave, my whole body hurts
Can barely stand, I tell you man, I got my money's worth

If I get the time I'm going to go to China
And eat at their ancient buffets
But I'm wonderin', how they stay so thin

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You know you wanted - A little bit of everything.
And we both wanted - A little bit of everything.

When all the world was listening to the radio
We had to close our eyes and turn the lights down low.
And when that song would play we stared into the light.
And when I held you close we fell into the night.

Each little note would leave a trail across my heart
And every tear would be a candle in the dark.
I don’t know how it all began so long ago.
It’s not for us to understand, it's only love that needs to know.

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You know you wanted - A little bit of everything.
And we both wanted - A little bit of everything.

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You know you wanted - A little bit of everything.
And we both wanted - A little bit of everything.

Like a fleeting dream,
When we meet it seems.
We are caught in between,
And there’s only tonight.
And this moment feels so right.

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You know you wanted - A little bit of everything.
And we both wanted - A little bit of everything.

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You know you wanted - A little bit of everything.
And we both wanted - A little bit of everything.

You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.
You said you wanted - A little bit of everything.

The flowers stood and paid their due.
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme
While drinking all they wanted to.
A bitter sweet, this final evening, 
Before he must leave her side... 

They danced around the glass filled tables
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other, 
However would she let him go?
And when the time it came upon them, 
She said in case we forget... 

Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

The letters came and every single Sunday
We all would wait to hear the news.
She knew her love would be home someday, 
The only thing she held on to.
We sang a song just like we used to
And she said before we could leave... 

Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

That night she heard her true love calling
With words that only she could know.
They held each other till the morning
And when it was his time to go.
She said... 

Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

Just a little bit more."

And when the seats are empty
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight
And i'll be in the place where i belong


For who will tell the story
Except someone like me
Of tragedy and glory
Of lovers as they walk so blindly
And try to find a place where they belong
We all must find a place where we belong


Everybody knows me
Everone shows me
And i'll be here when you have gone
For the road to carry on
We all must find a place where we belong


If destiny has spoken
If finally the dawn has broken
We all must find a place where we belong

I'll turn and walk into my spotlight
And i'll be in the place where i belong"

After all the things you said

Now you've turned around and told me
That you want to stay here forever
And you're back here in my arms

Wasn't cause it wasn't there

You look like the pride of your home town
But how can you hold out when your luck is down
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame,
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame.


Because I'm too tired to run around
Meeting people from the wrong side of town
Looking for a place to live, I've got no money,
Nothing to give, listen


All you gotta do is look around
For something that's new
Find a job that's stimulating,
That's easy and I'm still waiting
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame,
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame.


I've stood in the line and done my time
With nothin' to do all day
I've stood in the line with all my friends
With nothin' to say all day,
I've stood in the line and done my time
With nothin' to do all day
I've stood in the line with all my friends
With nothin' to say all day, nothin' to say all day.


Got brains but got no drive
Money's cheap, the roads are wide
All the good positions go too fast
I need a job I know will last
I've got a job for you, can you push a shovel can you swing that broom
Keep your head down and don't go slow
But don't forget to stop with the whistle.

Promises made, only one
Yesterday fades from the sun
And falls to a new embrace

They lived in a world that was cold and uncaring
They swore they would change it
With loving and shareing
They'll never live like their parents have done
Their innocence shone like the sun

American hearts, so filled with emotion
American hearts, so easily broken

Now they've got a family and a cottage in the hills
He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills
And she has trouble sleeping
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh

Who are these strangers who used to be lovers
Now they've got nothing to say to each other
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes
They filed for divorce and it breaks their
American hearts, so fiiled with emotion
American hearts, so easily broken

Ah - American hearts
Ah - American hearts, American hearts

Now that it's over they'll each go on living
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving
They'll care for their children protect them with pride
And that's how their dream will survive in

Whose music shall be day and night

But I can't let a superstition tear us apart
Who has the right to speak fire from above
If heaven is away from you, that is the place I will give up
For falling in love can't be taking these lips from the cup

Don't fill her mind with bread and blood
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood


I'm not afraid to face the truth of what I believe
If love was never meant to choose, it could never succeed
And we may always stand alone in everyone's sight
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right
Who puts a price on eternity's sin
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again
For you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain


Don't fill her mind with bread and blood
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood


I won't see you cry, should it make you cry


Don't fill her mind with bread and blood

When we believe our reality
In the words that we say
We're all searching for sanity
Till it drives us away
To that place in the wilderness
In the deep of your mind
You remember the happiness
Wasn't easy to find
Why do we spend time alone
Why don't we end nights together
Isn't it time to come home

[Chorus:]
I can't stop the rain from falling
Do what you must do
I can only hope to share
The pain I gave to you
Gave to you
We can climb to another world
If we never look down
We can join in the avalanche
And be thrown to the ground
If I'm still a part of your life
Come lay your head on my pillow
And tell me to hold you tonight
[Chorus:]"

A chance you will be there
Please be there alone
Help me speak of love
Chances aren't enough
Ones too good to miss
Chances aren't too strong
A Chance is all there is

There's a chance you will be there
Wondering what to do
How to play my role
I'll leave it up to you
If I disguise my smile
It gives too much away
What if we can't speak
What then shall I say
Don't you be too long
Something has gone wrong
The chances are all gone

Hey, there's a look in your eyes
Must be love at first sight
You were just part of a dream
Nothing more so it seemed
But my love couldn't wait much longer
Just can't forget the picture of your smile
'Cause everytime I close my eyes you come alive

The closer I get to touching you
The closer I get to loving you
Give it a time, just a little more time
We'll be together
Every little smile, that special smile
The twinkle in your eye, in a little while
Give it a time, just a little more time
So we can get closer, you and I

Then could I love you more
So much stronger than before
Why does it seem like a dream
So much more so it seems
I guess I found my inspiration
With just one smile, you take my breath away
So hold me close and say you'll stay with me now

The closer I get to touching you
The closer I get to loving you
Give it a time, just a little more time
We'll be together
Every little smile, that special smile
The twinkle in your eye, in a little while
Give it a time, just a little more time

And when you feel the flood upon the waters edge
And take the leap from bitter sweet
Do you believe, do you believe
Do you still believe

If you come to me, that's all that I remember
Come to me, before I fade away
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour
Come to me and let the music play

In the sea of those eyes, in the fall of the rise
There is no compromise

If you come to me, that's all that I remember
Won't you come to me, before I fade away
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour
Come to me and let the music play

Won't you come to me"

She looks into my soul
And reads me like nobody can

And she doesn't judge the man
She just takes me as I am

Chorus
Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

When I turn away
She knows those are the times
There's nothing she can say

Nothing that anyone can do
And so she lets me live it through
And when I'm in my darkest hours of uncertainty
She just simply lets me be
And goes right on loving me

And when it seems my dreams
Have all slipped through my fingers
When they just can't be found
I turn around and there they are
Shining in her eyes

Me haría creer lo que mañana podría traer
Cuando el hoy realmente no se conoce, realmente no se conoce

Fuera de esas largas y solitarias noches

¿Y qué dirías si te llamara ahora?

No hay una manera fácil, se pone más difícil cada día

Air Supply,Crazy Love,/a/air+supply/crazy+love_20522279.html,"When you are young, the thought of the day is
Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules.
You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that
Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last.
And you smile as it's going past.
Each morning arrives, and so much is new
You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you.
The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night
You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.

There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all
Watching time, all the things that you need so much
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love

You live every day, as fast as it comes
And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.
These times will change, and people must grow but
Until you do, you live the only life that you know
And the wild fire lets you go.

There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,
Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.

There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all
Watching time, all the things that you need so much
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love"

From feeling like I’ve never felt before.

Do what you do when your lights are turned down
And you wake up afraid
Think of the love that I have here for you
And the wish will be made

Could break what I hold for you
I know the cut will never be mine

Ha Ha funny how you broke me up, you made the wine now you drink the cup,
I came runnin' every time you cried,
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes,
Ha Ha very nice to know, that you ain't got no place left to go.

Hard to get a hold on
Searching for what you don't know
Blind to where you belong
Feel the power in your dreams
Vision in your sight
Nothing's dark as it may seem
We can make it right

Chorus
I have faith
In your love
I have faith
In your heart
You don't need to hide from what you want
You've just got to give it all you got
The first thing that you need
You got to have faith

Truth hidden between the lies
We both know the chances
Nothing comes from compromise
Only strength advances
I will be here at your side
For everything you do
When the world tears at your pride
I'll be there for you

Chorus

When the world's coming at you like a hungry alligator
You got to have faith
When you've got to pay them now or they'll take it from you later
You got to have faith
When you feel like the future's hiding on a distant cloud
You got to have faith
And you feel like shouting at the good Lord out loud
You got to have faith

When you know that you're ready but the time is not right
You got to have faith
And you lie awake staring at the ceiling all night
You got to have faith"

But you won’t escape
Your faith in love.

When you’re reaching out
Through the slightest doubt
Then it’s time to shout
Your faith in love.

And you can curse my name
And say I’m to blame,
But you’ll never tame
My faith in love.

And your wounded heart will moan.
It will sink just like a stone.
To the brink of the unknown.

And your wounded heart will moan.

With faith in love.

And you can curse my name
And say I’m to blame,
But you’ll never tame
My faith in love.

My faith in love.
My faith in love.
My faith in love.

I've got life on the avenue
I've got nothing to learn
I just do what I want to do
I've got places to go
I've got lines on the telephone
I've got nothing to show
For all this time that I spend alone
But if I wanted someone, someone to care
And if I needed someone,
Would you be there
I want to look into your eyes

[Chorus:]
And get a feel for your love
(where would I be)
I've got a feel for your love
(where would I be)
I've got a feel for your love
(where would I go)
I have something to give
I got a feeling that I never knew
I have a reason to live
And all I want is to be with you
If I gave you my heart
Would you take what I have for you
I have fallen so hard
And I will do what you want me to
And now I'm wanting someone
Someone to share
And if you are that someone
Will you be there?
So when I look into your eyes

I've never been one full of words,
It's much better to hide in a smile
With nothing to say, i'd just walk away
Disappear to my room, and shake my fists
Think things over and stare into the wall


And all this time i feel like screaming
Turn that key, let me out, let me out
Let me hold onto someone
Let me out, let me out
Let me hold onto someone


Inside it's so easy to breathe, but never so easy to leave
And just when i try, the fence gets too high
So i sleep with my head on my sleeve


And i dream of us flying away to a place that is out of the way
And there's somebody there who says i don't care
Who you are, where you're from, what you need
Or what you're thinking, we love you anyway"

And moving high up north

So I walked up the hill and lay there
Imagining the day was near
I know I want to stay there
And be a great pioneer

I made a promise then
That I'd find a place
Where my world won't end
Give me a piece of land
That will be my life
That I will defend
If I work really hard
I will surely survive
I know my virtue is strong
No one could oppose a spirit so raw
To be a part of the state
To be known as a great pioneer
I keep the fires burning
To let you know I'm free
My heart will always be yearning

To be, a part of the state
To be, a part of the state
To be, known as a great pioneer

And if it all should end
And I hear the call
From the great unknown
I'll need to go my way
Let me have my day
Let me be alone

I was dreaming here and lay there
Knowing that my time is here
I know I wanna stay there

To be, a part of the state
To be, a part of the state
To be, known as a great pioneer"

Nobody knows how much I've come alive
All that I have to give I give to you from deep inside

A long time ago, from the valley of the sun
Came the holy power,
When the gods were one
Searching for a new home,
Searching for this land
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen
The pillars of the temple,
In these hills of green
Buried deep inside for only us to find

[Chorus:]
It is the roar of the wind,
The power of the sun
The strength of a thousand bows
And those who near it again, will fear it again
And it's here in the heart of the rose
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake
All that lay within you,
As this dawn should break
With this force awoken, none can stand before
This is the hour, now is the time
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine
All that we must be, is everything we see

[Chorus:]
Our love, has brought us both together
And it's our love that will go on forever
There is no love that can become as one
Before it's time

[Chorus:]
It is the trees in the earth,
It is the rivers that run
And through us this secret flows
And now our destiny calls,
You'll remember it all
Our love for the heart of the rose"

Something was changing in my life
Turning the darkness into light

I'm gonna love you forever

There is not a thing that I would change about you
And my life was never quite the same without you
You made the rain clouds go away
Bringing me sunshine everyday

When I'm with you I come alive
I feel I'm living in heaven

You give me strength to carry on

Hot as a passion's rise

To hold on...

That we know but were not really sure.

Yes it's true that sometimes I’m a prisoner
And I’ve gotten so used to these chains.
It was useless to fight, 
But eventually I learned to see, 
But I know I could never explain.

When we talk it’s a walk into paradise.
I can leave all the darkness behind.
Then it’s clear I can hear all my own advice.
And I try to forget all the clouds in my head
But I won’t let it get in the way.

The mystery we feel will soon surround us
The journey of both laughter and a tear

Sweet memories we make will be forever now
The voices from the past will understand
Waiting for the smile that cuts into me
The fragrance of your hair borne on the wind

What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the panic of our love
We've risen high above it now
I owe it all to you
I'd die for you, I'd die for you


The flames that born as one in time may fall away
The glow that is within will never die
To live without you now, I cannot understand
To live with out you I could not survive

The secret of eternal love is laid right at our feet

To keep pace then he left us cold

It's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic, it goes by itself


Quick thinking and a mutual aim
So on finding out the name of the game

Knowing now we wouldn't take second place

Talking about just the things we knew
Watching a new day arise outside my room

And in fascination my heart was sold
Weaving in and out of my mind
With a skidder off now

We'll bend until we break
Cause we both believe

We can't stop
The feeling's too strong
We've got the will to hang on
Can't stop
We struggle and fight to survive
Keepin' the love alive

If we stand the test of time
Love will be the lasting kind

We can't stop
The feeling's too strong
We've got the will to hang on
Can't stop
We struggle and fight to survive
Keepin' the love alive"

Hold me like you never have before

I'll know that you can give a little more

How can I take your love
If you don't believe it
Reach and and count those stars
One by one

Chorus
Ooh, kiss me like you mean it
Ooh, Kiss me like you mean it

Now is the time when words have no answer
And silence is not what it seems
We can fall from the sky in the presence of angels
Do you dream the same dream?

Always the sounds of love
And a heart never ending
For the colors that bleed and run... One by one

Chorus

Where the water is deep the reflection is wide
We stand on the bridge looking down
But you can't decide
True love will never begin to see
So hold out your hand to me

There, there was music in the air. I should have been
Away, but I knew I'd have to stay.

Last train to London, just headin' out,
Last train to London, just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you.
Let the music play on down the line tonight.

You feel the fire is burnin', everybody was there,
Everybody to share, it felt so right.

There you were on your own, lookin' like you were
The only one around, I had to be with you,
Nothin' else that I could do,
I should have been away, but I knew I'd have to say.

I started talking to the girl next door
And she looked different than she ever did before
And she was saying things that
I could never tell

So I was searching for the way in crowd
With winklepickers and the music playing loud
But all the kissing came from listening to If I Fell, I was...

Learning to make love to you
I'll do what you want me to
Learning to make love to you
I'll do what you want me to

I was learning how to lose control
I needed someone that was certain to hold me tight
We were dancing until quarter to
I missed the bus and so I turned to you
I had the feeling that everything would be alright, I was...

A mother holds the son
A lover waits alone, like me for you

If that's what you've gotta do
I understand
It's not that easy setting you free
But that's how it's gotta be
And as you're walking away
As I'm watching you go
There's one thing I want you to know


CHORUS
Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no one's there to hold
And you're all alone
Take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find you ever need me someday
I'm just a heartbeat away, wo


Saying goodbye isn't saying we're through
Just know through it all I'm still here for you
Light a light in the window
When you're lost in the dark, ooh
These arms would be happy to hold you again
If ever you miss me or when you
Start thinking about
All the nights that we shared
Darling you know I'll be there


CHORUS (without last line)


You walk to the door with nothing to say
I look in your eyes and you look away
You're leaving me now, but darling I hope
Hope-that you'll look back someday

Speaking into the air
Where can I find the life
I know that only dreams can share
I close my eyes and see you there
Calling me far beyond
Wrapped in a robe of mystery
You wave your magic wand

Maybe it's real, only life is illusion
Don't break my heart
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you
Don't break my heart

Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home
I stare thru a veil, so thin yet so near
And walk in your footsteps, as you
Cast off my fear

Walk with me thru the gates of time, to eternity
And our love, will never fade away

We can fly to a bridge across the sky
Where the souls that would always cry
Will never fade away

Walking along the boulevard
Wishing we were complete
Why are some things so very hard to witness and believe

The victor of this universe
The victim of the wind
Where does a dream begin and end
And where does life begin

Maybe it's real, only life is illusion
Don't break my heart
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you
Don't break my heart

Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home
I stare thru a veil, so thin yet so near

Cast off my fear

I never saw the flame
I never new how much there was
To lose and gain
But when the sun was taken
You never shone so bright
And from a place we'd long forgotten
The blind were given sight
If there's one thing I must do
It's to say I love you to
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

If I hold you now from my point of view
Will you show me how to be close to you
If the dawn should break and you're
Far away
Can you ever know what I need to say
I can see how much I was taking it all
For granted
Among the silent victims
Only the wind would moan
And for a time I felt us touch
The great unknown
For that eternal moment
Oh what a price to pay
With nothing left but all we have
We slowly walked away
If there's one thing I must do
It's to say I love you too
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

For there lies your survival
And cast your heart beyond those
Faded scenes
And I'll bring you through that storm
Yes I'll bring you back

Out of the heavens they did fall upon the earth from one to two
One was as woman and the other was as man, the two were one

And so the journey for the meaning was begun where could it be?
Into the desert underneath the blazing sun, look for the sign
Beyond the mountains in the darkness of the night, it’s getting cold
They cannot falter they are soldiers of the Light, were getting warm

And they did take the names of Sara and of Sam, remember that?
So they would blend in with the people that they met, no one could tell
To ask them questions that nobody seemed to get I wonder why?

Not far away there is a Mother soon to cry, it looks so sad
Her son is leaving home it’s time to say goodbye, why must he go?
She says remember me, the words fill up his head, I think I know
This is our hero everybody will miss Zed.

We've done all we can now it’s all up to you.

The gypsy is complete

Chorus:
Someone is walking beside me
Someone is waiting till I say yes I do
Someone is living inside me
Giving me all that I need and I need you

Someone to cry on my shoulder
I want you to stay here forever

From the secret pool
Did I stare at your reflection
Let the water wash away
All the battle from my soul
For the bridge of spring
Do I swear to your protection
Today will be the day
That never shall grow old

Chorus

Someone to cry on my shoulder
I want you to stay here forever

Silence broken and the blackbird is free
Only your voice can I hear speak to me

Looking down from our celestial view

Just follow where I lead
I'll give you what you need
And I'll tell you something else
You'll start believing in yourself

I felt the doubt, it hurt me inside
Without your help, my hands are tied


You are my home, my place to go
My faith returned, you told me so
I feel you now, I'm standing beside you
Do you hear me calling
It's to remind you, if you find me falling


Hold me in your arms,
Tell me that you want me
Whisper all the words
That dreams are made of
Hold me in your arms
Tell me are we speaking of love


Don't leave me know, I've come so far
To hear your voice, speak from your heart
I hear you now, you're standing beside me
Do you hear me calling
It's to remind you, if you find me falling


Hold me in your arms
Tell me that you want me
Whisper all the words,
That dreams are made of
Hold me in your arms
Tell me are we speaking of love"

Love comes and goes,
Destiny unknown
Leads you to the promised land
Or leaves you head in hand
Tears fall like rain
Coming down once again
Stranger lost in a distant land
Language hard to understand
Seems like years have slipped away
Still have so much left to say
And I can't wait to see you

[Chorus:] when the spirit of love comes to you
Let it into your heart
Now's the time to turn away
From the ghost of yesterday
When the spirit of love comes to you
Let it into your heart
I'll be the one to shelter you
The spirit of love will guide us through
Love, right or wrong,
Somehow we must carry on
If only words were spoken true
If only I could trust in you
To believe in the dream of what could be
Hidden clues to the mystery
It's time to set yourself free

Let the spirit of love come to you
Let the spirit of love come to you

Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven

What an innocent face,
What an innocent place.

Natural, it's an easy thing to do.

But they find their way back someday
To the arms they need

Loves you in so many ways

Air Supply,The Power Of Love,/a/air+supply/the+power+of+love_20300207.html,"The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes


I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake


Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can


Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you


Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side


Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can


We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Bout the power of love


The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away


Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can


We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Bout the power of love"

(Graham Russell, Mark Towner Williams, Cliff Rehrig)

It's another lovely day
Are we still so far away
And how can I share it with you

It's not easy to believe
Are we both about to leave
Without ever saying, I do
I still love you

[Chorus:]

Just make me part of the scene
Say we're together, always forever
And everything else in between

Just say we're part of the scene
I don't want to hear it, I just couldn't bear it
If things weren't as good as they seem

You can say I'm not the one
That a lot of faith has gone
The bridges were never quite crossed

Every grain of truth, we deny or prove
Is somewhere before it gets lost
And is found again

(Repeat Chorus)

What if these feelings are all in my head
Flying around me in a world of their own
What if there's nothing that needs to be said

(Repeat Chorus)

Just say we're part of the scene
Say we're together, always forever
And everything else in between
Just say we're part of the scene
Just say we're part of the scene
Just say we're part of the scene"

Fight, 'till your world is one

Got me so hypnotized

A love song's on the radio
And memories are all I have to show

Now everything's in black and white
The colors faded with the night
The stars we used to wish upon
Have somehow lost their light

Where is the music that played
Oh, what happened to the love
That used to show

A glass of wine

I'll leave the porch light burning bright
And miss the loving arms
That used to hold me tight

Who will love me now
Who will love me now (repeat)


Trying on my own
But living alone is one thing I can never do
I could end it all now
But I'm not that crazy


Who will love me now
Who will love me now (repeat)


Oh I need all the love
That you once used to give me
Words are never enough
Now you can't be with me
I need all the love
But who will take my hand and show me how
Who will love me now


Being home by myself
Believing so much you'd walk through the door
And tell me you think I'm a fool
But you won't do that now
You've done it so often


Who will love me now
Who will love me now (repeat)


Trying on my own
But living alone is one thing I can never do
I could end it all now
But I'm now that crazy


Who will love me now
Who will love me now (repeat)


Oh I need all the love
That you once used to give me
Words are never enough
Now you can't be with me
I need all the love
But who will take my hand and show me how
Who will love me now"

Don't you worry, pretty baby
Everything's alright
Its another day tomorrow
And another night.
You can tell me how your feeling
Every single word
I was having trouble sleeping
Like the early bird
Who just want's to be heard

Chorus
Why don't you come over
I can't stop thinking of you
Why don't you come over
My heart wont rest ""till you do

Pick up the phone
Your clothes from the floor
The sleep in your eyes
And walk through the door

I'll turn on the light

Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over tonight

Verse 2
We can sit down at the table
Let your problems drown
I know how to get you smiling
How to be your clown
There's no need to think about it
Just come as you are
I'll be waiting by the window
For my shining star
You know it's not that far

Chorus

Pick up the phone
Your clothes from the floor
The sleep in your eyes
And walk through the door.

I'll turn out the light

Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over
Why don't you come over tonight."

Why do we give, do we say, will you take my hand
And live with me forever, if you live with me forever.
We will know.

Every day and night belongs to us.
Every step we take will be.
Just like the moment when this world was made for us, 
Made for you and you for me.

Why are we strong are we weak, are we everything?
And meant for each other.
We were meant for each other, that I know.

Every day and night belongs to us.
Every step we take will be.

A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland


In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town


Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland


In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down


When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but baby can't you see (baby can't you see now)
There's no one more important to me (baby)
Baby can't you please see through me
'cause we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (listen to the melody) cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine (you are a friend of mine)
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you
We were alone and I was singin' this song, singin' this song for you

That this love affair would never be
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and
From that moment she belonged to me

Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her

Andy Williams,Autumn Leaves,/a/andy+williams/autumn+leaves_20321041.html,"English Lyrics by Johnny Mercer and Music by Joseph Kosma


The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sunburned hand I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall


I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sunburned hand I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

There's many a guy who'll sing you these blues
His dream was a lie, his heart's in his shoes
He wasn't so green, in ways he was smart
Till she hit the scene and she took him apart
He'll tell you as plain as day
""keep away from ba-a-a-a-a-a-aby doll""

(that baby doll)
(look out for her)

You'll see in her eyes the warning you should
You oughta be ooh-eyed, she'll lose you but good
As long as she's warm, the livin' is sweet
Then she'll raise a storm, you're back on the street
You might as well know, my friend, that's the end
You're cooked, you're through
(my friend, you're through)
(you're cooked, you're through)

She was my baby doll and she'll do the same to you

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored,
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on.

Cho: Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps
L can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on.

Cho:
I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel,
""As ye deal with my contemners, So with you my grace shall deal;""
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel
Since God is marching on.

Cho:

He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

They shake their heads, they say I've changed

You came, out of nowhere

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will

I'm in dreamsville, holding you

There's no boundary to this magic light
As we go exploring hand-in-hand in dreamy dreamsville
Far away
And here we love, here we stay"

Don't you be a naughty baby; 
Come to papa, do,

As the murmuring sound of May
Of silver bells, coral shells, carousels

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to our marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily too"
Andy Williams,Falling In Love With Love,/a/andy+williams/falling+in+love+with+love_20520085.html,"Words by Lorenz Hart and Music by Richard Rodgers

Introduced by Muriel Angelus in the 1938 musical ""The Boys From Syracuse""
A # 18 hit for Frances Langford in 1939

Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

I won't make it any other way

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to
Come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

There could be no other for their love

Singing loud and singing clear
And it's all because you're near me, my love
Take my happy heart away
Let me love you night and day

You have changed my life so completely
Music fills my soul now, I've lost all control now
I'm not half, I'm whole now with your love

I could have danced, danced, danced all night

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night

I want to be free like the bluebird flying by me
Like the waves out on the blue sea
Your love has to tie me, don't try me, say goodbye

I want to be free, don't say you love me, say you like me
But when I need you beside me
Stay close enough to guide me, confide in me, oh-oh-oh-oh

I want to hold your hand, walk along the sand
Laughin' in the sun, always havin' fun
Doin' all those things without any strings to tie me down

I want to be free like the warm September wind, babe
Say you'll always be my friend , babe
We can make it to the end, babe
Again, babe, I gotta say

I want to be free
I want to be free
I want to be free

Charted at # 113in 1965 by Steve Lawrence

If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms

Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forevermore I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you
And forevermore sharing your love

Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

Lights up a purple sky

From the Broadway musical ""My Fair Lady""
# 70 hit for Rosemary Clooney (as ""...YOUR Face"") in 1956

I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups, her downs

Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face

If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
How I'd leave in autumn, I never will know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall

But from dusk 'til dawn, as the clock ticks on
Something happens to you

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never, ever think of counting sheep

Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king

The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing



Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl

And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing

And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing



O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low

Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow

Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing

O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing



For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old

When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold

When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King

And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing"

Might never be cross

Anita Gordon dubbed for Pamela Tiffin.
Was a # 5 hit for Haymes in 1945

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
>From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

Not a sign of a cloud passing by

There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as i
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love di-ie

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called ""lonely stree-ee-ee-eet? ""

Where's this place called ""lonely stree-ee-ee-eet? ""

It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes true love's a many-splendored thing

Then love died, now the rainbow is gone

Black, black, the nights I've known
Longing for you so lost and alone"

We pass the time away
Writing love letters in the sand

How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you would ever be true
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand"

Her lips are waiting there
Who will be Kalua's only love?

Who will her lover be?

My arms will hold Kalua
And where the trandewinds blow
Soft and low

Our love will blossom bright
In the night
And stars will sing above
The love song of Kalua"

To tell the story
Of how great a love can be
The sweet love story
That is older than the sea
That sings the truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With the first hello
She gave the meaning
To this empty world of mine
That never did
Another love another time
She came into my life
And made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart
With very special things
With angel songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love
That anywhere I go
I'm never lonely
With her along who could be lonely
I reach for her hand
It's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now
But this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all away
And she'll be there...
How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now
But this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away

When chains are torn by courage born of a love that's free

And with our love through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm

You'll still be the one.

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passions flow like rivers through the sky.
But after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wonderin' why.

Macarthur park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down...
Someone left the cake out in the rain
And I don't think that I can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!
Oh, no-o-o"

So the holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King's born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from Heaven sing
The music came from afar

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King's born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bare her child
Not a single room was in sight

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little Boy Child was born

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day"

May each day in the month be a good day
May you make friends with each one you meet
And may all of your daydreams be mem'ries
And may all of your mem'ries be sweet

The weeks turn to months and the months into years
There'll be sadness and joy, there'll be laughter and tears
But one thing I pray to heaven above
May each of your days be a day full of love

May each day in the year be a good day
May each dawn find you happy and gay
And may all of your days be as lovely
As the one you shared with me today

May each day of your life be a good day
And good night."

In days that are no more.
I used to love to run with her
Along the sandy shore.
She had a special prayer for me
To help my world go right.
Her hand was always there for me
The coldest winter night.

Chorus:
I hear the music from across the way,
Across the bridges of my mind.
I lift the misty shades of yesterday
To catch the dreams I left behind.

It was a joy to be with her,
To watch the way she smiled.
I guess I just felt free with her,
So free and young and wild.
I really came to love that girl;
How much she'll never know.
I need the nearness of that girl;
I really miss her so.

I hear the music from across the way,
Across the bridges of my mind.
I lift the misty shades of yesterday
To catch the dreams I left behind.

Spend the rest of my days near you

Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!"

From the Broadway musical ""My Fair Lady""
Previously charted in 1956 by Vic Damone (#4), Eddie Fisher (#18), and Lawrence
Welk (#96)

I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live

Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so;

Once upon a hill we sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone.

How the breeze ruffled through her hair;
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there.
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Once upon a time the world was sweeter than we knew,
Everything was ours, how happy we were then!
But somehow once upon a time never comes again."

Hide all the need inside

You were half, now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

And skinned our knees.

And too much song, 
Wonder how I got along.

Also starring Tuesday Weld and Fabian.
-Frank Sinatra charted it at # 50 in 1961


Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think, perhaps, that love like yours
Is wasted on the young

Love's more comf'rtable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what led us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time around

Taking all my dreams
And taking all of me

Legrand won an Oscar for his score.

The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smoothes the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arms

And if you've learned your lessons well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

So tender is the night
There's no one in the world
Except the two of us

Should tomorrow find us disenchanted
We have shared the love that few have known
Summers by the sea, a sailboat in Capri
These memories shall be our very own

Even though our dreams may vanish
With the morning light
We loved once in splendor
How tender, how tender the night

Even though our dreams may vanish
With the morning light
We loved once in splendor
How tender, how tender the night"

Promise me that you will leave me never

Promise me that you will leave me never
I will love you longer than forever

Clouds won't hide the sun
Blue skies of hawaii smile
On this, our wedding day

The grass grew through the floor (the grass grew through the floor)
Of tony's two by four (of tony's two by four)
On the bilbao shore (on the bilbao shore)

And there was beer to pour (chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug)

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you"

God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
And when the morning sun
Reveals her hills and plains
Then I see a land
Where children can run free

So take my hand
And walk this land with me
A nd walk this lovely land with me
*Tho'i am just a man
When you are by my side
With the help of God
I know I can be strong

To make this land our home
If I must fight, I'll fight

Until I die, this land is mine"

We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years

To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go.

To right the unrightable wrong
To be better far than you are
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star,
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To be willing to give when there's no more to give
To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live

And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star."

And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

You'll never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you

One little town I'll never forget

There, like a dream, this wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light
A feeling divine swept over me there
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me, would we?
Could we?

What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"

What's in back of the sky, why do we cry
Gotta get off, gonna get
Off of this merry-go-round

So let's drink to el vino de amor

Vino de amor and the taste of your lips
Leave a heavenly glow when I've stolen a kiss
It's a moment in time like a total eclipse
So let's drink to el vino de amor

As evening falls you are here in my arms
And the sound of the sea's like a million guitars
We'll lie beneath the blanket of stars
And we'll drink el vino de amor

We've tasted love on a warm starry nights
As I look in your eyes in the soft morning light
No I'll never forget such a beautiful sight
Here's a toast to el vino de amor"

Ooh, wake me when it's over

Arlo Guthrie,1913 Massacre,/a/arlo+guthrie/1913+massacre_20149902.html,"By Woody Guthrie

Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan in the copper country
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
And the miners are having their big Christmas ball

I'll take you in a door and up a high stairs
Singing and dancing is heard ev'rywhere
I'll let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance 'round the big Christmas tree.

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air
And the spirit of Christmas is there ev'rywhere
Before you know it you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall

You ask about work and you ask about pay
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day
Working their copper claims, risking their lives
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives.

A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
To hear all this fun; you would not realize
That the copper boss thug men are milling outside

The copper boss thugs stuck their heads in the door
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""There's a fire""
A lady she hollered, ""There's no such a thing;
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.""

A few people rushed and there's only a few
""It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you.""
A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

And then others followed, about a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor
The gun thugs, they laughed at their murderous joke
And the children were smothered on the stairs by the door.

Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there was seventy-three

The piano played a slow funeral tune,
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon
The parents, they cried and the men, they moaned,
""See what your greed for money has done?"""

Arlo Guthrie,Abiyoyo,/a/arlo+guthrie/abiyoyo_20518620.html,"Story by Pete Seeger
Traditional African music arranged by Rev. Hcn Williams and jn Maselwa

Chorus:
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo

Once upon a time there was a little boy who
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,
Bimp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp! '
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""

Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop! ' make
Things disappear. But the father played too
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop! ' no saw.
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold
Glass of something, 'Zoop! ' the glass
Disappears, He'd come to someone about
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'
No chair.

People said to the father, ""You get out
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and
Your son! "" The boy and his father were
Ostracized. That means they made them
Live on the edge of town.

Now in this town they used to tell stories.
The old people used to tell stories about
The giants that lived in the old days They
Used to tell a story about a giant called
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a
House and could eat... People... Up.
Of course, nobody believed it, but they
Told the story anyway.

One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red
Over the hill. And the first people got up
And looked out of their window, they saw a
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And
They could feel the whole ground shake.
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh! '
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming! ""

He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp! ' Comes to the cow
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp! '
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious
Possessions and run! Run! "" Just then the
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,
What's coming over the field? "" - Oh, Son,
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him
To lie down, I could make him disappear. ""

The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He
Grabs his father by one hand. The father
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the
Ukelele. They run across the field. People
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you
Alive! "" There was Abiyoyo. He had long
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.

Chorus

Well, you know the giant had never heard a song
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, "" The giant
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop! ' people looked out
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.

They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,
We don t care anymore! "" And they all sang:

Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
(Oh, you sing it with me,)
Abiyoyo Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo"
Arlo Guthrie,Alice's Restaurant,/a/arlo+guthrie/alices+restaurant_20518619.html,"This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the
Restaurant, but Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant,
That's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the song Alice's
Restaurant.

You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
Walk right in it's around the back
Just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant

Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on - two years ago on
Thanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the
Restaurant, but Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the
Church nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and
Fasha the dog. And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of
Room downstairs where the pews used to be in.  Havin' all that room,
Seein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't
Have to take out their garbage for a long time.

We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be
A friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump.  So
We took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red vw
Microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed
On toward the city dump.

Well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the
Dump saying, ""Closed on Thanksgiving.""  And we had never heard of a dump
Closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off
Into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.

We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the
Side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the
Cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile
Is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we
Decided to throw our's down.

That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving
Dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the
Next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie.  He said, ""Kid,
We found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of
Garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it. "" And
I said, ""Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope
Under that garbage. ""

After speaking to Obie for about fourty-five minutes on the telephone we
Finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down
And pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the
Police officer's station.  So we got in the red vw microbus with the
Shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the
Police officer's station.

Now friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at
The police station, and the first was he could have given us a medal for
Being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and
We didn't expect it, and the other thing was he could have bawled us out
And told us never to be seen driving garbage around the vicinity again,
Which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station
There was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was
Both immediately arrested.  Handcuffed.  And I said ""Obie, I don't think I
Can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on. ""  He said, ""Shut up, kid.
Get in the back of the patrol car. ""

And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the
Quote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of
Stockbridge, Massachusets, where this happened here, they got three stop
Signs, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the
Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars,
Being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to
Get in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of
Cop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer's station.
They was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and
They took twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles
And arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each
One was to be used as evidence against us.  Took pictures of the approach,
The getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to
Mention the aerial photography.

After the ordeal, we went back to the jail.  Obie said he was going to put
Us in the cell.  Said, ""Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your
Wallet and your belt. ""  And I said, ""Obie, I can understand you wanting my
Wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you
Want my belt for? ""  And he said, ""Kid, we don't want any hangings. ""  I
Said, ""Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for littering?""
Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the
Toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took
Out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - roll the
Toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape.  Obie
Was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice
(remember Alice? It's a song about Alice), Alice came by and with a few
Nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back
To the church, had a another thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat,
And didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court.

We walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty seven eight-by-ten
Colour glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back
Of each one, sat down.  Man came in said, ""All rise.""  We all stood up,
And Obie stood up with the twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy
Pictures, and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog, and he
Sat down, we sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the
Twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles and arrows
And a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog.
And then at twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles
And arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry,
'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American
Blind justice, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the
Judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy
Pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each
One explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  And
We was fined $50 and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but that's not
What I came to tell you about.

Came to talk about the draft.

They got a building down New York City, it's called Whitehall Street,
Where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected,
Neglected and selected.  I went down to get my physical examination one
Day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so
I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning.  'Cause I wanted to
Look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted
To feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York,
And I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all
Kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave
Me a piece of paper, said, ""Kid, see the phsychiatrist, room 604.""

And I went up there, I said, ""Shrink, I want to kill.  I mean, I wanna, I
Wanna kill.  Kill.  I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and
Guts and veins in my teeth.  Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, Kill,
Kill, kill. ""  And I started jumpin up and down yelling, ""kill, kill, "" and
He started jumpin up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down
Yelling, ""KILL, KILL.""  And the sargent came over, pinned a medal on me,
Sent me down the hall, said, ""You're our boy.""

Didn't feel too good about it.

Proceeded on down the hall gettin more injections, inspections,
Detections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they was doin' to me
At the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four
Hours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty
Ugly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was
Inspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no
Part untouched.  Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the
Last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there,
And I walked up and said, ""What do you want?""  He said, ""Kid, we only got
One question. Have you ever been arrested? ""

And I proceeded to tell him the story of the Alice's Restaurant Massacre,
With full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all
The phenome... - and he stopped me right there and said, ""Kid, did you ever
Go to court? ""

And I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten
Colour glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on
The back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, ""Kid, I want
You to go and sit down on that bench that says Group W.... Now kid!! ""

And I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, Group W's
Where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after
Committing your special crime, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly
Looking people on the bench there.  Mother rapers.  Father stabbers.  Father
Rapers!  Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me!  And
They was mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys sitting on the
Bench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest
Father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean 'n' ugly
'n' nasty 'n' horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me
And said, ""Kid, whad'ya get?""  I said, ""I didn't get nothing, I had to pay
$50 and pick up the garbage. ""  He said, ""What were you arrested for, kid? ""
And I said, ""Littering.""  And they all moved away from me on the bench
There, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I
Said, ""And creating a nuisance.""  And they all came back, shook my hand,
And we had a great time on the bench, talkin about crime, mother stabbing,
Father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the
Bench.  And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of
Things, until the Sargeant came over, had some paper in his hand, held it
Up and said.

""Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-
Know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-
You-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-
Officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say"", and talked for
Forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had
Fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there,
And I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony, and wrote it
Down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the
Pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the
Other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on
The other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the
Following words:

(""KID, HAVE YOU REHABILITATED YOURSELF?"")

I went over to the sargent, said, ""Sargeant, you got a lot a damn gall to
Ask me if I've rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I'm
Sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin here on the Group W bench
'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough join the army, burn women,
Kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug. ""  He looked at me and
Said, ""Kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints
Off to Washington. ""

And friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a
Study in black and white of my fingerprints.  And the only reason I'm
Singing you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar
Situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a
Situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk into
The shrink wherever you are, just walk in say ""Shrink, You can get
Anything you want, at Alice's restaurant. "".  And walk out.  You know, if
One person, just one person does it they may think he's really sick and
They won't take him.  And if two people, two people do it, in harmony,
They may think they're both faggots and they won't take either of them.
And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in
Singin a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. They may think it's an
Organization.  And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said
Fifty people a day walking in singin a bar of Alice's Restaurant and
Walking out.  And friends they may thinks it's a movement.

And that's what it is, the Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacre Movement, and
All you got to do to join is sing it the next time it come's around on the
Guitar.

With feeling.  So we'll wait for it to come around on the guitar, here and
Sing it when it does.  Here it comes.

You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant

It ain't so much the boredom
But the fire in her soul
That made her life unbearable
While living in that hole
Of her dark surburban nightmare
'Till she went to see the Dead
And the self esteem she valued
Was immediately spent
And she had no one to turn to
So she just turned off her mind
She's a well adjusted wanderer
But all this stuff takes time

On the streets of old Wyoming
There's a couple from L.A.
They are post-environmentalists
Looking for to stay
'Till their friends all come to join them
In the quest for air to breathe
And when it gets too crowded
They will just pick up and leave
Like they did in New York City
When the coast seemed quite sublime
It don't take much but money
And money just takes time

Marie is on the lounge chair
Draped around the pool
Avoiding almost anyone who'd
Desecrate he cool
It's the reason she's attractive
She's already self abused
And her pride won't feel the loneliness
That comes with being used
She's the center of the universe
For which she was designed
Until she wakes up wandering
Why all this stuff takes time

Bill died of a heart attack
Beating up his wife
Now he's come back as a lesbian
That's looking for his wife
Who is now a psychoanalyst
That likes to work with plants
Except of course on weekends
When she likes to wear the pants
She's a leather goddess minister
Who works with the confined
It don't take much to realize
That all this stuff takes time"

Come all you old time cowboys
And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long
Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo.

Well I found myself in Griffin
In eighteen eighty-three
When a man by the name of Creagho
Come a'walkin' up to me
Sayin ""How do you do young fella
And how'd you like to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the range of the buffalo"".

Well me being out of work right then
To that drover I did say
""My goin' out on the buffalo range
Depends upon the pay
But if you pay good wages,
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
On the range of the Buffalo"".

Well yes I pay good wages
And transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me
Until the season's through
But if you do get homesick
And you try and run away
You'll starve to death out on the trail
And you'll also lose your pay

Well with all the flatterin' talkin'
He signed up quite a train
Some ten or twelve in number
Of able bodied men
And our trip it was a pleasant one
Through all New Mexico
Until we crossed Pease River
On the range of the buffalo

It was there our pleasures ended
And our troubles all begun
A lightnin' storm come up on us
And made the cattle run
We got full of the stickers
On the cactus that did grow
And the outlaws waited to pick us off
In the hills of Mexico

Well the working season ended
But the drover would not pay
He said ""You spent your money boys
You're all in debt to me"".
But the cowboys never put much stock
In a thing like a bankrupt law
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach
On the range of the buffalo."

There's a tavern up on the roadside
I must be coming into town
The moon must be in Aries
Because the truck ain't slowing down
Pulled back on the throttle
I've been doing that all day
Looking ahead for a right-hand turn
To carry me away

There's times for understanding
It don't seem like one of those
The times are too demanding
When you're hanging by your nose
So why don't you just get out of here
And leave me here to pray
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise
And carry me away

CHORUS:
Carry me over the highway
Carry me over the sky
Carry me over the lonliness
That I'm feeling here tonight

You know I'm feeling just like a riptide
And I'm feeling a little scared
A twisted maze of old highways
Nobody has repaired
It ain't nothing that can't be handled
Like an actor in a play
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage
And gets a little carried away

Now all of your highways
Don't mean much to me no more
I've been on all of your highway roads
Of that you can be sure
But I still get lost on all of them roads
I can't seems to find my way
I know there's one out there somewhere

Rivers of blood running thru your hands

My song is cast upon the rainbow waves
Forever splashing in the sunlight
Prove to me there's a love still left
In all of this emptiness around me
Take me from the chilling of the evening

Though you know my love that I must go
A-following the winds that blow inside me
I've nowhere left to run or hide
Except if you will come and run beside me
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do
To keep believing
Take me from the chilling of the evening

And now my time has come down many streets
I'm coming from a night decaying
The song that itself sings is all alone
I cannot even hear it playing
Now to leave before I understand
Just what it is I know I'm leaving
Take me from the chilling of the evening"

Years keep rolling by

Can't remember when

We'll all be together again
No straight lines make up my life
All my roads have bends
No clear cut beginnings
So far no dead ends

I've met you a thousand times
I guess you've done the same

Can make it better again

It's the tenth of January
And I still ain't had no sleep
She comes waitzing in the nighttime
Made of wings
She is dressed up like a bandit
With a hundred sparkling rings
Looking for my company to keep
Coming closer to me
She doesn't say a word
In the shadow of the carved rock tower
Where the sounds of the night
Were the only things we heard
In my darkest hour

She don't want to hear no secrets
She would guarantee me that
She knows there ain't no words
That can describe her
With her white silk scarves
And her black Spanish hat
She knows there ain't no way I can deny her
Yes her blue velvet perfume
Filling up the night
The guards are all asleep
That watch the tower
The moon light held her breast
As she easily undressed
In my darkest hour

Her father's in his chambers with his
Friends all gathered 'round
They are plotting their enemy's demise
With their last detail done
They await the coming sun
While I am staring in my lover's eyes
Her brothers and her sisters
Are all through for tonight
Pretending that they've just
Come into power
But she far most of all, knows that they
Can only fall
In my darkest hour

Hungry wings; their melodies
While my love awakens me
In the midst of the sunburst first light
Her hands are holding up the skies
As I hid my opened eyes
Every move just for herself
And that's so right
Soon I went along my way
With no words that could explain
As she began descending to the tower
Her safety now concerns me
Her circumstance to blame
In my darkest hour"

And inside it was just another man

Every day another man reaches out his hand
Every moment there's a shifting in the sand
Every whisper in the wind
Brings a good man back again
Settle me down in my dreams tonight
Tomorrow's another day to blow my blues away

A man can go thru' life
Taking what he wants along the way
But until all men are freed
Each one gets but what he needs
The experience of living every day

Where would all the angels go
Would they just fly around forever
Or would they come down here below

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
Would there be angels here tonight
And would they live their lives among us
And share the darkness with their light

If all the doors were close in heaven
They'd have to close the road to hell
We'd all be stuck here with each other
There would be nowhere else to dwell

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
And everyone there had to leave
And death was nothing but a moment
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe

If all the doors were closed in heaven
Who would dare abuse a child
Or let a little kid go hungry
Or not return a simple smile

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
And the host of heaven was on the street
I wonder if they'd look much different
From the likes of you and me

So I hope they close the doors to heaven
And all the angels up above
Come and build a home among us
Remind us what it is to love

If the pearly gates were closed this morning
Would there be angels here tonight
And would they live their lives among us
And share the darkness with their light"

Watching clouds and eating flies

Don't want to bother no one
Don't want nothing here to change
A dusty road is all we've ever dreamed of

And I think I'm gonna love this life
Maybe someday take a wife
She can join us if she wants to

Ain't nobody gonna tell what to do
If a car comes we just move
And we both move real smooth like

Old dog is moving must be something in the air
Some bitch is coming up the road now
And I think I'm gonna like that hound
'Cause the more he gets around
The more I want to do too"
Arlo Guthrie,Evangelina,/a/arlo+guthrie/evangelina_20334165.html,"By Hoyt Axton and K Higginbotham

I dream in the morning
That she brings me water
And I dream in evening
That she brings me wine
Just a poor man's daughter
From Puerto Penasco
Evangelina in old Mexico

There's a great hot desert
South of Mexicali
And if you don't have water
Then you better not go
Tequila won't get you
Across the desert
To Evangelina in old Mexico

And the fire I feel for the
Woman I love
Is driving me insane
Knowing she's waiting
And I just can't get there
Lord only knows that I've
Racked my brain
To try and find a way
To see that woman in old Mexico

I met a kind man
Who guarded the border
He said you don't have papers
But I'll let you go
I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes now
She's the rose of the desert
In old Mexico

And the fire I feel for the
Woman I love
Is driving me insane
Knowing she's waiting
And I just can't get there
Lord only knows that I've
Racked my brain
To try and find a way
To see tht woman in old Mexico

And I dream in the evening

Every hand in the land
Shakes along with me
It don't seem that I can dream
Like I used to dream

Maybe that somebody is shaking me
If I fell I could tell
It may be that somebody is making me
Dream that you're forever
Gone away from me

Every toe that I know
Step away with me
I can't seem to get where
I want to be
Maybe it's my own foot
That keeps tripping me
Trip trap - flip flap
It must come to wherever from it comes
Through to me
I can't walk to where
My own dreams talk to me

Every face in this place
Take your eyes away
Blink if you think that
There's another way
Maybe it's my own eyes
That don't see the way
The time is blind
It may come to pass
That I will lose my mind
I can't live without the love I left behind
I can't live without the love I left behind"

Of wind upon the waters

Laugh at distractions
Amusing myself with songs

Played upon the faves of time"

Sitting down on a country fence post
Sitting down watchin' trucks roll by
Sitting down under the light of day now
You know that I won't tell you no lies

I've been here for an hour or so
And nothing much is going down
I don't care much anyway
Because you know I've been around

Here on the edge of the green fields growing
And the sunlight warming all around
And the blowing of the early mist in the morning
You know that I don't hear a sound

Till once in a while, when a truck rolls by,
Carrying a overload
I don't wanna go nowhere right now
I feel like my future sold

Stand on the good land children
You know that it won't do you in
I must have been here one time before
But I wonder where the hell I've been

Early in the morning when the sun comes up
And I'm walkin' all around the field
Thinkin' to myself about the city life scenes
And man you know they ain't for real

All you got to do is stick your foot in your mouth
And tell it where you want to go
End up talkin' to yourself some time
Alone along a country road

Stand on the good land children
I feel like I'm bound to stay
And do the same this morning
Like I went and did yesterday

Stand on the good land children
You know that it won't do you in
I must have been here one time before
But I wonder where the hell I've been"

That the streets of heaven have all been sold

Come on, children, come on

Come on, children, come on

Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Inch by inch, row by row
Please bless these seeds I sow
Please keep them safe below
'Till the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones
We are made of dreams and bones
Need a place to call my own
'Cause the time is close at hand

Grain for grain, sun and rain
Find my way in nature's chain
Till my body and my brain
Tell the music of the land

Plant your rows straight and long
Season with a prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her loving care

Slug by slug, weed by weed
Boy this garden's got me t'd
All the insects come to feed
On my tomato plants

The kitchen's chocked with zuchinis
I'm shopping at the A&P's
Next time I get the chance

He's got his hungry eye on me
In my garden I'm as free

Arlo Guthrie,Gates Of Eden,/a/arlo+guthrie/gates+of+eden_20209380.html,"By Bob Dylan

Of war and peace the truth just twists
Its curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though it's glow is waxed in black
All except beneath the trees of Eden

The lamp post stands with folded arms
It's iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Through it's shadow's metal badge
All in all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from The Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head
In the sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for The Gates of Eden

The time rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the golden calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a hush
All except inside The Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside The Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince discuss
What's real and what's not
It doesn't matter inside The Gates of Eden

The foreign sun it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and others, strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men holy and totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside The Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell me what's true
There are no truths outside The Gates of Eden"

But in the end if it's love you're givin'
Don't be afraid, don't give it up
Give it all you got

There's people around who are standin' right by your side
Walkin' hand in hand, they could follow you up to the sky
But if you leave 'em alone, they'll be on their own
And then there'll be reason to try,
What's the use payin' dues when you got no reason why

Somebody was yelling that the price got freezed
There was a rioting mob, a strangling hold
I received the bill for the escaping cold

I went and picked the kids up in the other lane
Put back the food and ran out of the store

It was late last night when the boss came home
Asking about his lady
The only answer that he got was
She's gone with the Gypsy Davey
Gone with the Gypsy Dave

Go saddle me up my buckskin home
And my hundred dollar saddle
Point out to me their wagon tracks
And after them I'll travel and after them l'll ride

Well I had not rode 'till the midnight moon
I saw their campfire gleaming
I heard the notes of the big guitar
And the voice of the Gypsies singing
That song of the Gypsy Dave

It was there in the light of the camping fire
I saw her fair face beaming
Her heart in tune to the big guitar
And the song of the gypsies singing
That song of the Gypsy Dave

Have you forsaken your house and home?
Have you forsaken your baby?
Have you forsaken your husband dear?
To go with the Gypsy Davey
And sing with the Gypsy Davey
The song of the Gypsy Dave?

Yes I've forsaken my husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davey
And I've forsaken my mansion high
But not my blue eyed baby
Not my blue eyed babe

She smiled to leave her husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davey
But the tears come a-trickling down her cheeks
To think about her blue eyed baby
To think about her blue eyed babe

Take off take off those buckskin gloves
Made of Spanish leather
Come give to me your lily-white hand
And we'll ride home together
And home again we'll ride

No I won't take off my buckskin gloves
Made of Spanish leather
I'll go my way from day to day

Looking like the stars are in your eyes
Here we go
You know it's been so long since we were lovers
I don't know
If I felt this way since then and baby why
Why we said good-bye
Why we sat and cried
Why we ever let this happen to us

I don't care
Where you've been, I've been there too
You know that
You and me
We had some growing on our own to do now
Let's get on
You know the time's a-wasting
Morning's breaking
Here we are
Looking like we used to be and baby why
Why we said good-bye
Why we sat and cried
Why we ever let this happen to us

There's a bird flying high
Way up in the air
And I am sitting here with you at my side
Way out in the country

There's a lot of real big trees
Rolling gently on the breeze
And I am playing with the bumble bees
Out in the country

Puffy clouds are in the air
If it rains well we won't care
'Cause you look good in your underwear
Way out in the country

Here I am
Let me take you in my arms and hold you
Once again
It feels like we are coming home and well
Remember when
We were young and so in love together
Here we are
Happy like we used to be, and baby why
Why we said good-bye
Why we stood and cried
Why we ever let this this happen to us

And you and I can just be friends
And if we let this moment pass

And times I feel ok

And wonder how she knows

Do not think about tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning grey
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find happiness some day

I can even glimpse a new and better way

I'll be standing with my hand out
Yes sire I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can all go

They'll be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow

Down to congress there's a safety net for you

Arlo Guthrie,I'm Going Home,/a/arlo+guthrie/im+going+home_20254368.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

Like the tree that grows so tall
Leaves turn gold and then they fall
They've gone down, now they've grown
They're going home

Mountain streams may run and flow
Clean the sands on which they go
Stretching down like it had known
It's going home

Sunrise early in the dawn
Slips away, then it's gone
Leaves the night to carry on
While it's going home

Once a man he lived and died
What he said death could not hide
Even though it's often tried
But he was going home

Now my friends it's time to go
And this love will live to grow
And I want you all to know
I'm going home"

That we'd just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
But I had never been aware
And as it is I dream of her tonight
Na na na na na na

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling me back again

I have never known
The likes of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this

Where are the dreams
We dreamed when we were younger
Where are the songs we never got to sing
Oh how cold were the nights we slept without each other
Time doesn't wait, but time won't pass us by

If I could only touch your life
With just one part of me
You'll know how much you're needed
And I'll know I finally succeeded
If I could only touch your life with mine

So green the trees and oh so blue the skies
When you are looking through a lover's eyes
Darling these are the days, our days of love and laughter
There'll be no time for tears, the doubts and fears will fly

If I could only touch your life
With just one part of me
You'll know how much you're needed
And l'll know I finally succeeded
If I could only touch your life with mine

Maybe I oughta start digging a hole around my feet on the ground

Look at me now as I roll off my chair
How did I know that a chair could be out where I stare?

And the sun shines daily on the mountain top

And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare that my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

Ladies cry out while on their head they bear
Ackie rice and salt fish is nice
And the rum is good any time of year

Shivered with the feelin' that he knowed

So fine that he had to go
Went to see what it was that he knowed
John looked down, John looked down
John looked down the long, long road

And I know it's hard
But what did you expect of her?
John looked down

If you see the lady in your mind
Even in her nothingness
Standing through the darkest night
And the people want to fight
But first ask if it's all right
John looked down, John looked down
John looked down the long, long road

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war

I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the paper was all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful pray'rs were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
While swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

Last night I had the strangest dream
I'd never dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war."

Spend my time alone at rest,
And if I were the last to leave here,
Now would these roads be any less?

Oh, I'm the last to leave.
Now would these ribbon highway roads
Be less wonderful to me?
Why must I always be so slow?

Many friends come and go,
You know there's a lot of feelings that I've left behind,
And it's a lonely world, I know,
When your friends are hard to find.

But take the time,  my memory fails,
And soak my eyes in the morning rain,

On the road back home again.

By Arlo Guthrie

I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue

Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo

I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo

Who should awaken but the woman of the house
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten when I said boo!
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.

I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo

Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the fields with the pack on my back
Over the field with my great heavy sack
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu

Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo
It's ""Good-bye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu."

Gonna beat the sunset to the coast and back again
Moving thru the shadows, almost going blind
Living like a Iegend before my time

Making up for lost time between us seems like everything
If I can make it home airight, you know l'll treat you fine
Living like a Iegend before my time

I know it wasn't easy for you, baby
With your man out on the road
So I'll be coming home tomorrow
To try to help you carry the load

I'm running out of highways and bridges to burn
This kind of living is taking it's toll on what I've learned
You know it ain't easy leaving you behind
Living like a Iegend before my time

But someday, baby, I'll be coming home to stay
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day
Oooh, I'm going out of my mind
Living like a Iegend before my time

L'll be getthg up early 'cause I know I'm coming home

Go and tell Lord Grenville that our dreams have run aground
There's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town
None of us are caring where we're bound
Like voices on the wind.

And come the day you'll hear them saying
""They're throwing it all away""
Nothing more to say
Just throwing it all away.

Go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out
We're on our way to nowhere now, can't bring the helm about
None of us are left in any doubt
We won't be back again.

Send a message to the fleet, they'll search for us in vain
We won't be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main
Tell the ones we left home not to wait
We won't be back again.

And come the day you'll hear them saying
""They're throwing it all away""
Nothing more to say

That runs forever with no end

Ourselves upon these rocks again.

But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

Some times when the sun goes down

To Manzanillo Bay

His day's catch Iying on the sand
Underneath the palms that sway
Over Manzanillo Bay

Now I'm missing your silver moon
Black sands and your blue lagoon
Some day I would like to be
Back next to your shining sea
Drinking rum from a conch shell
Caught up in your magic spell
Some day I would like to go
Back down to Mexico

I remember your fields of cane
Your warm breezes and jungle rains
And watching the children play
Over Manzanillo Bay

And out in your market square
The women sing out to sell their wares
I've got fresh shrimp today
From Manzanillo Bay

Chorus

And under the spell of night
The bay reflecting the harbor light
You can hear the guitar play
Over Manzanillo Bay

And if you're thinking about romance
And you're willing to take a chance
Just pick any small cafe
In Manzanillo Bay

The sun comes up to meet the dawn
And there's a day that must go on
There's another night that's gone
In Massachusetts
And I could spend all of my days
And remain each day amazed
At the way each day is phrased
In Massachusetts

Now if you could only see
I know you would agree
There ain't nowhere else to be

And there's a house upon a hill

Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Feelin' good was easy, Lord,

And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Stuffed with his feet pointed straight

Beneath this balcony of stars
Beyond the searchlight stage where we've become
The stuff of time amid the waves
Whose nets are cast along the shore when day is done

As the seabird flies aboce
My songs are sung to those I've come to love
The petals strung into the leis
The flowering of days I've just begun

A second chance to grasp a dance
Beneath the last rays setting of the sun
Tears along the trail of sand
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am

When gods and goddesses decreed
The mountains raised up from beneath the seas
The sound of sovereign thrones
Above the hand tied bureaucrat who moans

This crazy love amazes me
As I just gaze into your eyes
The liquid sun is split upon the sea
I want to be where I can see the moon arise

A second chance to grasp a dance
Before the moment fades to summarize
Tears along the trail of sand
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am

Along the lonely stretch of sand
Reduced to just a woman and a man
Bathed in the lunar light
The likes of which I might just understand

Among the myths I know are real
The goddess disguised as herself revealed
I sang her song out loud
She sat herself beside me in the crowd

A second chance to grasp a dance
Into the moment that she would allow
Tears along the trail of sand
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am"

I remember now the time you left
You thought to say farewell
But for how long you would be gone
There was no way to tell
You just set out upon your road
It caused you lots of grief
And took you many places that
You came to, for to leave

CHORUS:
Alone for years you sailed around
At last your ship come in
Well, charge admission on her deck
Or sail her out again

Among the people that you met
Are some you'll see again
With perfumed flowers in your hands
You stood there in the rain
They set the stage for anything
And everyone was game
You came alone and now at home
They stop and ask your name

CHORUS

You'd like to see your friends again
The ones left on the road
And ramble 'round from town to town
And tell me what's been told
And sing the song you sang before
You sat before the king
And fate alone will guide you on
And give you words to sing

Oh babe. I long to hold you at night
We two together are so right
You make the darkness so bright

My love. We've had one hell of a time
And we've got over our crying
And we've come out of this fine

Because when two loves grow old
There can be no denying
That their love may soon grow colder
Yet that's when we started trying

Oh babe. This love we have must be for real
We've overcome, now it's sealed

Just me and a friend roamin' around
Him a magician and I was a clown
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way

Crossed over the border to a mystical land
Sort of unexpected didn't quite understand
On a razor's edge on a grain of sand
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion

On a roll of the dice we headed out west
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs

On a turn of the cards I lightened my load
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds
On target and calm the vision was clear
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here

On a flip of the coins we rode the coast
Tryin' to make the most of every situation
That we witnessed near at hand
On a drifter's crusade all over the land

Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards
In a change of your mind in the passing of time
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line

Just me and a friend roamin' around
Him a magician I was a clown
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way"

Hello again the mornin' dawn has burned away
The midnight mist
Now and then I feel so fine
And now and then I don't feel lonely
Now and then and only in my mind

I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay
Now and then I talk with you
And now and then you turn me on
Now and then and when I don't feel blue

Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you
Pleased to understand that you are there, in the air
Now and then you turn me on
Now and then you must be gone
Now and then I said
Say so long, now and forever then"

Looked into your eyes this morning
You were far away
You must have known I was looking for you
You knew you couldn't stay
All these winds blowin' on me
Blowing in the nighttime lonely
Blew on over the ocean to you
Blew my words away

Put on your heavenly shoes babe
Walk around the clouds
You know that's where I'm bound to be now
I'm coming with the crowds
All these faces looking at me
Looking through me I don't mind
I just seen your face a-worrying
I loved you when you cried

Take my hand across the water
You won't leave no tracks behind
Step all over the moon lit ocean
It's only in your mind
All these thoughts just rip me
Who can heal a heart that's broken
Like the winds that blow unspoken
Blow my love away"

Coming up on darkness
Warm me in your arms

Gently unto me
Softly bring me music
Listen to you sing
Swiftly running river flowing
We'll at last be free
Oh, happy waterwheel
Roll gently over me

Oh in the evening
Feel alone at last
All of the things that the daytime brings
Roll gently in the past
There is nothing left to see
Except the stars and moon

Is coming soon

Many a page of my life has turned
Many lessons I have learned
And I feel like in those hills
Where I belong

Chorus:
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
Ridin' my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born

But as I sit here today
Many mile's I am away
From the place I rode my pony
Through the draw

Where the oak and black-jack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
And I feel back in those hills
Where I belong

To the land of the great Osage
In those Oklahoma hills
Where I was born

Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow white cotton grows
And I feel like in those hills

Placed by fate's mysterious schemes

To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Arise sweet destiny, time runs short
All of your patience has heard their retort
Hear us now for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Can you hear the words being whispered
All along the American stream
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few
You and your children with nothing to do
Hear us now for alone we can't seem
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams"

Turn, turn, turn again
With no other choice except for me to go
Turn, turn, to the wind and the rain

I walked down the hall
And I heard his door slam
Turn, turn, turn again
I walked down the stairs
But I did not understand
Turn, turn, to the wind and the rain

Through the night and through the day
Turn, turn, turn again

In the event of my demise
Be sure to include this statement
When you are bent on closing my eyes
Thinking about what my life meant

Alone on a hill back in '65
Things looked a lot like changing
Singing our songs that we harmonized
Dreaming of worlds rearranging

And I don't know why I'm singing tonight
Maybe it's time someone told you
Just because you say you've seen the light
Doesn't mean nobody sold you

I can remember all of your smiles
During the demonstrations
Taking on what seemed like the whole world
Igniting the hearts of our nations

And together we sang our victory songs
Though we were worlds apart
Every thing then has now passed away
Except for the love in my heart

Sitting at home on computerized beds
Tryine to come to conclusions
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads
Ignoring the states of illusion

Drunk in a world of material wealth
No one can notice you falling
Fantastic flights once good tor your health
Now make you deaf to your calling

And all alone the prophet groans
With words as yet unseen
Who'll be awake when the master returns
Who will be lost in their dreams

So in the event of my demise
8e sure to include this statement
Only the words of love kept alive
Are worthy of not being wasted"

The branches bending down

O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

Near the hills where the daffodils grow
When you're gone from the Red River Valley

While these times unfold
Looking backward briefly
Running down the road

(Arlo's version is from the singing of Ramblin' Jack Elliott)

My name is Juanano de Castro
My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

CHORUS:
Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Jolon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

In my youth i had a Monterey homestead
Fields,creeks,mountains all mine
And i built me a snug little shanty
And i roofed it and floored it with pine

I had a bronco,buckskin,
Like a bird he flew over the trail
When we'd ride out 40 miles every friday
For some grub and to pick up my mail

I sat in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn

I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet

He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl in with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn ya, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""

Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty red mouth

Well we soon reached the valley of twilight
And the stars twinkled out over the coast
She soon loved the valley and the orchards
But i knew it was me she loved the most

That was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

CHORUS

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Jolon

The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on the slide
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

They buried her out in the orchard
Carried me up to Jolon
Now i'm left with these memories
I'm an old broken man all alone

The cabin still stands on the hillside
The door open to the rain
And i'm living up here in Jolon
And i never can go back there again

Arlo Guthrie,Story Of Reuben Clamzo & His Strange...,/a/arlo+guthrie/story+of+reuben+clamzo+his+strange_20518603.html,"By Arlo Guthrie

Wanna hear something? You know that Indians never ate
Clams. They didn't have linguini! And so what happened
Was that clams was allowed to grow unmolested in the
Coastal waters of America for millions of years. And
They got big, and I ain't talking about clams in
General, I'm talking about each clam! I mean each one
Was a couple of million years old or older. So imagine
They could have got bigger than this whole room. And
When they get that big, God gives them little feet so
That they could walk around easier. And when they get
Feet, they get dangerous. I'm talking about real
Dangerous. I ain't talking about sitting under the
Water waiting for you. I'm talking about coming after
You.

Imagine being on one of them boats coming over to
Discover America, like Columbus or something, standing
There at night on watch, everyone else is either drunk
Or asleep. And you're watching for America and the
Boat's going up and down. And you don't like it anyhow.
But you gotta stand there and watch, for what. Only he
Knows, and he ain't watching. You hear the waves
Lapping against the side of the ship. The moon is
Going behind the clouds. You hear the pitter patter of
Little footprints on deck. Is that you kids? It ain't.
My god. It's this humungus giant clam!

Imagine those little feet coming on deck. A clam twice
The size of the ship. Feet first. You're standing
There shivering with fear, you grab one of these. This
Is a belaying pin. They used to have these stuck in
The holes all around the ship.. You probably didn't
Know what this is for; you probably had an idea, but
You were wrong. They used to have these stuck in the
Holes all along the sides of the ship. Everywhere.
You wouldn't know what this is for unless you was that
Guy that night.

I mean, you'd grab this out of the hole, run on over
There, bam bam on them little feet! Back into the
Ocean would go a hurt, but not defeated, humungus
Giant clam. Ready to strike again when opportunity
Was better.

You know not even the coastal villages was safe from
Them big clams. You know them big clams had an inland
Range of about 15 miles. Think of that. I mean our
Early pioneers and the settlers built little houses
All up and down the coast you know. A little inland
And stuff like that And they didn't have houses like
We got now, with bathrooms and stuff. They built little
Privies out back. And late at night, maybe a kid would
Have to go, and he'd go stomping out there in the
Moonlight. And all they'd hear for miles around...
(loud clap/belch).... One less kid for America. One more
Smiling, smurking, humungus giant clam.

So Americans built forts. Them forts. You know them
Pictures of them forts with the wooden points all
Around. You probably thought them points was for Indians.
But that's stupid! 'Cause Indians know about doors. But
Clams didn't. Even if a clam knew about a door, so what?
A clam couldn't fit in a door. I mean, he'd come stomping
Up to a fort at night, put them feet on them points, jump
Back crying, tears coming out of them everywhere. But
Americans couldn't live in forts forever. You couldn't
Just build one big fort around America. How would you go
To the beach?

So what they did was they formed groups of people. I mean
They had groups of people all up and down the coast form
These little alliances. Like up North it was call the
Clamshell Alliance. And farther down South is was called
The Catfish Alliance. They had these Alliances all up and
Down the coast defending themselves against these
Threatening monsters. These humungus giant clams. And
They'd go out there, if there was maybe fifteen of them,
They'd be singing songs in fifteen part harmony. And when
One part disappeared, that's how they knew where the clam
Would be.

Which is why Americans only sing in four part harmony to
This very day. That proved to be too dangerous. See, what
They did was they'd be singing these songs called Clam
Chanties, and they'd have these big spears called clampoons.
And they'd be walking up and down the beach and the method
They eventually devised where they'd have this guy, the
Most strongest heavy duty true blue American, courageous
Type dude they could find and they'd have him out there
Walking up and down the beach by himself with other chicken
Dudes hiding behind the sand dunes somewhere.

He'd be singing the verses. They'd be singing the chorus.
And clams would hear 'em. And clams hate music. So clams
Would come out of the water and they'd come after this one
Guy. And all you'd see pretty soon was flying all over,
The sand flying upandownthebeachmanmanclamclammanmanclam
Manclamclammanupanddownthebeachgoingthiswayandthatwayup
Thehillsinthewateroutofthewaterbehindthetreeseverywhere
Finallythemanwould jump over a big sand dune, roll over
The side, the clam would come over the dune, fall in the
Hole and fourteen guys would come out there and stab the
Shit out of him with their clampoons.

That's the way it was. That was one way to deal with them.
The other way was to weld two clams together. L don't
Believe it. I'm losing it. Hey. What can you do. Another
Night shot to hell.

Hey, this was serious back then. This was very serious.
I mean these songs now are just piddley folk songs. But
Back then these songs were controversial. These was
Radical, almost revolutionary songs. Because times was
Different and clams was a threat to America. That's right.
So we want to sing this song tonight about the one last...
You see what they did was there was one man, he was one
Of these men, his name will always be remembered, his
Name was Reuben Clamzo, and he was one of the last great
Clam men there ever was. He stuck the last clam stab,
The last clampoon into the last clam that was ever seen
On this continent.

Knowing he would be out of work in an hour. He did it
Anyway so that you and me could go to the beach in
Relative safety. That's right. Made America safe for the
Likes of you and me. And so we sing this song in his
Memory. He went into whaling like most of them guys did.
And he got out of that when he died. You know, clams was
Much more dangerous than whales. Clams can run in the
Water, on the water or on the ground, and they are so big
Sometimes that they can jump and they can spread their
Kinda shells and kinda almost fly like one of them flying
Squirrels.

You could be standing there thinking that your perfectly
Safe and all of a sudden whop.... That's ' true... And so
This is the song of this guy by the name of Reuben Clamzo,
And the song takes place right after he stabbed this clam
And the clam was, going through this kinda death dance
Over on the side somewhere. The song starts there and he
Goes into whaling and takes you through the I next...

I sing the part of the guy on the beach by himself. I go
Like this: ""Poor old Reuben Clamzo"" and you go ""Clamzo Boys,
Clamzo"". That's the part of the fourteen chicken dudes over
On the other side. That's what they used to sing. They'd be
Calling these clams out of the water. Like taunting them,
Making fun of them. Clams would get real mad and come out.

Here we go. I want you to sing it in case you ever have an
Occasion to join such an Alliance. You know some of these
Alliances are still around. Still defending America against
Things like them clams. If you ever wants to join one, now
You have some historic background. So you know where these
Guys are coming from. It's not just some 60's movement or
Something, these things go back a long time.

Notice the distinction you're going to have to make now
Between the first and easy ""Clamzo Boys Clamzo"" and the
More complicated ""Clamzo Me Boys Clamzo"". Stay serious.
Folk songs are serious. That's what Pete Seeger told me.
""Arlo I only want to tell you one thing... Folk songs are
Serious"". I said ""right"". Let's do it in C for Clam...
Iet's do it in B... For boy that's a big clam... Iet' s do
It in G for Gee, I hope that big clam don't see me. Let's
Do it in F... For he sees me. Let's do it back in A... For A
Clam is coming. Better get this song done quick. The Story
Of Reuben Clamzo and His Strange Daughter in the Key of A.

Save your money and let me be

Arlo Guthrie,The City Of New Orleans,/a/arlo+guthrie/city+of+new+orleans_20178738.html,"Riding on the City Of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three Conductors; twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey - the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms, and fields
Passing trains that have no name, and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobile

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City Of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealing card games with the old man in the Club Car
Penny a point - ain't no one keeping score
As the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman Porters, and the sons of Engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
And, mothers with their babes asleep rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning, America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City Of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Night time on the City Of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Halfway home - we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea
But, all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again - the passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night, America, how are ya?
Said, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City Of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done"

Chorus

This song is about the time that I was ridin' my motorcycle.
Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin'
My guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a
Mountain, and on the other side there was nothin' - there was
A cliff in the air.

Now, when you're going down a mountain road at I50 miles
An hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you're playin'
A guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar.
Because if it's an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater
On the box side than on the neck side, because there's
More guitar on the box side. I wasn't payin' attention..

Luckily I didn't go into the mountain - I went over the cliff.
I was goin' at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down
At the same time.

I knew it was the end. I looked down, I said ''Wow! Some
Trip"". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last
Trip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided
To write one last farewell song to the world.

Put a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper.
I sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin':
I don't want a pickle
Just want to ride on my motorsickle
And I don't want a tickle
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle

And I don't want to die
Just want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. ""

I knew that, it wasn't the best song l ever wrote, but I didn't
Have time to change it. I was comin' down mighty fast.

But as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn't die. I
Landed on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away
On the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin'
175 miles an hour, playin' the motorcycle song.

I came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around
The corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned
Itself off.

I walked over to my friend. He was standin' there eatin'
Pickles. I said ""Hi, what's happenin'?"" He looked at me in the
Eye and said ""Nothin'"".

You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just
Squashed a cop...

I just want to ride on my motor-cicle
And I don't want a tickle
I'd rather ride on my motor-cicle
And I don't want to die
I just want to ride on my motor-cy-cle

You know it's been about 12 years now, that I've been singin' this dumb song
You know it's amazin', it's amazin' that somebody can get away with singin' a song this dumb for that long

But you know, hey you know what's more amazin' than that is that, uh somebody can make a livin' singin' a song this dumb

But that's America.
You know I told everything there was to tell about it
When I wrote it, how come, why, what for
But you know the one thing, that I always used to neglect to explain, was the significance of the pickle

There was a time I was ridin' my bike
I was going down a mountain road
I was doin' 150 miles an hour
On one side of the mountain road there was a mountain
And on the other side, there was nothin'
There was just a cliff in the air
But I wasn't payin' attention you know
I was just driving down the road

All of a sudden by accident
A string broke off my guitar
It broke you know right there
Went flying across the road that way
Wrapped itself around a yield sign
Well the sign didn't break
It didn't come out the ground
And the string stayed wrapped around it
Stayed in the other end of my guitar
Held onto my guitar with one hand
I held onto the bike with the other

I made a sharp turn off the road
Luckily I didn't go into the mountain
I went over the cliff
I was doin' 150 miles an hour sideways
And 500 feet down at the same time
Hey, I was lookin' for the cops
Cuz' you know
Hey I knew that it, it was illegal

Well, I knew that that was it
I knew I didn't have long to live in this world
And in my last remaining seconds in the world
I knew it was my obligation to write one last farewell song to the world

Took out a piece of paper
I pulled out a pen
And it didn't write
I, I had to put another ink cartridge in it
I sat back and I thought a while
And it come to me
It come like a  flash
Like a vision burnt across the clouds

I just wrote it down
I learnt it right away

I don't want a pickle
Just want to ride on my motor-cicle
And I don't want a tickle
I'd rather ride on my motor-cicle
And I don't want to die
I just want to ride on my motor-cy-cle

Hey, I, you know
I knew it wasn't the best song I ever wrote
But I didn't have time to change it

But you know the most amazin' thing was that I didn't die
I landed on the top of a police car.... And it died

I come into town, I come into town at a screamin' 175 miles an hour
Singing my new motorcycle song
I stopped out front of the deli
And out in front of the deli was a man eating the most tremendous pickle
A pickle the size of four pregnant watermelons
Just a huge monster pickle

He walked up to me, pushed the pickle in my face and started asking me questions
It was about the same time I noticed the pickle in my face
I noticed a cord hangin' from the long end of the pickle
Goin' up his sleeve down his shirt, into his pants and shoes
Out into a briefcase he had near his feet

I knew it wasn't an ordinary pickle
But it was about the same time I noticed the cord hangin' out of the pickle
That a four foot cop arrived with a five foot gun
A cop that one time musta been around six foot three
But was met at the bottom of a mountain
By a flyin', singin' writin' weirdo freak

He walked up and with one tremendous hand
He grabbed the pickle away from the other guy
He threw it, a hundred feet, straight up in the air
And while the pickle was half way between going up and coming down
He took out his gun and put a three inch bullet hole
Right through the long end of the pickle
It started comin' back down
He stuck out his foot
He caught the pickle on his big toe
And balancing the pickle on his big toe
He reached his huge hand into his little pocket
Pulled out a 10 foot ticket
He borrowed my pen
He wrote it up
Then he rolled it up
And stuffed it in the bullet hole in the middle of the pickle
Took the pickle with the ticket
And shoved it down my throat

It was at that very moment that the pickle with the ticket was goin' down my throat
That I knew for sure that, that I didn't want a pickle

I don't want a pickle
Just want to ride on my motor-cicle
And I don't want a tickle
I'd rather ride on my motor-cicle
And I don't want to die
Just want to ride on my motor-cy-cle"

This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American
Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys
In the fbi.

Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an fbi man. I mean, first
Of all, being an fbi man, you have to be over 40 years old.
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a
Meaningful shape in today's complex society.

But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the fbi. I
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have
To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job.
Follow me around.

I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you
Know.

I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.

Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that
You have to go.

Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna
Do?

Well, it's a drag for him. But that's not why I want to dedicate
The song to the fbi.

During these hard days and hard weeks, everybody always
Has it bad once in a while. You know, you have a bad time of
It, and you always have a friend who says ""Hey man, you
Ain't got it that bad. Look at that guy. "" And you at that
Guy, and he's got it worse than you. And it makes you feel
Better that there's somebody that's got it worse than you.

But think of the last guy. For one minute, think of the last
Guy. Nobody's got it worse than that guy. Nobody in the
Whole world. That guy... He's so alone in the world that he
Doesn't even have a street to lay in for a truck to run him over.
He's out there with nothin'. Nothin's happenin' for that cat.

And all that he has to do to create a little excitement in his
Own life is to bum a dime from somewhere, call up the fbi.
Say ""FBl?"", they say ""Yes"", say ""I think Uncle Ho and Chair-
Man Mao and their friends are comin' over for dinner"" (click)
Hang up the phone.

And within two minutes, and not two minutes from when he
Hangs up the phone, but two minutes from when he first put
The dime in, they got 30, 000 feet of tape rollin'; files on tape;
Pictures, movies, dramas, actions on tape. But then they send
Out a half a million people all over the entire world, the globe,
They find out all they can about this guy.

'Cause there's a number of questions involved in the guy. I
Mean, if he was the last guy in the world, how'd he get a dime
To call the fbi? There are plenty of people that aren't the last
Guys that can't get dimes. He comes along and he gets a dime.

I mean, if he had to bum a dime to call the fbi, how was he
Gonna serve dinner for all of those people? How could the
Last guy make dinner for all those people. And if he could
Make dinner, and was gonna make dinner, then why did he
Call the fbi?

They find out all of those questions within two minutes. And
That's a great thing about America. I mean, this is the only
Country in the world... L mean, well, it's not the only country
In the world that could find stuff out in two minutes, but it's
The only country in the world that would take two minutes
For that guy.

Other countries would say ""Hey, he's the last guy... Screw
Him"", you know? But in America, there is no discrimination,
And there is no hypocrisy, 'cause they'll get anybody. And that's
A  wonderful thing about America.

And that's why tonight I'd like to dedicate it to every fbi
Man in the audience. I know you can't say nothin', you know,
You can't get up and say ""Hi!"" cause then everybody knows
That you're an fbi man and that's a drag for you and your
Friends.

They're not really your friends, are they? I mean, so you can't
Get up and say nothin' 'cause other wise, you gotta get sent
Back to the factory and that's a drag for you and it's an
Expense for the government, and that's a drag for you.

We're gonna sing you this Christmas carol. It's for all you
Bastards out there in the audience tonight. It's called ""The
Pause of Mr. Claus"".

Why do you sit there so strange?
Is it because you are beautiful?
You must think you are deranged
Why do police guys beat on peace guys?

You must think Santa Clause weird
He has long hair and a beard
Giving his presents for free
Why do police guys mess with peace guys?

Let's get Santa Clause 'cause;
Santa Clause has a red suit
He's a communist
And a beard, and long hair
Must be a pacifist
What's in the pipe that he's smoking?

Mister Clause sneaks in your home at night.
He must be a dope fiend, to put you up tight

As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen
All wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay

""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""
These words he did say as I proudly stepped by
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die

""'Twas once in the saddle I used to go ridin'
Once in the saddle I used to go gay
First lead to drinkin', and then to card-playing
I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today

""Let six jolly cowboys come carry my coffin
Let six pretty gals come to carry my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Throw roses to deaden the clods as they fall

""Oh, beat the drum slowly, and play the fife lowly
And play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley and lay the earth o'er me
For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong""

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly
And bitterly wept as we carried him along
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome
We all loved our comrade although he done wrong"
Arlo Guthrie,This Land Is Your Land,/a/arlo+guthrie/this+land+is+your+land_20518599.html,"Words and music by Woody Guthrie

Chorus:
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walking a ribbon of highway
I saw above me an endless skyway
I saw below me a golden valley
This land was made for you and me

Chorus

I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

Chorus

The sun comes shining as I was strolling
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me

Chorus

As I was walkin'  -  I saw a sign there
And that sign said - no tress passin'
But on the other side.... It didn't say nothin!
Now that side was made for you and me!

Chorus

In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'
If this land's still made for you and me.

There's gonna be some changin' 'round
Babe, when you come turn me down
Trifled on me for your last time
When I come home at night
Why you always start a fight

Now babe I want you to know
You left your motor runnin' slow
I got off and got on a faster line
Got me a baby that's got some dough
When you gotta go, you gotta go
Gonna leave you and ease
This troubled mind of mine

Chorus:
There's no need to talk to you
'Cause you know that we are through
I can find a better place to spend my time
Now if I stay out late
You know I'm swingin' on another gate
Gonna leave you and ease this
Troubled mind of mine

Now baby I want you to know
You left your motor runnin' slow
I got off and got on a faster line
Got me a baby that's got some sense
Gonna leave you to ease this

I saw the splendor of the moonlight
On Honolulu Bay
There's something tender in the moonlight
On Honolulu Bay

And all the beaches are filled with peaches
Who bring their ukes along
And in the glimmer of the moonlight
They love to sing this song

1:
If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you
If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele Lady linger too
If you kiss Ukulele Lady
While you promise ever to be true
And she sees another Ukulele
Lady foolin' 'round with you

2:
Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)
Maybe she'll find somebody else
By and by
To sing to when it's cool and shady
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo
If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you

She used to sing to me by moonlight
On Honolulu Bay
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight
Although I'm far away

Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing
And lips are made to kiss
To see somebody in the moonlight
And hear the song I miss

Repeat 1.
Repeat 2."

Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home
And I backed him on the banjo so he didn't play alone
We've got five generations of a fiddle playin' clan
And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man

Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie
Written on the road by the light of the moon
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon

Well my daddy had a fiddle and he laid it on his son
Sayin' ""Son play the fiddle like your fiddlin' folks done""
Well it's hard to Iearn to fiddle
When you're fiddlin' on the run
But fiddlin' is fiddlin', and fiddlin' is fun"

Can the tentacles of your mind stop the pain

How long will you sit there wondering
What's happening to your heart
Can't you fell the love surround you - That's a start

Chorus:
I'll take to the road in a little while
Under cover of night
You come or you stay
Whatever seems right

I ain't looking for friends or lovers
Ain't looking for a pot of gold
Had it all when I was younger - It got old

Who will leave this world of sorrow
Who will die to all the fears
Kowning I'll be gone tommorow - Gone for years

Somewhere the sun's just rising
And the road comes in to view
There's a wanderer freed from dying - Could be you

Who will pay the price for freedom
Learn the disciplines of the road
Many tried but few succeed - So I'm told"

There's a river running underground
That roll along the clay
That took my body when I laid it down
And carried it far away

It's too damned dark for you to see
So I did not protest
My soul shook free, you can't have me
But you may keep the rest

The waters weep, the sickles reap
My hands are cold with sweat
The eagle screams with frightened wings
The dust does not forget

There's a river running underground
That rolls along the clay
That tempts the sould to the ocean cold
To with the body lay"

Down in the unemployment line
You got yourself a place and I got mine
We been here waitin' since the clock struck nine
Down in the unemployment line

Just to read what's on the bulletin board

Some other sucker come and stole your place

I hope the people in the government
Tell us how we're gonna pay the rent
How we're gonna get enough to eat

So you ask me my kind friend
Why I am sad and still
And why my brow is darkened
Like the clouds upon the hill

Rein in your ponies closer
And I'll tell you all a tale
Of Utah Carroll, partner
And his last ride on the trail

In a grave without a headstone
Without a date or name
My partner lies there silent
In the land from which I came

Long ago we rode together
We'd ridden side by side
I loved him like a brother
And I wept when Utah died

While riding up one morning
And our work was almost done
The cattle quickly started
On a wild and maddening run

The boss's little daughter
Who was riding on that side
Rushed in to stop the stampede
It was there my partner died

Lenore upon her pony
Tried to turn the cattle right
But her blanket slipped beneath her
And she caught and held on tight

When we all saw that red blanket
Each cowboy held his breath
For should her pony fail her
None could save the girl from death

When the cattle saw the blanket
Almost dragging on the ground
They were maddened in a moment
And they charged with deafening sound

The girl soon saw her danger
And she turned her pony's face
And bending in her saddle
Tried the blanket to replace

Just then she lost her balance
In the front of that wild tide
Carroll's voice controlled the round up
""Lie still, Lenore"" he cried

And then close up beside her
Came Utah riding fast
But little did the poor boy know
The ride would be his last

Full often from the saddle
He had caught the trailing rope
To pick her up at full speed
Was now his only hope

He swung low from his saddle
To take her to his arm
We thought that he'd succeeded
That the girl was safe from harm

But such a strain upon his saddle
Had ne'er been put before
And the cinches gave beneath him
And he fell beside Lenore

When the girl fell from her saddle
She had dragged the blanket down
It lay there close beside them
Where they lay upon the ground

Utah took the blanket
And to Lenore he said
""Lie still"" and quickly running
Waved the red thing o'er his head

He turned the maddened cattle
From Lenore, his little friend
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him
He turned to met his end

And as the herd came on him
His weapon quickly drew
He was bound to die defended
As all brave cowboys do

The weapon flashed like lightning
And it sounded loud and clear
As the cattle rushed and killed him
He dropped the leading steer

When I broke through that wide circle
To where poor Utah lay
With a thousand wounds and bruises
His life blood ebbed away

I knelt down close beside him
And I knew that all was o'er
As I heard him faintly whisper
""Good-bye, my sweet Lenore""

Next morning at the churchyard
I heard the preacher say
""Don't think our kind friend Utah
Was lost on that great day

He was a much-loved cowboy
And not afraid to die
And we'll meet him at the round up
On the plains beyond the sky""

So you ask me my kind friend
Why I am sad and still
And why my brow is darkened
Like the clouds upon the hill

Rein in your ponies closer
And I'll tell you all a tale
Of Utah Carroll, partner
And his last ride on the trail"

Victor Jara of Chile
Lived like a shooting star
He fought for the people of Chile
With his songs and his guitar
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Victor Jara was a peasant
He worked from a few years old
He sat upon his father's plow
And watched the earth unfold
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Now when the neighbors had a wedding
Or one of their children died
His mother sang all night for them
With Victor by her side
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He grew up to be a fighter
Against the people's wrongs
He listened to their grief and joy
And turned them into songs
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He sang about the copper miners
And those who worked the land
He sang about the factory workers
And they knew he was their man
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

He campaigned for Allende
Working night and day
He sang ""Take hold of your brothers hand
You know the future begins today""
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Then the generals seized Chile
They arrested Victor then
They caged him in a stadium
With five-thousand frightened men
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Victor stood in the stadium
His voice was brave and strong
And he sang for his fellow prisoners
Till the guards cut short his song
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

They broke the bones in both his hands
They beat him on the head
They tore him with electric shocks
And then they shot him dead
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong

Where I will go the wind only knows
Good times around the bend
Get in my car, goin' too far
Never comin' back again

Tired and worn I woke up this mornin'
Found that I was confused
Spun right around and found I had lost
The things that I couldn't lose

The beaches they sell to build their hotels
My fathers and I once knew
Birds all along sunlight at dawn
Singing Waimanalo blues

Down on the road with mountains so old
Far on the country side
Birds on the wing forget in a while
So I'm headed for the windward side

Au of your dreams
Sometimes it just seems
That I'm just along for the ride
Some they will cry because they have pride
For someone who's loved here died

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead

Of those years have passed
Beyond the confusion

Have been stripped away
Now [ stand here exposed

In the night when the moon
Casts no shadows at all
We sat by the fire
As she started to call
Out to all who would hear
That the death of what's dead
Is the birth of what's living
And her words filled my head

It's the life that lies sleeping
When you think you're awake
Forever is real
And the rest is just fake
And though volumes are written
On this subject alone
She used three simple words
And she brought it all home

Taking off his shoes
Tired of running around all morning
From his animal interviews

Askign who are you
They spent the rest of their lives together
Making their debuts
Dressed in leaves and wearing blues

Some say one thing, some say two
Ain't much about it anyone can do
Keep on walking till my soles wear through
Wearing away my shoes

Evening comes and the sky turns red
Clouds of colors cover up our heads
Ain't it something just to lie here in bed
Just me and you

Oh Mary, wrapped up in glory
What are you going to tell your groom
How's he going to feel on the day of your wedding
What will your friends assume

Oh, but Joseph and Mary were married
The angels carried the news
What the Lord has joined together
The world must not undo

Halfway around the world tonight
In a strange and foreign land
A soldier packs his memories
As he leaves Afghanistan
And back home they don't know too much
There's just no way to tell
I guess you had to be there
For to know that war was hell

Chorus:
And there won't be any victory parades
For those that's coming back
They'll fly them in at midnight
And unload the body sacks
And the living will be walking down
A long and lonely road
Because nobody seems to care these days
When a soldier makes it home

They'll say it wasn't easy
Just another job well done
As the government in Kabul falls
To the sounds of rebel guns
And the faces of the comrades
Being blown out of the sky
Leaves you bitter with the feeling
That they didn't have to die

Chorus

Halfway around the world tonight
In a strange and foreign land
A soldier unpacks memories
That he saved from Vietnam
Back home they didn't know too much
There was just no way to tell
I guess you had to be there
For to know that war was hell

And there wasn't any big parades
For those that made it back
They flew them in at midnight
And unloaded all the sacks
And the living were left walking down
A long and lonely road
Because nobody seemed to care back then
When a soldier made it home

The night is coming quickly
And the stars are on their way
As I stare into the evening
Looking for the words to say
That I saw the lonely soldier
Just a boy that's far from home
And I saw that I was just like him
While upon this earth I roam

And there may not be any big parades
If I ever make it back
As I come home under cover
Through a world that can't keep track
Of the heroes who have fallen
Let alone the ones who won't
Which is why nobody seems to care
When a soldier makes it home"

Before the hurricane begins
The hour when the ship comes in

And the sea will split
And the ship will hit

And the waves will pound
And the morning will be breakin'

Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls will be a'smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift,
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts out to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a'touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh the foe will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
And they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour when the ship comes in

And they'll raise their hands

And lightning wrote these words in stone

On the road to Calvary
Nailed high to testify

Been drunk and I've been sober. I've had hard times

Relatives and I done the same with 86 people that was
Just her friends and her neighbors.

Kissed 73 babies and put dry pants on 34 of 'em, as well
As others, and done the When thing several times, as well
As a lot of other things just about like this.

I held 125 head of wild horses, put saddles and bridles
On more than that, harnessed some of the craziest,
Wildest teams in the whole country. I rode 14 loco
Broncos to a dead standstill and let 42 hound dogs lick
Me all over.

7 times I was bit by hungry dogs and I was chewed
All to pieces by water moccasins and rattlesnakes on
2 separate river bottoms.

I chopped and I carried 314 arm loads of stoved
Wood; 100 buckets of coal, and I carried a gallon of
Kerosene 18 miles and lost a good pair of shoes in a
Mud hole.

And I chopped and I weeded 48 rows of short cotton,
13 acres of bad corn and cut the sticker weeds out of
11 back yards, all on account a 'cause I wanted to
Show her that I was a man and I liked to work

I cleaned out 9 barnloads, and cranked 31 automobiles,
All makes and models, pulled 3 cars out of mud
Holes and 4 out of snowdrifts.

I dug 5 cisterns of water for some of her friends and
Neighbors and run all kinds of errands.

I played the fiddle for 9 church meetings and I joined
11 separate denominations. I signed up and joined
Up for 7 of the best trade unions I could find and paid
My dues about 6 weeks ahead of time, waded 40
Miles of swamps, 60 big rivers, walked across 2
Mountain ranges and crossed 3 deserts.

I got the fever and I got the sun stroke and I got the
Malaria and I got the flu and I got moonstruck and
Skeeter bit, the poison ivy and the 7 year itch and the
Blind staggers.

I was given up for lost and dead about 2 dozen times.
Struck by lightning, struck by Congress, struck
By friends and kinfolks, as well as by 3 cars on
The highways and a lotta times in peoples'
Henhouses.

I been hit and run down and run over and
Walked on and knocked around and I'm just
Settin' here now trying to study up what else I
Can do to show that woman that I still ain't afraid
Of hard work."
Arlo Guthrie,World Away From Me,/a/arlo+guthrie/world+away+from+me_20347156.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

I've been keeping on the run
I've been traveling with the sun
I've been singing all my life and getting by
Got to keep up with what's goung on
In this place I've been so long
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life

And it's so good to come home
To a woman all alone
Forgeting how hnd loneliness can be
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

L'll be coming home at night
While the kids are sleeping tight
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine
And the kids jump out of bed
Hello Daddy, what did you get
Did you think of anything on down the line

She'll be talking with her smile
Saying, honey, wait awhile
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me

Oh the prophets and the sages
And the wise men through the ages
All that's written down on pages from above
Just can't adequately describe
What I'm feeling here inside
It's just useless to be living without love

And I'll take her by her hand
Just a woman and a man
Without trying to understand what we should be
She will take me from this world
Then she'll gently take the world away from me"
Arlo Guthrie,Wouldn't You Believe It,/a/arlo+guthrie/wouldnt+you+believe+it_20343025.html,"Words and musk by Arlo Guthrie

In the candle, lights burn away
Leaving nothing, except the day
Just to blow your mind away
Coming thus, this daily change
You sit and pose the very strange
He sits and hums 'Home on the Range""
And just wouldn't you believe it

Now the hallway, now the doors
Locking out your deathlike chores
Locking in what's left to score
Coming thus, this daily thought
Heroes have so long been taught
Buying what cannot be bought
And just wouldn't you believe it

Like before, my time has gone
Here's wishing I could carry on
But I'm being called up into the dawn
Coming thus, this daily freak
Try to come again next week
When I strive to climb the peak
And just wouldn't you believe it"
Arlo Guthrie,You And Me,/a/arlo+guthrie/you+and+me_20353198.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

The sun is sinking down
I'm standing 'round my window
You say you're going away
But I believe in love

Chorus:
The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be
You and me

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

Chorus

But while the stars are coming out
And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

Chorus

The sun is coming up
A rainbow on my window
You say you're going away
And even though you do

The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...
You and me"
Arlo Guthrie,You Are The Song,/a/arlo+guthrie/you+are+the+song_20354595.html,"Lyrics by Glen Anthony
Music by Charlie Chaplin

My love, you are the song
That sings inside of me
The song is always the same
It starts with love and ends with your name

The more that I love you
There's more in you to love
And yet I just don't know how
I could love you more than I do right now
They say that love grows old
But our love turned to gold
You kissed my sorrows away
You touched my heart
What more can I say

Each day my life is new
For God blessed me with you
And when my life is all through
Without a word you always knew
That all my life my life was you"

I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble
That was brewing in the Asian way
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L. A.

In the city of the lost and found
It's hard to get a break
Hard to stop from getting turned around
And make the same mistakes

My reputation's on the line
The final day of '59
But like the sun, just watch me shine
Today

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso
I practiced 61 minutes a day
I could never reach the keys
But it was all ok

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother
That could brighten up the darkest nights
It's just another sign of love
Whenever we would fight

It's all the same twenty years ago
As it is right now
Like a tour at the closing show
When I take my bow

My reputation's on the line
At the start of '79
But like the sun, just watch me shine
Today
I've played this part so many times
Since the end of '59
But like the sun, just watch me shine

On the first part of the journey,
I was looking at all the life.
There were plants and birds. And rocks and things,
There was sand and hills and rings.
The first thing I met, was a fly with a buzz,
And the sky, with no clouds.
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry,
But the air was full of sound.

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
It felt good to be out of the rain.
In the desert you can remember your name,
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la
La, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la

After two days, in the desert sun,
My skin began to turn red.
After three days, in the desert fun,
I was looking at a river bed.
And the story it told, of a river that flowed,
Made me sad to think it was dead.

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
It felt good to be out of the rain.
In the desert you can remember your name,
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.
La la, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la
La la, la, la la la la, la la la, la, la

After nine days, I let the horse run free,
'Cause the desert had turned to sea.
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things,
There was sand and hills and rings.
The ocean is a desert, with it's life underground,
And a perfect disguise above.
Under the cities lies, a heart made of ground,
But the humans will give no love.

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
It felt good to be out of the rain.
In the desert you can remember your name,

Is done and think of it all
All the thoughts that I've seen of
Satin seams and tide pool dreams
I look to the sun
As the day is dawning
I carry my dreams
From a moment before
I try to recall
But I find myself yawning
I guess they are gone but there's more
So I head out the door

All around, listen and you can
Hear the sound
On cloudy days seems like I
Always feel this way

First break in the day if the time
Is right and nobody minds
I stroll down the lane take a breath
Of air and drift on a dream
I look to the sun
As the day is warming
Consider the things
That have happened before
I feel like I'm one
With the wind on the hillside
I feel like I'm one with the
River that runs by my door

All around, listen and you can
Hear the sound
On cloudy days seems like I
Always feel this way

One careful look shows you're lonely

Shelter your eyes, hold on tightly

Only to be delayed
Bubbles of blue burst into two
Eaten up by the incoming tide
Of the new

Then we call to the man who walks on the water
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view
It's in view

Granite charades are played in the rain
Till we fall through a sand castle window
To avoid the pain
Summer canoe paddles up to you
'Cause it's time for another beer run
Or something that's equally true

In a parade of clouds playing hide and seek
Do they know where do unicorns go
Where winged horses fly
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again
Does myth and mystery lie
Where the unicorns go"

The sand, feel the waves between your toes
Can you feel the way the old wind blows
From one to another
Here to discover

Indian summer
Indian summer

Honeysuckle vines outside the door
Dandelion wine and so much more
We can discover
Into each other

Indian summer
Indian summer
Indian summer
Indian summer

Night fall, fireflies light up the lawn
Pink skies mirrored on the sea at dawn
From one to another
Here to discover

Indian summer

At a party just the other night in Beverly Hills
Inspector Mills I hope you find her and it don't take long
Watch my feelings for her growing strong in a war of wills
Inspector Mills

I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I didn't see her walking out of the door
If I had taken my time she'd be standing here still
Inspector Mills

I recall once in my life I felt this way before
But I let her go and closed the door, walk away
Inspector Mills I can't attempt to show the hurt in me
And just how much I need the company; search the valleys and the hills
You gotta find her Mr. Mills

I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I was blinded by the look in her eyes
If I had taken my time she'd be sitting here still
Inspector Mills

Oo, someday soon I might be in love with her

Inspector Mills I guess you've taken quite a look around
Guess I've heard the word from underground, she's gone for good
Inspector Mills is it any crime for a fool like me
Try to use your time 'cause I wanna see; you just send me the bill
Inspector Mills, Inspector Mills

I can't attempt to point you in her direction
I didn't see her walking out of the door
If I had taken my time she'd be lying here still

I was blinded by the look in her eyes
If I had just followed through then I wouldn't be calling you"

Ev'rywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen

And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door, on your own front door

When out of the blue came a baby boy

He followed his pa right across the land
At the end of the day when his work was done
He'd sit and watch the setting southern sun

Nineteen years had come and gone
Little Jimmy had grown up big and strong
He didn't know that his time had come
When they handed him a shiny black gun

So his pa said, run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)

The distant silence yells
We call on wings and other things

We stare at our own indifference

Burning his face as he ran through the town

Feeding the wife on the phone
And there you are, all on your own

They sit sipping their tea, watch the sea
Move the sand through their heads (sit in their chairs by the bay)
Did I show you the marks on the wall
Left by captains now dead (house out on the cove)
They fell fighting for peace in their lives
Or so it is said (still nobody seems to be here)
Please, can you help me, my dear

If we want us to survive

Where will I be (can't you help me to find my way)
After watching them walking the pier
At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)
They're in love with the news
And don't show if they're living in fear (still nobody seems to be here)

A one in a million for me

I really think it might
Be a one in a million delight
All of my dreams go with you tonight

We'll walk down the roads of our impatience
And if one has to fall
He won't be too proud to call
Some doors I've closed just to reopen
And then sometimes I find
Everything wrong's turned to right

I woke up early and I looked around
My baby slept, the sky was blue
I started walkin' thinkin' only of you
Up the hill and down the road
Past the people that I barely know
Round the bend to the run-off wash
I found a feather that a quail had lost

Where are you goin' now my friend
Where are you goin' now
Are you going to see them on the mountain now
Goin' to see them trees
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow
Goin' to help agree
To be
Today

Some people like to play out loud
I like them always, they're a laughing crowd
To catch the wind then come slidin' down
You reach the bottom fallin' upside down

Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles
Brushin' every curl back again
To those sunset walks
That special summer and those all night talks"

Nameless faces play their game

The midnight gamblers place their bets
The tight-rope walkers check their nets
Then comes the queen of broken hearts
This is the way it always starts

Finders find love for the evening
Keepers keep the love they've found
Losers lose and wind up weeping
But it's the only game in town

All hail the third string debutante
She tries to act so nonchalant
Chasin' the prince of alibis
Into a smokescreen made of lies

Finders find love for the evening
Keepers keep the love they've found
Losers lose and wind up weeping
But it's the only game in town

My window looks down on the set
Each night the players strut and fret
So if you'd like to join the rest
Just choose the part that suits you best

Anything you ask is everything i've got
I can't let go
It's all you need
It's all i know

Tiny little girl wakens in the night
Was it just a dream, will she be alright
It's hard to say
There's so much more
Beyond her door

Hidden in the heart buried in the soul
Everybody's wondering if where they are going, they're going alone
Carried on the wind
Up above the stars alone
A spark from a fire ignited a long time ago

Every single moment
Every waking hour
I can see your beauty
Like an open flower
Just like a flower

Won't you come back, come back to me
Won't you come back, come back to me
There with your head in your hands
I sware that you don't understand
That you and i were meant to be

I can feel you breathing
As you lay beside me
Nothing but a memory
That you can't deny me
You can't deny me

But you know there's hope for you, for you

Everywhere I look I see your face
Every step I take seems out of place
You got to be a man to run the race
I'm not a hopeless man
How can you say I am"

Snow is falling
Evening calling
On knees, a calling friends
Can't you see
Doesn't help to be
The end

Strolling through lost times with you
What were we thinking of
Could it be they jumped the queue
In the winter of our love

Baby, we should've known
Where we were going
Should've known
Where we were going
We're in the sea of destiny
In the winter of our love

Do you know we're alone out here
What am I thinkin' of
Did this come to the time of year
Called the winter of our love

Baby, we should've known
Where we were going
We should've known
Where we were going
We're in the sea of destiny
In the winter of our love

Oh, I needed you so
Ah, you know, I never, never want to let you go"

Winter's come and gone

Now I'm here home with you (I'm here home with you)
I do all the things that you do

I never know if my feet touch the ground
But oh, baby, I know you're right

Since I've held you in these arms of mine

With that old suitcase in hand and a surefire plan gone over
This time it will work it can't go wrong
Cause I've got all of our dreams mixed up with my schemes
Rollin' around in my mind
I know the sun's gonna shine
Shine on me this time

In a week or two
I'll be writing to you with good news
And I can just see your smile as you read about all that I've done
Cause I've got all of our plans right here in my hands
And things are gonna work out just fine
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine
Shine on me this time

I've seen uncertainty and fear
Keep on lookin' for tomorrow

And feeling out the town and the country

Up on the hill I got a better look
I watched the river run brown (watched the river run brown)
And then I heard those songbirds singing
The country sound

And turned the television on (turned the tv on)

Being alone with you

With the snow in your hair
A crystal halo you wear
While the chill winter air streams through
Amid the birch and the oak
Smell the fireplace smoke
And the warmth we will go home to

So unsure of my direction
I would follow where my friends and family would lead

Sparked by inspiration
I was scarred by the pain
Of constant departures
I was wounded severely
At an early age
But my hopes hung high
On the thought of the future
I was happy to watch

The time go by
Eye to eye
Watching the time go by
Watching the time go by
Day for night
Watching the time go by

And then the world changed
There was hope in the distance
Til it raced up around us
And proceeded to shine
Like the moonlight
Full of reckless abandon
We would reach for the stars
'Cause there was room at the top
And food on the table
We were doing quite well
At such an early stage
There was no need to stop
Nor were we able
And no one could see

The time go by
Eye to eye
Watching the time go by
Watching the time go by
Day for night
Watching the time go by

There are moments I regret more than the rest
There are days I can't recall at all
Looking back now, there's not much that I would change

Diesel trucks are flying by on the shore
Yes that's your spirit inside you just waiting
It's time to move, now that much you must know

Step outside and take a breath of the morning (step outside the door)
And the wind will tell you which way to go
You are the needle on the compass for certain
The missing map has come back to your door

Uma razão
Para não ficarmos sós
E nesse abraço forte
Sentir o mar,
Na nossa voz,
Chorar como quem sonha
Sempre navegar
Nas velas rubras deste amor
Ao longe a barca louca perde o norte.
Ammore mio
Si nun ce stess'o mare e tu
Nun ce stesse manch'io
Ammore mio
L'ammore esiste quanno nuje
Stamme vicino a Dio
Ammore

No teu olhar
Um espelho de água
A vida a navegar
Por entre sonho e a mágoa
Sem um adeus sequer.
E mansamente,
Talvez no mar,
Eu veita em espuma encontre o sol do
Teu olhar,
Voga ao de leve, meu amor
Ao longe a barca nua a lodo a pano.

Ammore mio
Si nun ce stess'o mare e tu
Nun ce stesse manch'io

L'ammore esiste quanno nuje

Andrea Bocelli,A Mio Padre,/a/andrea+bocelli/a+mio+padre_20007804.html,"Caro Babbo,
Inutile discutere
D'accordo non saremo mai
Che cosa c'e di strano in cio
Trent'anni ci separano
O forse
C'e il timore in te
Di non trovare piu la forza
D'essere al mio fianco
Se gli ostacoli mi fermano.

Non preoccuparti, ascoltami
Avro problemi
Affronto infami ma
Niente mi spaventera'
Niente mi corrompera'
Niente al mondo
Mi fara scordare che
Posso vincere
E voglio farcela da me.
E voglio farcela da me.

So bene che per te e difficile
Giustificare
Questa smania di combattere
Osare l'impossibile....lo so

Ti sembrera incredibile
Ma piu ci penso piu m'accorgo che
Assomiglio proprio a te
E non sai come vorrei
Che la forza non ti abbandonasse mai
Per averti qui
E non arrendermi
Mai

Ciao Babbo,
A presto.

------------------------
Dear Father,
It's useless to argue
We'll never agree
There's nothing strange with that
Thirty years separate us
Or maybe
You are afraid
Not to find the strength
To stand by my side
If the obstacles should stop me

Don't worry, listen to me
I may have problems
I may face infamous people but
Nothing shall scare me
Nothing shall corrupt me
Nothing in the world
Will make me forget that
I can win
And I want to make it on my own.
And I want to make it on my own.

I know it's difficult for you
To justify
Such a restless impatience to fight
To dare the impossible

You'll find it incredible
But the more I think about it the more I realize
I am really like you
And you don't know how I wish
That your strength will never leave you
To have you next to me
And never surrender
Never.

Goodbye Father,
See you soon."

dall'arse erbe,
dall'imo dei franti sepolcreti
odorosi di timo,

di minuscoli amori
e perfidi consigli
che ammolliscono i cuori.
Fiorite, o campi immensi,
palpitate, aure marine,
aure marine nel lunare albor,

On the caress of your dreams,
Your hopes and then,
Turn towards the day that will be
There is a finish line there.

Like stars across the sky
And in order to shine
You will have to win
Like stars across the sky

Don't give up
Someone is with you

Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
And in order to shine
You will have to win"
Andrea Bocelli,Bellissime Stelle,/a/andrea+bocelli/bellissime+stelle_20697191.html,"Verrai, verrai, dovunque arriverai
Sei pioggia che gonfia le fontane.
Cadrai, cadrai, sul fondo scenderai
Nell'anima che scalda gli occhi miei
E ancora ti vorrei.

E di notte andar via
Fra I pensieri lass?
Mentre introrno a noi
Bellissime stelle.

Verrai, verrai, dovunque tu sarai
Nel vento che smuove le campane.
Quaggi?, quaggi?
Tra fango e nuvole
Nel tempo che rallenta I passi miei vicino ti vorrei.

Ogni notte andar via
Fino ai sogni lass?
Perse intorno a noi bellissime stelle.

Ti nascondi e vai via
Tra le ombre laggi?
Stese intorno a noi
Bellissime stelle...

.. E ancora ti vorrei, ti vorrei...

E ogni giorno che avr?,
Ogni attimo in pi?,
Cercher? Per te bellissime stelle.

Cercher?, cercher? Per te, trover? Per te bellissime stelle.

Le bellissime stelle lass? Per te.

I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
And when those blue melodies start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white, 
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

Decorations of red on a green Christmastree
Won't be the same, if you're not here with me

Libiamo, libiamo ne'lieti calici
Che la belleza infiora.
E la fuggevol ora s'inebrii
A voluttà.
Libiamo ne'dolci fremiti
Che suscita l'amore,
Poiché quell'ochio al core omnipotente va.
Libiamo, amore fra i calici
Più caldi baci avrà.

Tra voi tra voi saprò dividere
Il tempo mio giocondo;
Tutto è follia nel mondo ciò
Che non è piacer.
Godiam, fugace e rapido
E'il gaudio dell'amore,
E'un flor che nasce e muore,
Ne più si può goder.
Godiam c'invita un fervido
Accento lusighier.

(Godiamo, la tazza e il cantico
La notte abbella e il riso;
In questo paradiso ne sopra il nuovo dì.)

La vita è nel tripudio
Quando non s'ami ancora.
Nol dite a chi l'ignora,
E' il mio destin così ...

And the night is already far away
Already, far away

Look at this world
Spinning with us
Even in the dark
Look at this world
Spinning for us
Giving us hope and some
Sun, sun sun

My love, you are you my love
I hear your voice,
And I listen to the sea.
It sounds just like your breathing
And all the love you want to give me
This love
That is there, hidden
Hidden among the waves
All the waves in the world
Just like a boat that....

Look at this world
Spinning with us
Even in the dark
Look at this world
Spinning for us
Giving us hope,
And some sun, sun, sun,
Some sun, sun, sun.

Andrea Bocelli,Canzoni Stonate,/a/andrea+bocelli/canzoni+stonate_20520318.html,"Featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica and vocals
(Mogol / Aldo Donati)

Canto solamente insieme a pochi amici
Quando ci troviamo a casa
E abbiam bevuto
Non pensare che ti abbiam dimenticato
Proprio ieri sera
Parlavamo di te

Camminando verso casa mi
Sei tornata in mente
A letto mi son girato
E non ho ditto niente
E ho ripensato alla tua voce
Così fresca e strana
Che dava al nostro gruppo qualcosa di più

Enrico che suona,
Sua moglie fa il coro
Giovanni come sempre ascolta
Stonato com'è

Canzoni d'amore
Che fanno ancora bene al cuore
Noi stanchi ma contenti
Se chiudi gli occhi forse
Tu ci senti anche da lì

L'altra domenica siamo andati al lago
Ho preso anche un luccio grande
Che sembrava un drago
Poi a sera in treno
Abbiam cantato piano
Quell pezzo Americano
Che cantavi tu

Canzoni stonate
Parole sempre un po'sbagliate
Ricordi quante serate
Passate così

Se chiudi gli occhi forse
Tu ci senti anche da lì
Canzoni d'amore
Che fanno ancora bene al cuore
Diciamo quasi sempre
Qualche volta no qualche volta no

Canzoni stonate
Parole sempre un po'sbagliate
Ricordi quante serate
Passate così

English translation:
Songs Out Of Tune

I'm singing together with a few friends
When we find ourselves at home
Having a drink
Not realizing that we've forgotten you
Just yesterday evening
We were talking about you

As I walked toward the house,
You came to mind
In bed I turned over
And said nothing
And I recalled in your voice
Something fresh and strange
That gave our group something extra

Enrico - who sounds like his wife -
Sings along
Giovanni as always hears
It out of tune - as it is

Songs of love
That still make your heart feel good
We're tired but happy
If you close your eyes
You might hear us even from there

The other Sunday we went to the lake
I even caught a huge pike -
It looked like a dragon -
Then in the evening
We sang quietly on the train
That American piece
That you were singing

Songs out of tune,
The words always a little wrong
You remember so many evenings
Spent this way

If you close your eyes
You might hear us even from there
Songs of love
That still make your heart feel good
We almost always talk
Sometimes not, sometimes not

Songs out of tune
The words always a little wrong
You remember so many evenings"
Andrea Bocelli,Caruso,/a/andrea+bocelli/caruso_20007817.html,"Qui dove il mare luccica,
E tira forte il vento
Sulla vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce,
E ricomincia il canto

Ti voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
è una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai...

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare,
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica
Senti il dolore nella musica,
E si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire
Da una nuvola,
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza,
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Ti voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
è una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai...

Potenza della lirica,
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la
Mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano,
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole,
Confondono I pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo,
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita,
Come la bianca scia di un'elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce,
Ma lui non ci penso poi tanto
Anzi, si sentiva già felice,
E ricominciò il suo canto

Ti voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
è una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai...

Ti voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
è una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai..."

Se vuoi, ti accompagno se vuoi la scusa piu banale per rimanere soli io e te e poi gettare via I perche amarti come sei la prima volta e l'utima.
Champagne per un dolce segreto per noi un amore proibito ormai resta solo un bicchiere ed un ricordo da gettare via.

Slowly you come to me
Right into my heart
Tell me my love, what do you see there?

The snow has all but melted
My love, I think you know
It's been such a long way
To reach you
A steep, but worthwhile climb
But it makes me feel alive
Only you can set my soul free

A soul which is lost after you
And lost when you're not here
To reach just a part of you
Gives momentum to my song
And this for me is life
A life, together, with you
A life without the ""if""
A life, slowly learning to fly again,
Together with you

The snow has all but melted
My love, and it's thanks to you
And as it melts, like you,
It flows into me
Flows, just like a river
And just like a river
You effortlessly carry my soul

A soul which has opened up for you
Without the ""if""
It will light up the colours
In your eyes
There will never be snow again
It will climb and climb until
It will open up with you."

Y no existe nadie
Que pueda alejarme
De lo que yo siento por ti

Buscarte flores
Que no podré ofrecerte
Ningún regalo

Dicen que yo he sufrido
De mal de amores
Y que mi corazón
No se ha curado

La mia ragazza sa che non è vero
La mia ragazza sa che quando

Quando m'innamoro
Io do tutto il bene
A chi è immamorato di me
E non c'è nessuno
Che mi può cambiare
Che mi può staccare da lei

When I'm In Love

When I fall in love
I give my whole life
To the one who falls in love with me
And there's no one
Who with the power to dispel
What I feel for you

They say that I won't know
To look for flowers for you
That I won't be able to offer
Any gift

They say that I have suffered
Of bad loves
And that my heart
Has not healed yet

My girlfriend knows that it's not true
My girlfriend knows that when -

When I'm in love
I give everything good
To the one who's in love with me
And there's no one
Who can change me
Who can take me from her

Volaron già tre lune
Dacché la mia Violetta
Agi per me lasciò, dovizie, amori
E le pompose feste,
Ov'agli omaggi avvezza,
Vedea schiavo ciascun di sua bellezza.
Ed or contenta in questi ameni luoghi
Tutto scorda per me.
Qui presso a lei io rinascer mi sento,
E dal soffio d'amor rigenerato
Scordo ne'gaudi suoi tutto il passato.

De' miei bollenti spiriti
Il giovanile ardore
Ella temprò col placido
Sorriso dell'amor, dell'amor!

Dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.

With Love You Never Know

Speak to my heart, tell it that you know
Of my pains that never sleep
Speak to me, oh star,
And tell me if she will come

I look for love and I want it to come true
She that smiles, passing my way

Ah, it's so difficult to explain
But you friendly star
Tell me if the love will remain...

With love you never know
When it comes or if it goes
With love you never know
When it will be there
Or from where it will arrive

Sister star of my dreams
Still speaks to me until the morning
Tell me if it is true
That she exists

Ah indeed, it is difficult to hope
But you, always and
Only you tell me the truth...

With love you never know
When it comes or if it goes
With love you never know
When love arrives,
Everything changes, all around
It shines in the night"

Die des Himmels hehre Wonne
Tauschen mit der Erdensonne.

Daß, wo bang ein Herz in Sorgen
Schmachtet vor der Welt verborgen,
Daß, wo still es will verbluten,
Und vergehn in Tränenfluten,

Daß, wo brünstig sein Gebet
Einzig um Erlösung fleht,
Da der Engel niederschwebt,
Und es sanft gen Himmel hebt.

Und auf leuchtendem Gefieder
Führt er ferne jedem Schmerz,"

Text by: S.Cirillo
Music by: J.Amoruso - S. Cirillo

How narrow this street is,
The people do not fit in,
They form a procession
That progresses very slowly.
No one has died,
It is nobody's saint,
You cannot hear a voice,
No bell tolls.
Meanwhile the heart waits
For the fountain to play.

And it rains on childrens' heads,
I would like to capture
This moon with a rope
To take it with me far away,
To take it with me far away,
Where the sky is sky
And never darkens.

And it rains in nobody's land.
I would like to be in charge,
To sqeeze the pain
Into this bitter river
That has never met the sea
Because the sea is far away
And yet is near.

How long this road is,
Why does it never end;
It loses itself among the stones,
In the middle of maps,
Under the grass of the wall
Which climbs and swears
And curses during the day
And in the evening without sustenance.
Meanwhile the heart waits
For the fountains to play.

And it rains on childrens' heads,
I would like to capture
This moon with a rope
To take it with me far away,
To take it with me far away,
Where the sky is sky
And never darkens.

And it rains in nobody's land.
I would like to be in charge,
To sqeeze the pain
Into this bitter river
That has never met the sea
Because the sea is far away
And yet is near."

Impossibile, direi.

Anche un ritorno impossibile
Sembra possibile per me...

Where a rumor of crystal
Fountains in the garden
Seems to whisper to the roses.

Today the dry leaves without color
Which are swept by the wind
Are just reminders of the romance

In one sunset
In the breeze or in a flower
Waiting for your return.

Sei piena di un amore che a passato
Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Odio l'estate
Il sole che ogni giorno ci saldava
Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva
Addeso brucia solo con furor

Tornera un altro inverno
Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve copira tutte le cose
E forse un po di pace tornera

Odio l'estate
Che hai dato il tuo profumo ad ogni fiore
L'estate che hai creato il nostro amore
Per farmi poi morire di dolor

Tornera un altro inverno
Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve copira tutte le cose
E forse un po di pace tornera"

I thought sooner or later
The lights up above
Will come down in circles and guide me to love
But I don't know what's right for me
I cannot see straight
I've been here too long and I don't want to wait for it
Fly like a cannonball, straight to my soul
Tear me to pieces
And make me feel whole
I'm willing to fight for it and carry this weight
But with every step
I keep questioning what it's true

[Chorus: Matteo Bocelli]
Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

Presto una luce ti illuminerà
Seguila sempre, guidarti saprà
Tu non arrenderti, attento a non perderti
E il tuo passato avrà senso per te
Vorrei che credessi in te stesso, ma sì
In ogni passo che muoverai qui
È un viaggio infinito
Sorriderò se
Nel tempo che fugge mi porti con te

Fall on me
Ascoltami
Fall on me
Abbracciami
Fall on me
Finché vorrai
Finché vorrai
Finché vorrai

I can fly in my mind
To a place
Peaceful and full of grace
Come with me
You will see
Love is there to make us whole again
A love that only love knows

Go where love goes
Go where your heart leads
Angels are pleading with you
Go there
Go where love dares

Gather me in your arms
Hold me close like lazarus
To rise again like a bird
To fly again
In flowers dreams
So love can feed your soul
(love feeds your soul)
Love will make you whole
(love makes you whole)
So...

Go where love goes
Go where your heart leads
Angels are pleading with you
Go there
Go where love dares
To go

Love makes the rainbow
Love is the dawn's glow
Love makes the rose grow
Reaching for heaven so...

Go where love goes
Go where your heart leads
Angels are pleading with you
Go there
Go where love dares

Dream how love dreams
Love feeds the dreamers
Angels are calling you
To go there"

Andrea Bocelli,I Love Rossini,/a/andrea+bocelli/i+love+rossini_20007809.html,"Solo, come fosse un'abitudine
Passo fuori al bar anche stasera
C'e nell'aria un'eco che solletica
Una voce che non sembra nuova
E anche se vicina ti nascondi sai perche
Perche tu stai parlando ancor di me
Tu non mi sai dementicar
Ad un'amica che non sa
Tu stai parlando del mio cuor
In tutto il bar aroma di caffe
E risuona al banco dei gelati
La tua favola d'amore
La calunnia e un venticello perfido
Dissero il maestro e la sua penna
Tu hai creduto vere tante chiacchiere
Ma per me non c'era alcun motivo
Di prestare credito all'invidia sospettosa
E tu stai li che parli ancor di me
Tu non saprai dimenticar
Il mio inglese incerto che
Ti ha conquistata in questo bar
Quanti caffe hai bevuto insieme a me
Io ti dissi I love Rossini
Lei conosce l'opera Italiana
Qui davanti al banco dei gelati io
Mostro alla tua amica il mio amore
Diteglielo voi alla mia bella
Che vi seide accanto indifferent
Che se l'opera non basta
Ci sara un'altra canzone
Mentre stai parlando ancor di me
Tu non mi sai dementicar
Io sto cantando ancor di te
Perche io non ti so scordar

------------------------------

Alone, as if by force of habit
Even tonight, I stop by the bar
An echo, taunting me, fills the air
It's a voice, a voice that's all too familiar
It's you, so close, but you hide
Because you're still talking about me
Could it be you cannot forget me
To a friend that knows nothing of me
You're talking of my heart
And the bar, it smells of coffee
You can hear you love story
At the ice cream counter
Slander is a wicked wind
Said the writer with his pen
But you believed it to be true
While for me there was no reason
To give credence to suspicious envy.
Yet even now, your're still talking about me
Could it be you cannot forget me
My faltering command of english
That won your love right here
And countless coffees we shared together
I told you ""I Love Rossini,
You know, the Italian opera""
Right here, by the ice cream counter
Now I'm explaining this love to your friend
I plead, tell this to my love
She sits there, uncaring, at your side
Tell her if the opera isn't enough,
There will be another song
While you are talking about me
Then surely, you haven't forgotten
And I'm still singing about you
Because I know I can't forget you"

Sento le tue parole come piccoli fuochi
Accesi in fondo al mio cuore
Dentro la vita mia una musica suona
Una nuova poesia nel ricordo di te

Oceani immensi di libertà giorni di festa che non scorderò
Il freddo inverno non ti porta via
Dalla mia vita
I desideri le nostalgie quanti misteri questo amore mio
Prigioniero del tempo chiuso nella memoria
No ho mai più sentito il profumo infinito di una rosa al mattino
Questa voce che ho dentro parla solo di noi come un dolce tormento questo sogno
Lontano non mi fa più dormire
None e un canto di addio ma una musica dolce
Un orchestra che io suono solo per te

Oceani immensi ritoverò corpi celesti e terre d'Africa
Un altro sole ci riscalderà perdutamente voli infiniti sulle città
All'orizzonte solamente noi

It's you, and I'm guessing where you are

And plunges the theatre back into darkness

Più fa male più cresce l'amore
Di più . . . di più...
In canto
Io chiedo all'amore, quell'ombra nel cuore
Bagnala di sole
E il nuovo sorriso sarò solo io, io
E lei sarà la musica che canto
Così portrà amarmi ancora amando
Ed io potrò averla
E resterà per sempre
In canto
Rosa tradita, rosa calpestata
Ti strapperò dal cuore la paura
E insieme a me ti sentirai sicura
Di più . . . di più...
In canto
Io chiedo all'amore, quell'ombra nel cuore
Bagnala di sole
E il nuovo sorriso sarò solo io, io
E lei sarà la musica che canto
Così portrà amarmi ancora amando
Ed io potrò tenerla
E resterà per sempre
In canto.

In Song

Rose of autumn, discolored rose
Blighted rose, ill-used rose
What betrayal has left you thus unsure?
If I grasp your thorns in my hands
I can feel the strength of your pain;
The more it hurts the more love grows
More .... and more .....
In song,
I ask of love - that shadow in my heart,
Oh bathe it in sunlight!
And I, I am alone in a different smile
And she will be the music that I sing,
And so she will love me, loving still,
And I will have her
And she will be forever
In song.
Rose betrayed, rose trodden underfoot
I will wrest the fear out of your heart
And by my side you will feel safe,
Ever more so ..... and more.
In song
I ask of love - that shadow on my heart,
Oh bathe it in sunlight!
And I, I am alone in a different smile
And she will be the music that I sing,
And so she will love me, loving still,
And I will have her
And she will be forever"

Ingemisco tamquam reus,
Culpa rubet vultus meus,

Qui Mariam absolvisti
Et latronem exaudisti,

Preces meae non sunt dignae;
Sed tu bonus fac benigne
Ne perenni cremer igne.

Júrame
Que aunque pase mucho tiempo
Nunca olvidaré el momento
En que yo te conocí

Que el cariño que te dí

Con un beso enamorado
Como nadie me ha besado
Desde el día en que nací

Quiéreme
Quiéreme hasta la locura
Así sabrás la amargura
Que estoy sufriendo por ti

Todos dicen que es mentira que te quiero
Porque nunca me habian visto
Enamorado
Yo te juro que yo mismo no comprendo
El porqué de tu mirar me ha
Cautivado

Cuando estoy cerca de ti
Ya estoy contento
No quisiera que de nadie te acordaras
Tengo cellos hasta de mi pensamiento
Que purda recordarte

Promise Me

Promise me,
That although much time may pass
You'll never forget the moment
When I first met you.

Look at me,
'cause there's nothing more profound
Nor bigger in this world
Than the love I gave to you.

Kiss me,
With a kiss so full of love
Like no one has ever kissed me
Since the day that I was born.

Love me,
Love me until you feel the madness
And understand the bitter pain
That I am suffering for you.

They all say it's a lie that I love you
'cause they've never seen me so in love
I swear to you that I don't know why
The look in your eyes has kept me captive.

When you are near me
And I am happy
I wish that you'd remember no one else
I am jealous even of my thoughts
That may remind you
Of another person you once loved.

Promise me
That although much time may pass
You will not forget the moment
When I first met you.

Look at me,
'cause there's nothing more profound
Nor bigger in this world
Than the love I gave to you.

Kiss me,
With a kiss so full of love
Like no one has ever kissed me
Since the day that I was born.

Love me,

Tu, per quello che mi dai
Quell'emozione in più
Ad ogni tua parola

Tu, probabilmente, tu
Sei stata fino a qui
Per troppo tempo sola,
Fino a convincerti, come me
Che si può stare da soli.

Perché, la solitudine
Che non sorride mai
Diventa l'abitudine
E non la scelta che tu fai

Ma ora che son qui
Il vento cambierà
E semberà più facile
Il tempo che verrà

La vita può soprenderti
In tutto quel che fa
E dove non lo immagini
Incontri la felicità

E sono qui con te
E non ti lascerò
Ti chiedo di fermarti qui
E stare insieme a te
E stare insieme a te

Sì, adesso ci sei tu
Nei sogni e nelle idee
Nell'immaginazione...
Tu, che sei vicino a me,
Così vicino a me
Che sei parte di me
Cosi dentro di te
Come una sensasione
Sei le parole e la musica
Per una nuova canzone...

Perché la solitudine
Non si riprenderà
La voglia di sorridere
Ora no...
E la felicità
Se ci sei...
Per quello che tu sai
Fe lo sai...
Per quello che mi dai
Anche tu...
Per un amore semplice
Ma grande più che mai

E non è un'abitudine
Il bene che mi fai
Anche tu
E l'allegria di viverti
Finchè vuoi...
Di averti accanto più che mai!

E adesso siamo noi
Io e te
Ci siamo solo noi
Solo noi

Sicuri di non perderci
Di non lasciarci mai...
Un'altra solitudine
Non ci riprenderà
E tu non te ne andrai..."

L'alba sepàra dalla luce l'ombra,
E la mia voluttà dal mio desire.
O dolce stelle, è l'ora di morire.
Un più divino amor dal ciel vi sgombra.

Pupille ardenti, O voi senza ritorno
Stelle tristi, spegnetevi incorrotte!
Morir debbo. Veder non voglio il giorno,
Per amor del mio sogno e della notte.

Chiudimi,
O Notte, nel tuo sen materno,
Mentre la terra pallida s'irrora.
Ma che dal sangue mio nasca l'aurora
E dal sogno mio breve il sole eterno!
E dal sogno mio breve il sole eterno!

Translation:

The dawn divides the darkness from light,
And my sensual pleasure from my desire,
O sweet stars, it is the hour of death.
A love more holy clears you from the skies.

Gleaming eyes, O you who'll ne'er return,
Sad stars, snuff out your uncorrupted light!
I must die, I do not want to see the day,
For love of my own dream and of the night.

Envelop me,
O Night, in your maternal breast,
While the pale earth bathes itself in dew;
But let the dawn rise from my blood
And from my brief dream the eternal sun!"

Tu da sempre come un canto
Sciogli la malinconia
Dai sorriso al sole spento
Sai guarire la realtà
Ecco perchè canto di te
Quasi d'amore

A metà di un sentimento
Tu da quale parte stai
Forse cento forse un giorno
Tutto o niente poco importa sai
Ecco perchè nascono in te
Nespoli rosa
Da parte mia che vuoi che sia l'attesa

E parlami dal cuore
Io ti proteggerò
Somigli al nuovo amore

Potrei morirne anche per un po'
Per poi recominciare
Parlami ancora di te
Consuma il tempo
Comunque sia l'anima
è qui nel tuo cielo
E parlami dal cuore

Sei il mio filo appeso al vento
Sei quell sogno che non c'è
Sei il mio nuovo, sei il momento
Sei quell'aria che non sei

Cercami in te come se in me
Fossi sospesa
Da parte mia che vuoi che sia l'attesa
E parlami dal cuore
Io ti proteggerò
Somigli al nuovo amore

Potrei morirne anche per un po'

Voglio vivere di ... Te

The Wait

You, always as a song
You melt melancholy
You smile to the extinguished sun
You know how to recover the truth
Here's why I sing of you
Nearly of love

Half of a feeling
Which part are you
Perhaps hundreds, perhaps a day
All or nothing, it matters little, you know
Here's why pink medlars are born in you
As far as I'm concerned, what you want is the wait

And it speaks me from the heart
I protect you
Like a new love

I could also die for a while
In order then to recommence
Speak to me about yourself
Consume the time
However it is the spirit,
It is here in your sky
And speaks me from the heart

You are my hung thread to the virtue
You are the dream that it not there
You are new to me, you are the moment
You are the air that you are not.

Look for me in you as if in me you are suspended
As far as I'm concerned, it's what you want that is the wait
And it speaks me from the heart
I protect you like a new love

I could also die for a while
In order then to recommence
Speak to me about yourself
Consume the time
However it is the spirit,
It is here in your sky
And speaks me from the heart
Because to give sense to the senses"
Andrea Bocelli,L'incontro,/a/andrea+bocelli/lincontro_20240284.html,"Francesco Sartori / Andrea Bocelli / Alessio Bonomo - Poem by Andrea Bocelli

Mentre, come un gigante, fra le braccia
Fiero e felice stringo il mio piccino
E il corpicino tenero, innocente,
Fragile e vivo come un uccellino
Contro il mio petto preme,
Abbandonato, quieto e sicuro
Mezzo addormentato, per qualche
Istante, quasi dolcemente
M'appare come in sogno il mio destino.
Così mi vedo vecchio e rassegnato
Seduto là, nel canto del camino
Ad aspettar con l'ansia
D'un bambino, la sera
Per vederlo all'improvviso
Rientrare con il dono d'un sorriso
D'una parola, d'una gentilezza
È come una promessa che consola
La gioia immensa di una sua carezza
Poi mi riscuoto e
Già ho dimenticato
Ma dentro di me, l'anima rapita
M'avverte che quel bimbo appena nato
Già vale più della mia stessa vita.

... E restai davanti a lui per un po'
E ascoltai nell'aria poi l'afferai
Lui aprì la mano e poi
Mi toccò il naso sfiorò la bocca

Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Intorno a noi ogni cosa poi fiorì

E restai davanti a lui per un po'
E fu li che il tempo ci ritrovò

Lui aprì la mano e poi mi toccò il naso
Ed io sorrisi

Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più
Intorno a noi ogni cosa poi fiorì

Il mondo è un puntino di luce blu
Che gira e va con
Il soffio degli angeli

Io l'abbracciai ed il mondo girò di più

Che gira e va con
Il soffio degli angeli"

M'han detto che domani,
Nina, vi fate sposa,
Ed io vi canto ancor la serenata!

Là, nei deserti piani,
Là, ne la valle ombrosa,
Oh quante volte a voi l'ho ricantata!
Oh quante volte a voi l'ho ricantata!

""Foglia di rosa, o fiore d'amaranto,
Se ti fai sposa,
Io ti sto sempre accanto.
Se ti fai sposa,
Io ti sto sempre accanto. ""
Foglia di rosa.

Domani avrete intorno
Feste sorrisi e fiori,
Nè penserete ai nostri vecchi amori.

Ma sempre, notte e giorno,
Piena di passione,
Verrà gemendo a voi la mia canzone:
Verrà gemendo la mia canzone:

""Foglia di menta, o fiore di granato,
Nina, rammenta I baci che t'ho dato!
Nina, rammenta I baci che t'ho dato! ""
Foglia di menta!
La... La... La...

The Last Song

M'han said that tomorrow,
Nina, you are destined a bride,
And I am still singing you a serenade!

There, in deserted plans,
There, they go to obscurity,
Oh how many times to you I have ricantata!
Oh how many times to you I have ricantata!

""Leaf of rose, or amaranth flower,
If you are a bride,
I am always near you.
If you are a bride,
I am always near you. ""
Leaf of rose.

Tomorrow you will have around
Festivities smiles and flowers,
Neither of us will think about our old loves.

But always, night and day,
A flood of passion,
My song will come moaning to you:
My song will come moaning:

""Leaf of mint, or flower of pomegranate,
Nina, remember the kisses that I gave you!
Nina, remember the kisses that I gave you! """

Je me prenais à te maudire,
À te détester, à me dire :
Pourquoi faut-il que le destin
L'ait mise là sur mon chemin?
Puis je m'accusais de blasphème,
Et je ne sentais en moi-même,
Je ne sentais qu'un seul désir,
Un seul désir, un seul espoir:
Te revoir, ô Carmen, ou,
Te revoir!
Car tu n'avais eu qu'à paraître,
Qu'a jeter un regard sur moin
Pour t'emperer de tout mon être,
Ô ma Carmen!
Et j'étais une chose à toi"

Ed aspetter? Il tramonto,
Deve pur passare il vento,

Dove nascono le parole,

Te le voglio riportare.
Non? Giusto che una donna
Per paura di sbagliare
Non si possa innamorare,
E si deve accontentarev
Di una storia sempre uguale,
Di una vita da sognare.

Che in un mare di parole
E fra tanta confusione
Spera ancora in un amore.

Your words

Music by: J. Amoruso - S. Cirillo

Where the sun goes to die,
Where the wind rests,
There are all the words
Of those who have been in love
And have not forgotten
All that there has been.
And I shall wait for the sunset,
Some time the wind must pass.
I shall let myself be carried
Where the words are born.
I shall look for your words,
I want to bring them back to you.
It is not right that a woman
For fear of making a mistake
Cannot fall in love
And has to content herself
With a story which is always the same
Of a life to be dreamed.

Where the sun goes to die,
Where the wind rests,
I have met many people
Who, in a sea of words
And amid utter confusion,
Still hope for a love.
It is not right that a woman
For fear of making a mistake
Cannot fall in love
And has to content herself
With a story which is always the same
Of a life to be forgotten,"

Esso è risorto.

Per sempre!

Cambia metro.
Dei pazzi è l'amor tetro che
Lacrime distilla. Se non ride
E sfavilla, l'amore è fiacco e rocco.
Tu sei geloso.

Imbevuto di pregiudizi,
Noioso, cocciuto.

E colpa di certe città poca memoria
Con il cielo riflesso sul mare
Ed il vento che spazza la storia...
E tu dimenticato così come un uomo che fu,
Senza gloria e senza memoria
Ma il tuo canto è ancora nell'aria.

Le barche, le vele, le onde,
Le navi di questa città
Ora cantano tutte insieme
Le tue melodie nel mondo.
E' alta nel cielo la musica che ci hai dato tu
E nessuno può cancellare
E mai più dimenticare... adesso...

Corri verso il mare
Sentirai cantare
Questa musica dolce che non morirà mai
E ancora...la tua forza e il mare
Libero senza catene

Quel segreto che tenevi con te,
Una donna, un amore,
Quante lettere scritte per lei,
Per non morire.
Una voce, due occhi grandi
Nascosti nel cuore...
Sotto un limpido cielo toscano
Tanta voglia di sognare.

Storie, passione e dolore
Mascagni vive tra di noi.
La luna sparisce dietro alle nubi
E un uomo canta dalla prua
Negli occhi l'equatore,
Grande sogno dei marinai
E la scogliera già svanita
Si alzano le vele della vita... e adesso...

Corri verso il mare
Sentirai cantare

Di già con le rosee sue dita
Carezza de' fiori lo stuol!
Commosso da un fremito arcano
Intorno il creato già par;
E tu non ti desti, ed invano
Mi sto qui dolente a cantar.

Metti anche tu la veste bianca
E schiudi l'uscio al tuo cantor!

Ove tu sei nasce l'amor.

Morning Serenade

Dawn, dressed in white,
Already opens the door to broad daylight;
Already, with her rosy fingers,
She caresses the multitude of flowers!
All around, creation seems stirred
By a mysterious shiver;
And you do not awaken; and in vain
I stay here, aching to sing.

Put on your white dress too,
And open the door to your minstrel!
Where you are not, sunlight is missing;
Where you are love dawns.

All around, creation seems stirred
By a mysterious shiver;
And you do not awaken; and in vain
I stay here, aching to sing.

La stanchezza addosso che non
Va più via
Come l'ombra di qualcosa
Ancora mia.

Mi manchi

E in quell sorriso un pò incosciente
Nelle scuse di quei tuoi probabilmente
Sei quell nodo in gola
Che non scende giù
E tu e tu

Posso far finta di star bene ma mi manchi
Ora capisco che vuol dire
Averti accanto prima di dormire
Mentre cammino a piedi nudi
Dentro l'anima

Mi manchi e potrei
Cercarmi un'altra donna
Ma m'ingannerci
Sei il mio rimorso senza fine
Il freddo delle mie mattine
Quando mi guardo intorno
E sento che mi manchi

Ora che io posso darti un pò di più
E tu e tu

I Miss You

I miss you -
When the sun touches the horizon
When darkness covers the sounds
Of the people,
The listlessness no longer
Goes away
Like the shadow of something
That's still mine

I miss you -
In your look
In that thoughtless smile
In those excuses of yours,
You're the lump in my throat
That doesn't go away
It's you, it's you

I miss you, I miss you
I can pretend to be okay but I miss you
Now I know what I need to say -
To have you near before going to sleep
While I stand undisguised
Within my soul

I miss you and I could
Find another woman
But I'd be cheating myself
You're my regret without an end and
The chill of my mornings,
When I look inside myself
And know that I miss you.

Now that I can give you a little more -
It's you, it's you

I miss you and I could
Have another woman
But I'd only be cheating myself,
You're my regret without an end and
The chill of my mornings,
When I look inside myself"

Cresce la tua voce dentro me
Siedo al piano e libero il mio peso
Cerco chi non c'è
Dentro ai miei perché

Ma non ho più cuore
Quello che ora c'è
È pura noia, miele impuro
Senza te

Anche la luna sbanda lassù
Specchio della città
In un tempo senza età
E stento a vivere
Muore solo ciò che fiorirà
Di nuovo quando poi è primavera
Ora quel che so
Io non lo so

Mi perdo in te
E bevo l'amore in cui annego
È miele impuro
Senza te

E vive solo ciò che fiorirà
Sei sogno, corpo puro che non pesa
Sempre un po' di più
Accanto a me
E vivo in te
È miele puro

Io mi salverò
Sei la mia preghiera
Ed io risalgo fino a te"

But I toast life!
What a mystery my life is
What a mystery!
I am a sinner from the year 80, 000
A liar!
But where am I, what am I doing
How do I live
I live in the soul of the world
Lost in the depths of life

Wretched, wretched me
But I toast life!

I am the saint who betrayed you
When you were alone
I live elsewhere and observe the world
From the sky
And I see the sea and the forests,
I see myself...
I live in the soul of the world
Lost in the depths of life!

Wretched, wretched me,
But I toast life!

If there is a night dark enough
To hide me, to hide me,
If there is a light, a hope
A magnificent sun that shines
Inside of me
Give me the joy to live
That is not yet there.

Wretched, wretched me
That joy to live
That perhaps, is not yet there."

De noche nos pasábamos las horas
Hablando de mil cosas por hacer
Y a veces en pequeñas discusiones
Llegaba a amanecer.

Y siempre amanecia con un beso y tú,
Después me preparabas un café
Y yo me despedía cada día
Soñando con volver.

Parábamos el tiempo día a día
Quería descubrirte cada vez
Prendido de tu vida
Y tú prendida de la mía
El mundo parecía a nuestros pies.

Ya ves que todo pasa,
Quién diría
Ya ves que poco queda del ayer
Apenas los recuerdos
Momentos que no vuelven otra vez.

Te acuerdas de las veces que dijimos,
Que nada nos podría separar
El viento que escuchaba tus palabras
Cantaba tu cantar.

Y yo me cobijaba por tu cuerpo,
Y tu echabas los sentidos a volar
Perdidos en la noche y el silencio
Soñábamos soñar.

La vida se hace siempre de momentos,
De cosas que no sueles valorar
Y luego cuando pierdes
Cuando al fin te has dado cuenta
El tiempo no
Te deja regresar.

Ya ves que poco queda por contar
Apenas los recuerdos
Momentos que no vuelven nunca más.

At night we spent the hours
Speaking of thousand things to do
And sometimes the small discussions
Last till dawn arrives.

And always it came with a kiss and you,
Later prepared a coffee
For me and I left every day
Dreaming about returning.

We stopped time day by day
Wanted to discover every time
Of your life
And it seemed like you brought
The world to our feet.

Or you see that it all happen,
Who would say or you see that little
It is left of yesterday as soon as
The remembered moments do not
Return anymore.

You remember the times that we said,
That nothing could separate us
The wind that listened to your words
Sang your singing

And I sheltered myself with your body,
And you threw our senses to fly
Lost in the night and the silence
We dreamed to dream.

The life is always made of moments,
Of things that usually you do not value
And soon when you lose
When in the end it has occurred
You count the time that does not
Allow you to return.

Or you see all that happens,
Who would say
You see how little there is
To tell as soon as the remembered"

Forbidden Music

Underneath my balcony every evening
I hear a love-song,
Repeated several times
By a handsome young man
And it makes my heart beat faster.
O how sweet is that melody!
O how pretty, how I love to hear it!
My mother will not let me sing it,
I don't know why she would forbid me,
Now that she is out I am going to sing
The song that I found so exciting.
I'd like to kiss your raven hair,
Your lips and your solemn eyes;
I would want to die with you,
O heavenly angel,
My beautiful beloved, precious jewel.
Yesterday I saw him walking by,
And heard him sing as he always does:
I'd like to kiss your raven hair,
Your lips and your solemn eyes!
Clasp me, darling, clasp me to your heart,"
Andrea Bocelli,My Way,/a/andrea+bocelli/my+way_20697193.html,"And now, the end is here
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and ev'ry highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,
Oh no, oh no, not me, I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!"

It's just the secret of
Her greatness

That she alone can give

And that's how, now, it will always be
Until it becomes even more
You'll love her, oh how you'll love her
Because you trust yourself to her

And nothing can compare with her
There's really nothing to understand
That's just the way she is
All you'll know for sure
Is the more she makes you suffer
The more you find you love her

Until at last that dawning
That in the thrill she alone can give
Lies the secret of her eternity

To her
You'll gladly give
All that's left
Of the time you've still to come
To her
You're as one, with her, forever
And she'll be there, in your heart"

Nessun dorma! Nessun dorma!
Tu pure, o Principessa,
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
D'amore e di speranza!

Ma il mio mistero è chiuso in me,
Il nome mio nessun saprà
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò,
Quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Il nome suo nessun saprà
E noi dovrem, ahimè, morir, morir.

Dilegua, o notte! Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle! All'alba vincerò!"

Que a pesar de estar hoy aquí
Soy del pueblo, jamás lo podré olvidar
Debéis creerme
Mis lujos son solamente un disfraz
Un juego burgués, nada más
Las reglas del ceremonial

Tenía que aceptar, debí cambiar
Y dejar de vivir en lo gris
Siempre tras la ventana sin lugar bajo el sol
Busqué ser libre pero jamás dejaré de soñar
Y sólo podré conseguir la fe que querrás compartir

No llores por mí, Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
Mas no te alejes, te necesito

Jamás poderes ambicioné
Mentiras dijeron de mí
Mi lugar vuestro es, por vosotros luché
Yo sólo quiero sentiros muy cerca
Poder intentar abrir mi ventana
Y saber que nunca me vais a olvidar

No llores por mí, Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
Mas no te alejes (te necesito)

Qué más podré decir
Para convenceros de mi verdad
Si aún queréis dudar mira mis ojos ved
Cómo lloran de amor

Ricordi ancora il dì che c'incontrammo?
Le tue promesse le ricordi ancor?
Folle d'amore io ti seguii,
Ci amammo,
E accanto a te sognai,
Folle d'amor.
Sognai felice di carezze a baci
Una catena dileguante in ciel;
Ma le parole tue furon mendaci
Perché l'anima tua fatta è di gel.

Te ne ricordi ancor?
Te ne ricordi ancor?
Or la mia fede, il desiderio immenso
Il mio sogno d'amor non sei più tu
I tuoi baci non cerco,
A te non penso
Sogno un altro ideal:
Non t'amo più, non t'amo più!

Nei cari giorni che passamo insieme,
Io cosparsi di fiori il tuo sentier.
Tu fosti del mio cor l'unica speme,
Tu della mente l'unica pensier.
Tu m'hai visto pregare, impallidire,
Piangere tu m'hai visto inanzi a te.
Io, sol per appagare un tuo desire
Avrei dato il mio sangue e la mia fè.

Te ne ricordi ancor?
Te ne ricordi ancor?
Or la mia fede, il desiderio immenso
Il mio sogno d'amor non sei più tu
I tuoi baci non cerco,
A te non penso
Sogno un altro ideal:
Non t'amo più, non t'amo più!

I Don't Love You Anymore

Do you still remember the day we met?
Do you still remember your promises?
Madly in love I followed you,
We loved each other,
And next to you I dreamed,
Mad with love.
Happily I dreamed of a chain of caresses
And kisses fading into the sky;
But your words were false
Because your soul is made of ice.

Do you still remember?
Do you still remember?
Now my faith, my immense desire
My dream of love is no longer you
I don't long for your kisses,
I don't think of you
I dream of another ideal:
I love you no more, I love you no more!

In the dear days that we passed together,
I scattered your path with flowers.
You were the only hope of my heart,
You the only thought of my mind.
You have seen me praying, turning pale,
You have seen me crying before you.
Just to gratify your slightest desire
I would have given my blood and my faith.

Do you still remember?
Do you still remember?
Now my faith, my immense desire
My dream of love is no longer you
I don't long for your kisses,
I don't think of you
I dream of another ideal:"

Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth

Fall on your knees

O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by the light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men and from the Orient land
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend
Fall on your knees

Sur mon front morne où peut-être s'achève
Un songe noir qui trop longtemps dura,
Que ton regard comme un astre se lève...
Soudain mon rêve
Rayonnera!
Rayonnera!

Puis sur ma lèvre où voltige une flamme,
Éclair d'amour que Dieu même épura,
Pose un baiser, et d'ange deviens femme...
Soudain mon âme
S'éveillera!
S'éveillera!

Oh viens, comme à Pétrarque apparaissait Laura!

Oh! When I Sleep

Oh, when I sleep, approach my bed,
As Laura appeared to Petrach;
And when in passing, your breath touches me...
Suddenly my lips
Will part!

On my glum face, where perhaps is ending
A dark dream which lasted too long,
As your glance like a star arises...
Suddenly my dream
Will become radiant!

Then on my lips, where a flame is fluttering,
A flash of love that God has kept pure,
Place a kiss, and from an angel, become a woman...
Suddenly my soul
Will be awakened!"

For Us

For us
I thought of
So many things you don't know about
A different love like that....
So I never want to lose you...

Hot pearls on your face
Tears that I will gather -
You will smile
Amidst my fresh promises,
You will hear these words of mine,
Already honest.

The two of us like this, turning our backs on the world
Here facing a sunset,
You will listen to
The sound of life stretching away peacefully
And you will understand.

Dark summer storms
Remain a nonexistent memory
And I will hear
Sounds in the sunset, now
It's time to stay with you
Here and now,
Holding each other tight
Not to part again
If that is what you want.

For us,
You know,
From afar I caressed
A different love like that,
Still thinking of you.....
Softly you opened
Your coral lips on me
With your kisses.
Back turned on the world, like that
As it goes slowly by I know
I'll hear

Sounds in the sunset, now
It's time to stay beside you
And you'll understand
Holding each other tight
Not to part again
If that is what you want

For us
I would grow
A different love like that,
Inside me - here
I take everything that you are"

Tutt'e pace attuorno a me...

Fra sti bracce Maria vo' turna
Dorme 'o mare... Oje belle viene

Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un moment,
Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie.

J'ai tout quitté
Pour l'ingrate Sylvie.
Elle me quitte et prend un autre amant.

Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un moment,
Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie.

""Tant que cette eau coulera doucement
Vers ce ruisseau qui borde la prairie,
Je t'aimerai, "" me répétait Sylvie.
L'eau coule encor,
Elle a changé pourtant.

Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un moment,
Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie.

The Pleasure Of Love

Love's pleasure lasts but a moment
Love's sorrow lasts all throughout life.

I would have left everything
For faithless Sylvia,
But she left me and took another lover.

Love's pleasure lasts but a moment
Love's sorrow lasts all throughout life.

""As long as the water flows gently
To the stream that borders the meadow,
I will love you"", repeated Sylvia to me.
The water still flows,
But she has changed.

Love's pleasure lasts but a moment"

Calma la amargura

Que importa perderme
Mil veces la vida

Cuántos desengaños, por una cabeza
Yo juré mil veces no vuelvo a insistir
Pero si un mirar me hiere al pasar
Su boca de fuego, otra vez, quiero besar

Basta de carreras, se acabó la timba
Un final reñido ya no vuelvo a ver
Pero si algún pingo
Llega a ser fija el domingo
Yo me juego entero, qué le voy a hacer

Borra la tristeza
Calma la amargura

How Many Times Have I Searched For You

Afternoons beneath the sun
You held a flower in your mouth like me
In an hour it will be dusk.
I go home, what anguish -
Stay here with me.
I was the thief,
And you the fay
And you were life,
A great snowfall,
But you wept,
Eyes on the ground,
They rebuked you.
Marry me -
I promise you -
You promised -
Another flash of lightning;
It was war
God...
How many times have I searched for you
God....
How many times have I lost you
And I too am lost
How much of life has passed by
At night I used to dream of you,
I would awake -
It wasn't you
Life is but a dream -
A leaving or a return,
I don't know.
So many years in a second,
A flash of lightning and everything comes back, discounted
I don't know.
Trains, airplanes
Circling the globe -
How many times
My vagabond heart was lost.
I have been two or three times in heaven
I have walked heaven end to end
I know you don't believe me now
But...
God...
How many times have I searched for you
God....
How many times have I lost you
And I too am lost
How much of life has passed by
At night I used to dream of you,
I would awake -
It wasn't you.....

How many times I searched for you

How many times I lost you
And I too am lost

Is wish that
And watch us from above
Everyone finds love
We hope each soul will find
Around and inside
Another soul to love let this be our prayer
Let this be our prayer, just like every child need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so well be safe
Need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so well be safe la fede che
Hai acceso in noi,
Sento che ci salv
It's the faith
You light in us
I feel it will save us"
Andrea Bocelli,Musica è,/e/eros+ramazzotti/musica+e_20252681.html,"Musica   (Eros ramazzotti)
Musica  guardare pi lontano e perdersi in se stessi
La luce che rinasce e coglierne I riflessi
Su pianure azzurre si aprono, su pi su I miei pensieri spaziano
Ed io mi accorgo che che tutto intorno a me, a me
Musica  la danza regolare di tutti I tuoi respiri su di me
La festa dei tuoi occhi appena mi sorridi
Tu e il suono delle labbra tue, tu sempre di pi
Quellarmonia raggiunta in due, ti ascolter perch
Sei musica per me, per me
Musica, musica, musica, musica
Musica, musica, musica, musica
Io sento ancora le voci della strada dove son nato
Mia madre quante volte mi avr chiamato ma era pi forte il grido di libert
E sotto il sole che fulmina I cortili le corse polverose dei bambini
Che di giocare non la smettono pi
Io sento ancora cantare in dialetto le ninne-nanne di pioggia sul tetto
Tutto questo per me, questo dolce arpreggiare  musica da ricordare,
dentro di me, fa parte di me, cammina con me
musica  lamico che ti parla quando ti senti solo sai che una mano puoi
Trovarla
musica  da conservare, da salvare insieme a te.
Senti pi siamo in tanti e pi in alto sale un coro in lingua universale,
Dice che, dice che anche del cielo han bucato la pelle lo senti  lurlo delle
Stelle.
Forse cambier nella testa della gente la mentalit di chi ascolta ma non
Sente
Prima che il silenzio scenda su ogni cosa quel silenzio grande dopo laria
Esplosa.
Perch un mondo senza musica non si pu neanche immaginare
Perch ogni cuore anche il pi piccolo  un battito di vita e damore
Che musica, musica, musica"

Si lo so
Amore che io e te
Forse stiamo insieme
Solo qualche istante
Zitti stiamo
Ad ascoltare
Il cielo
Alla finestra
Questo mondo che
Si sveglia e la notte e
Gia cosi lontana
Gia lontana

[Chorus:]
Guarda questa terra che
Che gira insime a noi
Anche quando e buio
Guarda questa terra che
Che gira anche per noi
A dorci un po'di sole, sole, sole

My love che sei l'amore mio
Sento la tua voce e ascolto il mare
Sembra davvero il tuo respiro
L'amore che mi dai
Questo amore che
Sta li nascosto
In mezzo alle sue onde
A tutte le sue onde
Come una barca che

[Repeat chorus]

Guarda questa terra che
Che gira insime a noi
A darci un po'di sole

With a belief that you are waiting
I will go to you with tears, even if it is difficult.
Do not worry about anything.

He ain’t even make the music
He fell off!
Twitter followers he losing?
He fell off!
Yo! Wasn’t he on some tv show
He fell off!
I ain’t heard of him since, bro
He fell off!

C’mon man, music sucks
He look like Ne-yo with hair
He didn’t even put out nothing
He’s losing followers like
Matter of fact yo, I got more swag than him

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I done heard enough your swagga
It’s time to make moves like Mick Jagger
I’d rather top it than be the topic
That lyrical prophet making profits
It won’t stop until this worked out plan
Make me a skinny dude with big pockets!
Versatile and always keep the extra flow
Game tired so the kidnapping like Mexico
You can’t beat it? Neurologist is where you best to go
(Why)
Cause they kill rappers!
Pause, I’m dropping jaws, hold a candle to yours
You burning! I see you trying to duplicate my style
You’re learning! It’s serves no purpose, unless I’m earning!
Kermit green, guap, bread and nothing in between
Combined all my influences and came out sick
That influenza, as I enter the centre
My next word is highly anticipated
Clan of real mcs, Nas gave me the stamp, I’m initiated!

Hook:
He ain’t even make the music
He fell off!
Twitter followers he losing?
He fell off!
Yo! Wasn’t he on some tv show
He fell off!
I ain’t heard of him since, bro
He fell off!

He ugly, he ain’t got no girls
He ain’t got nose bridge
Girls don’t be replyin’ to him
Nobody even mess with him no more
He ain’t gettin’ no tweets from celebrities
I mean his life really is just boring!

Ain’t the life I chose, but the one I was given
Along with lyricism and perfecting the rhythm
So I took to microphone and spoke
Cause I was tired of being a contradiction, living dead broke!
I’m less friendly at the venues
Cause if it ain’t a dollar sign
In your username then the un-friend you!
Around the cool kids, I used to lurk
But then I threw that L up
Cause being cool was too much work!
Now rap’s how I get paid
Yards mix into seconds, every second trying to make me switch lanes
Switch blade sharp with these street smarts
Gotta keep (? For the stencil?) put it in the booth
Now check the street art!
That individual collecting residuals imminent and innovated
Flow creative like a a chocolate M&M
Endin’ em!
Speculations! Cause my style is facts, so quit the chit chat
Cause Brooklyn is back!

Bridge

Yo, I’m so New York that nobody don’t like me
Shouts out to Fab, I’m wreckin’ a record without a pad
Think I pretend to be nice but really I’m whack
But never catch me in the act
Facts is Macs don’t fall off, we fall back
So fall back, with that instigating, instagram’n
Tryin’ to see where my plans is
Yo Homie, where your manners, Uh
I, Kick that finesse every second fly
Homie never lie, kick lines cus they demand it
I will not lose!"

We can swing in out

Great they trappin the house with that tratchin
You’d better get back man the ecstatic it’s automatic
Like weapons in packs then
Everything I rip like I’m tryin to get
It’s not your itunes, first class with the window sheets
Bumping every...
Tri double since 9-6
Spit crack you... Fix,
Making it in la you’re... With your chicks,
Rap cast Jack you know they rob bitch but I’m here to stay
Switch flows like oil spill
Shoot em up wit that quick escape
Original consider the seminal we cast like criminals
Could’ve been one but I’m into bigger news
What that... Now I’m a walking legend shines eleven
This pitch cool days damn if I damn been waiting the step
So now I rap with checks and like viva la...
The best your test your texture but I don’t feel you
We the talk when they point out the wear ones
Oh soul, that’s why when you see us we look familiar

2 x Hook:
Check out this really bonix
Listen up when I’m rob me
Very rare when I’m kicking
You barely hear what I’m spitting
That’s why I got more flows than you
I’m making hot
Mc’s won’t even stay close to you

No woo tang but I got that method man
I tickle why but they obsessed they bear with me that couldn’t stare
I don’t even helping here just give me the beat, give me the beat
Am I show stay clapping here they moving the feet, moving the feet
I’m a G with G the... And beast the... You be at...
We knock em all then go to sleep
The checks I meet ’cause I’m with peace
A lot of tease you, I’ma need you
Cut the checks and send the hoes that play my vibal probably
But who else can kick you with the... Stitch
Assasin that your rapper stay the... On my hit,
If I ain’t in your top ten then what’s the purpose,
I’m right behind the nicest the hover I’ve been looking
You know that I’ve been working, it’s time for the...
Don’t you know you made it when haters make rumors at the evil
I’m bout your evil and touch the mind like evils,
Evokes spot this bikes consider me a diva.

Looks like you shine.
Walking a long night

Feel close to one foot and two feet

Following Moonlight Moonwalk

The lights go off as soon as they approach.
I'll close my eyes for the moonlight.
Under the dark
It's a story we both know.
Shh to others

Someone who makes me hotter
Not that many.
Rarely do you
Your motions
The lines are snowing for you.

Your footsteps
I want to be distracted
Baby let me relax

Walking and walking slowly
As long as you stay this night
You do not need to be alert.
Dejavu to fall

Your brisk briskness
Bear lips lips
As one pair of feet slips

Motion as close as you can get
Without anyone knowing
Moonwalk covered in clouds

I feel like I'm drunk
At that moment I already
Right after you fill up

I have lost all my senses
I am in a dimness
I want you again Moonwalk

I do not need anything.
Oh, I only touch your door

So we two
Movie hey that will not end
The fragrant scent
Lure as temptation

Goodbye, in your voice.
My presence is miraculous.

You stand before me now.
As I draw,
You are the heroine I dreamed of
That's what you are.

When the ordinary I become special
This is real love
When everything gets used to something special
The world I knew
When I realized that it was not all around
Yeah this is love
Woo love
This is real love
Woo babe
I did not know you.
Somewhere when it gets worse Yeah it's love

Everything I did on my own
I am alone.
I can get through it.
I thought about you.
Even if you watch a movie
Even if you walk the Han River
Even if you write lyrics
I thought of you.
Which one is inside me?
It's been shipped.
You're nervous.
It's a refuge.
Thank you. I'm not tired of you.
Thank you. I'm not tired of you.
You do not have to dream
You stand before me now.

I'm ruggin' my borrow with stuggin', I fly, you just luggage

Instead at just looking at this cat from Brooklyn
Or can see put the catchin' hooky, dead
But I'm still got body in the flash, lyrical .. and any nigga that test
Got my war pen tidied, I just really do the shit, you just added
True the legends I'm rapping my Brooklyn ??

Our niggas is lurge, but you ain't messin' with the origins,
He gonna try to be brave, must be dump with, I break you
I see through your make up, baking couldn't shave you,

Hey, boy you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns-clowns-clowns

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

[Chorus:]
Boy you can say anything you want
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shh looking at you flying
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back

[Cher Lloyd]
Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Trying to rock them ugly jeans-jeans-jeans
You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true
You'll be crawling back like boo-hoo-hoo

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

[Chorus:]
Boy you can say anything you want
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya

I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back

[Bridge:]
Ohhh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye uh oh uh oh
Ohhh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first uh oh uh oh

[Astro - Rap Verse]
Let's go! Astro!
We used to be, but now there's a separation between you and me
Baby I'm moving on to another girl that understands me more
Dated her in front your place so you can see it all
I remember the times, when we used to bond
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring, instead of you, nickname too
I can tell you're upset, because it ain't you
Met a new girl, and I gave her my heart
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start
You want me back?
We can just be friends, don't try to sting all over again

Wait until this song drop

Yes, I know, my G
It's all how I talk, yes, I know, my G
I'm so Brooklyn, yes, I know, my G
Just tell yourself, you ain't gotta tell me

I'm such a humble dude, young and kicking big bars
From the junkyard to where the white people move
Not the burbs, but I hit Burgs instead of Mossbergs
Birds never flirted, and now they got the urge
No relationships with funny chicks, I don't wanna see 'em
I try to bang, then poof, onomatopoeia
I'm such a grimy dude, and you know this man
Pops ain't popped up till I popped, I don't owe this man
I'm such a bad son, yes, I know dead beat
Get the rope and choke a rooster trying to stop my sleep
Think the flow looser, I recuse you, and we both gonna see
I'm even with the wind, and you know this G

It's all in my walk, yes, I know, my G
It's all how I talk, yes, I know, my G
I'm so Brooklyn, yes, I know, my G
Just tell yourself, you ain't gotta tell me

It's all in my walk, yes, I know, my G
It's all how I talk, yes, I know, my G
I'm so Brooklyn, yes, I know, my G
Just tell yourself, you ain't gotta tell me

I'm back in the building with millions of villains
We sitting back chilling and you catching feelings
They tell me I'm winning, but it was predicted
My landlord ain't like us, so we got evicted
Said get your ass out, yes, I know, my G
And now your new tenants watch me on tv
I put the D in daughters, yes, I know, my G
Wait a minute, I'm wildin', this is not pg
Tour like I play ball and my voice got deep
I'm inch scaled on you cm mc's
Ruler like the homie with the patch on his eye
When I arrive it be your demise, I see your disguise
On these guys 'cause they ain't really what they say they be
You can't be the best if your name ain't me
I'm ripping and living like yolo the motto, but cautious at that
'Cause in the Big Apple, you slip and they catch you and push your cap back
I'm focused on my music like a camera effect
Harder than Regis on you rejects, so you best not test

It's all in my walk, yes, I know, my G
It's all how I talk, yes, I know, my G
I'm so Brooklyn, yes, I know, my G
Just tell your friends, you ain't gotta tell me

It's all in my walk, yes, I know, my G
It's all how I talk, yes, I know, my G
I'm so Brooklyn, yes, I know, my G

The answer's easy if you take it logically,
He'll never stop us in our struggle to be free,
There must be.. 50 ways to get Bin Laden,

He doesn't care if he's alive or if he's dead,
We'll send commandos there to pump him full of lead,
There must be.. 50 ways to get Bin Laden,
50 ways to get Bin Laden,

You just stab him in the back, Jack,
Blow up the cave, Dave,
Step on his veil, Dale,
Just listen to me,
Hit him with a bus, Gus,
Then send in a scud, Bud,
Just hang him from a tree, Lee,
So we can stay free,

It will not grieve us, here, to see him in such pain,
We have to stop him cos he's totally insane,
He's gonna end up with a bullet in the brain,
There must be.. 50 ways to get Bin Laden,
He thought the us would give up without a fight,
But now he's gonna face the full force of our might,
We'll show Osama what is wrong and what is right,

Adam Sandler,7 Foot Man,/a/adam+sandler/7+foot+man_20523071.html,"We just wrote this song on the bus the other day so just sit back and relax

I'm the 7 foot man,
I've commited no crime,
Bumping my head into doorways,
It happens all the time,
I'm 7 feet tall,
And I repeat,
They don't make a ski boot that can fit my feet,
I'm 7 feet tall,
And I don't play basketball,

I'm 7 feet tall,
But I'm still just a man,
So of course it hurts me a lot,
When I walk into the ceiling fan,
Small people say I wish I was him,
But it's been nine years since I've had a trim,
The barber says,
I can't reach the top of his head,

7 foot man,
(ha ha)I cannot hide,
7 foot man,
I know cause I've tried,
7 foot man,
My last girlfriend died,
Because my penis,
Is 7 foot wide!!!!!!!!!

So the next time you see me,
Walking around,
And my head is right about to hit a tree branch,
Tell me to duck down,
And I'll pay you back ,
Soon you will see,
By getting you frisbee down from that tree,
I do what i can,
I'm the 7 foot man,

7 foot man,
7 foot man"

Oh they day can't begin
Till the gard lets me in
Then I walk for some exersise

In less then a snap
I complete my daily lap
Then it's time to socilize

I see Raidy and Ruth
At the Information Booth
Have rigged the hearing lady
At Ben and Jerry's Shake

Then I go to Pet Land
Where the manager stands
Has about to be the dangorous stake

Then I pass the tie rack
On my way to Radioshack
Where I pretent to be a Hollywood Star
I try to walk like John Wayne
While singing in the rain
And the Janitor laughs all the time!

A little bit later,
All the flash and the painter
Was so high I had to close my eyes

Janitor:
He takes his 11: 30 crap

Whitey:
Then go over to the Gap
And try clothes on for kids my size

You want to go to Panda Express?
Their spicey Chicken is the best!
Go to Instant Barrel for a medium drink
Cause their staff is really nice
And they only use cubed ice
Which is better then chushed I think

Bangle lesson nothing sees [?]
Look for chocolate heri-ings [?]
Cuz he les me take a quich cat nap
He says he misses his daughter
Puts my hand in warm water
And I wake up with a wet yellow lap

Footlocker is my last stop
Where I have to go and shop
For some clean passings couples at a nice price

Cuz when I leave the mall,
I 'reff' Youth League basketball
And to look your best... Never hurts
But the greatest thing of all
If the truth be told
Here at the mall its never too hot or cold
Cuz they were smart enough to make it truckin tall
.. At the mall, at the mall, at the mall!

Adam Sandler,Bum Biddy,/a/adam+sandler/bum+biddy_20157585.html,"Every one in this room has been associated with Whitey,
Either through basketball, or the mall, or the various odd jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
I'm guessing ninety-nine percent of you have either laughed in Whitey's face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or shortness or his sister when he wasn't looking
But the next time he'd see you he'd still go out of his way to wave and smile and ask you about your mother's operation or something like that because he unlike us actually cares about some one other then himself
The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst offender of all
My life was simply going no were
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
He should've gotten a big thank you
Instead he got a port-a-potty ride
I was such a shit-head
But he never quit on me
'Till I told him he was useless
And his sister was freaky
Once when we were watching Sunday football
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with a hanger
And spent the game on top of our T. V.
And when the lightning struck him
He let out a wicked loud yell
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell we should all rot in hell
I went to high school with Whitey
As a joke I told him to meet me at the prom
When he got there I said, ""I can't believe you thought I was serious""
So he ran home crying and slow-danced with his mom
What a crushing blow to Whitey
I bet you wish you could take it back
How could you all be so mean to Whitey?
Sound to me like you are all on crack
Tonight Whitey was counting on this town to show that we care
But the first time he really needed us we weren't there
And on Christmas Eve and the last night of Hannukah
It's just not fair
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum bum
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum

Here I am at camp granada
Camp is very entertaining
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining

I went hiking with joe spivy
He developed poison ivy
You remeber leonard skinner
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner

All the counslers hate the waiters
And the lake has alligators
And the head coach wants no sissies
So he reads to us from something called uylesses

I don't want this, should I scare ya
But my bunk mate has malaria
You remember jeffery hardy
They're about to organize a searching party

Take me home, o mudda fudda
Take me home, I hate granada
Don't leave me out in the forest
Where I might get eaten by a bear

Take me home, I promise I will not make noise
Or mess the house with other boys
O please don't make me stay
I've been here one whole day

Dearest fadda, darling mudda
How's my precious little brudda
Let me come home, if you miss me
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me

Adam Sandler,Champion,/a/adam+sandler/champion_20596219.html,"The Champion
Donald: Welcome back on this glorious sunday afternoon for the final round of the Enbuary classic. The legendary Champion is now approaching the 18'th tee off with an insomauntible 8th stroke lead.

The Champion: Well let's wrap this thing up

Donald: The gallery lets the champion know what a fine three days of golf he has had. The always charming Champion is now taking time to high five a young spectator and the boy, the boy is awestruck. Haha, the gallery erupts into delight

Random person in the gallery: Go get them champ!

Donald: Yes Yes. I think it would be hard to find in any sport a champion who is as beloved as this one. And the encouraging gallery goes silent. Eight strokes ahead of the pack, the Champion slowly starts his back swing.

(Honking car horn)

Champion: Four! (Hit the golf ball.)

Donald: Oh no no! Apparently the honking horn had some sort of concentration effect on the champion's usual monstrous drive.

Champion: Is that Greag normen's kid or something?

(Gallery begins to laugh.)

Donald: The Champion shakes it off and makes some sort of humorous remark about the horn to the gallery and they eat it up.

Champion: Let's get the ball back on the field.

Donald: Yes Yes, well now the Champion, his Caddy, and the elendent gallery make their way to the Champion's ball, which is unfortunately larged next to a very thick tree route. The champion and his caddy talk it over. He; s going to play it safe and punch out with a 7 iron with a 8 stroke lead this is simply smart play by the legendary Champion. He approaches the ball.. Let's watch.

Champion: Take a swing at the ball hitting the tree route in the process)

Donald: Oh, well I.. I don't think that's what the Champion had in mind when he took that swing. The ball is now 10 yards.. Um into the woods after ricoshaying off the tree route, and ther's a look of pain on the Champion's face. He is shaking his hands as if to say I did not have a strong enough grip on the club when I hit the tree route, and my hands are stinging quite badly.

Champion: (Start Grunting)

Donald: The Champion is starting to mutter some obscenities about the car horn, which if you just joined us blew earlier during the champion's back swing at the 18'th tee off. Well now his caddy and friend of 25 years, Mr. Skipijankings, is doing every thing he can to get the champion's mind back on track.

Skipijankings: (Say line during: is doing every thing he can...) Forget about the car horn, let's just win this thing!

Champion: Hahah, you're right.

Donald: What wonderful veteran words of wisdom. The Champion nods in agreement, and heads into the woods to set up for his third shot which he will have to play out of a dreadfully muddy lie. He's sticking with his 7 iron closes the club face a little. He starts his swing.

Champion: (Swing at ball)

Donald: And the ball did not move, um if anything it's a little deeper in the mud.

Champion: What is this fucking quick sand?!

Donald: The Champion is now conferring with coarse marshal, David Canner.

Champion: What do I do next?

David: Gonna have to drop one.

Donald: And yes i.. It has been ruled that his ball is unplayible, he will take a drop and a one stroke penally.

Champion: (Start laughing a bit too hard as if you where drunk)

Donald: and the Champion is now laughing very hard, uh one might say a little too hard, but none of the less, he drops his new Areo Fly Ball and resumes play.

Gallery: (Start to clap)

Donald: Back with his trusty 3 wood, the Champion lines up his shot. He starts his back swing.

Champion: (Fart)

Donald: He flatuates. Stops his swing, and steps away from his ball, and whispers something too his caddy, Mr. Skipijankings.

Skipijankings: Wha? What do you mean you got to take a shit?

Champion: I've got to shit.

Skipijankings: Finish the fucking hole, we've got to win this mother fucker!

Random man in gallery: Jesus Christ man!

Donald: Well now the Champion is staring angrily at his caddy. He continues to star for quite some time, and then abruptly walks back to his ball; not taking much time set up at all he swings,

Champion: (Swing at the ball.)

Connects, a Smash of a hit!

Gallery: (applaud)

Donald: Starting to slice, oh no it goes directly into the center of a man-made water hazard!

Champion: You've got to be fucking kidding me!

Donald: The Champion slowly walks over to his golf bag, unzips it, and pulls out, hmm what I believe  is a 16 oz silver beverage container and starts drinking in large gulps. Why don't we take this time for a word from our sponcers, and then we will return to our final round coverage of the Enbuary Classic. (Whispers: Well I have no idea what he was thinking)

Announcer guy: What do 17 major championships, over 6 million dollars in prize money, and the complete domination of the sport of golf have in common? Two things: The Champion, and Areo Fly Balls. Areo Fly Balls, they just seem to go further. If it's  good enough for the Champion, don't you think it's good enough for you.

Donald: Well welcome back to our final round coverage  of the Enbuary Classic.

Random Man: (Say this during the beginning) put your shirt back on!

Champion: I'll tell you one thing. No one's fucking up me in my hole.

Donald: As we join the action,

Champion: Because thay are fucking ugly

Donald: we can see his caddy and long time friend, Mr. Skipijankings, trying to cox the Champion out of the sand trap where he is presently on his back making a snow angle.

Skipijankings: Get up! Get the fuck up. What the fuck are you doing?!

Champion: All right(get out of hole)

Donald: Well the Champion is now ceasing his softmories behavior and is climbing out of the trap onto the green.

Champion: Yee-Haw! (Charge at Skipijankings and Tackle him)

Donald: The Champion has just tackled long time friend, Mr. Skipijankings, I've never scene any thing like this.

Skipijankings: That's it! I'm getting the fuck out of here! You're fucked up dude, you need some help!

Champion: Ya I need help fucking your wife!

Skipijankings: fuck you! (Kick the Champion very hard!) Don't you ever talk about my wife! I'll fuking kill you man!

Donald: Hear Hear! Generally Tempered, long time friend Mr. Skipijankings now storming off the forced hole, not with out hearing some expletive words hurled at him by the classless lord of the lace. Tears streaming down his face, the Champion is now alone on the green left with mainly a 12 foot put. (Police sirens are going off) Who would of thought that a horn honk could bring about such disaster and disarray in one ma's life. The Champion, now lining up his put, using the flag stick as his putter for some odd reason. He takes a few steps towards the hole, unbuckles his belt, The champion is defecating in the cup, and the gallery has scene enough! Not a moment too soon the police have arrived, and are advancing towards the champion slowly. In a last desperate act, the Champion holds the flag stick as if it were a large lance from medieval times, and runs full kilt in rage in his eyes towards the Officers.

Officers(Begin firing guns)

Donald: They Open fire. The champion has been shot. He is down on the green, he's not moving, walking inching their way towards the champion, the officer checks the champion's pulse, and signals to the other police that the Champion is sure enough dead. If you are just joining us Sunday May 7'th at 2: 42 P. M. Perhaps the greatest golfer of our time is diseased at age 39. My God have mercy on his sole. This has been Donald Hefington saying good day, and good golf."

This is a song that uhh..
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh..
Not too many Chanukah songs.
So uhh..
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to
Hear any Chanukah songs.
Here we go...""

Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much funukah
To celebrate Chanukah
Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights

When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me
David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah

Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew

You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr.Spock- both
Jewish

Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs
Celebrates Chanukah

O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew- he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish- not too shabby

Some people think that Ebenezer
Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is
All three Stooges
So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is

Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonicah
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah
So drink your gin and tonicah
And smoke your marijuanikah
If you really, really wannakah
Have a happy, happy, happy,
Happy Chanukah

Happy Chanukah"

There was no limit on what I could eat
Shake after shake after shake after shake
Followed by all kinds of red meat
Metabolism runnin' around so fast
My body never gained no weight
That pissed off all my Momma's friends
And made my big-boned sister irate
But now I'm a man
And all that food frolicking has caused my ego to hurt
'Cause even when I'm in the shower alone
I'm too embarrassed to remove my shirt
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me
And all them cookies I been munching lately
My feets are becoming difficult to see
I believe it was my Daddy
Who led to this eating disease
By calling me ""The Little Candy-ass""
When I couldn't finish a burger with cheese
Or maybe it was my Momma
Who got me addicted to the wrong foods
Only when I gobbled down every chicken cutlet
Would I get to see Momma's good moods
They said eat this, they said eat that
To stay skinny there was no chance
And now when I walk I hear corduroy
Even though I ain't wearing pants
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me
(You fat fuck, you fat fuck)
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me
(You fat fuck, you fat fuck)
And all that ice cream I been eatin' lately
My chins alone weigh 203
The diet starts tomorrow!
I have a grapefruit for breakfast
For lunch a bowl of white rice
Dinnertime it's a saltless potato
I ain't allowed no spice
If this diet's gonna work
Tonight I can't eat no more
""Just go to sleep,"" I say to myself
As I close the bedroom door
Two in the morning, I wake up to piss
My belly's hungry and achin'
Tiptoe to the kitchen, fuck the diet
Bring on the chips flavored with bacon
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay
Make a tub o' shit outta me

Wave your weeno, even more obsceno

And dance

Swimming Mark Spitz
Moustache, moustache
Playing with his hairy tits

Big Earl Weaver, Tommy Seaver
Both of them got the boogie fever
Shit your pants
You can
Do the hustle with seven-footer Billy Russell
Do the fucking hustle, jerking your love muscle
Shake your big, round ass with the ghost of Mama Cass
Blast from the past, the ghost of Mama Cass
Dry-hump the floor with Mary Tyler-Moore
Pump it sore
Squeeze your nipple like baldy Mr. Whipple
Drink some Ripple
Give it a hearty whack with tv great Victor Tayback
When you give it a whack, don't hurt the nut-sack

So if the thought of grooving is bringing you down

The stars will show you how to move

Even though it's 7: 44 (I fell asleep, pally)
I'm feeling kinda antsy
Mama's getting fancy
Slicking back a wet pompadour (Red Sox)

He said he'd be here at seven
It's closing in on 8: 01 (Trimmin' the 'stache, kid)
Me lookin' like a sap
In a wool knit cap
Mama's next move is a bun (fuckin' Patriots)

Where the fuck is he? (My pants are still in the dryer, dude)
Where the fuck is he? (I couldn't find my fuckin' snowboots, pal)
I wish I had a car (Huge, huge hangover)
Oh, no (Massive hailstorm, massive hailstorm, massive)

That stupid little punk
He's probably fuckin' drunk
I bet he drank a case
Wanna pop him in the face right now
Mama's eyebrow

Wicked good
Wicked good (Oh, god)
Wicked good
Wicked good (fuck yeah)
Wicked good
Wicked good (Pisser?)

Well my friend is still a no-show
And I'm getting' fucking pissed (Why?)
'Cause I could've gone with Charlie
In the side of his Harley
Mama's on the phone with a stylist (fuck Charlie!)

So I guess I ain't going out tonight
'Cause the digits say 12: 09 (shit-faced)
But call the operator
'Cause one perm later
Mama's hair sure do look fine (Heffenreffer!!!)

Where the fuck is he? (Ah, ha ha!  My stepfather was tellin' me a wicked funny
Joke!)
Where the fuck is he? (Ah, ha ha! I forgot it though...)

I wish I had a car
I wish I had a car (A cop pulled me over, buddy)

I wish I went with Charlie (5. 2 blood level, state record)
I could have gone with Charlie (I'm in a wicked mess of trouble, haha!)

Alright, rule number one: always wash your hands before touching the baby.

Do you know why?

Well, because you have germs on your hands, and germs make the baby sick.

That's right ryan, germs make baby sick
Okay, rule number two: don't feed the baby anything.

Adam Sandler,Inner Voice,/a/adam+sandler/inner+voice_20523068.html,"I'm happily married with a house and three mistresses
Even with the beard I'm not as hairy as my sister is
Got a new Hummer, two Ferraris, and some Lexuses
And all the girls I know got the big big breasteses
I got a ten story mansion on the beach
With a swimmin' pool filled up with the drool of Robin Leach
Richer than a Twinkie, I got so much cash
That to me Paris Hilton is poor white trash
I take forty-seven weeks of vacation a year
If people piss me off I can make 'em disappear
Every time I sneeze I get a feature on the news
The reporter says ""gesundheit"" and hilarity ensues
And how did I get to be the man that I am?
A god among men, only without the tan
It's simple, every time I have to make a choice
I just listen to my little inner voice, and he says
""Shave all the hair off your butt and glue it to your nostrils""
Ok
""Steal all the milk from all the supermarkets and put it
Back in the cows""
Alright
""Find out which species of rodent is the most flammable""
Ok
""Let's see what fun crafts we can make using only a chainsaw
And Regis Philbin""
Yeah!

So how do I explain my little cranial expressions
Intuition, premonition, or demonic possession?
It could be God, an angel, or my dead uncle Paul
Or that nasty purple fuzzy thing that lives in my wall
Doesn't matter, and to be honest I don't wanna know
'Cause thanks to him I've never had to deal with an hmo
And I can go show off my rocket powered solid gold Benz
I tell ya life is no much nicer with invisible friends
""Record an all-banjo Falco tribute album""
Done, and done.
""Put on a tutu, glue two live wiener dogs to your face, and
Prance around the subway terminal screaming 'Stop looking at me! '""
Ok
""There's no reason not to have sex with a cheese grater.""
Hmm, no, I suppose not.
""Set up a stand outside of K-Mart with a plate full of frozen peas
And a sign reading 'Take one! ' If anyone asks you what the hell
Your doing, give them a button that says 'i asked about the peas! '""

He's become my best friend, sticks with me to the end
Thanks to him I'll never live on Ramen noodles again
And he's always by my side, every minute, every hour
Though it does get kinda creepy when I'm trying to take a shower
Still I can't complain 'cause he made me rich
And figured out it was the opossum milk that made me itch
If it seems weird remember the voice made me do it
I don't question what he says I just get up and get to it
""Itemize everything in your cat's litter box for the next seven years
And mail a report to the President with a note saying 'Here! '""
Good idea
""It's time to find out what urinal cakes taste like""
If you say so
""Get a black and white horizontally striped suit, a mask,
And a bowling ball with a small length of rope hanging from it,
And tiptoe around the airport. ""
Sounds like fun
""How old does a baby need to be before it's too big
To fit down the toilet? ""
I don't know. Let's find out.
""Keep swallowing magnets until your farts can erase video tapes.""
Will do

So to that guy in my head I just wanna say thanks
For removin' my angst, so I'm no longer shootin' blanks
And now I own several banks, plus an inflatable watch
And paid Justin Timberlake to let me kick him in the crotch
I followed his advice and now I'm makin' major duckets
If it wasn't for him I'd still be processing Mcnuggets
So when life makes you feel like you should've stayed in bed
Just listen to the voice in your head, and he'll say
""Fat people are full of toys. Go get some!""
Yeah!
""Build a 20 foot tall nude statue of Tony Goldmark licking
Warm margarine off a malnourished dolphin out of onions,
Pez, and lint. ""
With pleasure!
""If Yanni didn't want to be set on fire and shoved down
A flight of stairs, surely he would have said so explicitly by now. ""
Yeah, I guess so.
""Go to a Mcdonald's Playland, tie that big Officier Big Mac
Thing to the back of your car, and drive away at 90 mph. When a
Cop pulls you over, roll down the window and indignantly ask 'what? '""
You got it!
""Move to New Jersey and become a comedy rap artist.""

Woke up in the morning
Put on my new plastic glove
Served some reheated salisbury steak
With a little slice of love
Got no clue what the chicken pot pie is made of
Just know everything's doing fine
Down here in Lunchlady Land

Well I wear this net on my head
'Cause my red hair is fallin' out
I wear these brown orthopedic shoes
'Cause I got a bad case of the gout
I know you want seconds on the corndogs
But there's no reason to shout
Everybody gets enough food
Down here in Lunchlady Land

Well yesterday's meatloaf is today's sloppy joes
And my breath reeks of tuna
And there's lots of black hairs coming out of my nose
In Lunchlady Land your dreams come true
Clouds made of carrots and peas
Mountains built of shepherds pie
And rivers made of macaroni and cheese
But don't forget to return your trays
And try to ignore my gum disease
No student can escape the magic of Lunchlady Land

Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe

Well I dreamt one morning
That I woke up to see
All the pepperoni pizza
Was a-looking at me
It screamed, why do you burn me
And serve me up cold
I said I got the spatula
Just do what you're told
Then the liver & onions
Started joining the fight
And the chocolate pudding
Pushed me with all it's might
And the chop suey slapped me
And it kicked me in the head
It's called revenge Lunchlady
Said the garlic bread
I said what did I do
To make you all so mad
They said you got flabby arms
And your breath is bad
Then the green beans said
You better run and hide
But then my friend sloppy joe came
And joined my side
He said if it wasn't for the Lunchlady
The kids wouldn't eatcha
You should be shakin' her hand
And sayin' please to meet ya
She gives you a purpose
And she gives you a goal
You should be kissin' her feet
And kissin' her mole
Now all the angry foods
Just leave me alone
And we all live together
In a happy home

Thanks to

Mama spit on her fingers and used it to clean dirt off my face.

Brush your teeth, q-tip your ear,
Take off your sister's new brassiere.
Watch pbs, not deputy dawg,
Don't you eat that lincoln log.

Oh mama I still don't believe
It's true: the tooth fairy was you.
No way!

I love you maaaaaama,
More than than paaaastrama,
Way more than jeffrey daaaahma,
Even more than my nfl paaaaajamas.

Mama always calmed down dad when he got too mean.
Like the time he almost hit me for stealing his juggs magazine.

Stop your jumping,
You'll break the bed.
Don't you fill up
On the bread.
Take those
Take those
(trying to read cue card)
Take... Carrots out of your nose,
That's not a hat that's pantyhose.
Don't play baseball in your suit,
That magnum pi's very cute.
Don't forget vick's vapor-rub,
Stop masturbating in the tub.
Thanks for making corn beef hash,
And putting powder on my rash.
(so much better.)

I love you maaaaaama,
More than golf with arnold paaaaalmaaaa,
More than yellow moons in lucky chaaaaamaaaas,
Def leppard's drummer only had one aaaaaaamaaa.

Oh, mrs. Nealon, yes it's true,
Kevin's gonna sing to you.

Come on kevin.

I love you maaaaaama

Come on, keep goin'.

More than films by brian depaaaaalmaaaa.

Thanks for being my date to the praaaaamaaaa.

Thanks for writing that note to the draft
Board that said I was gay so I got out
Of vietnaaaamaaa.

Mom your way better than the world trade center baaaaamaaaa.

Who's name by the way is mohamed salaaaamaaa.

I love you even more than richard gere loves the dali laaaaahmaaa.

And richard gere was also good in ""sommersby"",
Which was a melodraaaamaa.

Oh, all you moms out there oughta know,
We kids love you so.

Have a happy mother's day.
Thank you very much!

'Cause I looked in the garbage can and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head

I'm fuckin' wasted

Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moon walk all over the place
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak

I'm fuckin' wasted
It's the best shit I ever tasted
My brain's been erased-ed
Well fuckin' fried

Now I'm sittin' in the bathtub wantin' somthing to eat
I wanted a pizza- the bird said 'uh, pepperoni would be sweet'

I got a piece of shit car

Never gets me very far

My car's a big piece of shit
'Cause the shocks are fucking shot
And my seatbelt's fucking broken
I got to tie it in a knot
(It's a piece of shit)

I can't see through the windshield
'Cause it's got a big fucking' crack
And the interior smells real bad
'Cause my friend puked in the back

Piece of shit car
(He's got a piece of shit car)
It sucks royal dick
(That fuckin' pile of shit)
100% crap

Oh fuck you car

It's got no CD player, it only got the 8-track
Whoever designed my car can lick my sweaty nut sack
(They can bite his ass too)
And I got no fuckin' brakes
I'm always way out of control
Eleven times a day I hear ""Hey, watch it asshole""
(You fuckin' piece of shit)

I got piece of shit car

Diesel gas sucks my ass
(That fuckin' pile of shit)
That pile of metal shit

Oh what the fuck did I do
What the fuck did I do
What the fuck did I do
To get stuck with you
You're too wide for drive-thru
And you smell like the shoe
But I'm too broke to buy something new
Oh fuck me

Well the engine likes to flood
The car always fuckin' stalls
And the seat cushion's got a big rip
So a spring always pokes the balls
(Ouch, ouch, ouch)
Plus the door locks are busted
I gotta use a fucking coat hanger
(What a pain in his ass)
And if a girlie sees my car
There's no chance I'll ever bang her
(He never ever gets da pussy)
Hey shut up
(Piece of shit car)
You piece of shit car

(You got a piece of shit car)
You piece of shit car
(Piece of shit car)
Bald fuckin' tires
(You got a piece of shit car)
No rearview fucking mirror

Seven different colors

Fucking rag for a gas cap

Tailpipe makes the sparks fly everywhere

Adam Sandler,Santa Song,/a/adam+sandler/santa+song_20003922.html,"So many presents,
So little time,
Santa won't be coming around my house this year,
Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear,
Oh mama made it perfectly clear,
Santa don't like bad boys... Especially jewish ones.

Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that I desire,
So why did I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,
I told him I was sorry,
I'm a liar,
So no toys for me... I don't deserve them.

I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.

Dear santa,

I know what my problem is, why I can't be good, it's a fear of intimacy.
You see my whole life whenever I've met someone really great like you and
I keep feeling like I'm getting close to them, something inside me makes
Me want to screw it up. So in a weird way the reason I'm so bad is because
I love you santa.

Rock-em sock-em robots is what I was hoping for,
But then I made a death threat to vice president gore,
Oh santa won't be knocking on my door,
Cause he's a big fat whore... What made me say that?

Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed,
So why'd I have to sell that cop a bag of weed,
So santa please give me that easy bake oven,
I swear I thought billy goats we're made for lovin'.

So santa won't you accept my apologies,
Santa can't you see I'm begging you please,
Oh santa next year I'll do you right,
Live from new york it's saturday night..."
Adam Sandler,She Comes Home To Me,/a/adam+sandler/she+comes+home+to+me_20211448.html,"Though I have been a fool for love
I have finally made my score
I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast
But she loves me the most
Even though she's a highly paid whore
She'll give head to a sheep
She can stuff three cocks in her cheek
But she comes home to me
She'll do the groom and the best man
She'll slap your ass in the back of a van
But she comes home to me
She could fuck nine guys in a row
But still have a tenth for me
And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips
Unless you pay an extra fifty
So mister, don't you fall in love
Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove
Since her heart belongs to me
She has a throat that just won't quit
She can take all of it
And still have room for your balls
But she shops in the malls for me
She'll say twelve then call back and say one
But I don't care I know it's just work not fun
When she blows you, Jack
Don't you think she's not thinking of me
She'll go down on a yack, lick a horse's nutsack
But strictly for the cash
And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee
To watch her put a water bottle in her gash
(Put a water bottle in her gash)
She'll let you suck her nips till they're leakin'
But don't you dare try to go antique-ing
Cause she does that with me
Her pussy's sweet as honey
But when she moans, it's just for the money
Unless she's sittin' on me
She'll cram your asshole with a mouse
But she won't do it in our house
Tough luck, Jack
She knows that don't fly with me
She might eat your wife's box
But she won't tell ya where you left your socks
She rolled up and down your fat prick
But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick
She's got a face full of nuts
And a mouth full of cocks
She's done Seal, Larry King, four New Kids on the Block,
She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game
But they never got to know her actual name
On your face she will piss
On your chest she might poop
But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup
That's simply reserved..
Oh she'll bite ya, she'll spank ya
But she'll never thank you for free
Cause baby... Comes home to me.
Comin' home!!"

Noooo....
Is it something Amy can strap on and fuck me with?
Sid! No!
If I get jizz all over it, will it be ruined?

Noo...
Is it something that can be used like... A pussy?
That's just another way of asking if you can fuck it...
My bad... Does it get big if you touch it?
No...
Does it get hard if you touch it?
Nooo...
If my Amy catches me blowing it, will she be mad?
Look, you can't blow it, man, we already talked about that...

Ok, I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the Cure a lot.

[Sung]
You don't know how much I need you.
While you're around I don't feel blue.
And when we kiss I know that you need me too.
I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true.

But it all was bullshit.
It was a goddam joke.
And when I think of you and I,
I hope you fucking choke.

I hope you're glad with what you've done to me.
I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy.
You left me here all alone, tears running constantly.

Oh somebody kill me please,
Somebody kill me plee-ase,
I'm on my knees,
Pretty pretty please kill me.

I want to die.
Put a bullet in my head.

She came out with a lion's roar
Yelling, ""I'm going to the corner store,
Be back at quarter to four""
""Don't slam your pinkies in the drawer""
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore
Hanging out at Studio 54
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor
With Lionel Richie
Who, by the way, was a Commodore
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle tooth boar
Who couldn't breat right since the Vietnam War
Then she played Chinese Checkers with Skeletor
And went camping with Eva Gabor
She's my sweet Beatrice
She's my sweet Beatrice
She's my sweet Beatrice
And she's coming home
I got a picture of her down by the seashore
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour
Her hair's up like Conway Twitty's pompadour
With the smile of Guy Lefleur
She got the ups and downs like an elevator
But deep inside she's a marshmellow smore
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor
Either or, Neithor nor
She'll share it with your Labrador
She can run faster than a blazing meteor
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore
Can make a pipe out of an apple core
That's a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish
Down in Ecuador
You know why?
She's my sweet Beatrice
She's my sweet Beatrice
She's my sweet Beatrice
And she's coming home
Well, for sure she opened the door
Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure
Sexually, that made me insecure
Like the time I was a roadie
On Elton John's tour
She said, ""Let's go catch some Piscatore!""
I said, ""Beatrice, you don't eat fish no more.""
She said, ""By God, you're right!""
So we took ourselves a snore
And when we woke up 10 hours later
We made Love Du Jour
She's my sweet Beatrice
She's my sweet Beatrice
She's my sweet Beatrice
And she came home
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel
She gonna try on my third grade mittens
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way too small
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me
She ain't never gonna let me down
She ain't never gonna tell nobody
I'm afraid of birds and spiders
Well, Bea-bea-bea-beatrice
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice

Bea-bea-bea-beatrice
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice

Huh?.
Listen we got rules in this house, and you better follow them or you'll find yourself outta of here,
Ya ya ya
This might be harder then I thought

If you're coming from street, with dirty shoes on your feet
That's a technical foul
If you switch the radio, to some modern music show
That's a technical foul
If you don't shut the door, after using the fridge-er-a-tor
That's a technical foul, A technical foul

If you touch the thermostat, (you'll get hit with a bat)
Cause that's a technical foul (You'll feel my wrath)
If your hair clogs the drain, (you'll know the meaning of pain)
Cause that's a technical foul (I'll show you no mercy)
Ohh... this is such bull shita
(hey!) In this house we say bull spit
Or it's a technical foul, A technical foul

Let me get this straight, you expect me to change my entire lifestyle in one night, because you guys are a couple of psychotic control freaks!

You got it bub,
Or you can go rot in the gutter it's up to you Yankee Doodle!

Well I don't want to do that, but let me run a few questions by you so I don't screw up accidentally.

If I don't spray Lysol, after moving a bowel,
That's a technical foul.
Okay!
If I decide to wash my ass with your monogrammed towel,
That's a technical foul.
Please say Hieney.
If I make fun of your crazy feeties,
Or give sugar cookies to Miss Diabetes,
That's not only technical foul...
But possibly a homicide...

Can I sleep past three?
If you do  you'll get a ""T""
Take a wizz in those flowers?
Ill say hit the showers.
Use this horn as a bong,
Adios Tommy Chong.
Make some long distance calls,
You'll get a kick in the balls! (Oops)
Can I walk around with my morning erection?
If you want an automatic ejection,
Cause that's a technical foul.

But I'd like to see it any way (Just kiddin)

There are certain rules which apply in one's life
With your sister, friends or imaginary wife
(I can't believe I haven't killed myself) - (Adam Sandler)
Respect carries over  me on the court
(Here with Wigs Magee, and a fury elf) - (Adam Sandler)
Whether your jewish diabetic or especially short
(She's ironic and he's a troll) - (Adam Sandler)
I see she's strange in my royal carry; my imaginary wife is short and hairy
((They took my wig; I remember the look in their eyes)) - (Élanor)
(How did my life get stuck in this shit hole?) - (Adam Sandler)
((Why oh why wont someone retrieve my wig wig wig)) - (Élanor)
(Guess I have to deal with your demands, but please don't touch me with your alien hands!) - (Adam Sandler)

I got no right to growl
The whistle she's on the prowl
Without my wig, I look like an owl Hoo Hoo
(O my god!!!)
Don't laugh at her

Something jumped and poked me good
'That' he said 'just me morning wood'
A little tin soldier's marchin by
Sergeant major unzips his fly
Pulls his weapon from his camouflage pants
Slaps away til it starts to dance
A shootin star's above my bed
Changin colors of my mushroom head
A rainbow jizz flys across the room
Little white spermies meet their doom

(Aaaah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!
And my scrotum sack he says

Little green men from outer space
Here to exterminate the human race
Drop their ray guns and retreat to their ships
When marshmallow sauce squirts from me tip
Like a knight of olden Camelot
The goo takes off like an arrow shot
Gwynevere drops to her knees and begs
For the spittin dragon between me legs
I'm using my thing for what it's for
Gentle knock upon me door
Mumsy drops her cup of tea
When she sees my wank standing tall and free

(Aaaaah!) Here comes Willy Wanker!
And my marble sack he says
Lalalalalala, tickle me!

Squeezing my squid in the evening shine!
Visions of mermaids in the sky!
Shooting my load in me own left eye!
Gramps was a hero in the first World War
But he ain't got no dick no more
Comes home smokin from the corner pub
Makes poor old Gramsy kiss his nub
The world spins around like a big bass drum
Nanny pops a pinkie in the generals bum
The Irish dance and the Scotsmem howl
Time to clean up with the washroom towel

She looks fabulous for a woman her age, doesn't she? ""

For male adolescents to commit savage acts on animals as part of their maturing process. ""

By the monotony of their work and decided to play a childish prank. ""

[Valedictorian:] ""It's ironic that parts of one's body seems odd
And unusual because you don't see them on a day to day basis.

[Buffoon:] ""My father's shit stinks up the bathroom all fuckin' day!""

[Valedictorian:] ""It's puzzling why one person's fecal odor can be more overpowering than another's.
I wonder whether it is a function of the food digested or that person's internal metabolism. ""

One day of presents?

So here comes number three!

Ross and Phoebe from Friends
Say the Chanukah blessing,
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will and Grace's Debra Messing!
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mixed meat with dairy,
Maybe they should have called that show
Little Kosher House on the Prairie!
We got Jerry Lewis,
Ben Stiller, and Jack Black,
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism,
But you guys can have him back!
(Just kidding, Tommy!.)

We may not get to kiss
Underneath the mistletoe,
But we can do it all night long
With Deuce Bigalow!

Rob Schneider: I'm Jewish!?!?!

Drei-Dels: Put on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah...

Rob Schneider: The guy in Willie Nelson's band who plays harmonica celebrates Chanukah!

Adam Sandler: Tiny Elvis everybody.  Tiny Elvis.  Schneider, I didn't even know you were jewish.

Rob Schneider: I'm a filipino jew.  In fact, I'm going home right now to light the first pig.

Adam sandler: okay, get going.

Osama bin Laden...

The Driedels: boo!

Not a big fan of the Jews!
Well maybe that's because he lost the figure skating match
To gold medalist Sarah Hughes!
(Her mama's Jewish.)
Houdini and David Blaine escape straightjackets
With such precision,
But one thing they could not get out of...
Their painful circumcision!
Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish,
But a full-time Oscar winner,
Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish too,
And I'd like to put more in her! Whoo!
There's Lou Reed, Perry Farrell,
Beck, and Paula Abdul,
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music,
But first came Hebrew school!
Hey!

Natalie Portmanika
It's time to celebrate Chanukah,
I hope I get an Abtronica
On this joyful, joyful Chanukah,
So get a high colonika
And soil your long-johnnakahs

Adam Sandler,The Goat,/a/adam+sandler/the+goat_20209376.html,"Adam: I am a simple goat.
I live on the back of a pick-up truck.
The Old Man tied me here with a 3 ft. Rope.
Am I happy?
He don't give a fuck.
Old man: Hey goat!
I'm gonna beat your head in with the hickory stick!
Adam: Sometimes he uses his fists-a.
He's filled with anger and filled with rage,
And tells me I smell like piss-a.
His drink, Jimmy Beam.
His chaser, a beer.
After that, various alchohols.
That's when the beatings get so severe,
I sleep,
I pray he falls.
But don't feel sorry for me.
Things weren't always this bad.
Why when I was a young talking goat,
The Old Man was just like my dad.

I come from the hills of Europe.
That's where I met the Old Man.
He was lost in the woods,
I gave him directions,
He gave me a tuna can.
Then he stopped in his tracks and he said,
Old man: Hey goat!
Adam: Would you like to live with me?
I got a house with a pick-up truck
In a place across D. C.-a.
I said, ""sure why not? I got no family. You seem like a nice guy.""
So we went off to America,
The home of apple pie.

On the boat the Old Man told me,
I would be a present for his wife.
""A talking goat,"" he exclaimed,
""She's never seen this in her life!""
I felt so special.
Well, I just couldn't believe it,
After all these years,
I finally had a friend.
He trimmed my beard,
He scraped my hooves,
I prayed it would never end.

But when we got to his house,
There was no wife.
Only a short, short letter.
It said: I'm leaving you for your brother
Because he fucks me better.
His eyes filled with tears of sadness.
His heart was filled with grief.
To suit himself he drank a pint of Old Grandad,
And beat me like a side of beef.
I screamed, ""send me back to the hills of Europe!""
He just shook his head and said,
Old man: Nope!
Adam: No one will ever leave me again,
To make sure,
Put on the 3 ft. Fucking rope-a.
Present-day I've been on the truck for 51 years.
My only friend is the A. M. Radio.
Sometimes the neighborhood children stop by,
But it's always rocks and beer bottles that they throw.
At first they're excited to see a talking goat,
They gather 'round to hear what I have to say.
But I guess sometimes my stories go on too long,
So they leave and giggle,
I need a bidet.
But you know there was a night
That I did get off the truck,
When the Old Man was passed out drunk.
Three neighborhood kids took me to a rock and roll concert.
The kind of music?
Old school funk.

It was the first time I'd been off the truck,
The music made me lose control.
The lead singer asked if we were having fun,
I said, ""fucking crank that rock and roll-a!""
The women at the show were beautiful,
As they danced sexily on the soft grass.
One of them even petted my fur.
Fuck me in the goat ass!
Then some long-haired guys grabbed me by the horns
And threw me in the mosh pit-a.
They passed me around and treated me nice
Til I nervously sprayed them with shit-a.
Then the music stopped.
And everything was quiet.
And all the rock and rollers started a
Fucking goat riot.
Rock and rollers: Kill the goat!
Kill the goat!
Kill the goat!
Kill the goat!
Adam: They chased me under the bleachers.
They chased me onto the street-a.
They chased me into an alley and said I was dead fucking goat meat-a.
But then I saw a sight,
That I'd never thought I'd see.
The Old Man swinging his hickory stick,
But he wasn't swinging at me.
Old man: fuck you pot smoking turkeys!
Don't you press your luck!
Adam: The long-hairs ran away screaming
As I scrambled onto the truck-a.
When we got home the Old Man said, ""goat you broke the sacred law.""
Adam: No!
Please!
Sorry!
Shit!
""I'll let it go this time,
But if you leave again,
I'll break your fucking jaw. ""
Super!
Great!
Okay!
Thank you Old Man for saving my life.
Thank you again and again.
You could have let them barbeque me,
But you acted like a friend.
""I'm not your friend.
I don't even like you.
I'm just not drunk, "" he said.
To prove his point,
He drank a bottle of grain alchohol,
And beat the fucking shit out of my head.
Ow! Ow! Ow! You're hurting me Old Man.

That night I suffered a concussion,
Deep inside my goat brain.
I still cannot feel my tailbone.
And I'll probably will never walk straight again.
I guess you'd call me,
Escape goat.
A punching bag for the Old Man to mock.
Just because his wife left him,
For his brother's abnormaly large c***.
He could've been my buddy.
But instead he's a crazy old fuck.
And once again I go to sleep,
In my eternal home.......
The back of the pick-up truck.
Good night Old Man!
Old man: Yeah, good night goat!"

[Gary Phelps:] No, I haven't. I'm actually quite nervous, but I just, uh, I --
[Dr. Stewart:] All right, and you were referred to me by anyone...?
[Gary Phelps:] To be honest with you,
I saw your name in the Yellow Pages,
And It said you're good at this stuff, so I just,
I gotta give it a shot, just kick this whole cigarette thing...
[Dr. Stewart:] So smoking is your problem?
[Gary Phelps:] Yeah, I can't stop smoking and it's --
It's finally, like, affecting everything I do,
I can't run, I can't play basketball and all that stuff like that, so I,
I gotta give it up.
[Dr. Stewart:] How long have you smoked, Gary?
[Gary Phelps:] Uh, I started when I was eleven years old, and I just can't kick it, you know?

[Dr. Stewart:] Yeah, right. [small, barely noticeable fart]
All right, Gary, why don't you just have a seat here and sit down and just relax --
What I do is hypnosis.
[Gary Phelps:] Right.
[Dr. Stewart:] Basically I just want you to sit back and relax --
Let yourself sit back and relax and sink into the chair, and,
Um, just feel comfortable and trust me.

And I just want you to again relax and try to concentrate on nothing.
Okay? That's it. Now I'm gonna count backwards from five to zero --
[Gary Phelps:] Right.
[Dr. Stewart:] -- and I just want you to relax, and you're going to fall into a deep state of mind --
Of subconsciousness -- you're very comfortable,
I'll be counting back from five, I just want you to relax,

[Dr. Stewart:] Hmm? Just concentrate now. That's it.
Close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. Okay. Now.
We're very comfortable.
Five [small fart], we're thinking of nothing except being comfortable
And nothing's bothering us. Okay.
When I say the word ""relax,"" listen to me, you're sinking, you're sinking, [medium fart]

I'm just having a tough time concentrating --
[Dr. Stewart:] Hmm? Here we go -- there, there, we're relaxing, we're relaxing
[fart and cough together] three, two, two --
[Gary Phelps:] I was just going to ask you if you could maybe stop doing that.
I can't concentrate when you're doing that.
[Dr. Stewart:] This is what I do. It's a counting-down thing.
We're relaxing now. Just relax -- let it go,
Don't focus on anything else, just concentrate on what we're doing here.
Three, two, relax, relax, that's it, just relax [fart], we're relaxing now --

It's getting a little irritating --

We're to two, and all we're thinking about is healthy, fresh air.
Freshness. Breathing in. Breathing in deep, letting out. [fart]
[Gary Phelps:] Sir, I'd appreciate if you could stop 'letting it out'.
But okay, okay, fine, thank you.
[Dr. Stewart:] That's it, you're all right, everything's good.
All right, you feel very comfortable, you're sinking into the chair,
We're relaxing, one [long fart], and we're coming down to zero and --
[Gary Phelps:] Oh my god, uh... Yes, all right, it was nothing...
[Dr. Stewart:] No, no, that time that was you.
[Gary Phelps:] That wasn't me!

[Dr. Stewart: We're not here to pick sides, we're not here to pick sides, that was you, and maybe we could deal with this in another session, but right now we're dealing with the smoking, and, um, let's not worry about anything else that's going down --
[Gary Phelps: ok, I've just gotta kick this habit.
[Dr. Stewart: Down to zero, relaxing, we're going to feel very fresh [fart], we're going to feel very healthy [fart], and let's take a nice, deep breath --
[Gary Phelps: I can't breathe, sir, uh, I'm sorry, I just -- [""squirty"" fart]
[Gary Phelps: Oh my god -- what did you eat? It smells like baby food --

[Dr. Stewart:] All right, we're relaxing --
That one probably squirted out a little into the pants,
But we'll just continue with thte floating [fart] --
Yeah, that was definitely a squirt --
But here we go, one, zero, we are under.
Are you relaxed?
[Gary Phelps:] Yeah, I'm under, I guess.
[Dr. Stewart:] Here we go, relaxing, relaxing.
You're under a deep trance, you will not smoke anymore,

All right -- you smell nothing; I'm perfectly clean. I have no bad gas; it was all from outside or from -- from -- you yourself. And let's not forget the smoking thing that's why you're here. No smoking. Repeat after me: I am a smelly pig.
[Gary Phelps:] What?
[Dr. Stewart:] All right, we're moving along, and we; 're relaxed. [fart]
All right, and now we're going to count back up, up one to five,
[Gary Phelps:] ok, you know, I think this is fine, I don't want to smoke...
[Dr. Stewart:] Gary, settle down, relax, and when I get to five,
You will snap out of this, and you won't remember this,
Especially the smell, the smell was from you.
All right? And here we go.
Zero, we're coming out of it, you're waking up slowly, your eyes are opening,
One, you're feeling good, and when you wake up,
You'll feel wide awake and perfect you'll feel whole and [fart] all-righty,
I ripped that one out there and I apologize.
I ripped a good one there. That was a nice out..
[Gary Phelps:] That was not nice.
[Dr. Stewart:] Here we go, and, we're coming right [fart]
[Gary Phelps:] What was that?
[Dr. Stewart:] That was three.
[Gary Phelps:] It didn't sound like three.
[Dr. Stewart:] three, I'm counting, and four, it's no smell in here, and you don't smoke, you don't want a cigarette, no, and here we go [fart] five, and -- [snap] Do you want a cigarette?
[Gary Phelps:] No I don't.

Adam Sandler,The Lonesome Kicker,/a/adam+sandler/the+lonesome+kicker_20003956.html,"Me, I'm the Lonesome Kicker
Extra points, field goals at your service
One might think it comes with glory
You might think different after you listen to my story

My helmet is equipped with a tiny face mask
What it possibly could protect, I do not know
The other guys on the team
Like to make fun of my little shoulder pads
And also like to hide the special shoe
I need to kick in the snow

People think it's so easy
To kick a field goal from the 30 yard line
They forget to add seven yards for the snap
And 10 more 'cause the goal posts are pushed way back

In 1974, the uprights were right on the goal line
But some of the players were running into them
And getting hurt
So screw the kicker
Who cares about the kicker?

But I kick that ball
And I pray it goes straight
If it does
The coach says ""Good job, number 8""
He doesn't even know my name is
Andre Kristacovitchlalinski, Jr.
But that's the life I live
The Lonesome Kicker

Kickoffs can be so very scary
Especially, if the returner breaks on through
And I'm the only guy on the playing field left to tackle him
I don't want to get hurt
So I pretend to tie my shoe

Once again, I'm ignored by my teammates and all my coaches
""Go back where you came from!""
Scream 70, 000 fans
Well, I know I could win their love back
By catching a winning touch-down
But, unfortunately, I was born with these very small hands

And I hope that the cameras don't come in too close
'Cause they might see the tears in my eyes
As I sit on this bench made of cold-hearted wood
And the splinters go deep in my thighs
And the towel boy snickers as he walks by
The Lonesome Kicker

Another blocked kick
And everybody blames me
But it was the Left Guard
Who didn't pick up his man
Oh, why can't they see...

In my home country
I could have been a minor league soccer player
But I came to America
Seeking fortune and seeking fame
I didn't realize that if I shanked one
And blew the point spread
Some drunk guys would push me into their hibachi
After the game

So I go home at night
'Cause I never get invited
To go drinking with the other guys
And I sit in my chair, and I soak my foot
As I eat a plate of cold french fries
And my wife's out with her quote-unquote friend
And my son can't look me in the eyes
But that's the life I live
The Lonesome Kicker

Kicking for you
They took my snow shoe
They're going for two"

Ya'll ain't seen shit yet
Eh yo man let em know
Oh yeah, guess who's back
It's the mother fuckin pussy with the little nutsack
Don't care about cheddar or the paper chase
I'm a fuckin grown man with zits on my face
A straight up chicken shit
A pansy ass punk
If I'm if I'm guarding your ass it's an automatic slam dunk
While thugs are at the party bustin all ya'lls asses
I'm hidin in the corner wonderin where the fuck's my glasses
Can't afford no rims my
My fuckin dick's so small no bitch can suck it
I don't pop 9's I got weak rhymes
Back in 9 duce I got pissed on 10 times
I roll solo I ain't got no clue
I said please don't hit me more than a cow says moo
Afraid of heights I'm a-scared in the dark
I walk an extra 3 miles to avoid crazy fucks in the park
Denied by the bloods, turned down by the crypts
My fuckin auntie kicked my ass and she got 2 plastic hips
When I step to the club feel free to stare me down
Because I just got re-elected the mayor of pussytown
May-or-of-pus-sy-town
When bangers hit the street I stay home and watch tv
Slumped out on the couch so no one can see
Unless I hear somebody knockin on my door
Then you'll see me crawlin cross the mother fuckin floor
I've been a fuckin coward every day of my life,
That's why I pretend I don't know everyone's banging my wife
I won't sit on the porch, I don't want no trouble
I'm more afraid of goin out than the fuckin boy in a bubble
When the shit goes down I make a break so fast
Look like a mother fuckin rocket goin past
Searchin for the sneakiest place to hide
Straight into the ladies room, ain't got no pride
Slippin slidin, runnin hidin
You know damn well it's a scooter I'm ridin
Oh no here we go, out come the glocks
I take off so fast I pop out my socks
You gonna fuck with me, i'll cry then run
I called the cops when I got shot with a fuckin squirt gun
He clams up he shuts down
His pants he almost s***s
He'll even look the other way if you grab his grandma's tits
Well I had a little poodle but neighbor's stoled her
I'd shoot her with an ak but the kick hurts my shoulder
I can't pop no gun and I can't fist fight
Hell I'm afraid to take out the fuckin garbage at night
I use the steps in the pool cause I'm terrified to dive
Don't fuck with my floaties they's whats keepin me alive, bitch
Never drank remy never delt crack
One time I smoked weed I had a panic attack
If you're looking for my dick in the mens locker room
Just bring your binoculars with a fuckin super zoom
Naw I'm just playin I don't fuckin change in there
The one time I did got my bush sprayed off with nair
But did I stick up for myself no fuckin doubt
I did what I do best, I broke the fuck out
I ain't lookin at you I ain't tryin to front
It's aight with me you called my jimmy a c***
Freakin sneakin crawlin creepin
When the gangs are bangin I'm in the basement sleepin
I'm straight from the streets seen trouble in every side
When the shit hits the fan I throw on a fuckin disguise
Fake nose fake wig fake beard
It all worked pretty good
Sometimes I just use a map and a funny accent
And pretend I got lost in the hood mother fucker
Now all you coward mother fuckers out there
Walkin round with your head hangin low
Just cause you ate one dick
Just know
My man the mayor, had to suck off his whole high school
Case closed

My sister's on the dope and my brother always picks his nose
And Daddy's only happy when he's wearing Mama's pantyhose, yeah
I just lost my job to a God damn robot (Good times!)
Then my dog got in the freeze box, he ate everything I got
But I've got my mule
He's a very, very nice mule
He walks with me home from school
Cause he's a very, very nice mule
When he was a baby my mother fed him gruel
But now he prefers to dine on his own stool
He always philosophizes with the rabbis after shul
Cause he's a very, very pious mule
When he sees a picture of a carrot he has a tendency to druel
On Halloween he tries to scare me by dressing up as a ghoul
He once challenged someone who stole my hat to a duel
Cause he's a very, very Old school mule
A needle-nosed plier is his favorite tool
He lifeguards on a volunteer basis and the Rec. Center pool
When I break down on the side of the road he shows up with unleaded fuel
He's a devoted fan of Ms. Paula Abdul
And also approves of the recent makeover of former folkie Jewel
(coughing)
When I told him Halle Berry's husband cheated he just shook his head and said to himself 'what a fool'
Cause he's a very, very monogamous mule
(snoring) Porkchop! Wake up, man, the session's not over!
After several well-publicized arrests for public urination he now drinks exclusively O'Doul
And every year he puts on a presentation at the Boys Club to show kids smoking isn't cool
His favorite Elvis song is 'Don't be Cruel', no it's 'Hound Dog'

In my big brown shoe
Love to eat the turkey
At the table
I once saw a movie
With Betty Grable
Eat that turkey
All night long
Fifty million Elvis fans
Can't be wrong
Turkey lurkey doo and
Turkey lurkey dap
I eat that turkey
Then I take a nap

Thanksgiving is a special night
Jimmy Walker used to say Dynomite
That's right
Turkey with gravy and cranberry
Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry
Turkey for you and
Turkey for me
Can't believe Tyson
Gave that girl V.D.

White meat, dark meat
You just can't lose
I fell off my moped
And I got a bruise
Turkey in the oven
And the buns in the toaster
I'll never take down
My Cheryl Tiegs poster
Wrap the turkey up
In aluminum foil
My brother likes to masturbate
With baby oil
Turkey and sweet potato pie
Sammy Davis Jr.
Only had one eye

Turkey for the girls and
Turkey for the boys
My favorite kind of pants
Are corduroys
Gobble gobble goo and
Gobble gobble gickel
I wish turkey
Only cost a nickel
Oh I love turkey on Thanksgiving

Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"

But time keeps on going
And you keep on growin'
You're now six years old
You're getting so good at your spellin'
But my mind is always dwellin'
On the fact that you could be the kind of guy
Who grows up and needs to smoke weed on the couch
All the time
All the time

So answer me this while you're lying in your little bed
Why must you insist on bein' such a fuckin' pothead?
There's other things in life
That can make you feel good
But you just keep on smoking' your herb
You can't get enough of your precious, precious reefer
Where you getting all this money
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?"

And I hope you had as much fun as I did and here's one last little diddy just for you.

I used to ride my big wheel, and sell lemonade,
Eat popcorn with grandpa while we watched the parade
But now I'm only happy when I'm drinking J.D.
What the hell happened to me?

I used to have fun throwing snowballs with my best friend Billy
And Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly
But now I only get excited when I see a girl pee
What the hell happened to me?

I used to be the nicest kid in the neighborhood
I only did the things that Momma said I should
But now I just do whatever I want
I even whipped it out in a restaurant

I used to help clean the park in the middle of town
And then played kickball til the sun went down
But now all I do is get VD,
What the hell happened to me?

It makes no sense
I can't believe I ended on me
I'm out of my gourd
Won't somebody please, help me?

A do-do-do-do doo a do-do waa do-do-we-oh

I'm kind of a wierdo"

For almost two whole years
We had no secrets
We had no fears
There was nothing we wouldn't do
When we were in the sack
She'd even pop the zit on my back

But one night I was out cheating
After I drank a few
She caught me red handed
And said we're through
Now she's got a new boyfriend
It nearly gave me a heart attack

''cause who's gonna pop this zit on my back?
Well I got a pimple and I don't know why
It keeps growing in the same place
I can't reach it with my left or right hand
I wish it was on my face
It's four days old
And it hurts so bad
But it's ready for a squeeze
Won't somebody pop it for me please?
I'll give you ten dollars

If you're a girl in this lonely world
And you're looking for a guy
I'll never cheat again, I promise
That's no lie
There's only one thing I ask of you
Could we name our first child Zak?
Oh, one more thing
Please pop this zit on my back

I'm dying here!
A pimple ay-hee
A pop-a-doodly-doo
Squirt heedly-hoo

Well I'm sitting alone by the phone
And no one seems to call
I try to scrape my zit off on the kitchen wall
Well that don't work, so I look around
And find a big shiny thumb-tack
Put it on the floor, lay down
Pop the zit on my back"

But somebody knew about you baby and that you? D change
It was me 'cause I could see my love would turn you around

Chorus:
You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

[Verse 2:]:
I always say never say never boy, but you did
That's when I took your mind and flipped the script
Your boys talkin' 'bout you're falling off
And that you're whipped
But who are they to say when it's all my love I give to you

Chorus:
You used to love them, leave them, kiss them
Break their hearts, but now I got you in my arms
You used to get them, trick them, diss them
Do them wrong, but now your playa days are gone

On the way to the spot where people hang

Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became somethin'
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This the shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself

Feeling ain't been in music hooks ain't been the same

I still remember the pain you gave me.
I can't believe you, I gotta leave you.
I'm packin up 'n' you can hit the road jack.
You can take these things that you gave me,
Cause I'm never comin back.*

At the drop of a dime

I ca-ca-call on your cell (why's he in such a hurry)
Leaving the room, he's mumbling, too
Asking for his shoes, (just leaving outt he blue)
No explanation, no actual location
Just watching him pacing (wonder who he's stressing)
Little conversation, leavin' no debation, he left the door swingin'

You better open your mi-in-ind
To read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines

9 in the morning, up, up, up way before breakfast
Homeboy gettin restless
(the room is full of questions)
Little replyin, whole lot of denyin'
You're steady collidin
(so why do he keep on trying)
I s-search for the median, now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason
(he's changing like the seasons)
Are you still pleasing, well soon you'll be leaving
Which one will be grieving?

You better open your mind

It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told

It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines

Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause I, I know what's going on
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
Cause that, that ain't what I'm on
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause you'll look up, and I'll be gone
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
'cause I read between the lines

Who got you thinkin' you ishh ain't been stinkin'?
My temperatures peakin'
(why are you barely speakin)
I'm bustin' his bubble, and he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles
(I'm listening but hardly believing)
Changing the story, or trying to ignore me
Still reaching out for me
(but still I'm hardly reaching)
Give me a reason to put you back on line
You've wasted enough time

I had to open my mind
To read between the lines-ines

I fiend for all beats, like girls jump for dicks
Don't salt the next man, keep that Lindbergh shit
Up in the cut, like gay niggaz, in butt
I'm black wit indian, my race should be mutt
I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
E-valuate this rap, take heed a fuckin genius
Up in the sky, up high, don't puff lye
Do you smoke crack Sam? Prepare to fuckin' die
Fuck Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight, but I got ten mo'
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like pop's feet, make sweat wit no heat

Verse 2:
[Timbaland]
I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L. A., then come back to Virginia
Then call, Maganoo, to see if he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget, to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please please, brother don't slam my car do'
It costs too much money to get that shit fixed
I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time, for the shuckin and jivin
Peep my rhyme, cause that, shit's off-timin

Verse 3:
[Missy]
I'm in the Marriott, the place to get got
After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots
Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid named Scott

Touch my hot spot, I scream til I can't stop
Uhhhhhhhhhhhh (what, what?)
Give it to me daddy and

Give it up! We gon' show, you how we party...

Verse 4:
[Magoo]
Prepare to get wet, like jerry curl juice
You tight like virgin pussy, my rap get you loose
I bump like ac-ne, take honey from a bee
My style is like a safe, without da fuckin key
I c** cause I'm a nut, don't bleed when I'm cut
No fan of Madonna, she just a damn s***
So sit you damn dog, and bow to my shit
Nit-wit you stupid, I'm butter don't need grits
Make fits like seizure, lick c*** to please ya
I book then read ya, follow da leader
Like Jews and Chinese, I own your rap lease
The wackness must cease, prepare for yo' release

Verse 5:
[Timbaland]
I'm up in these labels tryin to, handle my business
Been makin more beats before, Jehovah had witness
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me
Brother brother, please, turn on the tv
See a black man dead, from a white man's powder
See a white man scared, from a black man's power
Back to reality, please don't freakin smile at me
This is a stick-up, so give up yo' wallet please

Verse 6:
[Missy]
I'm the best, and that's B, and that's capital
I hang low like testicles, mc's wanna copy these many flows
Hoes, better back up, foe they get slapped up
Pack up and go tell mommy, that I backed up you
You you you, and your whole screw
What, whatcha whatcha whatcha gon' do uhh, what whatcha gon' do
To me, the M-I-double S-Y-E
Wanna battle me, it's gonna be some tragedy

Chorus:

Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me (repeat 4X)

Lets resolve it
We can solve it, What's the causes?

I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out
I want to know: Were your fingers broke?
If you had let me know, I wouldn't have put on my clothes
I want to know: Where'd you go instead?
Cause it was 4 in the morning, When you crept back in the bed
I want to know: What was in your head?
Or what was in my head? Am I supposed to change?

Girl holla!!
You give me bits and pieces
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season, Maybe the month, Maybe the building
Now tell me what's the reason? Stupid yo? Looks are deceiving
So, cut the crying, Cut the coughing, Cut the weazing, Girl
Quit the blaming, Cut the naming, Cut the sleeping, Girl
I think you need some prayer, Better call the deacon, Girl
So, get your act right or else we won't be speaking, Girl
So, what's it gonna be? Fikifiki... Me and you?
Or is it gonna be who blames who?
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars

You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)

So make up your mind, cause I ain't got no time
Y'know? (c'mon)

[Nas]
I'm the most wanted baby fathe, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
you thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim
but I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you ridin with me
You keep askin, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit tryin
before you find what you lookin for and get to cryin
You always sayin what you gon' do if you catch me lyin

Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his key
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig peice
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
but I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doin his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
But I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

Thinking of me you gettin the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open; but -- you just my close friend
Get it baby?

Me and the boys were feelin' alright
Then we walked the streets feelin' loads of pride
Proud with our Boots and our way of lives...

Then stood some geezers tried to steal the night
Stared at us, tried to pick a fight
Me and the boys were waiting for the start
As we prepared for an aggro, oh! What a night...

That's the story of how our lives go
We have been treated like a bunch of snucked up fools
Scorned by many, understood by few
There's not much things left for us to do
Don't wanna go back to dark days of mine
Where I've gone too far, I could've killed someone
But I don't wanna sit down behaving like a cunt
While watching my mates doing the best they can

In the streets of uptown
Streets op uptown
It is our ups and our downs...
And it goes around and around...

In the streets of uptown
Streets of uptown
It is our laugh and our tears
And it will last for years..."

While poor still struggling for money

Some work from morn' till night
What they receive are just ain't right
Rich old bastards just havin' a laugh
Seeing some people hard to survive

Unfairground

It's so hard to feed wives and kids
When the pay are just enough for one to eat
Ain't no school for the kids
No good jobs for the one who ain't fit

Giving the pay that ain't enough

O’ your fallen out
Go and sow your courses

If I rise, they are on my drive
If I believe, it’s more than it is
More than it is

If I rise, one more chance
All our dreams, more than this
O’ your taller now I’ve found
Hold your fire course

If I believe, it’s more than it is
It’s more than it is

If I thought I wanted more
Get the life more
Just one more call
Though I’ve never lost
Believe I don’t care
Never again

If I rise, they are on my drive
If I believe, it’s more than it is
It’s more than it is

If I thought I wanted more

Anymore than this"

Run so fast they can't even catch me
Been that gypsy
Touch me I'll show you tricks with my stick stacks quickly

Pick up the packs on my journey
Dogs run, they start to follow me
Have my luck, some days they suck
When you live for the buck
We get for the family

One day I wanna be a star
So I get to hang in a bar
I'll go to Vegas with the playas
Just to forget my scars

Sweat shops have made me shifty
Like a ninja with speed I'm nifty
I hope I live 'til I'm fifty
See my city go from gritty to pretty"

A.R. Rahman,Tu Hi Re,/a/ar+rahman/tu+hi+re_21426609.html,"Tu hi re, tu hi re tere bina main kaise jiyu
Aajaa re, aajaa re, yu he tadpa na tu mujhko
Jaan re, jaan re, in saanso mein bas jaa tu
Chaand re, chaand re, aajaa dil ki zameen pe tu

Chahat hai agar aake mujhase mil jaa tu
Yaa phir aaisa kar, dharti se mila de mujhko
Tu he re, tu he re tere bina main kaise jiyu
Aajaa re, aajaa re, yu he tadpa na tu mujhko

In saanso ka dekho tum paagalpan ke
Aaye nahi inhe chain
Mujhase ye boli main raahon mein teri
Apne bichhaa du ye nain
In uunche pahaadon se jaan de dunga main
Gar tum naa aai kahi
Tum udhar jaan ummeed meri jo todo
Idhar ye jahaan chhodu main
Maut aur, zindagi, tere haathon mein de diya re

Aayi re, aayi re, le main aayi hu tere liye
Toda re, toda re, har bandhan ko pyar ke liye
Jaan re, jaan re, aajaa tujhamein sama jaau main
Dil re dil re, teri saanson mein bas jaau main

Chaahat hai agar aake mujhase mil jaa tu
Yaa phir aisaa kar, dharati se milaa de mujhko
Tu hi re, tu hi re tere bina main kaise jiyu
Aajaa re, aajaa re, yu he tadpa na tu mujhko


Aa

Sau baar bulaaye main sau baar aaun,
Ik baar jo dil diya
Ik aankh roye to duji bolo,
Soyegi kaise bhala,
In pyaar ki raahon mein patthar hain kitane
Un sab ko he paar kiya
Ek nadi hoon main chaahat bhari aaj milne
Saagar ko aayi yahaan
Sajnaa, sajnaa, aaj aansu bhi meethe lage

Tu hi re, tu hi re tere bina main kaise jiyu
Aajaa re, aajaa re, yu he tadpa na tu mujhko
Jaan re, jaan re, in saanso mein bas jaa tu
Chaand re, chaand re, aajaa dil ki zameen pe tu

Pal pal pal pal waqt to bitaa jaaye re
Zaraa bol zaraa bol waqt se ke vo tham jaaye re
Aayi re, aayi re, le main aayi hu tere liye
Jaan re, jaan re, aajaa tujhamein samaa jaau main"
A.R. Rahman,Tu Koi Aur Hai,/a/ar+rahman/tu+koi+aur+hai_21429227.html,"Tu Koi Aur Hai
Jaanta Hai Tu
Saamne Iss Jahaan Ke
Ik Naqaab Hai
Tu Aur Hai Koi Aur Hai
Kyun Nahi Wo Jo Hai
Tu Jahaan Ke Waaste
Khud Ko Bhool Kar
Apne Hi Saath Naa
Aise Zulm Kar
Khol De Wo Girah
Jo Lagaaye Tujhpe Tu
Bol De Tu Koi Aur Hai
Chehre Jo Odhe Tune Woh
Tere Kahaan Hain
Saamne Aa Khol De Sab
Jo Hai Dil Mein Bol De Ab
Saamne Aa Khol De Sab
Jo Hai Dil Mein Bol De Ab
Tedhe Raaste Khwaab Hain Tere
Tere Saath Jo Umr Bhar Chale
O Inhe Gale Lagaa
Tu Kaun Hai Bataa
O Khol De Ye Girah
Tu Koi Aur Hai
Teri Naa Hadein
Aasmaan Hai
Khayal Hai
Bemisaal Hai
Tu Mauj Hai
Tu Raunaqein
Chaahe Jo Tu Wo Hai."

 Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
 Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain

 Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behta Hoon Main Nili Raaton Mein
 Main Jaagta Rehta Hoon, Nind Bhari Jheel Se Aankhon Mein
 Awaaz Hoon Main

 Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
 Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain

 Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain

 Raat Mein Chandani Kabhi Aisi Gungunati Hain
 Sun Jara Lagata Hain Tumase Awaaz Milaati Hain
 Main Khayalo Ki Mehak Hu, Gungunaate Saaj Par
 Ho Sake To Milale, Awaaj Ko Mere Saaj Par

 Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
 Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
 Tu Hi To Meri Dost Hain
 Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behata Hoon Main Nili Raato Mein
 Main Jaagta Rehta Hoon, Nind Bhari Jheel Se Aankhon Mein
 Awaaz Hoon Main

 O Kabhi Dekha Hain Saahil, Jahan Sham Utarati Hain
 Kehate Hain Samunder Se, Ek Pari Guzarati Hain
 Woh Raat Ki Rani Hain, Sargam Par Chalati Hain
 Se Ra Se Ra Se Ra, Sa Re Sa Sa Re Sa

 Aaja Main Hawaon Pe Bithake Le Chalu Tu Hi To
 Tu Hi To Mera Dost Hain
 Aaja Main Khalaon Mein Uthake Le Chalu
 Tu Hi To Mera Dost Hain

 Awaaz Ka Dariya Hoon, Behati Hoon Main Nili Raaton Mein
 Main Jaagti Rehti Hoon, Nind Bhari Jheel Si Aankhon Mein
 Awaaz Hoon Main - (2)"
A.R. Rahman,Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera,/a/ar+rahman/yeh+jo+des+hai+tera_21428639.html,"( Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera, Swades Hai Tera
Tujhe Hai Pukara....
Yeh Woh Bandhan Hai Jo Kabhi Toot Nahin Sakta )...(2)

Mitti Ki Hai Jo Khushboo, Tu Kaise Bhulayega
Tu Chahe Kahin Jayeh, Tu Laut Ke Aayega
Nayee-Nayee Raho Mein, Dabi-Dabi Aaho Mein
Khoyeh-Khoyeh Dil Se Tere Koi Yeh Kahega
Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera, Swades Hai Tera
Tujhe Hai Pukara....
Yeh Woh Bandhan Hai Jo Kabhi Toot Nahin Sakta

Tujhse Zindagi Hai Yeh Kah Rahi
Sab To Pa Liya, Ab Hai Kya Kami
Yun To Sare Sukh Hai Barse, Par Door Tu Hai Apne Ghar Se
Aa Laut Chal Tu Ab Deewane, Jahan Koi To Tujhe Apna Mane
Aawaz De Tujhe Bulane, Wohi Des
Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera, Swades Hai Tera
Tujhe Hai Pukara....
Yeh Woh Bandhan Hai Jo Kabhi Toot Nahin Sakta

Yeh Pal Hai Wohi, Jismein Hain Chhupi
Poori Ik Sadi, Sari Zindagi
Tu Na Pooch Raaste Mein Kahe, Aaye Hain Is Tarah Dorahe
Tu Hi To Hai Raah Jo Sujhayeh, Tu Hi To Hai Ab Jo Yeh Batayeh
Jaye To Kis Disha Mein Jaye, Wohi Des
Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera, Swades Hai Tera
Tujhe Hai Pukara....
Yeh Woh Bandhan Hai Jo Kabhi Toot Nahin Sakta"
