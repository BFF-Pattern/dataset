Start moving, the road is so opened up that it's like you can't see it

I'll always be able to walk along like this

It wasn't by chance, and it wasn't an everyday dream either

But it reminds me of the sky, when we were together.
I can still see the ocean from my house
I'm looking and waiting for you here.

The days have changed and gone by,
But our summer is still there, in my surfboard
I remember the sun then, like it was yesterday
Ne, I can still hear your voice.

You said to me ""I'm not going cry, э?
We waved each other goodbye silently.
We didn't say any words: our hands did that for us.
You melted into the sunset, but I Remember You.

Every time I hold your old, rusty guitar,
I hear our song tugging at my heart.
The days seem so cloudy now,
Passing by one after the other.

But I remember thinking:
""I know we're living for someone. э?
Yeah, the sun told that to me.
Ne, I can still hear you.

Yui,It All Too Much,/y/yui/it+all+too+much_20850156.html,"The night is turning into a shade of cobalt
The chilly star studded sky is glimmering
There's no need for words of any sort

Rather than trying to uncover the truth concealed behind tears
I'm better off with baseless predictions
Sitting on the bench where the lights have already gone out
And gazing up
It was a shooting star with only idealities surfacing

Nee! Would someone enlighten me
If I were to live life as it is simply
I would gather all the miracles dispersed throughout the universe
And try overcoming them
All because these emotions which are pulsing throughout my body
Are dictating me
This wouldn't do
Am I right?

Being as decisive as cast dice
And not ever having regrets
I hope to move onward to the next destination
The rule book which was created uncertainly
Only timidity appeared later
I continue watching the backs of my rivals
That,
As naked as the moonlight
Was a shooting star which strayed from a pure heart

Nee! Would someone enlighten me
To live life as it is simply
Innocence does not suffice
You can't escape from conflicts too
Those lessons which I have learnt time after time
Are definitely dictating me
What should I do
It's a lie isn't it?

Simply daydreaming
Will not get me anywhere
It also can't make me more pleasant
I wonder why?

... It's all too much

Nee! Would someone enlighten me
In order to live life as it is simply
I want to change even the toughest obstacles facing me into something humorous
And then laugh it off
Because there is no way to resolve it
It is buried within everyday life

That is why I wish to believe
Miracles do exist don't they?
Am I right?"

We walked with our heads down,
Unable to laugh in the same way
People hurry past
""Has your dream come true?""
I'm still struggling

I'd rather try living well now than go back to when
I was a kid
Cowardice is being born

I went out to a place where the sun shone
And held out my arms
And thought
Could I cross the sky?
I still can't see any wings to fly with
It's because it's not simple
That I can go on living

Just picking up a wet puppy
Made tears overflow
In a way that was funny

I want to be loved, I just want to be loved
I said,
But you can't just long for something

When I was a kid there were days
When I hurt my mother terribly
I want to
Change everything now

I went out to a place where the sun shone and
Gripped tightly with my hands
I can smash that place, that time,
And change my life

But there's no way I can tell you
Everything that's in my heart
It's because it's not simple
That I can go on living

I go out to a place where the sun shines
And open up a map, but
I know... You know...
You can't help getting lost
I can change my life

All the days that have passed
Have made me who I am now
It's because it's not simple that
I can go on living"

But in reality I sometimes worry about
Love and the day to day grind Those rolling days!

You would never hold a lie, no never

SUMMER SONG [translation]

The sun is on my side because you're waving to me, suntanned and all
Have been anticipating this Diving like a mermaid into the season of promises

In a corner of the school grounds the sunflowers are blooming Just being shy will look uncool
To the extent of wanting to yell into the blue sky now I'm thinking of you

Summer is here so let's go to the sea
Though there may be days where we stop in our tracks and feel lost just for a second

Disheartening days Revitalizing days Meeting you and laughing together
The summer holidays are beginning lan la lan la~

Because true emotions are reflected upon the back of my running figure
It shimmers on the other side of my T-shirt just like magic

Your words which are being drown out by the sounds of the fireworks, dissolve into the night breeze
Can't hear the important details but I seem to know what it is

Ah long long long time I have been longing for this
Youth is something which is a teeny bit mean isn't it

Disheartening days Revitalizing days Meeting you and laughing together
The summer holidays are beginning lan la lan la~

Sitting on the sandy shores Both of us taking notice of the time
Hearing the sound of the waves and being unable to make any promise at all

Definitely will feel nostalgic someday
Can't depend on the future written in the sand

Disheartening days Revitalizing days Meeting you and laughing together
""It's a bright red-blue""

Because summer is here we came to the sea
Don't wish to forget that sky where the rainbow has formed

Disheartening days Revitalizing days Meeting you and laughing together
The summer holidays are beginning lan la lan la~"

I want to cling to this moment
I don't understand myself

I shouldn't be able to do it all over again
Even if I try to hide away in a city that no one knows about
I'll still just think about the moment, over the window sill

I want to run away from the urge
I'll be lost in excuses until I do run away

If I follow my torn up memories
I should be able to get back to then
Like the boy on that day, a long time ago

I was born for my dreams to come true
I drew out the cosmos in the days when I was young
I'm a baby, I don't want to cry
If I have my grief in my own hands
Then it will be so good

When it comes to fighting against life
Win or lose, there's no helping it
I understand things like that

I want to cry from the shock
My pulse races from running toward tomorrow

I want to live honestly
I just want to live honestly
Like the boy on that day

I was born for my dreams to come true
I felt the breath from the days when I was young
I'm a baby, I don't want to cry
If I have my grief in my own hands
Then it will be so good

I don't want to trip over someone's words
I don't want to be deceived...

Certainly tomorrow is shining too
It's alright that I can't go back to the days when I was young
Tomorrow's way of life, I'm afraid of it, but
I can't go back to standing on the road

I was born for my dreams to come true
I drew out the cosmos in the days when I was young
I'm a baby, I don't want to cry

Once a peaceful man laid his old head down by a river,
Thought about his childhood life, his father and forgiver,
Couldn't hide away, hide away.

He controlled the horses with a handclap or a whisper,
Drink he couldn't combat but he knew he was no sinner,
Couldn't hide away, hide away.

He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away.

Better men have realized alone is not a venture,
A decent man would realize alone is not a venture,
Just to hide away, hide away.

He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away."

Was blind, but now I see.

And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun."

Let us be lovers
We'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag

So we bought a pack of cigarettes
And Mrs. Wagner's Pies
And walked on, walked on, walked on
To look for America

'Kathy, ' I said as we boarded a Greyhound to Pittsburg,
'Michigan seems like a dream to me now'
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
All gone to look for America
All gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the Gabardine suit was a spy
I said, 'Be carefull his bow tie is really a camera. '

Kathy I'm lost I said
Although I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and I'm aching
And I don't know why

Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America

Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Changed only for a sound of sight, the space agreed
Between the pictures of time behind the face of need
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evenin', nights with you

Coins and crosses never know the fruitless worth
Cords are broken, locked inside the Mother Earth
They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by and you and I

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you

Sad preacher nailed upon the colored door of time
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
Political ends, as sad remains will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same

In the end, we'll agree
We'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you, with you

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid

And there again reflected on the dreams of everyone.
Out of the starlight night the telling of all our lives,
And racing faster than the Northwestern World.

Starpoint to compass: We look to the North
To return to the centre: Angkor what.

I could not take it oh so seriously really
When you called and said you'd seen a ufo
But then it dawned on me the message in writing
Spelt out a meeting never dreamed of before

I looked out, in the night
Strange and startling
Was this voice of time just saying
There's got to be a linking of everyone
Got to be a centre
It all comes flooding back

Arriving thru eons of times immortal power of the future to behold
Vessels of a different impression, none that we could ever hope to have
known

So look out, in the night
Once they arrive
On that perennial light
Impress a bolder empire of energy
In the ships we see
The coming of outer space

You say there's no reason to conjure
With the force as it has been known to be see
You say I'm a fool, a believer
Put your feet on the earth it is green

But look out, in the night
Wait for they arrive
To start such sciences anew
Here it is the coming of outer space
Such a pure delight
The coming of outer space"

Stood a man with glasses held high,
Wondering when to do it again

Somewhere flying high.

Wandering where lights go,
Leave out the body load.

Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in being.

Yes,Believe Again,/y/yes/believe+again_21084974.html,"So I climbed to the height of a mountain line
Is there a vision here
Woven to touch
And all to capture light?
Surely the stream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I'm really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days

There I knelt at the foot of an open sky
Is it by faith, not time
The sun does climb
To light the path for us?
And I can embrace where I'm going
Tomorrow has already found me

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
I lost my touch to handle with kid gloves
In the rough game of push and shove
I lost sight
I used to believe in your love
To be believed in
Once more tonight

Will you speak to me fathers?
Grant me the words
That one day I'll be called to speak
And finally I am here understanding
The clear and constant page
Despite the shroud of material ways
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If you lose your touch to handle with kid gloves
In the hard game of push and shove
Don't lose sight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight

Surely this dream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I'm really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If it all comes down to push and shove
Remember to lift your heart above the fight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in

To turn wrong to right
Beyond all the pain and the strife
Ride the turning tide
Lift a strength deep inside
We can transform wrong to right

We can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight"
Yes,Beyond And Before,/y/yes/beyond+before_20148477.html,"(Squire/Bailey)

Sparkling trees of silver foam cast shadows in winter home,
Swaying branches breaking sound, lonely forest trembling ground.
Masquerading leaves of blue run circles round the morning dew,
Patterns understood by you, reaching out beyond and before.
Time, like gold dust, brings mind down to hidden levels underground,
Say a few words to the wind, that's all that's left of winter's friend.

Reaching the snow in the days of the cold, casting a spell out of ice.
Now that you're gone,
The summer's too long and it seems like the end of my life
Beyond and before.
Time, like gold dust, brings mind down."

The time.  The Aborigines still call this 'the day of the cloud. '

A new born land
Dreaming by the sky
The scent of colours
In the flowers

Believe it's small
In many ways
It holds the key
That divides the super powers

This road is never lonely
To england they are tied
They were blasted by the Silver Cloud
There were blasted to the wall alive

This place, this place ain't big enough for stars and stripes

Counting out the statesmen
Bungling one by one
Spelling out this segregation
So the catchword be
Looking after number one
They release the fear inside
Are human after all
So begins our dream time
They hunted like the dinosaur
We the pure
They the savage innocent
How we crush our existence after all
Come on

For without them
We are lonely
This England we are blind
Like all the Empires crumble
Will surely change the tide

This place ain't big enough for red and white
This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes

This place - This place
This place is theirs, by their birthright
This place

The sun gives better reasons
United we are blind
To deliver our existence
Keep it up
Keep it up
This human tide, give it some

We can break the ties
Of recent changes
Know the ones who
Hold the key
Singing out the congregation
We are them and they are we

Yes,Circus Of Heaven,/y/yes/circus+of+heaven_20148446.html,"(Jon Anderson)

The day the Circus of Heaven came to town
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around
On the very last day

A unicorn headed the mystical way
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colours of jade
On the very final day

For what seemed only just a moment in time
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time
There then arose where nothing really stood there before
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high frofrom the floor
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed
To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen
From historical or mythical scenes

Then there above their heads just as vivid as life
Each vision transported multitudes inventing light
Grecian galleons, the sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon
A play of millions roared along
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great
Civil wars where fbrothers fought and killed their friendship with hate
All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way
The day the circus came to town

Outside great animals as tame as the trees
Angels high in starlight dancing streets
Turning their colours with indigo and gold
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow
As the circus finally changed it's invisible course
A new world to be found

On the dreamy ground we walked upon
I turned to my son and said
""Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary
Beautiful? ""

""Oh! It was ok!! But there were no clowns, no lions, tigers or bears,
Candy-floss, toffee apples, no clowns. """

And on a day we will remember,
On a clear day we will love forever.

I once knew a sweet young dream,
That if life itself were all we had
And who are we to ask for more;
Let's not decide, let's be sure.
And on a day we will remember,
On a clear day we'll all be together,

Yes,Close To The Edge,/y/yes/close+to+the+edge_20148493.html,"I. The Solid Time Of Change
(Anderson/Howe)

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching out to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

Ii. Total Mass Retain
(Anderson/Squire)

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden problems shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

Iii. I Get Up, I Get Down
(Anderson/Howe)

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.           I get up,
I get down,
I get up,
I get down.

Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

Iv. Seasons Of Man
(Anderson/Howe)

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up."

Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Turn round tailor,   coins and
Assaulting all the mornings of the   crosses
Interest shown, never know
Presenting one another to the cord,    their fruitless worth;
All left dying, rediscovered  cords are broken,
Of the door that turned round,  locked inside
To close the cover,    the mother earth.
All the interest shown,    they wont
To turn one another, to the sign hide, hold, they wont
At the time tell you, watching the world,
To float your climb.  Watching all of the world,
Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call."
Yes,Crossfire,/y/yes/crossfire_20148375.html,"Julie's sick and tired of her job n'all the reasons lately
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die
Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being
She took it as a message from a real and a distant life

Shirley gets to help her with the child though
She's strung out on crack time
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love
Together getting high to get to mess up their night
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind
Just to get high, breking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get
Higher

Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says ""come on""
How we'll walk in the dark of the morning
Cars screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven,
Guns are loaded,
Locked in vengeance

Who shoots the child?

Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life
Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life
Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about,
Feed us in the raw, fear is all we fear about
Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up
It's the answer to punishment given you

Don't give us reasons,
Caught in the crossfire dying

Don't give a reason, God give a reason

Yes,Dance Of The Dawn,/y/yes/dance+of+the+dawn_21337813.html,"Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,
Chased amid fusions of wonder
In moments hardly seen forgotten,
Coloured in pastures of chance
Dancing leaves cast spells of
Challenge,
Amused but real in thought,
We fled from the sea whole.
Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days underseaarching
Earth
Revelaing corridors of time, provoking memories,
Disjointed but with purpose,
Craving penetrations offer links with the self-instructors sharp
And tender love
As we took to the air, a picture of distance.
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused
Expression,
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing
Late into corners,
And we danced from the ocean.
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow,
Only tunes of a different age.
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life
Everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well?
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well?
Did we forget what happened? surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment moment

Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you,
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
Or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion
Clearly to be home

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to

There's someone, to tell you,
And I just can't believe our song will leave you

Skyline teacher
Warland seeker
Send out poison
Cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

Young christians see if from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to.

There's someone, to tell you
A course towards a universal season.

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home

We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment

Past present movers moments we'll process the future, but only
Through him we know
Send flowered rainbows
Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to
Follow and show all we feel for and know of
Cast round
You seekers of the truth accepting that reason will relive and
Breath and hope and chase and love
For you and you and you."

Moving forward to the only place you know

Yes,Harold Land,/y/yes/harold+land_20148479.html,"(Anderson/Squire/Bruford)

Harold Land with a wave of his hand said goodbye to all that.
He paid his bills and stopped the milk, then put on his hat.
He tried to say his last farewells as quickly as he could,
Promising that he would return, but doubted that he would,
Doubted that he would, doubted.

Now he's marching soldiers in the rain as on to war they rode.
A long thin line of human mind, damnation as their load.
In the mud in coldness dark, he'd shiver out his fear,
What disappointing sights he'd seen instead of ones so dear,
Instead of ones so dear, so dear.

Going home,                        He's going home to the land he loved so well.
Going home,                                 He fought for two years, never fell.
Going home,                                                     He's going home,
Going home.                                                     He's going home.

Harold Land with a wave of his hand stood sadly on the stage,
Clutching red ribbons from a badge, but he didn't look his age.
Only two years had passed between his leaving home and back;
He had lost his love and youth while leading the attack, leading the attack.

In conversation it could be said,
Well after war your heart is dead.
Well it's not hard to understand,
There is no heart in Harold Land."

Did you find what we had lost?

How long this energy of Winter?
How many times that we could never love?
How many times is time enough?

All the foolish notions: When we'll die that's all that is.
We can never really understand the broken promises.
All along we run together (Remember?)
All along we run as one (Remember?)
When you find a perfect union, you've got to follow it.

Stop that reasoning  (you've got the answer)
Stop that thinking out loud! (you've got the answer)
Go where your heart takes you to (you've got the answer!)
You're not that innocent!  You've been around!
You're not that innocent...

Got to be right; got it coming to you.
How many times is time enough? (Time enough...)
Your time is just beginning out of all where we came from.
Holding on: This point receiving; there it is, there it is, there it is

Holding on, Can you remember
Holding on, Was it ever like this?
Holding on, It's the most important thing.

It was the first time that I saw you
It was the first time that I knew
Out of all my disbelieving,
Holding on, I was holding you."

Far enough together

Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls' devotion
Fast enough together

Right enough to let you begin

Realized their doubles
Took a new step
A question of origin

Only in the recent past
Seekers fought to realize
Skyward shone like beacons
A question of origin

Ten thousand millions flee
To the westward light
The dreamers represent
This arc of peace

As the poets entranced
The anchor redeemed
Secrets of science
The history of the future
Was surely made

Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world

Nothing can bridge our souls devotion
Fast enough together

Right enough to let you begin

Speak so fast to the prophets of the living
Looking for the signs
Spanning out the centuries
Search for truth

Ancient ones, they watch and listen
Carry our wishes
Took upon themselves to guide us
Through the endless skies

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Our hope is our world, our life

I have seen the passion
That's in the hope that everyone
Will find their way into the secret
Of the home of your heart

Living within the vision
Within the power, beyond belief
We see that hate destroys the soul
Of anyone who tries to teach it

I have seen the dream
That's in your heart
That's in your eyes
To bring you closer to the one

It's what keeps us so alive
It's what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world, our life

All is pure and clear to resolve
Nothing can change us now

Send, ascending to the future
Nothing can ever change us now

Here for us all to see
Reach as it comes to you

A place for us all to reach
Sing as it sings to you
As it sings to me

It's another game of exploration.
Something calls at reverse and it comes to you;
Experience everything as it comes true.

So - It will be then
Change - It will happen
See - That we feel it
All - Is completed.

Don't you want the world to stop short of giving?
Anytime of night or day, the magic things you love.
Everybody hurts when you shout, when you walk away;
Talk about it according to you.

I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life
I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had
I would have waited forever - There's no question about it at all

So in between the perfect flame of you, this love will never let you down.
Just take it as it comes, for everything will come around.

You put your hand up: stop the flow of where you're going to;
It's another game called exploration.
How we imagine everything that we think we're going through;
It's another reason to make the break.
Everyone will move with you now to the riverside;
Experience everything, but don't let the land slide...

Deeper than every ocean
Deeper than every river
That's what your presence brings to me

Revealing the words I listen
Seeing you in my silence
Learning I'm with you constantly
As I was before

If we were flowers
We would worship the sun
So why not now?
This high is shining brightly
Brighter than before

As the door was open wide
There inside was a diamond chair
Where I sat when I was young
I wrote down the words

Only when the young at heart
Can enter the real world
This chance I've waited for
For you to see

If I had chances I would spend them with you
To hold you close and let your love surround me
Deeper than before

(Deeper than every ocean)
And I know this love is real
(Deeper than every river)
Realize this is meant to be
That's what your eyes they say to me
You are listening to how I feel
So expectedly
(Brighter than every morning)
From the ocean to the sky
(Beautiful as the sunset)
Every river to the sea
Nature surrounds me constantly
We can hear love constantly
This is for you and me

Turn around and come deeper now
So what happens when I touch you there
You feel the words roll over you
Thinking of the better scenes
The memories
As everybody else just
Hasn't got the time
To help you anymore

'Cause if the reason for
The things that pleasure us
To please ourselves
Not pressure us
To give our ego
Some pleasure time

Can you imagine
Any reason
To know you're only fooling yourself
And then you'll understand why
You'll understand why

So if we choose to realize
All existence is a dream
This perfect resume to you
From me

Just had a tough time with magic
The death of ego
The moon
It was just coming through

Send me such a good time
In a letter form, tell me
The pleasure, no pressure
Pure imagination in a metaphoric dream

I get amazed like a true beginner
I get amazed like a true believer
I get amazed when I see you there
And I come alive

I believe I'm a true beginner
I believe I'm a true beginner
In your arms I can see it all
I can see it all

If we were flowers
We would worship the sun
So why not now?
This light is burning brightly
This light is burning brightly
Brighter than before
Brighter than before
Brighter than before
Brighter than before

When it gets so low
As you finally hit the ground

Turn around and remember that
Now I'm standing tall
Standing on my sacred ground

Lift me up and turn me over;
Lead me on into the dawn.
Take me to the highest mountain;
Tie me up, love in a storm.

Facing the future in your eyes,
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries.

Open doors - They may be closed to me;
The fire's still burning in my heart...

There's not so much in life I miss.

Then I saw you standing there
With a smile I couldn't share,
Just looking around ev'rywhere.

All the things I've wanted to do
Take so much time to get around to you.
Just reach out and catch and hold on,
Leaving trails of dust and lust,
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.

Tunes that I can't hear
Would take me for a while my smile.
Fares that are too dear,
I'd rather walk out another mile.
Then I heard a tune so right,
It was in the dark of night,
Just list'ning around ev'rywhere.

All the things I've wanted to do
Take so much time to get around to you.
Just reach out and catch and hold on,
Leaving trails of dust and lust,
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.

Smiles that I don't see,
I'll make them up as I go on.
Laughs that just can't be,
I'll make and laugh at ev'ry one.
Then I saw you in your place
With a laugh upon your face,
Just looking around ev'rywhere.

All the things I've wanted to do
Take so much time to get around to you.
Just reach out and catch and hold on,
Leaving trails of dust and lust,
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.

Full of words and of sound, bringing smiles all around.

Satisfy me with your words that can be,
Full of sound and I'll see I'm just looking around."

Cast off your garments of fear, replace them with love
Most of all play with the game of the age
Highest of places remain all as one with you
Giving us light and the freedom of the day

And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame

There's a feeling so real

Magnify the truth you are
Waiting for the rebeginning birth of every star

When you walk into the bliss that
Holds down the fire

And the answers, too
It begins with me

Looking for the sign

Waiting for the time to call
Dancing in the harmless sun
Entering the mind drive

Don't forget to seek out the world
If you want to stake out
Actions speak much louder the words [than words]
And you get to realize
Just as long as you have control
Holding the fire
Just as long as you get to keep
This point of your desire

When tense, it will come to you  [Wait as it will come to you]
Fear of the future response  [Feel it as a future response]
You get the heaven you like
You get to heaven

You get to heaven now"

I speak from some sort of protection of learning
Even tho' I make it up as I go on
A special trait is that I've tried
To reach all feelings
So I speak a new language of love

Some say that it is written in the circle
Others that it is written in the sun
But I protect myself by seeing this experience
As a metaphor for moving on

Sometimes I check myself
To start to believe in
The horoscopes you read everyday
They're telling me somethings
I really ought to know
But then again I like to
Then again I learn to
Then again I'm running away

Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself
Vision forgets who is real
On the city streets, people get lost
Just waiting for history
Pushing the real world away

Taking a chance only once in your life
Only weakness can stop you from hearing
New languages
Translate each word
As they bring you creation
Your voice is the perfect  key

Is there something that
I'm supposed to see

Is there something that I'm
Supposed to feel
I'm with you
And I can't help but want to know

Is there something that I'm supposed to teach
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing in each spoken word

For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute
I'm chasing every second before I let go
Yesterday my history
Dreams are still a mystery
This living is a gift I should know

Lay it down and let me live the new language
Let me learn at every twist every turn
Lay it down and let me love the further future
Let me know I'm running
Let me know I'm learning
Let me know I'm moving on

Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself
Chasing the reason
For all kinds of wondering
People embracing these feelings of limbo
Just waiting for some kind of truth

Taking a chance as it comes only once
Only strength can do justice
With words of new languages
Translate creation
To bring you salvation

Carry round and round and round and round

Until the early winds of change

Dawn's new light conquering timeless ease
Spread the harvest breeze

Gently hold our heads on high with you

Have you heard before, hit it out, don't look back
Rock is the medium of our generation
Stand for every right, kick it out, hear you shout
For the right of all of creation

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration

Power defy our needs, lift us up, show us now
Show us how amid the rack of confusion
Drive in thoughts of high, satisfy, in a plan
Set it out for all to understand it

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration we are...

Lost and wondering, maybe, how it is
Seems to me, it's as simple as this
No matter, where you go, you're going to find
You won't see me in front, but you can't leave me behind

Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways

Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister
Release, release, enough controllers
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties

Campaign everything, anti-right, anti-left
Anticipate the love of creation

Spins out of hand

Surrounded by million years

One more lost before begun
While we fight our mass confusion
Thus we walk before we run

Beware of the rocks
And be prepared
Prepare, for love finally grows

Here on Earth and out in Space
Foreward on the road to glory
History records the chase

Have yourselves that certain Christmas
Eat, be glad, and drink the wine
Leave your sadness by the river
Giving love and given time.

Ahh... Ahhh...

Run with the Fox
Along the lanes a lover takes
Run with the Fox
Beneath a moon, a Christmas moon
Run with the Fox
And sing a tune, a dreamer's tune
Run with the Fox
Across the bridge of many ways
Run with the Fox
Onto the place where dreamers bathe

Till the blood in my veins run dry - I'll be there to testify

I believe that you knew our faith was secure;
How you kept up your smile with a cool disposition,
Are you stocking the fire with a new sense of reason...

Around the south side so cold that we cried
Were we ever colder on that day
A million miles away
It seemed from all of eternity

Move forward was my friend's only cry
In deeper to somewhere we could lie
And rest for the the day with cold in the way
Were we ever colder on that day
A million miles away
It seemed from all of eternity

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
A snow storm a stimulating voice
Of warmth of the sky
Of warmth when you die
Were we ever warmer on that day

The river can disregard the cost
And melt in the sky warmth when you die

In this world the gods have lost their way

Can't keep this picture from out of my mind
This fear hand in hand crossing innocence, time
Surrounding creation they caught in a trap
The youngest offenders will witness confusion

They driving so fast not a care in the end
Escaping collision every twist every bend
When you're young invincible nothing to lose
Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle
The gods have forgotten to switch on the light
Who's lost in the dark will crash in the night

These lessons we're living the lies of the day
Expect them to honor and never disobey
Yet greed is controlling the elders display
No wonder the younger look at them in shame

The spirit of survival
Who's teaching the hatred
The spirit of survival
Or the class of your school
The spirit of survival
The color of your money
We're standing in a circle
We don't understand at all

They don't understand at all
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place

The younger the older the wiser become
Recover misfortune this true life as one
Our genius is shining the past has all gone
What's left is the clearest perception of one
The spirit of survival
To magnify the power
The spirit of survival
To magnify the soul
The spirit of survival
To magnify the love

Fly fast the gun

Not really knowing how
The world outside would take it when it came
And life*s the same

Are we to blame?

The crawling bird begins to scream and shout
Where is the parent bird?
A loneliness arose and heard it's name -- ring in
For lives, begin
Survival win
Survival sin

So soon the evening comes
And with it runs the aching fear of hate
Could someone still remain
Who thinks he still could gain by escaping fate?

Come once and for all

in vengeance
Who shoots the child?
Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life

Stand the marchers soaring talons

Destroy oppression
The point to reaction
As leaders look to you attacking

Choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor
Kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow
Casting giant shadows off vast
Penetrating force
To alter via the war that seen
As frictions spans the spirits' wrath ascending to redeem

Wars that shout in screams of anguish
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver

In glory we rise to offer,
Create our freedom, a word, we utter a word.

Words cause our banner, victorious our day
Will silence be promised as violence display

You and I can change the world;
The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.
From this moment on we share the world;
The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.
The spirit of imagination can lead us through the dark;
The more we see, the more we try, the more we show.
The evidence of our confusion, life has left it's mark;
The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.

As we walk into tomorrow
(Turning away from the path we know)
Holding the future with our hands
(We carry the weight of the world we go)
It's up to you and I -- We hold the key; we hold the answers

All our thoughts of doubt and fear are leaving one by one
The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.
For each of us the road is clear and life has just begun;
The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.
It's time to reach the goals we've set for ourselves;
The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.
All we need is just to believe in ourselves;
We face the truth, we see it clear, with no disguise.

Cast away our doubt and sorrow
(Turning away from the past we know)
The Universe at our command
(Conserving the fate of the world we grow)
Together you and I, we hold the key to all the answers

Let go
Let go
Let go

Yes,The Prophet,/y/yes/the+prophet_20148442.html,"(Anderson/Squire)

Long ago a tall man told a tale of yesterday,
Searching for the truth to life and not for just a way.
Finding pleasure from this house his ears, they did obey;
In his life a moment's pleasure, never to delay.
He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning;
Seeing the things in diff'rent lights his life was redeemed.

Words of peace will fill his mind and change his way of life;
Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive.
Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself;
Asking not for pers'nal meaning, more for just himself.
Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living;
Take the things you need in life but remember the giving.

Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out;
Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt.
Then you'll never worry as somtimes you used to do;
Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, you."

That given points in time are not so significant as the nature of
What is impressed on the mind, and how it is retained and used.

As the silence of the seasons on we relive abridge sails afloat
As to call light to the soul shall sing of the velvet sailors' course on

Course the compass to offer into a time we've all seen on

We wander out the days so long

We walk around the story

Out in the city running free
Sands of companions sides that be
The strength of the meeting lies with you
Wait all the more regard your past
School gates remind us of our class
Chase all confusion away with us

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
We walk around the story

Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you

Don the cap and close your eyes imagine yourself that is the challenge

Distant drums

Force the bit between the mouth of freedom didn't learn to fly
Remember to sail the skies

Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Arranged to sail you toward

Shine over mountains make the view
The strength of you seeing lies with you

And change the passing of the sun

Flower in which simple truths emerge examining the complexities and
Magic of the past and how we should not forget the song that has
Been left to us to hear. The knowledge of God is a search, constant
And clear.

Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,
Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten,
Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of
Challenge,
Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole.
Dawn of thought transfered through moments of days underseaarching
Earth
Revelaing corridors of time provoking memories, disjointed but with
Purpose,
Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp
And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance.
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing
Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean.
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age.
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life
Everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine.

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well
Did we forget what happened surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment moment

Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you,
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
Or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion
Clearly to be home
They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone, to tell you,
And I just can't believe our song will leave you
Skyline teacher
Warland seeker
Send out poison
Cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.
Young christians see if from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to.
There's someone, to tell you
Acourse towards a universal season.

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home
Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home

We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment

Through him we know send flowered rainbows

Follow and show all we feel for and know of

For you and you and you."

Roan shaped his heart
Through his working hands
Work to mold his passion into clay, like the sun

In his room his lady
She would dance and sing so completely
So be still he now cries
I have time oh let clay transform thee so

In the deep cold of night
Winter calls he cries Don't deny me
For his lady, deep her illness
Time has caught her
And will for all reasons take her

In the still light of dawn, she dies
Helpless hands soul revealing

Like leaves we touch we learn
We once knew the story
As winter calls he will starve
All but to see the stone be life

Now Roan, no more tears
Set to work his strength
So transformed him
Realizing a form out of stone
His work so absorbed him
Could she hear him?
Could she see him?
All aglow was his room dazed in this light
He would touch her
He would hold her
Laughing as they danced
Highest colors touching others

Did her eyes at the turn of the century
Tell me plainly
How we meet, how we'll love, oh let life so transform me

As autumn called and we both
Remembered all those many years ago

Was the sign of the day with a touch
As I kiss your fingers
We walk hands in the sun
Memories when we're young
Love lingers so

Was it sun through the haze
That made all your looks
As warm as moonlight?
As a pearl deep your eyes
Tears have flown away
All the same light

Did her eyes at the turn of the century
Tell me plainly
When we meet how we'll look
As we smile time will leave me clearly

We agreed to let it go
We agreed to turn our backs
We agreed to turn our face away, away

Sisters, grandmothers and more

It's the way we close the door

Their silence deafens every sound
We try just to ignore
To waste their future freedom
We'll regret forever more

You could never force it in your life: this decision to break it.
Without hope, you cannot start the day.

It's coming clear I've noticed;
It's a different face you're showing.
It's another ""Welcome Back"".
I don't imagine it could be this way -- So jealous!
Only you can tell it; tell me why.
Only you call tell it.
Only you can say.
In between this moving out to save your soul it came away,
And took it out;
Oh why?

Fire burning wild, burning in the night, chasing in the wind;
Shadows always dance in the rain, ringing into the fire.
Doesn't matter who, who can see in the smile.
Hope in the rain, open the flame, coming back in the night.
I can see the rhythm of the rain; I can see it shout back under:

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you need
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love

Shadows come alight from the vision that flowed;
Shake it off - Passion is the flame that fired.
Does it matter?  Can you give?  Can you hear it come?
Can you see you're like?
What's the matter?  Don't you want to risk?  Don't you want to hold me?
Hold me, dance in the rain.
I can see the love in your eyes; I can see you coming.

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you want
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love

Sweet suffering, love protection: Need it, You need; Come to me.
Believe it, better by far, your heart is there;
Most of all: Believe it.

Eventually we would learn each other's life
Open your heart
Give it a moment
Leaving the cares behind
Happily
We could be two of a kind

There you were
Like a dream to me
Wonderlove
We were meant to be
Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're the world to me

It was the very next day that I came alive
The door flung open
There was a vision
Couldn't believe my eyes
Everyone immortal like as though they didn't get it
Everyone believing here at last receiving
Wonderlove
It's a place we all belong
Wonderlove

Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're my world

I believe I could walk a thousand miles
Just to see the vision of your simple smile
Everyday
Wanting to follow
Forever by your side
Faithfully
You are my destiny

There you were
Wonderlove
We were meant to be
Wonderlove
It's the world where we belong
Wonderlove
Together we will faithfully
Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're the world to me

Just imagine what you give is who you are and where you're going to
If you're looking for the wisdom of the world
All you've got to do is let it coming through
Be forever

Just imagine

Love laid me down by a river.
Drifting I turned on upstream
Bound for my forgiver.
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.
Sound did silence me
Leaving no trace.
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.

He spoke of lands not far
Or lands they were in his mind.
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time.
In no time at all he took me to the gate.
In haste I quickly checked the time.
If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.
Had to hear your wonderous stories.

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing your wonderous stories.
Hearing your wonderous stories.
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there to stand
So cautiously at first and then so high.
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories.

On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place,
If the summer change to winter, yours is no disgrace.

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are,
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are,
Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far,
Lost in musing circumstances, that's just where you are.

Crawling out of dirty holes, their morals, their morals disappear.

And I 've felt the pain 
I've seen the hatred
And so many lives lost in vain 

And yet through this darkness
There's always a light that shines through
And takes me back home, takes me back home 

All of the promises broken
And all of the songs left unsung
Seem so far away
As I make my way back to you 

You gave me faith
And you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love
I can rise up above
And be strong, and be whole once again 

I know that dreams we hold on to
Can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted
With so much to say 

And when I feel helpless
There's always a hope that shines through
And makes me believe
And makes me believe 

And I see for one fleeting moment
A paradise under the sun
I drift away
And I make my way back to you 

You gave me faith
And you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me a love to believe in
And feeling this love

And be strong
And be whole once again

And I hold on

Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie
I took a break from the rap for a reason
Now I ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
Whoever thought me and my crew be ridin' horses
Paneramic car, that mean back to back Porsches
They said I fell off cause I ain't brought the new whip through
But when I bring it back, I'ma paint that bitch crip blue
And still post up on the ave with my boy big blue
And a hundred young niggas and they all screamin' Su Woo
I went to church just to chill in the pulpit
And Mario got shot, yea that's still some bullshit
But Thug, I can't let it handle you
I'mma take you off to Cleveland, aka the Zoo

[Bridge: Young Thug]
And my bitch look like a barbie
I have a new spot, Houston no Marcus
Nigga you don't wanna start it
Lil Tee bring the troops, we the sergeants
Ride the beat like a ROC crew Harley
And if ya'll ballin' with the bands we Spalding
Bet a couple M's and I'm all in
And I'm so high, in 10 days I still be fallin'

[Hook: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Yea, and I'm the motherfuckin' realest
And any nigga hear about me they say Young the fuckin' illest
And ya'll motherfuckers brainless, no ceilings
Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof I had to fuckin' kill it
Bought my bitch the new Audi, we have to switch cause I like it
When I don't like to drive, we bought the jet so I can fly it
They say I'm sexy but the face look kinda mean so don't fright it
And niggas know I'm shootin', they say they don't? Then they lyin'
And if they say they shot back they a front
The only niggas shot that was the rats
So shoutout to the rats
I'm the realest, no front
I'm sorry I had to kick it like a punt, yeah

I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You gotta picture me rollin', packin' a semi (wait) colon
Ready for war like Korea, headlining shows out in Poland
You should be cleanin' my mansion, my pents is disgustin'
Why don't you act like a Hoffman, and go get to dustin'?
Yeah, latex on my trouse, bitch, go clean my crown
Can't hear my haters from way up here, they don't make a sound
Body goals on these hoes, white paint on my toes
When I send that new bae alert, niggas gon' be mad
Jumpin' in the Bent', then I switched to the Ghost like, ""Who's you?""
Remember this face 'cause I'm that bitch you gon' lose to
Drippin' in ice, fuck you lookin' at? Screw you
It's squad goals when all your bitches pretty like New New

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I never killed anybody (body)
But I got somethin' to do with that body (somethin', just shh)
I got the streets on my back (on my back)
Carry it like I'm movin' a body (huh)
I told them to shoot a hundred rounds (do-do)
Like he tryna movie the body (movie)
It was like 11 in the mornin'
Skippin' school, that's a truancy body
I made me some racks in the mornin'
I had me a pack by the mornin'
I had me some racks by the mornin'
I had a six-pack by the mornin'
I got on a mink, no pneumonia
The racks keep me up, don't need Folgers
I had a pack in my shoulder
You gotta picture me rollin'

[Bridge: Young Thug]
Jumpin' in the Bent' with the too-dark tint
And who's you? (Who's you?)
My shawty pullin' up with a real bad bitch

Fucked her in store 'til they was closing, nigga
Head and pussy feed my motion, nigga
I found her phone and I didn't scroll through, nigga
Green slime ball, bases loaded nigga
I think they jumped on my pockets cause they swollen, nigga
Drophead, it's a drophead
Haiti boy, I leave them shot dead
You ain't no gangsta nigga, stop that
I fucked that bitch before she gave me head
Telling me you're gon' win
That's some shit I don't know about
Fucked her in the deep end
That's some shit you gon' know about
Big B, Willy B, still smoking gas, eyes low as a Chinese
Still wearing flags, bitch I bleed 'til I'm deceased
I ain't talking guns, but I smoke the head of Khalif'

The world could thing I'm dreaming but I swear to God he know
What your momma tell you about playing with that fire?
Didn't God tell you if you livin' you gon' die?
When you shot 'em up you know that pressure was applied
My nephew saw his daddy get sent out home to the sky
If you knew any better he would've said 'don't break rules'
If I didn't know better I would've stayed in a school
If that bitch didn't know better I would've of played it in two
If I didn't know better I would've crossed out God and went voodoo

AB bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s

My wrist a Hellcat, I’m not kidding
They dig all the shit that I’m kicking
I just bought my bitch some new titties
You take out these pictures, you bogus
Wasn't gon’ turn your ass until you told it'
Wasn't gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
Make some bad bitches fuck my brodie
I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta

[Verse 1: Young Butta]
Three chopsticks, I paid a stack for it
They run me through, I probably got warrants
In the back of the 'Bach, ugh
Burning OG out of Backwoods
Not just dancing, diamonds racing Balmain
Lots of fakes allergic to seafood and serve for decoration
Lobster never tasted
Missed Thanksgiving, I was in Miami
I was on ocean, I was on vacation
In the Benz speed, 120 racing
AB in a Rari, shit was like the Matrix
In and out of lanes, weaving in the spaceship
I’m flexing, got muscle like Popeye
But fight over a bitch, no that is not I
I’m him, I'm gon' tell the roof bye bye
Then remove the lid at the stoplight
With my side bitches at Benihana’s
Brung her sister, her bestie, her mama
Told ‘em tab is on me, yeah I got ‘em
And I pay the bill all in new hundreds
Now that is real colorful money
Spikes on me, they drip at the bottom
She want Thug, and her friend is a toss up

Can't tell, yeah

[Hook: Young Thug]
Niggas say they fuck with you, I can't tell, $500,000 Chevelle
I got bricks and birds for retail, I got 100,000 worth of belts
These bitches and these niggas know that they can't play around here
I call the spot elementary cause I keep a K around here
All my Aces if you play they make you grady baby
I might shoot you in your head and then it's no more thinking
Pussy boy I'll leave you dead and call it dead-ication
I put Act inside my drink, they call it medication

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hold up, pull up, roll up, pour up, ounces in a soda
Push up on your bitch and shawty I didn't even know her
See this hood I throw up, realest one I ever seen
ATL, call it XXL, cause we stay spittin' shells outta long magazine
Real nigga got a crown, better own that thing
If the game got a throne, bet I'm on that thing
Beloved dope dealer and a well known King
And a killer 'pending on how you put your spin on things
You know how many suckers get ahead I've seen?
Bout the same amount of pussy niggas dead I've seen
You know how many bitches in the bed I've seen?
That like asking me how much bread I've seen
More than enough, in God we trust
You love a real niggas then fuck with us
But if you got a problem with it then fuck with us
It be ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Got your bitch riding everything but the bus
She let me put it everywhere but the butt
I always tell the bitch don't talk so much
She said ""Who I'm hidin' from? What the fuck, for what?""

Ballin' in New York like the motherfuckin' Knicks
You better have them racks you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I pass like a staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left 10 bands in a mu'fuckin' cab

[Hook:]
Okay cool, okay bool I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi 'fore I fucked her mother
I passed them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like 2 bitches
Boy that dope get whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside that bitch got 2 digits
Money stand like 8 feet just like 2 midgets

[Verse 2:]
I just wanna go and run my money up and everybody did it
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm comin' back with the K
And I'mma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitch you wanna see a nigga thumb throw it fast
I'mma never sell Young Thug attendance
100 bands in no time
I fronted you back but you-
I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy
I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just won't nut like Buddy
All of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs going, ""Woof!""
Top notch shawty, nigga we ain't gon' care
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learn mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she follows patterns

[Hook:]
Okay cool, okay bool I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover

Your bitch let me in while you gettin' banded
Young Thug nuttin' everywhere, gotta buy some panties
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, mob boss manners
Nasty bitches can't stand me
Caught my bitch clean like an empty house attic
Check my closet Bally
Red rag comin' from the right like I'm about to challenge
Peyton Manning accuracy, Randy Moss status
House two times bigger, four baths back

Then I head to the turf and I'm like fuck 12
Fuck them white folk that gave my little buddy an L
So I do this for him when I'm rappin' dummy bells
Fuck a cell, I'm payin' in a cash bond
And you gettin' bunned if you don't got them cash funds
Servin' on the block can take off when crash comes
And right back to the block just like we left somethin'
I don't trust 'em, them crackers killed my homeboy
So every single night I smoke one for my homeboys
I ain't foot locker, but I'm servin' the J's
In love with the alphabet, I married the K

[Verse 3: MPA Wicced]
Fuck 12, this a six figure operation
I'm still beatin' those down, dodgin' traffic and casin'
Hey Miss Catherine Johnson I'm ridin' for you baby
With a shoulder strapped chopper and nina my baby
My blind opened a little, the trap going crazy
Four (?) for the camera, fuck the narcs and agents
Cause gettin' this paper is so contagious
I'm gone work this bitch until they serve them work paper
I'mma switch right up, gone duck low in Decatur
A on the flow, bails of the gas on the table
No longer a soldier, but keep that Cain and Abel
I'm direct with it, you do basic cable

You did my nigga wrong, I know it, it was last summer
Lyin' to me, tellin' me I'm the bomb like Osama

I could never call, not a fed, not a cop
Niggas sit on the bench and I said do ya'll
YSL scream ""fuck the rest"" cause we got right now
Niggas asked me ""Am I sure?"", and the Bentley said “Yeah”
That little bitch ask for a purse and you know I said ""Yeah""

She might act like she know Bird when them players in there, Yeah

I know this beef ain’t gon never end
100 thousand for the necklace
Now I’m looking like a champion, a champion

[Verse 1]
When I take off on that molly, she got a perfect lil body
Ride it like a kawasake, buy her brand new Maserati
You know rapping is a hobby, you know capping is a habit
And that ass I got to have, I’m not grabbing, we can share it
Baby girl don’t take it personal, but I can never ever ever propose
But them M’s I can post those, and I’m smoking indoors outdoors
Give me good head, and I’m folding up the lead
Every time I get finessed, she want to practice all day
She want to come to the bed, she see this Versace
[?] she nut every time I say it

Skating like a skater
100 thousand on the Lakers
Bought my girlfriend a new crib

Now I’m looking like a champion, a champion

[Verse 2]
I put molly in my food, and I’m leaning like a fool
And I can’t wait to be here
Cause your body is a fool, and your booty look like jewels
And I just want to see you
Now if you got some big bootys say (Oh yeah)
And if you got some big titties say (Oh yeah)
And if your pussy stay itchy say (Yeah yeah)
Cause you shave it and crave it, I eat it when you bathe it
I like it when you wear lazy, bent over like you praying
With babies, no Deangelo, but girl get naked
When you leave I wish that I could copy it and paste it
I'm riding 'round with stoners, and all my blunts are laced, ayy

Goin' first like a hearse nigga
And if you play you're done, that's a curse nigga
And I hope you know they tie you up first nigga
And I hope you know the CEO gets work nigga
Born with a sickness, I look suspicious
And everybody round me gunnin', pistol tradition
That brand new Bentley on factory inches

Conversation with Guap, Guap is the perp
They gone hate on me, I know that
Cause I got Freebandz and you ain't got no racks
You took your own number in my trap

I bought CoCo with my deal
I missed a couple shows with my deal
If I could take it back I will
And don't you take that to the head
You know I got you in my whip
It don't matter if it don't work out
Man I know you with me for real
You helped me balance my skills
You helped me over the hill
You got my mind right when I was thinking 'bout going and go kill

Never had to touch a nick
Never had to risk shit

This money turnin' me on, ayy, this money turnin' me on
I'm thinkin' out loud, but these hunnids got a nigga gone (far gone)

Ever since that day, man I been riding 'til I die

When hearts are closed, 
When a friend becomes a stranger, 
Nobody wants to know

Where do you go, where do you go, 
When the world turns dark, 
And the light of truth is blown out, 
And the roads are blocked

He stopped by a stall, between the barrels and sacks, 
A child's face peeped out and gave a smile, and ran back, 
Behind a misty glass, on a windowpane, 
A little finger drew a perfect heart, and a name

Where do you go, where do you go, 
In a world filled with fright, 
Only a song to warm you, through the night
Where do you go, where do you go, 
After lies are told, 
And the light of truth is blown out, 
And the night is cold

Mmm... Mmmm... Mmmm... Mmmm... 

Roadsinger rode on, to another land, 
Though the people spoke a different tongue, it understand, 
They showed him how to share, and took him by the hand, 
Showed him the path to Heaven, through the desert sand

Where do you go, where do you go, 
To find happiness, 
In a world filled with hatred, (Cheers)
Where do you go, where do you go, 
If no one cares, 
And everybody's lost, looking for theirs"

Until you reach the sky
To be proud of your life

Don't turn back until you see the light
Until you reach the sky
To be proud of your life

Don't turn back
And if you fall down
Take a second and leave the ground
And be strong
You've got no bounds
What goes around, comes around

Don't turn back until you see the light
Until you reach the sky
To be proud of your life

Don't turn back until you see the light
Until you reach the sky
To be proud of your life"

Yolanda Adams,A Message To You,/y/yolanda+adams/a+message+to+you_20833379.html,"I love you, do you really love me?
I cry for you, have you wept with me?
I've cared for you
How much do you care for me?

So you could have me
I carried a load of shame
So could have my name
Have you done what I've asked of you?

I asked you to come unto me
Give all your cares and burdens to me
For I truly love you
Somehow I can't get through

I have only the best for you
But my voice you ignore
Have you done what I asked of you?
This is my message to you
I'm coming back for you"

[lyrics: zur heide]
[arranged by breitenbach ]

Shades of blood
And shades of inhumanity
We can see
Your trace throughout history
Decades of hope
You brought up to society
And centuries of pain
And hopelessness and misery

Your mission is perfect
You spread and infect
Annoying insect

Good Christians

Crucifixions
Forgiven when you cross yourself
In the name of God
Millions have been sent to hell
Is it faith
What makes you look up to the priest
Or ignorance
Or the fear of the beast?

Your mission is perfect
You spread and infect
Annoying insect

Good Christians"
Yolanda Adams,A Song Of Faith,/y/yolanda+adams/a+song+of+faith_20274359.html,"You can't let it get you down
No no no no no
No no no no no
No no oh no no
Don't let it get you down

Just when everything seems to be going alright
Some unexpected misery enters your life
Then you ask your self how could this be wondering why
I've been there
You see your whole world come crashing down
All at one time
Your bodies weak from all the worrying
And so is you mind
Your walking down that rocky road
But things will get better
Cause trouble won't last forever

You can't let it get you down
Not now
You've come to far to turn around
You gotta walk with your head up high
Believing you can reach the sky
You can't let it get you down

Have you ever felt the need to get away from it all
The person that you care about the most just broke your heart
Just to be in the same room with them
You can't stand the thought
I've been there
You don't know if your relationship is worth holding on
How much longer can you take being treated so wrong
You're confused on what to do
But no matter what you do
You're gonna make it through

Oh, take it from me
The only thing you need is a little faith
The size of a mustard seed
You may cry through the night but hold on
Cause joy comes in the morning

In the morning
Joy comes in the morning
Have a little faith
Just a little faith
And you can make it
So don't you give up

Don't you let nobody turn you around
Don't you let nobody tuen you around
Keep your head up to the sky
Believe in yourself"

Cause one of my friends got I'll seriously
Now the doctor told him ain't no way you gone' live
But he prayed his prayer in faith
And a miracle appeared

[Chorus:]
Its already alright,Its already alright
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down
Just bow and pray And then give it all up
And know everything's gonna be okay
Just throw your hands up
And then wave them left to right
And now do your dance child
Cause it's alright already
Always surrounded by negativity
This might be where I live
But it ain't gonna change me
Gotta work on my mind
And keep my actions pure
And when I stumble, I know who has the cure
So any time your feeling down
Just lift your voice in praise
It'll pick you right up
And you can come to Him don't be afraid
Anytime , day or night He can give you what you need
And if you pray your prayer in faith
And in your heart believe that

[Chorus:]
When life's problems get you down
Can't find no peace nowhere around
Trust in the spirit you can't see
Its bout to bring you your relief
Go ahead and cry now , it's alright
Cause now you're cryin tears of joy
This life ain't hurting you no more
Cause you know it's already alright

You love never waited no - no - no - no - no

Now you're living your life like a castaway
Searched for strength inside was it all in vain

And on your behalf, I just asked if He would be there for you
I want you to

Enter a place where you never have to cry
Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why
Never want for nothing you're always satisfied
In the peace that his arms will provide
He will erase any guilt or shame, any bad habits you've got
You won't wanna do em again, Yes we all can change, I can testify
See I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked, If he would be there for you
I want you to

To the angels and to worry
Instead I'm coming to leave,
And remaining in my safety
You'd rather do it all yourself

Pretending as I speak to you, in restfulness I kill you
I wash the fears away so God can never stay
When I stand strong in you, I give you power to bring you back
You never take your time out,
Sit in silence and to mind out
I've always been right here, waiting for you to come near me

In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know

A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Yolanda Adams,Fly Like An Eagle,/y/yolanda+adams/fly+like+an+eagle_21699277.html,"It's almost time...

I'm waiting...

Almost time...

Time keeps on slippin', into the future
Time keeps on slippin', into the future

I'm gonna fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle, let the spirit carry me
I'm gonna fly like an eagle, 'til I'm free
On through the revolution

Feed the babies who don't have enough to eat
Shoe the children with no shoes on their feet
House the people livin' in the street
Ooooh, there's a solution

I'm gonna fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle, let the spirit carry me
I'm gonna fly like an eagle, 'til I'm free
On through the revolution

There are times when I would like
To fly away from here
Far this place of hurt and woe
And just disappear
To that place prepared by my love
That is where I'll go
Waiting for that great day 'coz I love Him so

I love Him so

Time keeps on slippin'
Would keeps on fightin'
Brother keepin on dyin'
Time keeps on slippin'

In the fact that I will fly away
I'll fly away
One day I'm gonna fly away
One day I'm gonna fly away..."

I get a little misty eyed, knowing you've gone on
I've come to realize just how much your presence meant to me
I also realize that now you're finally free

I'll always love you for the special times we shared
All the times you let me know just how much you cared for me
I'll always love you, you were a friend that I could totally depend on
I love you and you're forever with me

The will of the father had to be fulfilled
I feel your spirit, your voice still gives me chills
The anointing is still touching today
I wrote this with a smile and tears of joy just to say

I'll always love you for the special times we shared
All the times you let me know just how much you cared for me
I'll always love you, you were a friend that I could totally depend on
I love you, you're forever with me

We used to sing together, cry together and laugh together
You said it didn't matter for God would always take care
You taught me how to give again, when giving seemed to be too hard
The benefits of your love were my reward

And I love you for the special times we shared
All the times you showed me how much you care for me
I'll always love you, you were a friend that I could totally depend on
I love you, you're forever with me

I love you, yeah, you're forever with me

Standin' here with a fragile heart
See I never she'd a tear
I stayed strong for them
When everybody disappears
It's only you that keeps me strong
I can't imagine goin' on
Without you in my life
Goin' on with a fragile heart

I forget about everything else
There's only you and I
I can't think about ever givin' up
Ever givin' up the fight
The only thing that matters Lord is You

[Verse 2:]
I ain't got no time to pretend
That I'm not missin' you
I know you're in good hands
The same hands that hold my heart
And I'll cherish every moment that we've spent
As a gift from God above
'Cause he takes care of all fragile hearts

When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of You
I forget about everything else
There's only you and I
I can't think about ever givin' up
Ever givin' up the fight
The only thing that matters
When I'm goin' thru
Is givin' my fragile heart right back to you

And you're the only one
Who can put it all together again

When I was just a girl
My mama said to me
You can't fight hate with hate
You gotta love unselfishly
Love is not just a word
But a way of life you keep
You need to know
You're not here just to receive

Now that I'm older
Her advice I still take heed
For the power of his love
Lives in me

Ya gotta have love
Ya gotta have love on your mind
Ya gotta have love real love
Let your heart be your guide
It's gotta be real love
Feel so good in love
Gotta be real love
Or there's no sense in wasting your time

Didn't have to go far
To find myself
'Coz he knows the real me
More than anyone else
I found a higher place
Who's voice I must obey
When I was a child
I heard the Word that say
Now abide in these hope and charity
And the greatest of these three
Has set me free

Because we're gettin' beat on the street
And others meet defeat with no heat
And nothin' to eat
And when you're walking down the street
You gotta step with pep
'Coz fools are mad enough to rob you
Just to get a rep
Is it me G
Or is it society
But I can't see why
We kill for notoriety
That's whack
We lack love for the black
In fact
Let's end the attack
So we can get the love

Gotta have love
Gotta have love on your mind
The man on the street with nothing to eat
Wants love
The daughter who doesn't know her father
Wants love
Gotta have love
Mothers and fathers
Sisters and brothers
Want love real love
Let your heart be your guide
Everybody I know
Even they want love
They want a love that's real
One they can feel
One that's deep inside
That they can no longer hide
It's gotta be real love
Gotta be love

But never mind that night'cha had to cry
Cause you had never let it go inside
You worked real hard and you know exactly what you want and need so believe
And you can never give up
You can reach your goals
Just talk to your soul and say

I believe I can
I believe I will
I believe I know my dreams are real
I believe I'll stand
I believe I'll dance
I believe I'll grow real soon and
That is what I do believe

Your goals are just a thing in your soul aha
And you know that your moves will let them show
You keep creating pictures in your mind
So just believe they will come true in time
It will be fine leave all of your cares and stress behind and
Just let it go
Let the music flow inside against all the pain
Just start to believe

[Chorus:]

[Rap passage]

Never mind what people say
Hold your head high and turn away
With all my hopes and dreams I will believe
Even though it seems it's not for me
I won't give up, I'll keep it up
Look into the sky
I will achieve on my knees
I will always believe

If we could remember
The moment of our birth
We give our voice
To songs and whispers
And know what life is worth

Remember, remember

Suddenly there's beauty
In pieces of the past
And sorrow clings to angry questions
The days of dust at last

And morning holds us
When worlds come tumbling down
A dance of ghosts and ragged dreams
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round

I remember, remember

If we could remember
The power of the light
That cripple prayers
Are sometimes answered
And hope survives the night.
And hope survives the night.

I remember, I remember, remember"

Is it laid?
Your heart does the Spirit control?

And have peace and sweet rest

Your body and your soul

Of sacrifice laid?
Your heart does the Spirit control?
Now, you can only, only, only be blessed
And have peace and sweet rest
After you have yielded Him
Yielded Him your body and your soul

Everything, everything, everything

In the beauty of His light?
Would you obey His Word
Everyday and every night?

Give Him your thoughts, give Him your ways, your desires

That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
With news of joy foretold

""Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
Over all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
Old echoes plaintive ring
And ever over its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world hath suffered long
Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love song which they bring
O hush the noise, ye men of strife
And hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look now! For glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing

For lo! The days are hastening on
By prophet bards foretold
When, with the ever-circling years
Shall come the Age of Gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling
And all the world give back the song
Which now the angels sing"

Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices

O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night, O night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land

The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our Friend
He knows our need? to our weakness is no stranger

Behold your Kingbefore Him lowly bend
Behold your Kingbefore Him lowly bend

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His Gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His Name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy Name
Christ is the Lord!
O praise His name forever

His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim"

Send your anointing father

God has calmed another raging storm in my life
Led me into safety turned my darkness into light
Now I stand in the power of his might

You would have thought that God already done enough for me
When he took my place at Calvary
But he done so much more and more
Right before my eye's
And I have no other choice
But to stand and testify, stand and testify

Since the last time I saw you
God has worked another wondrous miracle for me
Led me into triumph
Now my blinded eyes can see that Christ the lord
Performs victoriously

You would have thought that he done enough for me
When he took my place at Calvary
But he's done more and more and more every day
He makes a way and he's made a way

Since the last time I saw you things have changed
I'm not the same since the last time"

Your just fine
Got it all figured out this time
All of the plans you made
Will work out
Deep inside you have your doubts
But your clinging to your pride
And you just don't know
Your free to let it go

Cause even when it rains outside
There is light
Even when you cry all night
Your alright
Even when you loose your way
You'll get through
Cause there is someone watching over you

Say you've been hurt before your afraid
That you'll never love again
And why should you take a chance just to fall
But you'd rather build a wall
Than believe that you are loved
Open up your heart
Someone needs you as your are

I've been there
At times I get scared
Its true
But I hold on to that
I can't see
Something inside of me
And that's what give me strength to believe"

Yes Yes he does
God is willing and He is able
This did not catch him by surprise
So just trust him
And just oh step aside
Be still and don't question it
These obstacles they were allowed
He wants to take you higher and higher
If you will hold on
God is willing and more than able
This did not catch him by surprise
So just trust him
And just step aside
Oh I know he's faithful
My God is faithful
To do what He said He'll do
Now if He said just believe it
There's nothing he can't do
You must stand on His word (stand on His word)
Put all your cares on him (give them to Him)
Cause He knows and He loves you
He did it for me that why I can say
Step step aside
God can work a miracle for you
Step aside
You got to let go
And let God
And let go and let God be God
Move yourself out of the way
Move your pride out of the way
He'll never leave you
Nor forsake you
This what I know it ain't just what I heard
So Thank You Lord for being awesome to me
You're marvelous
Praise him Praise Him
Oh step aside
Let go let go let go
He knows what you go through
He knows what you can bear
He can do what you can't do
So step so step so step aside
Thank you Lord
And you're in control
So I step aside"

Wounded but time will heal
Heavy the load the cross I bear
Lonely, the road I trod I dare

Shaken, but here I stand
Weary, still I press on
Long are the nights, the tears I cry
Dark are the days, no sun in the skys

Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Never to give in
Against all odds

Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet still I rise

Sometimes I'm troubled
But not is despair
Struggling, I make my way through
Trials they come to make me strong
I must endure, I must hold on.

Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Never to give in
Against all odds

Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel Low
Yet still I rise

Above all my problems
Above all my eyes can see
Knowing God is able
To strengthen me
To strengthen me
Yet still I rise

High above the clouds."

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!"

And there's no other way to the Father
But by him

Long ago when He knew you'd be out on a limb
He gave His life for you
Can't you live yours for him
He's the Almighty Rock
And you won't have a firm foundation
Unless you're build on Him

You can't live without Him
You can't move without Him
You can't breathe without Him
You can't think about doing one thing without Him
You can't do without Him
'Cause there's no you without Him
Because He's the only way

There's no one

So many trails I´ve endured
God has given me the cure
I have a joy, a joy that´s unspeakable
It soothes my doubts
When the way gets hard
Although, I lived in sin
He cleansed my heart
Now lives within
Saved my soul from a burning hell
Christ lives in me now
Oh

No the world didn´t give this joy to me
And this world can´t take it away
This world didn´t to me no no no

I found a friend who´s all the world to me
His love is so ever true
I love to tell how He growed me out
And He changed my Life
With Christ in my heart without a doubt
I am satisfied
Now I am save from sin
And hard leaning on His mighty arm
Secured my soul
Each day in every way
I know He´ll guide me
The world didn´t give this joy to me
And this world cannot take my joy away
The world didn´t give it to me
No no no

Nothing in this world can take the place of this joy
And amazing grace
He loosed my shackles and He set me free
I didn´t deserve all that He´s done for me
He give me joy
Unspeakable joy
What a marvelous joy
He gives a joy that´s unspeakable
I love him so
So what a friend I have in Jesus
All my sins and grieves He bears
This joy gives me everything I need
All I have to do is take it to Him in prayer
He give me joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy
When I´m stuck, when I´m lonely
I still have joy
Because I know He is my all
My all
My all in all
I don´t have to worry because
He takes care of me
And I know, I know, I know
I know where my strength comes from
I know where my joy comes from
It´s in Jesus
It´s in Jesus
I can lean on Him
I can depend on Him
Wonderful, Counselor
What is His Name?
What is His Name?

Joy, my joy
Now we´re not talking about somebody about 6 foot six

Oh Jesus
We´re talking about Jesus
Joy, my joy
Jesus is the one Who gives us joy
He´s the One who sets us free
He´s the One who sets us free
Because He is my joy I can dance
Come on, everybody in the building sing

Come on, come on
Talk about Jesus´ joy

You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done
Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes
See His love overcomes

If I can find out where you are - it's true

Wherever you are, that's where I want to be

Take me on a vision quest - And focus in on me
So you can tell me what you see in me
Please don't let me live a lie
Let me live in honesty
Cause you're the only truth that can set me free
That's why I want to go

I'll just keep on trying
Seeking you to the end of all time
Following you any place, anywhere

May take us far
Chances that we take tonight
May lead us into darken places

Are higher dreams
But in the game of chance
There's only a guilty wave or stream

Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
And it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just
Bow his head
Then I will do it
That's what I will do

I started down the right road
Only to end up wrong
The endless journey carried me so far away
From my home and family
But I'm learning I was never meant to go alone
Neither was it meant for me to go on my own no
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

I'll never go on my own
I'll never go all alone

Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes

For it's only if God would just answer me
And it's only if God would just hear my plead
And it's only if God would just bow his head

English Translation

Sometimes, it feels as though love isn't the answer
Even though, one gets tired in solitude
What do I get out of looking for love
If I'm not yet happy with myself

It's better to be alone
So that I get to know myself first
Love for myself first
It's better to be alone
So that I don't blame this sadness on others
I just need to
Focus on myself first

Focus on myself first
Although I have to strengthen my valor
What do I get out of giving love
What do I get out of giving love
If I will end up neglecting myself

It's better to be alone
So that I get to know myself first
Love for myself first
It's better to be alone
So that I don't blame this sadness on others
I just need to
Focus on myself first

How will I love
If I'm not able to love myself
Today, tomorrow, I will just end up exhausted...

It's better to be alone
So that I get to know myself first
Love for myself first
It's better if I'm alone
So that I don't blame this sadness on others

Come stumbling again and again

It's like first time all over again here I stand
Coming over my head
It's sound so vain, it's kinda crazy, hear my words I'm trying to say
I'm in love with you all over again

And it feels like watching how the sunshines
Getting lost in your eyes
Oh I am in paradise
Feels like breathing for the first time
Holding you so close to mine
I never felt so alive
Like I'm inlove with you for the first time

It's like Valentines every single day
When you smile takes my breath away
I'm a little girl on a Christmas Eve
I can't sleep, I can't wait
'Til I finally have you in my arms

And it feels like watching how the sunshines
Getting lost in your eyes
Oh I am in paradise
Feels like breathing for the first time
Holding you so close to mine
I never felt so alive
Like I'm in love with you for the first time

I could hate a thousand pictures
Write a million songs of how much I love you
Oh I'm in love with you

And it feels like watching how the sunshines
Getting lost in your eyes

Composition and recorded:
Carlo_abayon

Friendship is a bright patch in the pattern of life
With understanding, with the single soul
Dwelling in two bodies
Won not by the giving of things but by the givin of the heart

Is love a work of heart?
Is hug just when its needed?
Is shelter a sheltering tree for you and for us?

When someone knows all about about you and she doesn't go away
Just respect her, and love her so much
Won not by the giving of things but by the givin of the heart

Is love a work of heart?
Is hug just when its needed?
Is shelter a sheltering tree for you and for us?

Treasure with a value beyond measure
Garden where the sweetest blossoms grow
Special gift that adds fragrance to life is so wonderful

Is love a work of heart?
Is hug just when its needed?
Is shelter a sheltering tree for you and for us?

Is love a work of heart?
Is hug just when its needed?
Is shelter a sheltering tree for you and for us?"

Ngayong pasko

Kung may kamay
Na nais mag-abot ng init
Ilang labi ang mapapangiti
Kung bukal sa damdamin
Kung nariyan
Ang pusong handang mapatawad
Kung may puwang sa damdamin
Ang paghingi ng patawad

Kung pag-ibig ang mauuna

Isang tinig tayong maririnig
Ipaabot sa buong mundo
Ang bawat kamay
Habang humihimig
Na'ng ibig sabihin ng pasko
Ang ibig sabihin ng pasko'y
Ikaw at ako

Kung ikaw ay handang
Magbukas ng iyong palad
Ilang hiling ang matutupad
Mga munting mang pangarap

Kung may isang bisig
Na handang magkalinga
Ilang luha ang mapapawi ng
Mainit na yakap

Repeat refrain

Panghabang buhay ang pag-ibig ko sa'yo, o sinta
Kahit na magka-wrinkles ka, iki-kiss pa rin kita.

Ah ha huh... 4x

Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it
Does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude
It is a not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it
Keeps no record of wrongs
Love does not delight of evil, but rejoices with the
Truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes and
Always perseveres.

Panghabang buhay ang pag-ibig ko sa'yo, o sinta
Kahit na topakin ka, iintindihin kita

I want to see you crying
I want you down on your knees

Cause it's the only thing that makes me realize
That there is something in your heart that you hide
You don't talk about it so I really don't know
But I wanna hear it
So baby please, oh oh.

Tell me now if you really love me
Tell me now if you really need me
Tell me now, tell me now
Cause I'm confused

Tell me now cause my heart is breaking
Tell me now cause I won't stop asking
Tell me now, tell me
Cause I really really wanna know

I wanna see you walkin' away
Wanna break you until
I hear you say So...

Tell me now if you really love me
If you need me, if you want me

Tell me now cause my heart is breaking
Won't stop asking
Cause I really really wanna know"

Male-late na naman ako
Sa trabaho kong ito
Siguradong sabon ang aabutin ko
Sa aking among gwapo
Na hindi ko kayang abutin
Hanggang tingin na lamang ba ako
Sa aking Prince Charming

Ngunit
Malapit na, magugulat ka

How can it be the same

Where is this thing called love

Is it my fault? Is it you or is it me
Is this goodbye or is this what we want us to be
What about the things that we have shared
What about the promise that you've said... And baby
What about us

I can imagine vividly the very first time
That you held me
It felt so right
I still can feel the way you've touched my face
And every night your sweet embrace
Oh why...

Ya Boy,100 Bars Of Death,/y/ya+boy/100+bars+of+death_20750257.html,"[Intro: 2Pac]
I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world
But I guarantee that I will spark the brain
That will change the world

[Verse 1: Ya Boy]
Better show respect before I lose it
The whole world know Precise is more than music
A movement, look at all the goons that I move with
Homies, guns, vest &amp; boots on that platoon shit
Best, hardest in the West, yes, literally
The fans comparing me to who? Come on, ya killing me
The enemy keep trying, but can't get rid of me
Bombs like Timothy, arms like a centipede
Hoes through his door, make sure he's a memory
One nigga, but I got 'em shook like there's ten of me
Go hard in hip-hop, hope they remember me
Screamin' ""Thug Life"" like a 2Pac Mini-Me
Any beef? Tell 'em to bring it special delivery
I bet my little friend will put 'em outta his misery
These niggas wanna finish me and send me to the Reverend
Honestly, there's probably better competition in heaven
Holla at me, Fillmore bitch, we dollar happy
You would think I was strippin' the way hoes throw dollars at me
I'm the ma'fuckin' spiteful, delightful, iteful
The new Ice Cube, bust my guns and rock mics too
So what's good? Either you Crip or you Blood
Somebody call Khaled, tell 'em ""Ya Boy was hood""
If he joke like DeRay, my heat like D. Wade
Shots to his face, make him sing like T-Pain
Stuff him in the trunk, then I dump the remains
Nowadays all that rappin' is is a free chain
If a nigga ever look at me as a free chain
He's not gonna make it like his plane got delayed
I'm talking to the real, if you fake, then get lost
Them block musclemen, hustlin' like Rick Ross
Real talk, I'd rather sit than snitch dawg
Cause quick jaws get a nigga smoked like menthols
I'm way outta they league, who hotter than me?
Gotcha favorite R&amp;B bitch swallowin' me
I ain't lyin', look I'm so fly I should be flyin'
Maybe that's the reason why ya girl keep eyein'
I'm eyein' her back, Louie purse with the hat
I'm not a trick, but I'm rich, so I'm buyin' her that
And I'm tired of this rap beef, tired of that gay shit
I thought he wanted war, he seen me and didn't say shit
I'm outta this world, when you see me I'm like a spaceship
Lights everywhere, make it bright anywhere
Got the sun on my neck, full moon on my wrist
Da-da-diamonds in my mouth and it's all on a bitch
I guess I took notes from Kevin Federline, every time
Milk a bitch like a cow, every cent, every dime
Never been to jail, but I done done hella crimes
Moved to Malibu, now I got 'em thuggin' in Pepperdine
Gimme mine, if a nigga say I ain't the top five
Dead or alive, remove his head and his spine
I load the lead in the nine and leave him dead on arrival
You sittin' on the shelf, what the fuck did you sign for?
Catch me with the Crips and the Bloods don't mind, no
I don't bang colors, I'm a damn albino
Drunk like a wino, hard like a rhino
Flyin' through ya time zone, looking for a fine ho
Rihanna, Alicia, Mya, big pimpin'
I'll even take a white girl like Jessica Simpson
Make sure she licks it, kiss my Limp Bizkit
Tape it, need a witness, this is big business
I'm heavy with SRCs like Steve Rifkind
I'm talkin' some real clientele, nigga listen!
Drop 'em a line, that's all I do is go fishin'
Get 'em hooked on me then I turn 'em into fish sticks
This is -- 100 BARS OF DEATH if ya listenin'
I ain't like these other niggas, I can go the distance
Ya fans in my hands, so you know that I'ma clinch it
The rap game dirty, but somebody gotta rinse it
I don't even spit shit, I just go and rip shit
That's why these hoes put me on like lipstick
That's why these hoes put Ya Boy on they hit list
Swag like a ma'fucka, I'm the new Slick Rick
La-di-da-di, sawed-off shawty
Ridin' through the hood, bout' to flip somebody
""How you rap like that?"" It's just somethin' 'bout me
I step in the booth and the shit just comes at me
Niggas wanna shoot me, niggas wanna rob me
Fuck that, .40 cal here right beside me
Niggas can't deny he, hotter than Mojave...
...Desert in the middle of summer, let's have ménage
I be, killin' other rappers like a hobby
Niggas take pictures of women like they surround me
I don't even trip, I don't block no head
I tell them hoes, ""Do me,"" like Rocko said
But you can get up outta here if you ain't got no bread
Cause even my bed, got a Ferragamo spread, yeah
I mean Scrooge McDuck bucks
And if a nigga say I ain't nice then he probably get butt fucked
I catch you in the hood all I'll say is ""tough luck""
Don't holla ""Precise Gang,"" ya get fucked up
What-what? Cut a nigga up like Nip/Tuck
You might as well kill ya self like a wrist cut
And everybody in the whole hood know it's us
The way them doors no longer swing, they lift up
The way them boys gon' do they things with big bucks
Big homes, big diamond rings and big trucks
Despite that, I'm tryna sell like Mike Jack
I even get the fans that don't like rap
Keep it a hundred, so it's a must I write that
Spit so much crack The Feds got the mic tapped

[Outro]
Yeah, holla at me
PRECISE GANG!
YA BOY!
I suggest you keep me healthy West Coast
West Coast, I suggest you keep me healthy

They sayin he put a few bitchs on the blade
And he's pimpin now getten money in differnt states
And he's on the radio they hearin him on differnt stations
They herd he's in l.a. with game
He's gang bangin nah

[Bishop Lamont:]
Yo I get my shit chopped
Fake niggas don't stop
If it ain't our people then it's brothers cuttin up spot
When niggas plot and niggas pop and get popped
Over the usual cash, pussy, n pharmasoticals
Motavated by jelousy inremovable
When cematarys get so filled ain't no room for no more funerals
Preety soon they'll hang no vacancy signs
Niggas will have to get cremated and add to the smog line
It's pathetic I admit it I regret it
When you no where u headed it's a curse bein pathetic
I tried to stand by keep quit and just let it
But once u touched by god till u die u gotta rep it
Hard got lines it's easy to over step it
That's why I never mind when rappers gossip on a record
Cause there's worse problems then niggas lien on a record
I'm a real soldier nigga world wide respect it

Everyday I hear them talkin about me
Everywhere I go the talk is bout me
The people wanna no what the talk is bout
So welcome to the barbershop
Everyday I hear them talkin about me
Everywhere I go the talk is bout me
The people wanna no what the talk is bout
So welcome to the barbershop"

Roll the turf, skate block's, never will the case stop.
I'm from the state where they crippin' and they bloodin' at.
And if they can't find you, they go to where ya cousin at.
And ain't no squares here, a lot of playa's here.

The dealer's give the yay, the killer's get away.
A snitch is very lucky, if he can live another day.
The Giant's vs. The Dodger's,
The Raider's vs. The 9ner's.
Either you small grindin', or you a big timer.
We wearin' black tees, gold teeth, and bandanas.
We push zip's, fuck model chick's, and tote hammers.
We get a lot of dough, like Digiorno.
You see them Bentley coupes, We can afford those.
Where if you live another day, only the lord know's.
Wherever the money at, It's where the whore's go.
We call them gold digger's, and it's a lot of those.
The feds really bull, they wearing cheap clothes.
The state of California, where we don't get along.
I'm bringin' you to cali, just listen to the song.

Tonight we gonn take you to the convict cinema
A move, starring straight out the windy city, Chicago Illinois
My nigga twista, straight out the bay area, California
I be Ya Boy, when I be the rock star

Man I swear they ain’t ready for a nigga like me
40 cal with extended clip under my white t
Make it rain on the nigggas them hit them with lightning
That’s on, mask on, the scene is frightening
And I swear I showed up with an army of killas
Big on banana clip baby I’m a gorilla
On my mama grand mama ain’t nobody killer
How they kill the cali, swear to god nobody iller
Put my head low then I threw my gang up
Threw a few hoes in my new race truck
These niggas ain’t dropping, they loosing they touch
Convict, California, they all blame us
3 or 4 goons in the back of the van
And if we can’t find you then we clapping your man
Acting an ass when you slide through
Better hide you, and put you somewhere they can find you
Tallying my list up, while I’m being twist up, marijuana twist up
Kill yourself, wrist cut
... On my fist up, listen on the ...
Kiss y’all goodbye, put you in the sky
I shall not lie, all I know is ride
You might get out of line, if you ain’t no messiah
Real niggas don’t die, put that on my life
And put your hands up high, feel I’m ready to shine, nigga

Twista coming back and I’m fin to destroy
Anything in my way soon as I deploy
Killer from Illinois, I let off any ammunition
No mission, but now I gotta do it with your boy
Murdering is a joy, leaving up this body with the bullets from a shottie
When he go off through a stress he gonn do a somersault
Shooting up the Maserati, tearing up the whole party
Cause you gotta have them killer with you, become a boss
Showing like is a cinema, then I’ma hit them, with venomous …never defy me
You think you fucking with it, try me
I’ma ... Showing off what the cabby niggas doing
Whenever we give it to them…
Competition copping at me, it’s absurd
Look at the way I kick it and the way I paper work
Strike at them enemies like I can control them birds
Straight from California to Chicago with the herb
Rolling with real niggas is a duty, push them motherfuckers
I can uzi like I feel the buss…

Didn't really have a name I couldn't charge much
Nigga's overlookin the bay but that was our luck
Now I got sumthin to say and they on our nuts

That's all on the strenght of my flow
Only suckers who measure skills based on the land of there dough

Homie tell me what you need

If he rep that bay why his swag that way?
Man the bar so fresh plus I'm cool like dre
Yo my sound so new... Like it's still in the wrapper
The rumors so true, yes I'm killin these rappers
Headed down south with a car full of clappers
Inside my trunk all white like pampers
Get it off quickly... Headed back swiftly
Heard them boys on me but they'll never get me... No
Who the truth mama let them know
That I keep two nines like Gretzy tho
The young nigga with the peschi flow
That's good fella... Catch me in the hood fella... Get it understood fella

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
Ay you want it I got it

Ay, I'm Montana in his prime
Hammer on my side
Term said I need a bandana when I ride
K in the bushes, cannon in the ride
Gotta stay strapped, simple that's the way that I survive
Rush a nigga fast, like Sapp off the line
Then know off his mask when I clap off the nine
Niggaz in the hood gimme that off my grind
And hoes in Hollywood gimme head off my shine
I turn them hoes around, lemme hit it from behind
Then I put that long, black, Bay shit in they spine
Rappers always say that fake shit in they rhymes
They aint sold no dope, they aint clutched no nines
I'm like a parkin meter how I touch those dimes
And quarters, I have ya orders
On time
Got the best flow in the west to this day
It's gon' stay that way
Ask around, I run the Bay

Wh-what's good la
I run the Bay
Ya bitch know I run the bay
Ya momma know I run the bay
Wh-what's good la

Shout out to Troy Carter, lets get this dough
There aint another nigga that can spit this flow
There aint a younger nigga with chips this long
So I play with cars like I'm six years old
I need my bread and my biscuits hoe
I fry these niggaz, I got a fishstick flow
Ya Boy is dope, ya betta sniff this blow
And if ya broke you betta fix it hoe
Call me the bus, you missed it hoe
You can kiss my ass with yo lipstick on
Look good, Ya Boy throw that slick shit on
Did it for the nookie, like Limp Bizkits song
Made her sip this Trone, lick this bone
And after I hit it I'm gone
No lie, hop in the Astin
Wave while I'm passin
Puffin on that big bubba kush while I'm chantin

[Chorus:]

Old b-tchs wanna holla at me cause I'm hot now

Song on the radio album bout to drop now

I hope you like heat cause it's hot in the kitchen boo
Do you have service, am I gettin through

[Chorus: Akon]
Hey, I know you heard we got the drop now
Konvicts supplyin n-ggas round the clock now
Gettin money am I forced to put the glock down
Glock Down, Glock Down

And I'm a get accustomed to this lifestyle
No more spending all my cons tryin to fight trials
Lock Down, Lock down
Cause victory is my my my my my my my my my mine
Cause victory all is my my my my my my my my my mine

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
Another watch, another chain, another charm cocked
Time to wake these n-ggas up like alarm clocks
I see em hatin so we gotta keep the arms cocked
I'm the reason CA on storm watch
It's bout to get ugly no whoopie gold
Superstar still in the kitchen whippin Os
Toss it to my youngest call me when you get it gone
F-ck a rap n-gga we about to get it on
I'm speaking fo california from the top down
Holla at Ya Boy I got it locked down
I tried to tell em this foreva like a diamond

And all my hustlas on the corner of 7/11
Po alert on the ground and I start reppin
For all the homies layin down restin up in heaven
And I hope you watchin down
And proud of how we just locked it down
Don't let nothin stop the cash or get caught up
In the streets that's how we brought up

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
I'm from a city where the fiends shoot up and spark
Load up the ammo it's time to shoot up the charts
Game cold baby you might need a scarf
Rockstar but I'm riddin like noah's ark
Louis shades, dolce and gabana cloth
Your girl know I stay fly like santa clause
On the road with a trunk full of Asher Roth
We gon pop rose when the package off
I swear to god I went and got the bay crackin ya'll
But I could'ntdo it without LA backin though
N-ggas say they gon get me, I laugh it off
Cause they know I keep shooters like basketball
Lock it down make Kon through away the key
Real n-gga, record deal ain't changin me
It took a while but we still got from a to z
I put in work n-gga what you gotta say to me

I'm on the block trying bump more
I can't help the way I stunt though
I'm trying to make my money double
I'm in the street with the white
I got the work and the price
State to state, taking flights
All day and all night

Yo, bricks of the white
Pounds of the purp
And for the right price, come around to the turf
We don't keep tucked outside with the work
I strap it on a bitch make her fly with the work
Ya boy want 17-5 for the work
23 in the south take a ride with the work
Fuck what you heard, I'm a grind till it hurt
Knock on wood, I get caught won't say a word
We call it a brick, they call it a bird
We call it a corner, they call it a curb
I got a hotline, you can call for the herb
Mathematics with a addicts, you can call me a nerd
I don't get money nigga, that is absurd
I passed it like magic, then ball like Byrd
You can find me in the hood from the first to the third
Goin hard for them clear diamond stones and infirms

You know
The ladies love the way I touch dough, so
I'm on the block trying bump more
I can't help the way I stunt though
I'm trying to make my money double
I'm in the street with the white
I got the work and the price
State to state, taking flights
All day and all night

That's only 10 bricks
Coulda swore I saw more
I chop em all up, you can call soft ***
I got white galore
So, my money comin more
Bank America know, my accounts are offshore
Why have a girlfriend when I can have yours
The boy so fly, got butterfly doors
Lord knows the hores love Bentley exhaust
So I got mine, all black, fresh from the store
Fresh out the door, pimping like Fylmore
Slim tell her sprint till her feet get sore
And if it's raining bitch you walk between the rain drops
Then get a nigga dough till you see the rain stop
Keep quiet nigga, you ain't gotta name drop
The tech, different snitches, they all the same cops
We call a half, different mother, same pops
Different cover but it still the same cars

You know
The ladies love the way I touch dough, so
I'm on the block trying bump more
I can't help the way I stunt though
I'm trying to make my money double
I'm in the street with the white
I got the work and the price
State to state, taking flights
All day and all night

And cracks in the walls got packs in the drawers
My bitch enter the door, the gat and the bra
Half these niggas that got a gat in their drawers
Behind closed doors with the captain and sarge
I'm might be on the block with the sack in my balls
UPS if the package is large
Send it to Mississippi, surpassing the law
Then the money appears the next day like voila
I'm tryin to double up
Nigga I tell you what
My creme makes the fiends jump like double dutch
The black lambo float like a rubber duck
Precise game, every bitch want some of us
But I'm all about the cash, all about the paper
The money see me now so the hoes see me later
If flippin's a crime, I down for the caper
That's why I got the ride's inside alligator

You know
The ladies love the way I touch dough, so
I'm on the block trying bump more
I can't help the way I stunt though
I'm trying to make my money double

I got the work and the price

My fan base stretch from ca to Norway

Livin like a king, same age as Lebron James
Breakin these hoes wasn't enough so I copped haze
You other guys just mad cuz you not paid
Who wanna rap? Believe I got word play
Ya Boy got more bars than a bird cage
And I'm stapped like a seatbelt, see
You want beef? I creep like tlc
Put a couple in they head, make sure they sleep
Cuz most of these dudes hoes, like females be
But I never get caught up in they bitch ways
For the quick pay believe, I flip like a switchblade
There's no hope for ya
When I put the scope on ya
Take ya lid off like a fuckin can opener

Prince of the Bay cuz my flow so good

Show the whole globe fa sho it's Sanfran time

Still in the mix like coolaid in punch bowls
I'm rich at all times I don't blow my cake
Boy ya money fluxuate, like Oprah weight
Hold it straight
It's a fact while holdin pape
Nine times outta ten friends known to hate
So I roll alone, I'm a rollin stone
Somebody call the police, Ya Boy stole the show
And I'm not givin it back, Imma hold it ransom
Gangsta raps grandson, hoes say I'm handsome
Yes yes it's the prince of the fuckin Bay boy
Got my own website in the Escalade boy

My pockets inside out nigga and what, yeah

Now baby I can take you to moss
But I ain't got no gas in the car
You can walk right nextdoor to the bar
You should just be happy to fuck with a star
Now baby we can go to Brazil
But it'd be cheaper if we sat here and chilled
I got a lot of problems and a whole lotta bills
Fuck what ya heard I'm just keepin it real

Even chicken is expensive, it's six dollars just to egg a niggas window
And drive bys cost too, so they on bicycles doin what they gota do
Look
Ma bitch say she won't miss the childs, I turned around and looked at her
Bitch how?
I caint even afford to wax your eyebrows, it's hotdogs on the stove girl
Pipe down
I went from the green leaves to the blacka dn mile, and I done went from
The iphones to the burn outs, polly seeds and corn nuts got me turned out,
But anything goes when you in a paper drought
I'm tired of rap niggas talkin what they paper bout, when they ain't got
Enough dough to start a bank account
Got money betta know it's a blessing, let's see how long you can survive
This recession"

Yeah, Ya Boy
I want to thank David Foster
For letting me bring this platinum back

It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to

Been committed all day but she still say

She don't want me to go, she keep tellin' me ta
I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya
I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya

I wake up every day with the same plans
She's on my mind and there's no other game plan
I'm always with her I could never be a changed man
And I been knowin' this since back in the days man
My grandmother used to tell me she was dangerous
But people was gettin' money on her and gettin' paid and shit
I said I want money too, I'm a mess with you
I said holla at Ya Boy, she like what it do
From New York to California people grind on ya
And they never stop, even though a stop sign is on ya
I'm a take my time and flick nicks and dimes on ya

I ain't even goin' lie dog, I think I love her
I might even just put her on my cd cover
Squeeze and hug her even share her with my little brother
She want me to stay from sundown 'til the sun come up
Don't let her looks fool you, she get bad at night
If you with her you might get grabbed at night
Shot and stabbed at night, she took that med that night
So if you're scared do like Stacey, dash at night (ha ha ha)
I never beat her I told her I never leave her
When there's nowhere else to go, that she's there whenever I need her
I like to get high, she there growin' my reefer
Gettin' Franklin's like Aretha she tellin' me don't leave her (please)

(Stay the night) when the moon come up
It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to

I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya

If you love her like I do, and hug her like I do
Then you know what this song implies to
Them other type of people they be hatin' on her
'Cause they know Ya Boy affiliated with her, chyeah
This for my people on the corner
Get your money on her from nyc to Arizona
From Florida all the way to California
The whole wide world from Tacoma to Barcelona
Make small moves if you're slick you's a goner
I'm a be fine 'cause she knows I'm a soldier
She's my bitch for life, we don't ever fight
And my bitch don't ever say goodnight, she say

It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to

In the streets, put a shot where ya coufie at
Excuse me Jack, I know I sound rude for that
But I be damned if they put me in a suit and strapped
I'll make sure the whole West Coast know my name

What's happenin', I thought ya'll was ballin', what happend?
I got the work let's get it crackin'

On the curb with the rocks, Mossburg or the glock
(Is the ambulance comin'?) nigga nah that's the cops

Last of a dying breed, heart of a lion
All of my soldiers with me, we all right
Ain't no stopping once the red light turn green
I will not lose, I know they heard me
I go hard still fly were the birds be
If he tryna stop me then he gon' need surgery
They can't serve me, waiter or hater
On my way to glory baby I see you later
Ain't nobody promise this, please check my accomplishments
Better find your nitch, cause you ridin' in the wrong lane
Call me anything besides a king, you callin' me by the wrong name

Ask me if we ready for war, I'm a tell you

I never stopped for bullshit I kept it moving
This is why I grind like I lead in discipline
I put in the work so this is why I shine
Don't tell me I'm great, I hear that all the time
You just tell a friend and spread the word while I climb
And if I don't get the crown for some reason, I be back to put it down for
Next season

It's on my soul I put my heart in it
You say you want the will when I'm so authentic
Ya'll won't finish cause ya'll so timid
Every pass, every play, every yard I been in

Everybody with a dream, repeat after me
Not right now, but on three
One, two, three say we ready
One, two, three say we ready
Go for the crown, don't never back down
Every city you hit, make it jump down
We run that city, run that city
Say I run this city, I run this city
Follow the leader, I show you how it's done
I never let us down we'll remain number one
All the greats before me gave me the stamp
Remember that name, Ya Boy, your true champ

Pass the cup to my girl and told her to sip slow.
This my show, watch me baby, The way I go can't stop me baby
Seatbelt beside me baby, la just drive me crazy.
We could float through the city night, I'm drunk and your lookin real pretty right.
Make love I ain't finna fight.
Not once, we can go till we get it right.
What it cost I can fit the price
Got a house in hills you can spend the night.
When they ask who turns you out.

To be a star on the boulevard
She wants s** on the beach

I've got paradise on call, it's ours, it's ours!
She got a little taste and she wants more, some moreee
We run L. A!

Yeh, cut a lot of girls, cut a lot of cheques.
That's the life here on sunset.
Rich and famous I am sucess.
Met her at Les Deux and she do love s**.
Ima sip this, you do the rest
You know what you do, you do the best
Do me a favour, lose the dress
It's nice by the way, Chanel I guess.
Lamb handbags I know where they sell those.
Maybe later on we can hit Melrose.
All you gotta do is hit me on my cellphone.
Baby girl me and you can kick it like a field goal.
Know who I be, call me yb.

Mohawks and heavy metal I'm never settled
I'll be on the move, put your momma on the news cryin'
Like Jim Taylor, stay with a tune n'
When I let it loose give you the opposite of life try him
Put you on death-row if you crooked eye him
You never in the streets see ya boy put his time in
Put his life in consignment and buy him
20 on his head will have them desert eagles flying
Then I'm back in the street like a rock star
Coke so soft but that soda make it rock hard
That's when I used to eat macaroni and hot dogs
Now when I'm valet parking I got the top off
With a hot broad that suck me till she lock-jaw
My red-boned bitch you can call her hot sauce
Exhaust out the Bentley Coupe
Blowing a whole bunch of kush out the Bentley roof
See this the life that I dreamed about
I seen the east, mid-west, and I seen the south
While them fags was ridin' jags brought them beamers out
Hip-hop was getting dirty had to clean the house ya
Tell them hos that precise in the bitch
And we fresh out the trap like some ice in this bitch

So they can't see me I'm poltergeist in this bitch

Verse 1:
Tere Bina ye ghar, Kitna Soona Soona Hai,
Maafi Ke Liye Mein Ne Tere Pairo Ko choona Hai,
Karni hai har woh baat jo mujhse ki nai jati hai,
Tujhay dekhe binna mujhay neend nahi atti hai,
Khuabon mai meri maa tu mere pass atii hai,
Meri zindagi nahi ye, yaado ka fassana hai,
Kya karu Maa mujhay tou bs tere pass anaa hai,
Ksi Taaray Ke Saye Se tu Dekhti Tou Hogi,
Intizaar Hai Ke Tum Mujhay Kab Awaaz Dogi,
Khuaab Mein Rota Hu Aur Tum Pass Mere Atti Ho,
Galay Se Lgati Ho, Phr Muskuraati Ho,
Rokne Se Pehle He Tum Door Chali Jaati Ho,
Aankh Khulti Hai Tou Bahar Abhi Kaali Raat Hai,
Raat Ki Khamoshi Mein Bs Ik Yaado Ka Saath Hai,
Dua Hai Ke Yaado Ka Ye Saath Ab Na Choothay,
Maa Tou Rooth Gai, Bs Ab Rab Na Mujhse Roothay.

Verse 2:
Jab bhi tu na ho pass tou jaan nikal jaati hai,
Maa mein kya karu mujhay teri bohot yaad ati hai,
Meein aur mera khuda ye baat hai janta ke ghar pe tu naa hogi ye dil nahi maanta, Tere hissay ka pyaar ab baantay ga kaun?
Mujhay ghar der se anay par ab daantay ga kaun?
Teri socho mein ghum,
Khuli aankh se mein sotaa hu,
Kya karu mein ghar par bhi chup chup ke rotaa hu,
Saath tou nahi par teri har baat yaad hai,
Kya pta tha teri meri aakhri mulaqaat hai,
Meri maa, Aj bhi tu anaa mere khuaab mein,
Galay se lgana aaj dil bohot udaas hai,
Itni bhu tu dur nahi, Itna bhi majboor nahi,
Teri bhi khatta nahi, Mera bbhi kussor nahi,
Tu ne hi sikhaya kabhi haar nai mantay, Rab k iradon ko insan nai jantay

[Chorus:]

Verse 3:
Maa daant apni beti ko woh khaana nai khaati hai,
Kuch bol apnay shohar se usse neend nai aati hai,
Teri tasveeren dekh kar khush woh hojata hai,
Unka chota beta unko bohaat satata hai,
Daant mujhko akar, ye dil bekaraar hai,
Teri awaaz sunney ka hi tou intizaar hai,
Ab kon mujhey raaton ko pyaar se sulayega,
Kon mujhey hasaega, kon mujhey satayega,
Ye dil hai bechaain, kuch samajh nai ata hai
Daant Hamzah ko woh roz der se ghar ata hai,
Daant meri aankhon jo band nai hotin hain,
Samjha apni beti ko jo din raat roti hai,
Bol k gayi thi k jaldi laut ayegi, kisko ye maloom tha k tu waapus nai ayegi
Teri yaadon k saharay zindagi bitaani hai,
Zindagi khatam, ye bas ab kahaani hai

Good times man, good times, man I got one on every wallet in this fuckin' house
I got eight of 'em, that American 36 you produced for me is still one of my favorite solos man
And I want you to do some more of those for me, at least one more
So, man that shit we on right now is a game changer, man
With these break beats and these good ties like this

Went from a spark in the kitchen to an uncontrollable flame

He picked up the poison when he picked up the loose change
That's what the karma is for dropping chains
A penny for your thoughts
How many can you spend before you go insane?
Life is a bitch, man
To drive you crazy 'til you take the wheel and switch lanes
Or you could make your deal and take a pill for this pain

Cutting the hair, tryna give it a mullet

Dope was so strong, made the J hit the dougie
Don't want the recognition, just the money
Strap always with me, I'm keeping it currently
Bae get it with me, ain't takin' it from me
She on the board like Coyote Ugly
Woke up and ate, lit like dentist
It's lookin' like you haven't ate in a minute
And how it seems, at the rate that we winnin'
Yeah, the Slumboy go to state to you niggas
Draymond with the Draco, turn your fitted cap to a halo

You might get whiplash, whip pass
Ride 'til the whip crash, Six Flags
Pistol no kick back, get back
Get 'em smart like zigzag real fast
Pull up like a gym class, gym bag

I can't stay out of my kitchen
I used to re-up on Liston
And piece 'em on Eighth
I come from straight out the projects
Now I'm Slumerican made
CookUp Boss, I'm not a rapper
I represent for all the trappers
Balling hard like I'm a pastor
On the low, dirty bastard
Used to be broke, I'm up now
Wolf call a play, it's a touchdown
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with us now
Nigga want smoke then it's up there
I'm here to make the trap great again
I want the front and the backend
I got my rank and my bank up
My migo need somewhere to back in
I'm so addicted to trappin'
Niggas keep tellin' me tap in
I see the hate in your face
Trife Life got they ass in 'cause...

Don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve
Cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway

Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels

I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

[Verse 4]
You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican

Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos

I just wanna hang with real people
You know, I don't give a fuck about how much money you got
Who you know, none of that
Be authentic, that's the type of people I want to kick it with

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Motherfucker I'm, a catalyst of the baddest that you can find
Cowboy hat, sittin' crooked in the corner of the club when I'm sippin, my
Jack, beautiful woman on my side
Fact, you ain't gotta tell me, I know, I'm fucking getting it
Fake motherfuckers just talk, I'm fucking living it
Chevy in the parking lot
But I’ve had a few holmes, I'ma have to Uber home
I'ma have to pull my phone out, hit the icon, baby
Then I’m moving on, but I won’t do it alone, uh
Take a walk with a wolf, girl
I can make a good girl a hood girl
We can get down and party, shaking the Chevy
But whatever happens in the truck, if you could, girl

Please just be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring

With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance

Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight up to my best friend

[Verse 3: Eminem]
God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap
Or what I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap cause I'm a sinner
(I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock and I shoot
Who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

Pull up your bra, quit spilling your guts, you better cook your bo-ttle

Never let bygones be bygones
Rather I'd say, ""See ya later, adios"", bitch rapping obese is just bygone
Never thought the culture that I loved would be this sleazy

Is this the guy that said he was the hottest white boy
Since the one with dyed blonde hair, what the fuck

Fuck it, fuck Post Malone, just because, let's see if he answers back
All that change, tits, and funk chill bill, and the cowboy boots and hats

Poser, biter, appropriation thief, give a fuck how many records you sold
Every fan you made is a leaf off of my tree
Boy you're my seed, another mullet in the gang with the teeth I see

On the steps like I had a job at UPS
Told her call me but every time we bark, I yawn
I went and parked my car, they come lift it
And I'm fuckin', I'll fuckin' fuck a soccer mom
Or some dork bitch dressing up for Comic-Con
The Chevy bouncing like it had a hydraulic pump
The T-tops are gone, I speed off like a redneck screaming yeehaw
These laws probably seesaw, bring in police stars
All they retrieve underneath the seat was a big pink double-D bra
That a big broad must've worn, I don't recall
But they tryna give me tickets like I won at Skee-Ball
In a black Monte Carlo, strapped like a narco
Riding through Atlanta bumpin' Tennessee love
Reppin' CNT, but believe I'ma be Slum 'til I'm 6 feet deep in the ground
Up in my box Chevy speedin' off when I see the GCP dig around and I be...

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
In my box Chevy runnin', you in a Cutlass
But my dope cut less, pass it like judgement
Wet paint and it's gutted, police say I'm up to something
Put the thirties on that bitch, tell 'em you gotta look up to something (Yeah)
This for the homies that keep money down in they sneaker box, that fast cash
In the trunk of my Box Chevy I keep me a speaker box like Outkast
People tryna get me for it, they staking out like out bag
But I got some killers that's in the front yard and I got some killers that's out back
There's something in my Box that'll put you in a box
Got your ho in my Box Chevy 'cause I'm fucking with her box
I beat the song of the year with a freestyle, who run it?
20 years in the gangster doing laps, and I got this bitch

My lady's laying in the Chevrolet, and I say, “Lord,
Thank you for giving me this baby girl on a swayed horse!”

I'm pushing both ties till I die
And them till my legs sore
Folks, I gotta sit for

Five generations have taken pictures with grand dames
The Chevrolet slim shady, there's no way you can save me!
Best bo flex, you've never seen such
Word on my window, like who I am doesn't mean much
Burning, tread up a thousand dollars, my ties with a clean touch
Six hundred horses running behind a mean clutch.

Feel like I'm watching television on a couch Lauren
I must be dreaming, leaning back inside the chariot.
Get on the back of this truck, my... I carry it
Watch Alice in Wonderland, fill up my cup with Jack D
And get my fucking keys, so that I don't wreck it
Let me come sit on the passenger's side and check it
How does it feel from over here? Oh, bless it!
This is for all the Chevies that I collect it
Big trucks, low riders, whatever the best is to you
Man, I just wanna give you a message, oh

Watching.. And trunks, and don't skip hella pay

And man, I'm sitting in my vision with a vision to celebrate.

Where they make that moonshine still
There’s an old man on the porch on a shack
And the shack is where he lives
Round the town they call him Paul
It’s Paul from on the hill
And everytime Paul does lay a hole
You can hear that swing

Slang from the belly of the bible bilt
That motherfucker frigid daughter slim
Where you can find no woman no here
No cousin no friend without a gun
Alabama that is my home
Fucking trailer park it's got my heart
Off in the hood, I make hoe when I play in the wood,
After dark
You won’t find me sober much
Always got a bible of jacky oh
I take my sip, I talk my shit
And I fight anybody that wants to go
Tall and slim, walk with a limp
Cause my nuts are oversized
Fuck your dope and your out your hobby
Cause your shit is overprized
Hit the buffet for a 20 forbie before I’m 21, mathematics
Gonna do jail cause I’m drunk and pygmy rigmey, black magic
Cause I’ll be here and I do my time
Cause I can’t make bail out minimum wage
Nothing to do when the country budget drunk
And watch that pendulum sway
Back in the saddle again
Throw my middle finger up to the law
I ain’t gotta ride nobody tonight
But I might do it just because
I’m a nut, I get bored
Did some pills but I want more
Fuck this world, fuck this town
If I fuck you once, I fuck you sore

Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit god damn
Pussy c***, suck a c***
If you want some of this rocking boat
Take this bite, suck this rock
Just a flock, super hot
Ain’t no law, grab a muck

Catfish billy, catfish billy, hey, hey, hey
Catfish billy, catfish billy, hey, hey, hey
Catfish billy, catfish billy,

You don’t want it with me motherfucker
I pormise I put you with the piranhas
Inside of the shallow swamp make you follow
A boat of a drinking water
And sing to you lullabies while I’m sipping Coronas under umbrellas
Got a propellor sharp enough to eat through you
You fall to root of a tree, if it’s onto me then it’s cool like it’s movin
So why do you think I fuckin hate it
Or lay a log I front of my boat and put a stop to what I do buddy whatever
When I get up in the morning I take a bow and
When it's all over They can put my body up in the river
With everything I did for the culture
Inide of the book indicted, came from my mama
Who got sick on the fucking thang
Immediately media will follow me to the end of the river
Why the people around my body deliver rhythm renovating my scripture
I’m a sick son of a bitch, do you get the picture
My fucking name is catfish, real it on

Back in Alabama with the ball-pen
Hammer knocking hubcaps off the wheels
Stealing bowties off the grills
Mama said, ""No carbonated soda 'fore you go to bed""
But I never listened to her
A two-liter bong with a tinfoil bowl
Full of cheap hydro is illegal, I'm sure
But I learned from watching the neighbors
Yeah, watching the neighbors
Got me in Jordache jeans
Feeling real hot, hangin' from my pocket, a pager
Yeah, buddy boy, I'm clean
Cubic zirconium rocks in my earrings
Give me that stone and a mobile phone
And I carry that gem like me and Irene
I'm getting totally stoked
Sipping Creek Water with me and my folks
I'm getting totally throwed
My flock is waddling around
Can't keep my ducks in a row
And I can't keep up with this bullshit they callin' dope, but I'm married to her
I can't leave this bitch neither
Rock and roll pussy I cannot turn down
Even though she's a liar, a thief, and a cheater, I need her

Checking my trunk like a killer
You ain't fucking with Slumerican, stop, uh
Bitch, go to sleep, grab a pillow
Go to sleep with your stinking ass
I ain't got time, I ain't taking trash
Out to the bin, take you out with my pen
And then I take a bottle and break the glass (Ooh)
I done built me a fortress
And I didn't have to beg, plead, or force it
Got enough forces to sit on my porch and not move, and still be in orbit
An ancient alien, homo sapien
Me and rap is like bee to orca
Turn water to wine, one dollar a time
Drink it up, it's fine, there's no need to cork it
Gorgeous, mmh, give me those
'Cause I remember me and mama poppin' penny rolls
And if you wasn't with me when the shit hit the fan
Then you cannot get a penny, you ain't getting any, bro
Gotta pay the taxes when the wood is out
And the kerosene can is filled up to the brim
Don't look at him, go get the matches
Lace up and then take a hike
I'm making shit that is major like
I'm pulling up on them big wheels
You couldn't pedal a baby bike

Had to walk hours before I found this new kind of road
Had to spend months inside a dark room with my candle broke
But I came out with a light that blinded the antelope
Oh I mean a buck, 'cause I'm buckin' the antidote
Could I be what they though I was, but it's kinda no
And it's kinda yes when addressin' my talent growth
They seen a star but I got life like a planet though
I was just a bud and who knew what the plant would grow
Flowers and I got flower power like Abbey Road
I caught the sun shower drenched in a pot of gold
Bless you with this twinkling powdered smoke
The wind got in my sails in the creek water, no paddle boat
Nobody pickin' me off the ground when my saddle broke
It don't matter though, a horse is a horse
Plus I needed the workout, I'm kinda glad it broke
I'm ecstatic, better yet, I'm in that kind of mode
That classics are made from

I done found my soul through change

Yeah that's me, with a fifth of that Jack D
Still ridin' dirty to 8-ball MJG
Still got the house in the little hood that raised me
Still know dope boys, I talk to em daily
Still got that red neck family who loves me
Still hop out of trucks in the heart of Dixie
Don't try to pull me back, or apart from my history
Because I'm creative, smart and thrifty
'Cause I'll take a shotgun of PBR's no sippin'
Jump in the Chevy do some Catfish Billy trippin'
Hop on the 808, when I flip then you know I'm flippin'
Never gave a fuck about the lines I cross 'em, I'm playing chicken
Raised in the Bible Belt, but with the cross I was made a Christian
What's up world? I'm in Alabama chillin'
And I just took a shot for the ones who stop when they hit the ceilin'
Drop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still hear em, they're saying

Do not succumb to the masses ideas
Over ridicule and judgement
For those who follow the ideas of the weak
Will perish in a dim fog of enlightenment
Become the vision of the mind's eye
And carry your flame to the fire
Do not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you
Build, work, build, work, build, work
Fall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer
Money is a tool for the creation of a creative space
Do not squander the value of a gift from a friend
Family, strangers, enemies, atheists, partisans, pedlers, people
People in this ocean of hungry minds
Feed, do not starve
Start now, wake up
A trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care or not about your happiness
Love yourself and hate only you

Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks
So if you take me up show me the Balcony lookn over
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you, you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got an elevator in your house
But with me you appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much it is Jack Daniels you can handle
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo
Let me drive your Daddy's Lambo

Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying and would kill entertainment channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh

You're young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace
Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast
Though you aint never been to waffle house
Always hanging in guys and dolls
If you came to the shop, I'll put you in a Chevrolet
N we drive to the mall

Buti'm off to the party with rogue status looking for Beverly Hills goody's

Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping cause Drummer made a beat that'll climb the chart
Money, money, money, money, money
Aint it funny what a hunny and a Lambourghini will do
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill
And drill a anytime, unhappy with a 24 inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyse my swing
It's slick rick and Bobby baby
Gotta let me drop that thing, come on

Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion

Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado

Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?

And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues

We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man

[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?

Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately
Mama's never here and step daddy hates me
He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean
Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams
Today I dropped my bowl of s'ghetti on the floor
I didn't mean to make a mess, I tripped on one of my toys
I tried to clean it up, really I tried
But I just made it worse so I went to my room to hide
I knew if Benny saw it I'd be in so much trouble
I didn't want to, but I did
And the thought of gettin' hit scared me so I didn't tell him
Benny saw it, he took off his belt and
You know... he hit me with it
Then he pushed my face in to the carpet where the s'ghetti spilted
But I forgive him though
I love you daddy, I guess I gotta go

There's a moth on my window seal
And it came to die alone
Through the pain of the pouring rain
I gaze into the storm
And I imagine I'm the son of a man
Who will hold me close and near
With these bruises on my face I cry
While I pray to disappear

[Verse 2]
Daddy are you there?
I know you're probably busy off working somewhere
Helpin' somebody, build a house or somethin' neat
You told me what you did, carpentry, right?
Man, that's so cool, daddy
I really miss you, so much that I would kiss you
Yeah even front of my friends
I guess you know I'm gettin' sick again
I've been throwin' up, I haven't been playin' much
I missed a lot of school this week, but I'm tough
I'll make it, you know me, daddy
I don't get what I want most of the time but I'm patient
Hey if you get a second
Maybe tomorrow you could come by just to check in
Because my babysitter's crazy
Mama don't believe me but she makes me get naked
And I'm embarrassed so I hide it
I'm tellin' you because you know my heart and what's inside it
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?
I gotta go to sleep but don't turn off the lights
I love you daddy, or should I say Christ?

When the weeping willow tree sways from the breeze
I float away
To the end of the world, to the moon, to the stars
To the heavens where I'm safe
I’m a child, not a prey. I’m an angel, enslaved

He's been at since ten
Nine to five hours don`t pay enough money
He took a third-shift and he's just gettin' in
Babies are hungry and mommy is bitchin'
'Bout bills that he need to go pay while he sittin'
Not even five minutes to drink a cold beer before hearing about what was left in the kitchen
Walk out the door for a walk to the store, bread was five dollars he only had four
Won't get a check til' the first of next week and he said to himself I can't take anymore
With no heat in the house and no gas in the truck, and his four-year-old's birthday about to come up

She's a single mother livin' in a hotel in the south side of the city
And she works at a bar in the strip to get tips savin' up for a place that is pretty
A twelve-year-old son to support, still in school with a father that's never around
He took her virginity, promised infinity
Then he took off and he hasn't been found
Most of the people she already knows
Have trouble survivin' and keepin' a home
That side of town ain't the place to raise a child
But she's doing her best and there's no where to go
Puts on a skirt, picks up her purse

Joints rolled up bigger than pony stool

[Verse 1]
I never was the one in the classroom sitting with my hand up
When the teacher told us that we needed to report
Anything that was happening at home
Like if I saw pipes or things of that sort
Cocaine dime bags laying on my front porch
Never made me feel sick 'til I found out what it was
No telling how many adults went in through my home
Had a convo with me, unavailable
And maybe I've caught the vibe and maybe they're right
And maybe I'll follow them footsteps of my folks
But that's only a theory 'cause of the people near me
Love me enough to never let me do that dope
But the crew I roll with knew that road
We took a left turn and pursued that dough
I remember being scared of the goons in the room
Passing needles around, spooning, smoke
At the time my young mind was curious
Gullible and naive still
I run around the apartments, hidden in darkness
And sparked it with Chris, Robby, and Will
And I didn't like the feeling at first
The taste in my mouth or the smell on my clothes
But I kept showing up after school to be cool
I would do anything with the bros
And I told my mama lies over and over
What I was doing and where did I go?
Didn't hurt my feelings anymore
I didn't care about being an asshole
Unless my girlfriend found out
That my backpack had a fat packed out roll
But out the blue, she pulled a joint out her purse
That she stole from her folks, and that's all that she wrote
I quote

[Chorus]
I got a question for you, please don't tell nobody
""Boy, do you get high?"" I said, ""All the time""
We got a secret, baby, I won't tell nobody
""When do you get high?"" She said, ""All the time""
Give me a lesson, baby, teach me something new
I said, ""I'll be your guy,"" She said, ""Give me a try""
We got a secret, baby, we won't tell nobody
You and me get high, all the time

[Verse 2]
You and me? Best friends 'til the end, amen
Ride around in the box, ""Guilty Conscience,"" Eminem
Growing up too fast, no bars over no hoes
No high is too high, no bottle is too low
Pack it up, let it burn, pass it, my turn
Let me hit one more time
Let me live, let me learn
Who am I for you to judge?
Who are you? It's just drugs
It's only weed, it's only pills
It's my dope, it's my buzz
One time, one try, then I say bye
I'm lying, I can't stop now, and why?
I tried this, I tried that, I came clean, my act
Took five yellow pills, passed out, came back
D.U.I. sometimes, too lit, can't drive
I made it home, I survived, I shouldn't be alive
My bad, my fault, I'm just an alco'
Shoot 'em up, bang-bang, no chase, no salt

I got a question for you, please don't tell nobody
""Boy, do you get high?"" I said, ""All the time""
We got a secret, baby, I won't tell nobody

And landslide the vampires are vandalized
With cans of Krylon damage and design
Sanitize the inner prize

Face shot to the clear, she dropped on the legs, yeah, and I let her kiss on the head
Hold my beer, don't hold my breath
Hold my weight, showing flex
I'm so hard, diamonds envy 'round me
Look, I'm so cool, I got my own climate
Mountainous terrain to climb no
You fuckin' with the hustle, need a rope
You want the vintage turquoise, Navajo
I stained that shit from stage at every show

Pull up in a beat-up Honda that I stole to drunk drive cause I like Chevy's
Oh, here I go, no red carpet and no rope
Put me down there with my folk and let the Slum come strike a pose
I write my flows like a fighter
These are punches being thrown
To your nose, duck and jab
Leaving blood patterns on the clothes
I might be white Muhammed Ali
As-salamu alaykum, here for the feast
But I couldn't be a Muslim, that could never be
Cause I'm still pissin' in a barrel full of beez
Like a chair for a bear, I'ma need a bigger seat
To sit cross-legged, I swear I'm a Chief
Hey I hose off, staring at me
Better mourn the cow, bury the beef
I clip your wings like there's no air beneath a parakeet
Give you some rings around your eyes like I said marry me
Get to the bottom of it like Titanic, very deep
Make you a model puppet, like Jim Henson every week
Sesame Street, yes sir Big Bird
Leave 'em black and yellow like I live in Pittsburgh
Shit turds, with quick words, throw bricks of wit, this pick is yours
All my fans, they pump the fist, get lit, and flip the bird
All my jams, they bump and kick and I just stick the words
Like a tube of super glue does for model aeroplanes
If the music chooses you, add the wheels and glue the wings
Then the paint, then the strings, then from the ceiling it will hang
Collect them all, don't let 'em fall
Until the critics come and frame
You working pictures then you switch up and you work on model trains
Just to keep 'em in suspicion like a pro, that's why I changed
So to all the people who supported me throughout the game
Over the years, I hope you like watching me grow

Sleepin’ bag by the bricks – come with the fly, I’m on some shit
Drum this out with two sticks
Soup a high school Coupe for new kicks
Zoom – raps make mummies just lift from a tomb
Knock twice if you feel it
Born to rip, I should’ve been
Perforated by the rings like a Mead notebook
Squares want an artery blocked when I’m around
Circulated – nerds are in, Urkel made it
I’ll slap Urkel, take his lunch money
Punks they run from me, drunk and upset

For all the stress that went into my songs

One time for the single wides and the little cribs (one time)
Two times if you know what it's like to fuckin' live (two times)
Three times in a row you've been late on the rent (three...)
Four times before you did the same old shit, yeah

Baby done grown up, rockin' that beard like a grown up
Fuck gettin' toned up, let the Glock talk
I'm on gone and hush
Just like daddy taught me, wait I didn't have one
Fuck it, I'm happy for him, cause he caught a bad one
I popped outta that Easy Bake, landed in 'Bama, clean and safe
Dropped outta high school, reason, hey
I'm already high from a seedless eighth
And they wonder why I speak this way
And ye ain't ever seen this place
Well here's your American pie
It's a Dixie piece of cake (cake...)

Ain't nothing new to this
Been that country cousin way before I even knew K.R.I.T
Seven hundred dollar glass of whiskey and I shoots it
Using my gold teeth to take an olive off a toothpick
Throw the bitch in an empty bottle then I stepped out the Silverado
Light a cigarette up and then hobble off into the alley way covered in smoke like the Legend of Sleepy Hallow
Colder than a December breeze in Chicago, rolling up my sleeves in this one and a lot of them out here working hard but that ain’t my problem, fuck ‘em all because of all that shit was borrowed
Got a bucket to piss in I’m good on this end, no college tuition
On a whole other mission, I’m headed to Memphis to fuck with the remix
Bumping Three-Six, pull up at the big pen and create a helix we repping for Felix
Been dripping, been leaking juice bitch you see ‘em drinking
Look at all my puppy dogs, daddy left you in the kitchen
Now you fucking going off cooking up a new rendition
Country rappers on my balls look at the redneckism
Should’ve popped some Adderall, I wasn’t paying attention
That ADD’s like SATs I never took nothing for it
Dazed and confused major league dude, I never took nothing for it
I was just bored, I was just stuck in my trailer walking back and forth
Became a rapper just so I could sing a lose every fan that I had before
Everyday all day, didn’t have that tattoo
Around about ’08 back when I wore fat shoes
No Balenciaga’s I was hoarding Jordan’s with a corduroy hat fedora in Florida
Forget about the old me kinda sorta
Put on a pair of boots and I jump the border
But what’s a boarder to a native quarter but a wave to make Trump create an order
I’m a rebel bitch I don’t wade at the shore for a wave to crash I go and make the water
Transport a serpent earth I’m never nervous, you can’t evolve living on the surface
You can’t take me from my purpose, that’s like taking 50 from Curtis
So hop in the next lane, yeah just I hop in the next lane
But I got the whole fucking highway, run over you like a sept tank
Trying to catch up in your Reeboks, you better watch where you’re stepping
I’ll shit on your Champion sweatsuit, cause we can get popped like a wedding
But I’m musically polygamous idiot rock and roll we did the same thing
Yeah I’m 'bout the Slum South, striped suits and the chain gangs
See if Johnny Cash and Jim Morrison became B-boys with Eminem and Pink Floyd
Then forged a group with Hank III of course then Slumerican would be the emporium

And break a bottle with the bullet, yes I'm 'bout it motherfucker
Not a single solitary thing is missing from my southern roots
I'm liable just to take a chevrolet and run it through the mud for giggles
Huh, what a son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper that could tell story like my uncle when he's drinking
Product of a working environment, fuck is y'all thinking?
Meaning I'm working-working harder than any artist can ever do it simply cause I'm made that way
I build a house around your ass before you could realize, that you were in the neighborhood that yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it, tell'em I'm an alabama wanna-be, I be that
I'll just take it to the studio and drop a bomb on you from a motherfucking beanbag, I need that

Get away
Tell my folks roll up the j's
Bring yelawolf a deuce, we'll sit up on the roofs of the broken [?]
Till there's nothing left to say, cause if I don't get away

Who would roll with wolf, why you come back?
Cause them up there, don't want to play fair
Got me pinned to the wall like a fucking thumbtack
Dumb fatt, dumb?, criticize a nigga for the crack I sell?
Like you could give a shit if a nigga eat well
Or eat at all, want to see me fall

Yelawolf,Growing Up In The Gutter,/y/yelawolf/growing+up+in+the+gutter_20988495.html,"Once upon a time in an apartment home
Lived a little girl with a heart of stone
Cause part of her heart was partly gone
Rarely seen and hardly known
Treated like a mat on a boxing ring
Blood drops stains on the twin box springs
Daddy came to visit, it's not a dream
She thought to herself, what is happening?
Above her head there's a crucifix
But Lucifer loosens up his wrist
Lays her down with an open fist
And all that was left was hopelessness
Little girl, where's your loving mother, under the covers, under the covers
Little girl what have you discovered?
She stuttered

Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairy tales and songs
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter, black and white, in a frame
Dead we are, safe and sound, straight guns, no aim game
Growin' up in the gutter

And you ain't gotta be from the projects to deal with this non-sense
Cause even in suburbia, somebody will murder ya over nothing
Leave your body slumping in the parking lot of your complex
Violence is a hard pit to swallow and digest
The town is full of drug dealers
Most of them are shot in the process
Hussle
And robbing motherfuckers like they're having a contest
Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag
A week later he tied her up on
Cause he showed her all the pills he got for
She told her cousin, and her cousin grabbed a gat and a mag
Kicked in his door, laid him down,
Ran off with all that he had
Used to be ballin, now he got a colostomy bag
What you know about that?
Middle-class white bitch slangin her body for crack
For drug cartels, you hear the buck shot shells, and then the blood
Clot fails,
Biggest meth bust on the east coast, right here in the
My lyrics approved, growin' up in the gutter

You think you can define how hard you got it
By what neighborhood you live in mother fucker?

Wake up in the gutter, no more, fairy tales and songs
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter, black and white, in a frame
Dead we are, safe and sound, straight guns, no aim game
Growin' up in the gutter

Slumerican in I am
Drug through the mud like a I am
Was a child who was beaten, I am
Leather belts that made me, I am
Home or gone again at 8, I am
Somebody's life to wait, I am
Given to the beast by fate, I am
The one who did escape, I am
A voice for the cold in the dark, I am
The one who sold his I am
From a family torn apart, I am
A target for your daughter, I am
Sick again from the whips, I am
Head to the gun and click, I am
That don't run from shit, I am
Exposed to the goats of sea, I am
Met a ghost and he said, I am
In the basement in red, I am
Dead cause the ouija board said

I... A... M

Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairy tales and songs
No place like hell, no place like home
Growin' up in the gutter, black and white, in a frame
Dead we are, safe and sound, straight guns, no aim game

That one is yours, this one is mine

Pull me over ’cause I’m falling over stepping off
Running rap I swear, hello mama how is church
Another sunday and I’m working off in it
Feeling like a edible eat shit for dessert
For the first day of christmas I won’t buzz
Second day of christmas I won’t check
Niggas in the cars and the crop and the city in the chevy
Throwin rocks and your car don’t match
Steady branches while they kill it and before that
You been a real goon ’cause I feelin laid back
But if I wanna run I wanna circle with the upper
So I like it to your rose and I do it in fact
And I’m running on your own, black maybach
And a can of white paint like I came from the top
And the cd drops if you wanna tell your mama
That you wanna come play like you came from the stop
I’m right on time don’t change the clock
With the prime of the rhyme ain’t no cock
And the game’s on lock and the game in the box
Doors on you we got on so back
Better put your mom, better find a job
Call the cops, find it all
‘cause if I made it call, the people that care about you
Never ever ever find you at all
Ah nah hell nah, I don’t know on it, but ball hundred
Crips and tie hand it a hundred
Yelawolf’s raw, ye he’s done it
But I can’t afford to lose this gold
It be like driving a ford to the show
I rather walk and get my chevy towed, 
To the front door the bar I sold

Hammertime or jack daniels
Is an old friend of mine
I bought my lady friend a gin and lime
My hand in the pandy line
We took the pills and the feeling get samplified
We sort zandy line and feel the drain is dripped
Hard liquor we don’t sip we don’t baby sit
Draw spitting like I’m niffing on a baby dip
I could get hit like a freight train and leave
But it’s time to go hammer, I’ma go slam her
Tryin to crown but your little ghost
Like a dude want to gold winners
Now tell the shit, I’ma bust them in the head with his so called bottle
He gon’ need some cold water and a pack of ice
I ain’t no role model got a bag a body
We bout to drop it out, we hopping out
There’s something those goons driving drove from those flashing lights

Yelawolf,Happy Father's Day,/y/yelawolf/happy+fathers+day_21023173.html,"Yeah, I just thought it was appropriate to
Just to give a shout out, show my appreciation to the fathers
You know I hear a lot of rappers saying
Or brag about not having kids
But guess what, I do!
So I'd like to sing this record out
To all the daddies, you know the real daddies
Taking care of shit

This one's for the skateboarders, emcees, b boys, like me
Street artists and magazines, dj's with babies
Working hard, you never sleep, never get to spend they time at home
Send that money but you never see him
Hard ways working, daddy's gone
To the brick legging, dirt digging,
Burglar flipping in the fucking kitchen
Just to get that friday
So you could bring back what was missing
Every day, it'll be my kids day,
End of the moth is day
And if you don't get back to work on time
They tax you for that month's wage
For the d boys holding weight
And for the daddies who are locked away
Doing time cause you was doing grind
But you was on the trying to put down a plate
Maybe to get some baby jays, in the that's how we raise
If you could be a feed in a french drive
When that train has passed away, I've got to say

Yeah, to all my closest friends
And all the father figures in my life
You know I really, I just wanna say thank you, yo, for real

Happy father's day, no matter how you getting paid
You hustle hard, you show the way

Happy father's day

Tell my mama not to worry about me
Cause I ain't never had a second to forgive my dad
I can't help her to believe in myself
Is not really good choice
But no matter I be in the building
When I came to the world I knew a dad
But I never would imagine I will be young dad
And I grew up like weed a over night, through the crack in the concrete
Look at me, young dad
Tell me how to walk away from a child
And I'll tell you how to walk away from a million doll dad
If you can walk away from a million bucks then you never give a fuck
You dumb luck dad
To look up and see your man above you
To tell you that you ain't invisible, that's a motherfucking dad
So why did he push you, and teach you how to fight
If you didn't fight, fucking right, it's a good dad
Gotta take a second now show love to the trailer park apartment... Dads
Or man who ain't got a lot but in a minute
He would drop it all, do anything he could do
Jesus, when I go to mama who never had a real dad
Don't take it out in the
You may be even the man when he's only tryna become
A real daddy

Cause it ain't easy
But it's a blessing man
Makes you work hard
To all the hard workers out there
I just wanna say

Happy father's day, no matter how you getting paid
You hustle hard, you show the way
Happy father's day."

You ain't gotta lay down on your bed to know you already fucked up
Lettin' me in the motherfuckin' game is lettin' me drunk-drivin' your truck
When Yelawolf arrived in this club, already had five in my cup
I done took another hit, I done ran into a bitch that's lookin' lifeless and stuck
Baby, what's wrong wit' you now? What, you ain't happy wit' red bottoms?
Mad 'cause I'm in vip wit' a fuckin' Jack bottle?
Wit' Tom, dick, and Harry
But I got up in this bitch wit' a tank top 'cause I spit so very darn quick and scary
That's why they're so quick to compare me
But fuck the critics wit' a spiked dick when it can fit barely
They prob'ly think I'ma Limp Bizkit, their spit's jelly
But I put 'em in the woods, I'm a redneck, I'm a hick, tell me
Go ahead: What the fuck does it matter to me?
'Cause after me, there'll only be wannabes, and mostly ain't-never-gonna-bes
Yeah, in this forest, I'm a lonely tree
My limbs are covered in tattoos, and my roots, they run deep

Two bottles, shawty, two bitches waitin'
Two tens, that's a win-win situation
Happy birthday, I'm feelin' brand new
Drinks on me... For me, not you

Still don't give a fuck

I don't know what to say after that first verse, I mean, like, damn, I just killed it
What the fuck am I supposed to do with this cow? I done already milked it
Smoke another cigarette, unfiltered, let go of anything that I'm feelin'
They done broke me down so many times before that I'm no longer rappin', I'm buildin'
Wit' one brick, two brick, three brick, four
Underneath the steps of my single-wide door
Raised by them dope boys, so I know how them things look
Thanks for the recipe, rest in peace, Wayne Bush
I don't cook my shit, I don't break it down for you motherfucker out there waitin' around
For some rap savior, you better look up at what it is that you facin' now
'Cause Jesus drives a Harley, the devil wears Prada
If God was one of us, he'd prob'ly drink vodka
I still kick it at the party when I get rich
'Cause rich or broke, I'm still as dope, the realest ain't as real as this
Dead or alive, I'll put a stamp in this bitch
You'll never see rock and roll do hip-hop like I did

Two bottles, shawty, two bitches waitin'
Two tens, that's a win-win situation
Happy birthday, I'm feelin' brand new
Drinks on me... For me, not you

At the coffin

I will take your favorite books, and put them in a row
I remember how you like them, I know where they go
Your mama will be waiting there, for you to hold
I know that she misses you, misses you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
You have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose

[Verse 2]
I will keep the memories, that always make me smile
But letting you go, honestly, I'm havin' a tough time
But I promise I'll be strong for you, like you said, and hold it in the road
But, I'll be down here missing you, missing you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose

Uh, 'money ain't the issue' you said, that's funny now
Cause money's all I could give you to shut your motherfucking mouth
Here, take 20 grand and buy yourself a lawyer
Shit, here's a whip so my kids ain't gotta walk to the store for ya, fuck
Momma told me I should keep it real
My record ain't selling, momma, I'm trying hard enough to keep a deal
Meanwhile I'm throwing paper down into an empty pit
I got a business I'm trying to run, man, fuck this bitch
I should've seen it coming, she never pulled her weight
I'm carrying her like an elephant on a dinner plate

Wanna talk about heartbreak, oh, oh
Baby, I've been around, you know I've been around
And I can't pretend to love you right now
So you can go cry your heart out until you drown
Hope you can swim it out cause I can't be friends with a friend like you tryna hold me down

You got some nerve to be mad at me for, fuck, anything
What have I done besides give you what I could not afford?
The kids are happy cause they really don't know anything
If they only knew what toys that their momma could afford
The vacation they could be taking when daddy's on tour
Wait, you are on vacation, that's what this shit is for
I get it, I'm like the fountain of youth
You're in the bed with your boo and you two are sipping courvoisier, true?
This song ain't no diss, it's a living proof

I ain't done, bitch, put this shit in loop
Here's a melody so it sticks in your head like your tracks do, ooh

Cause I'm the golden ticket to get out of the hood
You better hope somebody cares more than I do
Cause my will don't include you

Working so hard cause they can't, go to sleep
Got the same clothes that you rock, for three days
Hitting traps like a prophet, for beats sake

No job open but she's out, still looking
If you don't, who the fuck will?
Not daddy, cause that mothafucka's not here

Like I didn't wake up in the back of the bus that's finally mine
Why do I feel like I never had marshall mathers' co-sign sometimes?
Like radioactive failed, well livin' this time
I'm even not used to believe that I could be one of the top 5
Maybe when I tell myself I'm one of the best, I'm just lyin'
When my uncle buddy call and ask, I say I'm just fine
But I feel like I haven't made it, uncle but I'm just tryin'
Or maybe I'm just not used to having shit I never had
Never stood in the winters and never said ""I got dinner, dad""
Shit, never even had the cash to pay my dad for getting her back
And [?] I love you, thank you, always my favorite dad
And it feels like yesterday literally like yesterday
When I couldn't get one motherfucking fan to come and see me play
When I drove that minivan for the [?] without a license plate
To atl so I could play will power my demo tape

He's a friend of mine [?] and that I can't replace

But the butterfly's still above and I'm above what I started now
Passionate like a political poet in an artist lounge
Hungry like a poor daddy with a gun and a starving child
If you thought it was a flake, then you just a departed clown
And if you thought I was coming hard, well you better think harder now

And it's been a long motherfucking time since I felt this homesick as I do now

Throw it up, it's that alabama sound
Much love and I never let you down

Back in gadsden and cuttin' grass
Or handcuffed on the side of the road on my fuckin' ass
Before I become complacent on the [?] level that I'm at
Momma will quit drinking and no poppa will smoke some crack
Lost, yeah I may have, my mind
But it takes a lunatic to pursue this shit
Ay that's fine because I paid the cost
Really more like a fine, but instead of paying for tickets now
They pay for tickets in line to see me [?]
The pain in the mic [?]
Two-step in my shoes with a shameless walk

Yelawolf,Hustle,/y/yelawolf/hustle_21059124.html,"Rolling with the top down, no peanut butter guts
Trolling, I’m about to climb
Lemme go on turn the bass up, turn it up! 
Holdin that glock nine, in case a hater run up
Call me, I’m the shit now, so your bitch on my nuts! 
I got my car smoking, but it ain’t the motor, 
It’s just me and that dodo
These hoes is strolling, I'd stop and poke em 
But I’m trying to get that doe hoe ridin dirty
Ain’t no hobo it’s just me strapped up like a go pro
And I'm one deep Han/solo
Laws trynna capture me like a photo! Hustle! 
All I need is two cups of drink
With the system crank and a fifth of... 
See me pulling planks and my candy paint pull broads around me in crowds
Bow ties when I hit the brakes, my hustle skills you can’t debate
Money don’t wait, I’ll be stacking up bank
Till I’m dead an up in them clouds
Getting to the cake mayne fuck the fake
Riding outta state with a Texas plate
Speakers in the back beatin like a ape
Four 15s rockford fosgate
Crawl like a snake, boys gone hate
But it’s money to make, don’t fall for the bait
Save the bullshit, I ain’t gotta cape
What I got till I am in the grave
Is a whole lot of hustle, Hustle

Hook: (x2)
Pack it up and send it away 9 to 5 I could do it all day, boy you know I gotta hustle! 
Movin a mop I clean em up from outer space
Gotta get em up got a universe on hustle! 
Had a premonition of me in the front seat
Of 2013, boy we gotta hustle! 
We gotta, Hustle 
You wanna go follow your dream then! 
Hustle

Yeah, couldn’t tell me not to believe
In the people that I was put in front of
And told that I had an opportunity to become a part of a situation
That put me in a position to maybe some day break out of a small town
I guess I fell for the okey doke
I suppose I couldn’t turn around in the hokey pokey game
To see lames and other folks who thought a joke was being played on me
Oh well, the story goes again! 

Here we go again, all I'm gettings frown while the motherfucker’s grin
I can get the sound of the gate closing in
And I can feel the breeze of the hate blowing in
Cause they all wanna go sightseeing
Hop in the Chevy and ride for a little while 
And they kinda wanna drive, even make a turn off a road you aint familiar with
And offer to pay for the gas for alittle bit then

But fuck you know what you got a best friend
But when he started off he was just hitchhiking
Should have heard real when they said wolf for real
If you'd chill, then you'd find another one just like him! 
But it’s hard as a mother fucker to say no
When you’re a rookie talking to a veteran playing pro
And everything that he’s saying, he’s saying so pay him close attention
So you put your hands low! 
Palms, out, opened, hoping
And you can even see that engine smoking
Plus all the money that he gave you, owe him Rear view mirrors all of them broken black boys, white boys, just a token for the slot machine
And the gambling notion! 
Scheming and scoping, the animal inside
The cannibal chose him, me! 
I fell for another man’s hustle! 

Hook: (x2)
Pack it up and send it away 9 to 5 I could do it all day, boy you know I gotta hustle! 
Movin a mop I clean em up from outer space
Gotta get em up gotta universal hustle!

Yelawolf,I See You,/y/yelawolf/i+see+you_20994833.html,"[Verse 1:]
Yeah, once upon a time not long ago,
My grandmother told me one day I'd change
I felt like she was coming down on me
So I told her no, I'd be the same
Not knowing she was only trying to help
Motivate me to excel and climb
I was thinking she was the one trapped
While I was stuck in the cage of my mind
Man if I would've known what I know now
I would have brought my head down out of that cloud
Told her thank you and that I loved her
But I was too cool and too damn proud
What a fool I was in fact
I've changed so much, now looking back
I wish somebody I thought was cool
Was cool as she was when she told me that

[Hook:]
I see you, the real you
Trying to cover up what's inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!

[Verse 2:]
Baby girl don't know much about
What it would take to become a star
Hollywood is so far fetched
Too long of a drive in an old car
Work every day but you barely eat
Going over lines from a script you read
Your boyfriend said it's a silly dream
But how can you dream when you never sleep
You're looking in the mirror and you're picturing a light show
A glimpse in the lens of a camera
Behind the scenes of life as a tightrope
Yea you walk a thin line
But a thin line is all you need
A thin line in an Indy movie
Just a break for somebody to see the

Talent inside, the ballad of a diary you write
The by and by is just another day for a normal girl
But for you it's another day that you tried
Aside from the fact that you ride in the back of a bus
Sometimes cause your car won't work
Well maybe you should take that bus to L. A.
And put your dreams first because...

[Hook:]
I see you, the real you
Trying to cover up what's inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool
I see you!
I see you!

[Verse 3:]
Black and white, everything is black and white
Broke down, simple and plain
Most of us lost with a curious brain
Curiosity is looked at as strange
Stuck in a lane, but you can't complain
While you look at another passing train
Wondering how, where's it going?
Wishing you were inside, packed and rolling
To another place, but your time is chosen
To live low key, 'cause your dream is stolen
They don't understand, they believe in loathing
Lounging, loafing, waiting, hoping
Homie if the grass is greener
Look, the gate is open
You're waiting for God to release the ocean
Sitting on the beach two feet from floating
But I see you...

[Hook:]
I see you, the real you
Trying to cover up what's inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool

[Verse 1]
The windows cracked on the Chevrolet
My cigarettes in the ash tray
The engines off and the radio's down
So nervous my whole body shakes
The parking lot's full of people and
They ready to see the preacher man
Time to open up for the main act
I guess that makes me a deacon
I promise that I won't let me down
And check myself in the mirror one time
Say my prayer and then I sip the Crown
Light another smoke and step outside
Walk inside and take a look around
As I try to remember all of my lines
Guess it's time for me to face the crowd
And give the people my time

These people standing on front row
Tryna see through me like a window
I'm wearing my soul on my sleeve
But they look at me through a pin hole
All I see is this opportunity
To see at least one of you in me
But I can't seem to win 'em over so
I swallow the humility
Fifteen minutes to hold 'em down
And I'm just wishing that it would fly by
It's like my whole world hits the ground
All I wanted to do is have a good time
Hold me under but I will not drown
All I really know how to do is survive
Next time that I come to your town
I'll be the fuckin' headline

I'm not supposed to be this person, I suppose
I'm not supposed to be this rapper poking holes at stereotypes
Or to write this juxtaposing flow to beats at shows
I hold the microphone and out me goes this songs and quotables
Call me nasty, say I stink, well hit the sink and hold your nose
Cause I'm about as convinceable as a bum in stolen clothes to let go of those
I got dreams like fish got gills
I can't survive in this lake water without a deal
But I can build Noah's Ark without a power drill
Look at this crowd like it's a battlefield
Tell 'em my trials, my triumphs, my failures, my family loud and clear
Let 'em all judge, I don't care how they feel
Fuck it, what do I care? I'm my personal shrink
Throw my heart down on the ground, stomp it, use the blood for the ink
I'm used to purple and pink bruises so thanks for the tools
That's just a brick from the mansion
Another stitch in the pants of a Johnny Cash

Henny where I put in work, best believe it hoe

Permanent pirate, slum to the dirt
Crown me king, imperial poet
Lace my bud with lsd
Picture me floatin' at 16
Play with the ouija board 'til the Devil lost his focus
Mental wars, built me up
Veteran soldier, pistol totin'
Sharp as a sickle, drippin', broken
Wish you would, I ain't hopin'
Like a creek to an ocean eventually connects
I found my way into that wave and rode it with respect
Now some of these country boys are rappin', but have no intellect
No introspective on the genre, just out there for that check
But fuck the world, I'm no lie detector
And if you're conscious does not affect ya

Monetize the lies you perfected

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Way back in Alabama where the dirt roads cut through the woods
And when it rains you can smell the steam off the grass
Even dew on the hood of my paw paw's 1985 Chevrolet Silverado
I must have been about six
Life was so easy back in the sticks
16 year old mother fought for the life she wanted for her son
Lookin' for love in the world of rock and roll is where it begun
It was Alabama, Ted Nugent
Alice Cooper, Randy Travis
Aerosmith kept my stepdaddy on the road
And life, it was madness
Cocaine and alcohol filled up the house party to be frank
It wasn't long before I tried it myself and then started to drink
School became boring and doing my homework became rollin' joints
Now I'm sixteen like my mama was when she had a little boy
Can't imagine that now as I look back 'cause I got three kids of my own
And I respect what she went through to pay for food and clothes
And a home
'Cause it ain't what she did, it's what she didn't do for me
That brought me to this moment
And made me who I am on this recording
And this is my story

[Chorus: Wynonna Judd]
This is my story
This is my glory
This is what keeps me alive
This is me flying
This is me trying
This is what keeps me alive

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
20 years old in the streets and I'm rollin' with gangsters now
Hip-hop is takin' over me, my language, my clothes, my lifestyle
Antioch, Tennessee put me through the school of hard knocks
And I carry that attitude with me to this day, more or not
And I'm young and hot-headed
Always running from police and skateboardin'
Graffiti, loiterin', I sorta got my peace from the chaos
Was no ""mother-may-I's,"" surrounded by have-nots
And maybe some day I's well
I was against the grain, even when I was growin' wheat
Got back into rock and roll, and then got into poetry
Started expressin' everything I could through the medium of pen and pad
Playin' instrumentals off a tape and then over-dubbin' what I had
It was everything, because I had nothin'
And man that was alright, 'cause now I had somethin'
Little did I know that would be the hardest thing to do God ever put before me
So I took a look at what I've been through
And I made it my glory, and this is...

This is my story
This is my glory
This is what keeps me alive
This is me flying
This is me trying

It's a 2 AM bus 'craw; from me at the parkin' lot of Wal-Mart
Leavin' Nashville, Tennessee for a nationwide tour
My bags are all packed and I'm loadin' my truck to go meet the crew
And I'm excited to get on the road, already one foot out the door
Turn around and it's my daughter, she's cryin'
'Cause daddy is leavin'
Knows that I'll be gone for months and it hurts and I hate to see it
Kneel down and tell her, ""Look, baby, I promise I'll call you everyday
And daddy will send you a present from everywhere that we go play""
But that's not enough, and it's breakin' my heart in two
Just knowin' I can't stay, not even to see it through
And that I can't tuck her in, to say goodbye with a grin
Now she's bein' left behind, this is me all over again, man
I picked her up in my arms and held her tight
And said, ""Hey you know what? Daddy used to be just like you
When I would walk up to the bus
And I'd do anything in the world for you, so chase your dreams
One day you'll use everything you've been through to be anything, baby girl
This is my story

I'm just a kid that rocks
I'm just a boy with a dream
You bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep A. 22 in a shoebox
Now I bang beretta's, she's 22 and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all, take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the f-ck did I get a catalogue with more hits than a f-cking jackhammer dog
Cause I planned it all, crimson tide standing tall
Shit, I'm another lit cannon ball
F-ck around and I'm going off and I'm getting throwed off

Put the needle on the record man
Let’s bump some of that Yelawolf and DJ Paul

PBR cannons and ditches

Big trunk rears rolling over ditches
And PBR cannons in bitches hands
PBR…

That DJ Paul beat!

Don’t smoke, I’m blowin up city yards
This city yours, I burn this
The fuck? See

See it was shit but…
Hold up
Keep your doors in
Fuck man
There gotta be a way to describe this shit man
I’mma figure this shit out
Fo real

(Verse)
Gold teeth on my silver spoon, fuck the face on that paint job
Fuck yo boys from the pin up goons, white folks that you can’t drop
Yea that quarantine, sippin this both, we both for same highs
Get away, well that stretch bad
Pentagram for my paint box
Levi’s from a thrift shop, Busta Rhymes on my feed, fuck!
That exactly not real, now play stuck in my keats, what?
Mouth’s all in that JOB, flame dipped on that cheeba cheeba
Six poppin that game, up yours
Me closing these green Adidas
Strappin from the pop home, carpet pass for them M80’s
Drug pills in my watch like it’s no folks to this gym daily
This dope, tripped out
Tied out, brain fried
Mouthful, lips out
Mushrooms, stack trot
Back workin that overdose, got a half that owe me the crystal full
Young girls in the web trap
Brain washed like I’m finished, I’m cool
Take some of this blood soon
Can’t fuck with just me and you
Blood pass me that 22
Witchcraft and the bitches blew
Yea

Light switch, head down
Baby shut the motherfuckin pyro
Ain’t that a bitch? Fuck yall
Gotta hit my neighbor up just to make a call
Light switch, fuck yall

Lookin at this shit, it’s like click to a light switch

(Verse)
I do my long nights with the top on it
Drink it down til the spit bad
Mad the action up floorboards
Role models can’t get that
My whole model is just left
Laugh it off and just get mad
Either way I’m up on the roof
Think of revolver, throw bricks at
Antarctica’s in my genes, middle fingers and pipe bombs
That tower stay in 13 with no damn , right ma?
Fit your group over that bim
Free songs to my white males
Our truth to this lost world
Rotate til I fight real
Give thanks to the microwave
I’m a chef and I’m rolling on it
Try to cook a banana peel
For me you baby just smoked on
Tin foil with a big pin makes no smoke, good smoke
Before the damsel was paint in red
Oh wait, more than one way to use a Colt
Scopes over them crossed bones
There’s no face to vibe us all
Clubber talkin that deep south
Go pop pills like Pyro
Don’t speak Spanish, they can’t manage
Quiet watching the fine cops
In the back suit with the mad life
Leaving dope boys in the pile box

Trench coats in the hallway
That doorman’s gotta know I’m gone
But when Pac left with them safe keys
That empty gap is a short draw
Babies all in that grave sight
Tears drop on that Jesus piece
Bad flows, Johnny Cash
From Pac style and you leave in peace
My stripes red stripes
White stores, blue night
That bed is open, the trailer park
Some bitch flashin them blue lights
Psychological motherfucker,
Power trip and they best look down
Statue go with a steel cage
Finna make a grown man act a clown
Tight threads on them, grab a rose
Old school with them rusty goods
Baby seats full of crystal meth
High rich but the money’s good
Show sticks and then pops his hair
Buy the liquor, smoke by the case
Watching over this in my land
Til the butt, nothing goes to waste
Bridge trappin the nation’s bid
Oh how they just savor it
Hoods droppin like fly shit
They got a plan for you, just wait for it
That statue was a major bitch
But man I feel liberated
Took this shit like a dome beater
I had a while, I innovated

Man look at this shit
I know right, it's crazy
I wish the storm would just blow this motherfucker away
Why you say that?
Serious man I hate this fucking town
You know Bobby needs you at the job right?
Fuck him
You don't like Bobby? I thought you liked Bobby?
I'm gettin' the fuck out of here man
Okay
Watch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Tommy just got out of jail (Got out of jail? Got out of jail)
Two months he couldn't make bail (Couldn't make bail? Couldn't make bail)
Here we sit, whiskey bent, freestylin' over cricket chirps
He would spit, then I went, loaded gun, death we flirt
Leave it up to the Baptist church
Me and him are scum of the Earth
Feelin' like two millionaires with a hundred dollar net worth
Topic of discussion, is that they know nothin'
They didn't find the other 20 pounds hid in the oven
What happened to me and you
We used to go to Sunday School
And we worked Monday to Friday, and sometimes Sunday too
500 dollar check, and that's no disrespect
But I'm a talent goddamnit, you watch, I'm tellin' you
We had it all mapped out, hip-hop til we crashed out
I drank 'til I couldn't walk straight, on the front porch where we passed out
Nothin' but trouble, dealin' with troubles of our sorrow
And the clouds follow, we was just like

[Chorus]
Just like lightning in a bottle
Burnin' electric blue
Just like gunshots in the hollow
Echoin' all night through
This is how we shed our problems
Under the southern moon
Just like lightning in a bottle
Burnin' electric blue

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's three o'clock in the morning
I got two packs of Parliament lites and
A dimebag and Bama brick
I just lay in the dark of the night on
The bed of my buddy's truck who
Got it from his Papa back when
He died in a fire rescue, and I never asked what happened
We would listen to Charlie Daniels
Too $hort and Bob Sigel
Sing along to Night Moves, sippin' on gas station margaritas
Gotta get a good buzz out here man
Nothin' else to do but get high
But bullet holes in beer cans
And talk about how we gonna get by
Some say that dreaming's useless, full of pride and selfishness
Escapin' that mental prisons like, climbin' the electric fence
And that's a risk, but a risk I'll take to better with
'Cause through Hell I've been
So successful be just self-defense
I took another swallow
Can't share my dream with everybody
And besides to the factory, I clock in tomorrow
And to the room I wabble
But the vision I follow
A storm was brewin', we was just like

[Chorus]
Just like lightning in a bottle
Burnin' electric blue
Just like gunshots in the hollow
Echoin' all night through
This is how we shed our problems
Under the southern moon
Just like lightning in a bottle
Burnin' electric blue
Just like lightning in a bottle
Burnin' electric blue
Just like gunshots in the hollow
Echoin' all night through
This is how we shed our problems
Under the southern moon
Just like lightning in a bottle
Burnin' electric blue

Madonna, Madonna, Madonna, what kind of mama raised you?
And I'm the piranha who chased you
Threw me inside of your prison, I made up my decision
My only regret is they didn't make two
Happily a victim to the collision, running head-on
See, that's a motherfucking breakthrough
Told me I couldn't handle it and, baby, you was dead wrong
What happened to the harder way?
You turned it to a marathon, tear that pussy down
Throw the wig on, very into blondes, whatever you want
With the break of dawn, each and every song
I'ma let the gun go until you call it quit, donezo
You puttin' on a show and I'm sitting front row
You got with the one told, that could wake them, you know
Plus I got an ego to uphold, true, to put it to you blunt...

And this handle, Eminem thinks this kid's

For you, to serve things scrambled.

And that I wouldn't make it.

Fuck 'em! Sometime you (need to hear!)
'cause when you realize I'm a doubling one debt
You're gonna fuck up what I get.

My tail back everywhere I go to.

I was kicked down and kicked again,
'till I was kicking in every lock there is
Dropped my fans, try to hold me back,
So I can hit the road and rock again.
And there they are and I'm standing on this fucking stage,

That band's gotta go, friend,

Took off, fuckin with some college graduate
Punk ass, Abercrombie wearin motherfucker
Left me broken hearted in the chevy
It's all good though, know why?
I got me bitch

Both of us was in the same class
And I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mark my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hoping to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took zanex
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial it's apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live
Without you holdin my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes

Rollin down 20 man
With this jack in my cup
Feelin down on my luck
And I'm doin 120 man
Maybe I'm givin up
Baby I'm givin up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

Used to fuck so much we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were on separate fool
And I was broke with no fuckin food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate hoes under my shoes
Dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip hop
You was in love with that dude
What made it come to a stop?
Had to have been the money issue
Bitch
And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul
And I got left was a key chain

Who the fuck are you fuckin now?
Bet he's always takin you out
Accomplished, educated and proud
Me, well I'm just a drop out
Can't really blame ya for buggin
Ain't I the dirt on your rug
And just a place to wipe your shoes
And give me all your thrown away lovin
Back to my buzzin and druggin
Back to my gutter with nothin
Back to the all of a sudden cracks
In the cevenant trust in me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharin this success with Wyane
Now it's just petty change
But I still feel the pain

If I don't come home
Just know you've been a good friend

If God is my angel, the fucking devil's the pistol
Better put your face behind safety glass when I load up this missile
Whistling past this infinite path, I limp when I track
My footprints like a giant, look at this mountain
Bounce on my boots and then climb it
Mount up my troops and defiantly
Go against what they trying, teach 'em to shoot what I'm rhyming
Be living proof of my word, meaning I'm Bible designing
Jesus I'm rival, decapitating put the bait on my line and
Throw the hook to the open water
Fish till I catch that motherfucker
Looking for Megalodon, Goliath, Leviathan, I have been dying to find him and tie him to my boat and chop him up and dine with him on a plate with a steak and a coke
Rely on patience and hope, speak to a nation at shows
Reach through these speakers and grab you, turn the bass up and then choke
And I earned my place on this road, ain't nobody moving me, no way
No, how, OK, go, pow
When I was born they said exit signs in the hospital set on fire
The preacher got goosebumps when he saw me and said ""Messiah""
Yea from the heavens, I have arose from the ashes of hell
Brought here to be poor white trash and excelled
Stuck in the woods of 'Bama, wood like math on the shelf
A scientist under development with nines and twelves and threes
And things like pyramids and fuck it you'll see
How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans
How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea
From crippled ships to triple dipped Z's 71's
Yeah it's already begun and I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one
I got my weight up like I'm carrying fat people
I planned it, I landed
Touch down, that's eagle
But above all the guts glory it's more than just blood for me
My heart is half open for the ones that never gave a fuck for me
My love story

Oh...

Ayy, I don't care how much dope you sellin'
You should care more about the hoes that you tellin'
Dirt, leather soft, I'm reppin'
Always gotta ride with a weapon
Spent too much time outside with the felons
Daddy was an outlaw, ride with the eightball
Guns in the ride, we ain't talking 'bout paintball
Don't mean I won't get in the paint
Know last rapper that I came for got mangled (Got mangled)
Left him bloody in the streets, paramedic company
That's a pair of scary crackers, your cup of tea
Cunt, you were smiling, try not fuck with me, yeah
Yelawolf, black sheep, blacking out on sleep
Blackout curtains for the heat
Black is what is underneath
Try to come swim with the shark but the water is getting too deep
And I gotta get in my feast
I get ahead of myself when I talk about y'all
Like you know I got the skill to compete
Still I don't miss a beat, riding with Pistol Pete
Two felonies and a misdeme'

Off of cocaine and an Advil relief

Ridin' around in a tank in a tanktop
Knife on my leg, hoping one of y'all namedrop

Fuck what you heard, we them boys and you ain't hot
Watch 'em pop up out the blue, that's a Percocet

I hurdle a herd of sheep in my sleep
Before I woke up in bed, I took a leak
Bedwetter, trendsetter
Dead center of the attention and finna get better
Turn that pussy into wet weather
Is it hailing or it's meth weather?
Why do you inhale it? It make the sex better
Huffing a line, covered in hives
Walking on glass, breaking the ice
Money got me rolling like dice
Molly got me rolling like dice
Paid the price, I gave my life
My heart and soul, I won the fight
We on a roll, I'm on a roll

Raised the bar, I'm on the rise, it's

I just left a thrift shop with a Ziploc full of new wings
Got a few things for the miss, I got no bling on the wristwatch
That denim vest, put that top rock of that vintage New York hip-hop
Where the funk at? Y'all lost that
Too much trap, not enough style
Too much gold, not enough slow
Too much blow, not enough pot
Two months ago now it's old school
I'm like, fuck that shit, no, it's not
Look, you don't want it with the posse, pussy
Not me, try me, push me
Pull up on your fucking block, we mopping
Got you sloppy, gushy
Mafia, mafia, Slumerican is the mafia
And I am not being cocky but Slumerican is unstoppable
Give a fuck 'bout that Glock you tote, even my mama got pistols
You should be more afraid of Mama Wolf if you let that clip go
Gang, gang
Never snorted Columbian, bang, bang
But I snorted enough glue to knock a few screws loose
And the rails up off my train
That Ozzy Osbourne, why's he always going?
Lying ass rappers, not a rider, boy
I'm a rider for the music I perform
Got another tour, know what I did it for?
Family handing me bills
Enemies handing me grills
Can I be young and concealed?
Know I'm an animal seer
Only presented with thrills
So don't pretend to be real
Rappers are getting you killed
Punking you out of a deal
Suckered you out of the bill
Then owe the real thing
I'm the real thing
I will kill dreams
Freddy Krueger with the Ruger pumped into you

Because powders and a bag of tobacco
Said her boss was an asshole
She been on the line just breakin' her back though
I need a rope with a lasso
To catch a pot of gold and get past the hassle
To get my mama a castle
Pink Cadillac with the matching tassels
Take my daddy off of that backhoe
Send him down to Florida to fish on a bass boat
And a truck to match
So he can roll around town pullin' his bass boat

She'll be on the line till daddy can come save her

Got five grand stuffed in a tube sock
Ain't got no fucking credit to use
I paid cash for my car at the used lot
Small town, trapped in a sinkhole
Still keepin' it cool in the pistol
Me and dope's like green to a pickle
Yeah folk, like a haystack to a sickle
Never brought back home a report card
Spent more time in court, dog
But in this little town, it's a short fall

Trouble is how I ride all this shit, so I guess he knows

[Verse 1]
Silverado, black package
Dealership didn’t have time to tag it
I whipped that bitch out the parking lot
Like I was dead broke and I couldn't have it
Uh, swipe that piece of plastic
Rode around Nashville for three hours
Listenin' to beats, waitin’ for the magic
Swung by the crib, grabbed WLPWR
Hit the bar, of course the bar
Valet park my brand new car
Threw the keys and when you move it, please
Be careful and don't go too far
Took a second and soaked it in
Couldn't wipe off my big-ass grin
Look at Will, ""Can you believe it, man?
Just wait 'til I get them twinny-twin-twins""
That's hard work (Uh)
I had to do a lot of yard work (Uh)
I had to pick up that white trash (Uh)
So I could bet on my bar to work (Uh)
I had to cut my own path (Uh)
And do something that had never been done
Alabama ain't no cakewalk (Uh)
I showed the world how we popped that trunk
And it's one shot down, two shot down, three
And this old fuckboy keeps looking at me
He walks up to us then offers me a drink
I know that he wants to hang, he must think that I'm a tree
Wanna be rock and roll, he starts ramblin’ about who he knows
And where he’s been and how many records he's sold
With who and how and this and that
And I can’t pretend to like this douchebag
Even though he's got the boost that has the leather and the durag
The shit he told me he wrote for so-and-so is just so, so whack

Don't wanna be the supermodel for the clothes you wear
Don't pull a seat up ’cause you see me in my folding chair

38 OG, creatively a new worn baby
From the G to the A dot D
Went from the Creek to a Love Story
Went from a single wide trailer to the booth's alligator
And a highrise over the streets
Ran through the dirty South in cleats
Never lost touch, never got beat
Lot of rappers talk about who's doing what
Not a single one said shit about me, now that's respect
Can't buy that with a bat or a check, better check the beat
I mob with kings
Crown my head with a tattoo, Slum, make sure it reads
No more at sea
Fuck a message in a bottle, deliver my words like Desperado
Misfits under my umbrella
I hope these songs fulfill the sorrow
Take the bricks so you can build tomorrow
Like a freemason, claw and arrow
Free bird, a prophet's sparrow
Flying through hip-hop, rock, and metal
And while that clock is ticking
I won't let a soul living stop my vision
Give me that bucket and a mop to dip in
I'll shine that floor until it's popping prisms
'Til you see the colors of the rainbow dancing off my Box Chevy
Don't try to fill up my gas tank or my shoes, homie, you ain't ready
And if imitation is flattery, uh, I don't lack on the flattery
I just led gatherings up in my room with the magic
Go back to my cabin and charge up my battery

Go poke around the soil, my roots are covered in blood
How can I not be deep? unfold the origami
I went from salami and ramen noodles to wasabi and ""what is it?"" I can't pronounce those, who?
See you can take the boy up out the swimming hole
But you can't take Catfish Billy up out the flows, nah
You begin fuck around looking like somebody took your best chicken from the coop
And took your coupé and crashed it into the booth
With the full intention of fucking you

To the corner in a Travis Caddy

Swing around the mosh pit, do-si-do

Comin' out for the kill

Let em' roam with the truth sometimes
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art

If eric clapton could sing about cocaine, then there's no harm
Then I can write about drugs, I can rap about girls
I can sing about fleeing cars
Not that my money is large

Let's talk about gettin' evicted, everything owned thrown out on the road

Got one drag, on a runaway train
On a one way street better pick your lane

Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain
And we could be that rolling stone
Mix'em up with janis joplin

Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasing a dollar, and an impala
White trash heart throb, mellow yellow
Drinking hard liquor, brauds get on my level

I'm hotter than the bottom side of a whistlin' kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
Sent me to hell, and I shit on the devil
Try to bury my chevy box but I won't buckle
And that's a deep hole bitch, bring your own shovel
Long gone, I'm grown up, and I'm gone cut you
But a grown lady, but if you want a blade then holmes fuck you
Fuck you till you can't take a shit
Yeah I'm a fucking big body tsunami, better anchor the ship
Aim for the ankles and wrist, I came for the dangerous shit
I claimed to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slang for the pain of a trip that took the? And a whip
I became what I came to get the chains for the chain I give
A quarter for your thought, appreciate the contribution
Slumerican, I'd appreciate the constitution
Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page in ruins
To eat alone, I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built with hopes, no ifs

So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm generation x, I'm selling ex, no pills
Dopeman chopping up lines you don't sniff
Read'em, I'm bringing back booklets and hookless, lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
But what he says, come again? What is that?
Come to earth, touchdown, I might be your one and back
Because you have been running back, stay cool enough to wear
Toboggans as a summer hat
Steady on the throne I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll, mosh pit flow
Girls on your shoulders get topless at the show
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road
It only makes mud, raised around a deer
I know how to chase bucks
Babysitter, 16, taught me how to make fuck
At 7, I've been raising hell
So I can make it to heaven
Pick up a 2-liter but I only need the plastic
I know how to make bombs with the? Acid
Butterfly effect over hurricane's magic
Tornado pathin', rearview mirror of my '87 classic
I'm talking about gadsden
Look mama no hands, I'm radioactive"

And a bullet with your name on it
So don't breathe when I talk
'cause you haven't been spoken to
But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket""

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I got blue wheels on a Harley blades
And a trail in the sunrays
Me and this lady, man
It's like church on a Sunday
I'm up from my rocker
But rock and roll is my papa
Raised me up on this gasoline
Billy Jean was my mama
Broken hearts turned to spoken art
My blood is like lava
Hard as a rock when I'm cold
Yet I can flow just like water
Grew up with people that's lethal
Grew up with hustling daughters
Mothers and fathers alike
Like it or not when you saw us
Live my life like a rebel
The devil's hot on my tracks
But I won't run from my demons
No, I embrace them in fact
So remember my spirit
When that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs to losers
Users and runaways

[Hook]
""But a trigger for a heart beating blood from an empty pocket""
From entrepreneurs, losers
To users and renegades
For factory workers, servers
And hustlers all the same
Single mothers and others
Nobodies, prisoners, no-names
For entrepreneurs, losers
To users and runaways

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Alcohol in my system to face the system of living
Marijuana rolled up, money on tables for women
For the strippers and divas
For those who didn't believe us
We went from single wide homes to homes with twenty foot ceilings
You may say you hate money, money isn't the issue with you
And all of your bullshit, you bullshit me and I miss you
Save your tears for your love, smile when love ain't around
I'm in the booth for my family, yes I'm holding you down
Keep pressing play every day
And if they hate, let them hate
Believe in you and that's all you can do, so fuck what they say
And remember my spirit when that Slumerican flag waves
From entrepreneurs, losers to users and renegades

Ayo I’m done selling drugs and buying keys on consignment
I’m about to buy a lab and purchase me a lion
Drug money is sucks, I’m the lux, drunk as a fuck
Be going hard, bitch ass you butt
But still in all I gain I don’t know no other way
I’m cooler than the M6 play
I run with drug niggas who ya one day
One pay, one K
Sun play, some spray
Half of these niggas underage
They came with the purple T
Grape shit, some call it gray
I call it revolutionizing in the mix
My money he man now
Was shakin, don’t fuck with them snakes
Fuckin with them fix hustle niggas is gay
If that’s your thing, cold play
Don’t get in my way
We got hack saws that smack jaws, betray me
Bout to get you more
What you in this for? Aye chill
The official just late, give him his way
That’s my nigga no big and give him his space
If they front on us we frontin back, piss in his face

Peace to the god, wussup?

Layin in the cut with a slut
Late in the cut on the peanut butter guts
With a slut but Brazilian, half to a but

Fuck nigga, yea I’m a king in Atlanta
You don’t wanna be a new star round the TV channel
Talkin bout last scene in Atlanta
Bitch I take your life, sleep good that night
Crab crab legs in Savana
I’m so Tony Montana
Nose full of coke, M16, all black hammer
Put coke in the street, in a week everything jump back
Sweet Sweden and a can of Fanta
Polo polo had the flow ho
I got horses on pajamas
Yea, late night I might take flight
With 3 hoes like my name Santa
Yea yea, I drive a Chevy and I treat it like a Phantom
I bought a ’96 Impala and I named it MJG
‘Cause we pimp hard and we pimp hard
And a bitch can’t ride for free
Gone

Peace to the gods
Way to hit the breaks home boy
You about to fall asleep in the car
Run a red light on me motherfucker
I’mma pull the Chevy over and reach in the glove
Speak from the blood
Kin folk, you don’t wanna see my pin though
You don’t wanna see me unplugged
If I pull a 9 out, over night I’ll sign out
You should know I gets a bug in the rug
Get the buzz on drugs and chug a jug of sauce til I bust the goods
Man I could make a deacon dirty when I speak
I’m murdering, I make a mean mugging cause
When I lean in the cut
Listen, this 30 yard 6 when your out of that window
Tiers in the mud
Got the soul of an old man, I can feel the love
So call me daddy, lay my balls on the cag
‘Cause I drive em nuts
Don’t follow in envy if you ain’t following where
‘Cause I’m about grinding plus
These songs that I write got life, I can sick em on tree
They did grow target
Takin more lefs to the boys in the Bronx
I’m losing heroin
Let em go ball, just give em more weed
Dollars in the kitchen, povery
Did I forget to mention I’m an emcee?
That I have to prove it on BET
And cyphered twice but that just might be
I know
So radioactive, had a couple of radio attempts
But I don’t wanna be radioactive anymore now
Than I wanna jump off a cliff
This I promise, 
Catfish Billy, you can put Trunk Muzik in the picture frame
You ain’t gotta tell me that I made a mistake and some of that shit was lame
But all I wanna do is say fuck that shit and please accept my change
I was on the tryna people please
So people please, know my name
Now back to the metaphors
It’s better for me to settle scores instead of more self-loathe
And I put tags on toes
And like I’m in the morgue and I’m giving no pedicure
Said a story now go on and set the melanol
Set sail on a pale horse with a sword
Yea me behold, in a white Caprice classic, pedal to the floor
Flime of the seed in my pants
‘Cause I need what I need
I believe that I can go achieve what I came to achieve
And I leave you and you with the new CD in your hands
Put it in, put it in, let the 808 fill that space
Any kind of high never feels this great
You can feel the taste, you can see that smell
You can touch the moon when you hear that bass
Thank God that I got this gift, damn right and I won’t shut up
But the gray hair fall down like an OG, damn right and I won’t cut em

Yelawolf,Ride Or Die,/y/yelawolf/ride+or+die_21135421.html,"[Verse 1]
We was thick as thieves growing up
Both of us raising hell
Chasing liquor with liquor
Racing and chasing tail
You got caught with a nickel bag and then went to jail
You sat it out for a week because your mama didn't have bail
I rode my bike to your house as soon as you got out
Remember laughing at the cops and then I took you straight to the spot
I moved away for some years to Atlanta, Georgia but stayed the same
My troublesome attitude got me locked in an ugly chain
We kept in touch every week and I noticed the change
You wanted to clean up and go to school some day do the family thing
And I was too wild to get it, admittedly so
But I supported your move no matter which way that you rolled
I guess you made a good choice, graduated with honors
Got a good job at the factory making that legal dollar
And as for me I got worse
I found myself in a curse
Dropped out of school for a dream
A dream I didn't rehearse
You hit me up cuz you knew when you saw me I was bad off
But I was too proud to ask for the help cuz I knew the cost
But you offered a place to stay
Until I could find my way
You helped me go find a gig
Clean up and get it straight
Never once did you tell me to stop rapping and give it up
As we sat talking on the bed of your lifted truck
You had it all and I had nothing
I'm just saying that meant something brother

[Chorus]
If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound
I'll never let you down, I can't let you down
Because when I couldn't get my feet on the ground
You'd do anything to help me out
You never let me down
What goes around comes around
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die

[Verse 2]
It's been a while since I seen my friends, family and such
Six months a year on the road, I never get to visit that much
Even though it took me ten years to break a crack in this rock
Now that I started this movement, I got no plans to stop
Now you may see me in publications and radio placements
A new truck, a new Harley, and think I forgot how I made it
But ain't a day that goes by that I don't recall the struggle
Scared to death to go back to it, I constantly hustle
I thank you for my ambition
For the strength to condition
Anyone who helped me along the way and believed in my vision
It takes a village to raise a child
For me it took small towns
Everything that I learned from it
The ups and the downs
My Uncle Buddy, he gave me a thousand dollars to make a tape
Back in '02, when I could barely afford a plate
And he couldn't afford it either, but he did it anyhow
And now he wears a thousand dollar smile, Uncle Bud

[Chorus]
If you ever need me around I'll be on the next train headed southbound
I'll never let you down, I can't let you down
Because when I couldn't get my feet on the ground
You'd do anything to help me out
You never let me down
What goes around comes around

This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
This one's for my ride or die
I'm just sitting here on my front porch singing

Heaven’s not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in
Leavin’ what is keeping you from walkin’ out the door and livin’ life like there’s a reason
Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison
Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision
Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya’ they will loot ya’ they are killin’
Killin’ power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it’s a sentence
Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high
There is no limit
Limit what they sell and what they’re givin’

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat

They marchin’ up the street they wanna fight they don’t want peace
Peace of what you have they snatch and grab
They steal and run
They pullin’ guns out on police
Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will
They will at you - they’ll execute if you don’t leave
Leavin’ the impression no one’s safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast
Beasts are on the corner, slingin’ poison to the junkies - to a junkie it’s a feast
Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that’s on your street
Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets
Sheets in Alabama cockin’ hammers, ridin’ horses, wanna handle who is free
Free yourself from anything they preach

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink

I woke up from a deep sleep
I must have had a nightmare
But I really cannot remember
My heart was beating up out of my chest
And I was cold, I must've let the window cracked
25th of September and the winter's coming back
The house is unusually quiet
And I'm wondering where Sabrina's at
By this time at eight o'clock
She would have been pullin' on my blanket
Saying daddy ""I want some cereal""
Wondering where her mommy's at
My door is wide open I can hear the breeze hit the curtains
Wind chime hangin' on the front porch singing
Sabrina must be asleep
I pull back the sheets
Get up and walk toward her room in the hall
Not a peep, not a sound not at all
The anxiety of a father is settin' in
As I turn the corner to her room
Her Mickey Mouse blanket's on the floor
She isn't in the bed
I take a deep breath, put my hand on my head
Relax
It's a game of hide and seek
She's in the closet I know it
I open the door
""Gotcha!""
She isn't there
The faint sound of the television from downstairs is playing some cartoons she's on the couch of course
How did I oversleep?
""Baby girl, why didn't you come wake up daddy?""
Not a response
Fear turned to frustration
""Sabrina, answer me""
""'Brina, this isn't funny""
I ran to the couch, she's not there
I'm startin' to panic and I'm lookin' up everywhere
Guest rooms, bath rooms, cabinets
Under the tables, the attic
Wait a minute, oh God no
I know she wouldn't go outside
We live so far back in the woods
She wouldn't dare
Its too scary for a little girl just to go bye-bye
I'm trying to escape my mind's eye
But my imagination is runnin' wild
At this point I'm talkin' to God
""Please Lord, please I'm scared, help me find my child""
I run to the basement (Sabrina!)
Sweat beads on my hands
Pacin', thinkin', pacin', thinkin'
Turn my face in
The screen door to the backyard's ajar
I run to the swingset
Swingset? No
Sandbox? No
God dammit Sabrina where'd you go?
There's a trail to a pond that I take her to everyday
Maybe she's down there
I run down the trail it's about 100 yards
We usually hang out on the pier
And as I get close in
Everything moves slow motion
Her little white shirt on the surface of the water
She was there, lifeless floating (Oh my God!)
The pain I can't explain, I couldn't say anything
I ran to the water
God, is this really my daughter?
I picked her up, she was heavy
I held her tight in my arms
I took her out of the pond
I laid her down in the grass
I couldn't breath, I gasped
Givin' her CPR, she wasn't respondin' to it
My phone in my pocket
My hands are shakin'
My vision's blurry
9-1-1 , send an ambulance in a hurry
But it was too late
No tellin' how long she wasn't breathing
Her skin was the color purple
Her lips were ice cold
She must have fell off the pier reachin' for her teddy bear
She tried to get out, she got wood under her nails
God, what did you do to us? What have you done?
I say my prayers at night, haven't I been a good son?
What did you to do my baby? She's mine, now give her back
You don't deserve her if you let her die like that!"

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There's a dark moon in the clouds
Misty fog in the swamp
Crickets chirpin' outside my window
The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall
The lights flicker sometimes
The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines
A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running
Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming
I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape
The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate
Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper
The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature
Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie
A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary
Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin
The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing
Surrounded by demons
I'm an angel and they all want me
And to this day ...

[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass
The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass
The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines
Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women
The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light
The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight
Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin'
From the fight in the kitchen
Blood screamin' and kickin'
Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap
The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping
The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it
The flask for the moonshine, I watch as they all sip it
The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram
The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand
Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies
And to this day ...

[Hook: Joshua Hedley]
Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches
One of them says savage, the other one Black Sabbath
Heavily tatted, barely any skin left
Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death
Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf
Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt
Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper
Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter
Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter
Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter
'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it
No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted
Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters
Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners
Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe
Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life
So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire
A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower
Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming
Especially when ...

An easy E for effort
That's wwa, white with an attitude
Alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is Z's they sleeping on me, I can't get 'em awake
I spoon feed them the sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
Who believe they making it rain cause
All they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the vip like a potato with a bunch of
Meatheads like fuck it
I just feed em a cow
Plenty of white boys you can pick from this year
But before you can pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic but what it's like to pick a
Fight with me
It's like putting Nikes on a cheetah with a speedo or at least in my case
Addidas
I'm out this bitch drinking Sprite by the 2 liter
Holla, Shady records

[Joe Budden:]
Say I'm from the new school, I'm a say check ya tone and watch ya mouth
If they teaching how to dougie, I'm condoning dropping out
Forced a while you birthed and gave me up
I just perfected being hip hops foster child, now check it
I don't blame y'all for being trash fans and copping it
The radio's the crime scene the masses are the hostages
In my youth I throw shots, the fan would dodging it
I'm grown, I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it
You see that four headed monster and the storm looms
Snipe 'em from a distance, the scope got a long zoom
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room
Got a figure here you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it Was left to me I would revive what the game be 'bout
I'da took the wine outta Amy's house
Enough raps from you scrub cats about cockin a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I got this shit from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke but she c** from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn so I lock her out and now she doubt
David is Stern
She so bad I make her hit the telly from a taxi and dead her in that
Holiday inn
Learnt that from Max B
That's why the haters empty condo on a semi lamas
I made it right before the eyes like I was Beni hanas
Is it me, or is it what I'm hearing is pitiful
Airwaves the same now the stereo's typical
My skin thick so the critics ignore
So unafraid to die you think I did it before
The boys Rodman with the trash talk
Magic or Ward with the black ball the way I bounce off the asphalt with cat
Paws
Glass jaw, hoody and mask will be to blackfoot with no passport
Body be found in the mansion in one of my trap doors
If punks had awards ya status whore categore
Propbably that, Michael Rappaport and Kenny Lattimore
I know hip hops alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell

[Crooked I:]
I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is ticken
I caught em slippin, I gotta give em a shot, I hit 'em with proper spittin
Hottest writtens and compositions, so competitions a contradiction
Somebody mentioned they got it crooked, highly fiction, we probably
Different, got Gotti henchmen, opposition our body quick as Bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get rich, the sickest lyric kickin' diggin a dish for
Different spittas
We lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor
Spit like a sick mixture
Notorious Pun and L get the big picture
The poster I'll roast ya, my mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is
Close to a holster
It's over control my whole coastal region like I'm supposed ta
Flow is going postal even, open season
Heart close to freezing, ruthless is easy
Approach I'm squeezing, believe me
Dopest west-coaster breathing
So most ya'll hope I'm vegan, no pun, beefing
Rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to kill too many people still eating sleeping pills
People sleeping on my ether skills
And ya'll ain't even real
You 'bout to die in this cypher before you die you should do the Jada and
Leave a Will
Foreal

[Joeel Ortiz:]
Yaooowa [x2]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this I was moving crack
Killers y'all would come when y'all rhyme I salute and dap
And if I blink then remove ya snaps, you ain't cool you wack
With ya foolish yac? Skinny jeans don't mean ya ass shoot

It means ya booty claps
Don't play like Tyler Perry, this the Slaughterhouse of Pain
Float brown, tight and heavy
When it comes to sixteens I'm a fiend feinding a studio
Near a needle with a mean lean, probably writing bars to Nas' Thief's Theme
Getting my Yaowa on, may all these Olajuwons be the dream team
This is an all day slaughter they feindin for us to break like Beyonce's
Water
The four quarters doing all the eating and you gotta know why I made the
Cut, I'm Puerto Rican
Ortiz keep the fire ready
And tryna put me out's like tryna steal a transvestite from Eddie

[Royce Da 5'9"":]
I'm do or die dope
And you can make the sticker sittin on the door
Of that phantom your suicide note
Hi Rihanna...
Is Nicki living with you? Let me know
So I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi Rihanna...
I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye Rihanna...
Now back to y'all fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames, I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing bout Budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why do I keep her? I say it's cheaper too
That's why I ride around in a rose like Wiz Khalifa do
Rappers, I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't kill but your father will like jaden smith
I tell ya like I tell my Spanish chick
You fly but I ain't going down on no landin' strip
So get your wax on like Daniel-son
I'm a have to run like De La Hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive I head shot 'em
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber sexing with Jessica Alba, via skype
I'm on my d-boy, d-bo thing
Spiritual steelo swing like cee-lo green
Get out the camera with yo B Roll bling
You know your flow is whack
We cornered the market like a walmart in a culdesac
Yeah, this what 2 million singles sold and a album that's gold
Look like, without having to sell your soul
Nickle

[Eminem:]
Lyrical, miracle, spiritual, individual criminal
Subliminal, in your swimming pool

You 'bout to see peace destroyed
It'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hoards on your cd stores
Wanna stop it, you gon need a priest and at least three swords
A license to I'll from the Beastie Boys, 3 ouija boards
And a squeegee and please be warned don't ask for the squeegees for
Or the holy water, acid rapper that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in the rhyme book, you see these horns?
And as for me, you ask where I'm going will he be mourned?
Is puke luke warm? Should Casey Anthony do porn?
Can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside her freakin shoebox
With a shoehorn, smother in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?
Can she duct tape and Velcro a fetus? Joell yo,
Tell Joe I need his empty box from his old shell toe adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position, they're getting elbows to
The penis
Yeah, big deal. I took some little kids big wheel
And spit in his fricken big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch, you win sit still
You just put your six inch heel through my Benz windshield?
Is it dust we bout to kick up?
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup?
Between a stick shift in his fricken pick up
And drink like a hick, redneck, hillbilly will till he gets hiccups?
Flippin the script up like Mike Vick
Get bit in his junk by a pit, yup I'm a sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician
Cause I'd fuck that trick up
Fix ya lips up to say something fly, or zip up
A-B? Let's C. You said you were gonna do X-Y-Z
Till you fuck around and get dropped like an E
When you add an I-N-G
Don't put a K in front of that though, When I mc
Cause I'm not the king of this microphone booth
It's more like a phonebooth
Superman in this bitch, kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power, I bump the fat boys and
Eat rat poison, and take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital and me not flossing a middle finger
While I hop in a mosh pit, will be like Nas doing gospel or R&B, you crazy?
Me pushing up daisies, that thought is impossible
Is it flashing across the news, Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge Johnson, boobs, and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra, some boots, some panties, and an aqua blue Mazda
Swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
So kill the rumors it ain't happenin
I'm a rap till I'm fossil fuel"
Yelawolf,Sky's The Limit,/y/yelawolf/skys+the+limit_21135375.html,"[Hook]
They said the sky is the limit
Well I guess it all depends on you
And your views
In this American dream
Don't tell me that the sky is the limit
Cause it ain't about what you can do
It's a who knows who
In this American dream

[Verse 1]
Okay you got criminals everywhere, right?
Criminals smugglin' dope across borders to feed America's high appetite
Kis, pounds, ounces, grams, whatever the weight of substance is gettin' sold
Cause drugs got a price
Home hydroponics, LSD chemist
Spoon cookin' heroine, junkies fill up methadone clinics
Get caught for crack and catch a long sentence
You ask me how I feel about that, maybe you got the wrong witness
I heard Jay Z's cool with Obama
Obama must be cool with me then I guess if I'm packin' up this Honda
I highly doubt it but fuck it, it's worth a shout out
At least that's what I tell the judge before I gracefully bowed out
Meanwhile I'm gettin' taken to the county for a seed
There's a news flash on the holdin' cell TV
Boston bombed by a terrorist at a marathon
8 year old killed and the killer's still free
Shit is hard to believe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't no politically savvy citizen
I'm just an average man who writes poetry about witnessin' fuckery
And these police who always fuck with me
Done my fair shire of dirt, my boy, trust in me
But I picked music over hustlin', and I made it out luckily
Could've been on corners droppin' quarters from a bucket seat
My cousins preach about the lord but all I see is crime
If the Vatican has got the book then what the fuck is mine?
Just a line with a hook
You might as well be a rapper cause you signed and get booked
All the same to a suit
Black or white, you still a crook
If you ain't a Justin Leave It to Beaver with that look
Then just drop the egg in the skillet, let it cook
Who y'all bein' took
No I'm not a crook, son but this one ain't shook
But I'm rollin' Mobb Deep, my dreams on a Harley Davidson
Pigs, I hardly wave at them, yeah I said hardly
If I'm rude then pardon me but remember...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My grandparents retired from 9 to 5s
They paid for my hospital bills when mama was doin' lines
I wasn't raised up like the model American
But I love what it made me, life is all about where and whens
Whos and hows that ultimately create my heritage
My great grandaddy Otis would sit down in his chair and then
Smoke a cigarette while he sipped on Muscadine moonshine
Homemade, and reminisce about the old days
He died of cancer when I was 5
I wasn't allowed to go see him in his casket cause I would've cried
I got so much value off life in such a short time
Memories stick to my heart and today they still apply
They used to share crops when they were poor
He worked his ass off at the mill and then he opened up a store
Both of my granddaddies fought a war
So I could say what I'm sayin' in this record for you and yours
For you and yours, the truth

I'm on the sidewalk with this fuckin' skateboard and these dirty ass jeans
I'm the boy that stole a pack of Twinkies And a bottle that's green
I never gave a fuck about environmental shit throw my empty bottle in the gutter
Rednecks four' wheelin' screaming “skate or die dude” 
Fuck you motherfucker (fuck you motherfucker)
I'm a car wreck in a swamp I drown victims slow With these words that I lay
Pigs on the corner got an eye for my kind 'cause we ignore laws everyday
What do you mean I'm white trash? Grab my nuts and kick your poodle in the face
I'm sick to the soul with hate
'Cause I'm the bitch that society raped
So what'a ya say?

[Chorus]

My body is covered in tattoos that are totally offensive
If I did It, I did it for life No regrets, you know that I meant it
I ain't bothered by racist my family is worldwide, ho come get it
I'll take you to the gutter Like a cigarette butt in the rain let Shawty Fatt spit it (Yeah!)
You motherfuckers are lost, get your maps out and follow me into the creek water
I didn't forget where I came, jus' how to ignore my musical calling
That crack on the window on the Chevy's been there for over seven months
Along with Jon Newport's beer bottle caps and the Roaches of Will Power's blunts
So what'a ya say?

[Chorus]

People is why shit is so wrong
Why they won't let all our soldiers come home
Why them boys who get caught with such small amounts of dope on the Ave do bids so long
They bids so long by the time they get to come home
Mamas is gone and babies is grown
And baby mama that was tight in that thong
Fat as a fuck and her body all gone
Pay for it cash her ass is gone
She never worked so the stash is gone
Government rations she gets on
Year after year she get check after check
A gangster come home already in debt
The government say you owe fifty K
For all the free lunches that yo baby ate
Do you go legit, and never have shit?
Or G' up and re-up and get you a brick? (yeah)
Get you a brick (yeah)

See what you suckas don't understand is
This ain't even about race
This is about who got it and who ain't got it
So if I'm on the bottom
And you on the bottom
We're the same color

Yelawolf,So Long,/y/yelawolf/so+long_1729337.html,"I look in the mirror sometimes and think about how it all started
Small town Alabama, from city life we departed
Not a single light in the street, morning was scary and dark
To a little boy catching the bus to school 5: 30 sharp
I used to make up songs to keep my mind from wandering
What was in the woods waiting for me, my stomach still rumbling
From the cereal diet
Even though mama was trying to do the best that she could
Alcohol made her violent
Her boyfriend was a prick, probably 26
Barely looked my direction and really didn't do shit
My animosity grew along with my anger
And impatience disastrous school
My teachers knew I was trouble waiting
And I did too, admittedly but I like it
Maybe I had to accept I'd always be uninvited to church events, football and family oriented stuff
But I never thought I had it rough
I embraced it, honestly, 'cause I knew how different I was
It made me a rebel and rebels made me feel welcomed and loved
I never knew my daddy but, they said that I was the same and what a shame, get your umbrella Wayne
Here comes the heavy rain

Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
Dark bloodstains after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun

If life is but a dream
I'm up the creek in a paddle boat
Streams full of snakes, demons, not even a ladder goes
Up high and over the Mississippi to see the ocean, so here I go floatin', yeah
But I made it a habit though
19 and tattooed, hell-raised in the neighborhood was the place and I made it home with the favorites
Quarter pound of that seeded Mexican trash slinging nickles
Make enough and then break it even, just do it for tickles
Nashville's under icicles, the Methadone's penatratin'
Ecstasy-hungry, baited as an experimentation
No more chocolate-chip cookies, and porcelain jars
Morbid and dark are my role models, and old-school cars
Sickening and I'm lovin' it
I'm basking in half of it
Backstrokin' in sinnin' ways, a dagger to pastors
I never knew my daddy but, they said that I was the same and what a shame
Here come the cocaine in the heavy rain

Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
Dark bloodstains after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night
I'm the snake outta your barn
That one mistake you ever did right
The gunpowder to your drum
I'm your son
The son of a gun
Son of a gun
Son of a gun

And you can tell that I still don't give a fuck
Still drinking whiskey I'm half-a-bottle already down
Slumerican-made man, Criminals all around
Seventy-thousand dollars a night isn't good, look
Livin' a story usin' my war as my shield
The truth, examined and recreated
The followings real:
Plenty of fatherless children fill up the pit in the buildin'
Usin' the mind for the feelin', it's just like poppin' a pill
And I'm takin' it in
Lost at makin' a win
Thanks for the poems that you inspired, I'm rakin' it in
Never heard you say ""give me five,"" so make it a ten
Think the chances I'm ballin', look at the bastard of him
When I went to jail for the first time, I thought about you
Son of a bitch, I admit it, I guess the rumours are true
'Cause when I look in the mirror, I see from what I 'came
Trial by fire, pain, heavy rain

Cause I'm the lighting to your storm
Dark bloodstains after a dogfight
The tornado to your alarm
Your hangover after a long night

Barking, they ravenous
Broken bottles and trash in the grass of a Gadsden trailer park
I’m a fucking savage
I just woke up drunk and brushed my teeth with a soap bar
Blocks under that pickup truck
Drive by me with a mean mug, I’m jumping off the porch what’s up?!
Nothing to lose except my life
And I don’t give a fuck about that, so you do the math, how many fucks you got tonight?
Motherfuckers ain’t tough, I be the only white boy in this bitch gettin' buck

Robbing and stealing and dealing and working a temp
This dope is not paying, these wages ain’t making a dent
My baby’s mama just hung my clothes up on the fence
Cops on the corner, they stare and harass me for shit
Fuck what you riding, I’m riding, I jump in the donk
I get the feeling that we got some guns in the trunk
But I do not care who’s still pissed, I do not have a pot
So open the register, give me the money you got

No Christian Dior adorns the native son
Drippin' Dixie since '81
Sippin' whiskey since Raekwon spit hit page one
Nerd shit that gamma ray gun
That any day come, fuck a rap punk sucker, I'm a bum
Tornado picked up my trailer, I'm in a new zone
How do you go from group home to [?]
'Cause I'm a Matrix in itself, a true song
Plus I hit the Oracle up, red or a blue phone (Marshall)
Yeah, and I made it with lil prophet
I got a knife from a wizard because I stake the profit
Ask me how I'm doing, this shit is gold, really though
Catfish really though, and Billy done did it hoe

[Chorus]
Yeah, we went from counting the o's and the Speghettios
To countin' zeros, oh what a heavy load
The stakes are high but the Chevy's low
We still ridin' (Still ridin')
Yeah, we went from counting the o's and the Speghettios

[Verse: Struggle]
I went through the fire
Flames made me pure
Feds were fishing for a confession
I ain't bite the lord
Took a tour of the country
In a federal van
The light overcame the darkness
In the devilish land
Knowing that the change must come but Sam Cook seems
15 minute phone calls press 5 when it rings
Locked doors open my mind, find peace
The animal I became is tamed a kind beast
Attending birthdays through pictures
Tears on concrete
Refusing to lose
Over the years of defeat
Now I speak the truth
The try to acquire my choir
Been to hell and back
This is trial by fire
Desire to find the higher power
In the hour of despair
Cutting out the stitches
Yes there's bridges to repair
Holding on to whats left
Trying to stay right
After the chaos of the night
Comes daylight"

[Verse 1]
I'll take your piss in that bottle, throw that bitch at your papa
Smoke flyin' off the chopper and it's chokin' your mama
She can't breathe with this funk, what I conceive in the trunk
They disbelieve in the son, bitch, best believe I'm the one
I got that bump in the back with the box of bodies
Creek Water 'til I'm walkin' wobbly
I'm a businessman, I don't keep it political
Fuck the world and I'm not sorry
The priest was thinkin' I'm Illuminati
'Cause Eminem is a close kin
He might as well be 'cause I give him hell
For that white bread, put the toast in
Not simply a rapper (Uh)
But I snap like a crispy cracker
When I peel the pages out the book and hook it
That's a life story, no empty chapters
Pull up on 'em in the '59, shinin' like a trailer park king
Let the boots take a walk
Alligator, how I lift the pile of what I made into the faders
Choppin' like me should've been a log

Money pilin' up, I ain't got shit to do
We hit the bar and settled up a twenty dollar tab
I left her bein' drunk and walkin' out the back without a ride
Or even bein' smart enough to get an Uber
Go to Hooters, takin' double shooters
Throw a lot of hooters, hit the alleyway
And paddle my way over to the studio, I'm travelin', a mover
Head rattlin', I'm at church with a newer God
On another level, bitch, better grab a ruler
Quarterback of anything Slum and I'm throwin' bullets
Could've been a stylist, you admire this mullet
Wanna catch a vibe, then take a violent bullet
Walk a country mile and take a ride in my 'Cuda
For the 808s up under the bench of the Chevy
For the Bettys gettin' ready
Throwin' the confetti, hittin' the powder heavy, uh
Catfish deep gettin' heady, alien shit for my ship, SETI
And it's a walk in the park
When I'm talkin' the talk, like walkin' a dog
No leash for the beast, no caution at all
Be alert if the dog starts barkin' at y'all
'Cause I'm a marvelous shit starter
A public hit, causin' the market to flip harder
But fuck it if I can roll, these suckers just pickpocket
The creative profit and go remake it to make a dollar

I must be Jim Morrison, to get a motherfucking girl like you,
Don’t know what I did in my past life, but it must have been something cool,
Cause I’m a whiskey drinking, thought provoking, cigarette smoking dude,
I got a problem with my attitude, it’s hard for me to keep cool,
But when I look at you, I see me, a reflection of a real soul,
So pardon me, if I may seem loose and out of control,
It ain’t the drink talking, it’s me talking, fuck if everyone knows
You my girl and that’s that, so hop on the back of this bike and roll
Let’s roll now.

[Hook:]
I’d never let someone straight up disrespect you
I’d never let someone call you out your name
I’ll always be the one that runs up to protect you
‘Cause I know if I was down you’d come and do the same
So let’s pack it up and move our life to Nashville
Build a studio in the house and do our thing,
And I’ll take you out and we’ll go honky tonkin’
Get drunk and fall in Tennessee Love

[Verse 2:]
Can’t you see that my hands are shaking?
Withdrawals from alcohol,
Ain’t no use in us fucking,
But it’s our life, ain’t it baby?
So ain’t no use in us taking, a chance with it,
So I promise that I’ll work on my patience
Someday, if we get lucky
And we grow and get old
We’ll look back, and laugh about the circus and the show
But for now, we live it up, we spend it up, and we go
To the last call in every bar in this town
Turn the lights on and close, you and me now

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
When I first met you I was so broke,
And I tried to hide behind the Alabama pines,
Prayin’ that you didn’t know, about my problems,
‘Cause I couldn’t, bear to see you go,
And when you found out, all that happened
Your little heart was broke
And I had to earn it back
And I learned in fact
That money don’t fix that shit
Not tattoos and I love you’s
It’s trust that I had to get
I’m sorry that I ever hurt you,
For anything that I did
Can I put this ring on your finger,
Let you know that I’m serious, marry me now

Sign a major deal, with a major payne.
They gave me a budget, I bought a bicycle frame.
I rode that bitch around Walnut park,
Put a stack in my pocket and then blew it at Wal-Mart.
On a jacket, a pistol, and a packet of blow darts.
If you enter my skull, you gonna need a strong heart.
Strong art, the heart of Dixie got history.
You sittin' on 32's we sittin' on 60's.
Mud tires and barbed wire you drive for hours.
You wont see nothin' but palm trees and wild fires
and BOOM! Out pops a B Boy.
The mossy oak is dirty brown, I know it's dirty brown boi!

Jimmy crack corn, then he threw a bar stool.
Mother goose broke a wing and still flew the coup.
She gave Jimmy 20 bucks and threw him a deuce.
Left Jimmy on the string like a loose tooth.
See these the type of people that I'm used to.
Hard knock country boys fuck a new suit.
Fuck a new coop when you need a new roof,
Give me the whole stake from the ruler to the two.
Give me the ruler too, measure it up.
There's good money in the pyrex mesurin' cup.
Ricky Bobby's on the corner he's tearin' it up.
If he don't slow down, he'll be wearin' a crutch.
Ricky needs to take it to tha highway,
But you can't tell him shit, cause it's Friday.

You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen
And I'm from the gutter so believe me
I've seen some hard things
You come from where the black flower grows
I wanted to cut you down and take you home
Call me axl rose
I could see you in a 1976 camero
Me and you, sippin' whisky getting drunker than jack sparrow
It's black sabbath, how you get mellow
Well put your feet on harley davidson pedals
And rock and roll girl

You switch walkers like a switch blade
You walk into the room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a
Grenade
With that said, let me pull them spandex pants off you with my teeth like
Ozzy did a bat head
I like rock and roll, let's go

You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries
You would rather run across the country like mickey and mallory
Be the natural born killer that you are
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car
We'll rob a dollar general for nothing but snack food
Shooting anything that moves, dogs and cats too
Re-enact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll baby

Everybody's asking me lately where I'm from
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run
Off
That your scared of the truth so it's dead and secret line and chalk
See I've been lost ever since I could walk
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke
Leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around
And I didn't give a shit cause me and my momma we held it down
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking
Yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the
Shelf turn the page

(Hook)
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show
In the magazines hear me on the radio
So what do you think huh?
(I hope that your proud now
To watch it all go down)
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello
Bye (and I hope that your proud now
To watch it all go down)

Yeah mamma you look great... perfect
Be safe on your first date... for certain
If he brings you home too late... I'll hurt him
Don't worry bout me I'm safe I'll close the curtains
And I feel like I'm raising you but what do I know baby blue
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me
But everything I did I had to see
Feel the pain, had to grieve
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be
What I've learned cannot be taught
What I've earned cannot be bought
Justified deserve it all
So don't be concerned it's not your fault
I never counted sheep I count my blessings
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him
My message just tell him

Back in 1979 it was a cold day in December
Mamma peeled the paint off the wall, screamin'
Babie's on the way
They rushed her to the hospital in that old Chevy truck
Running 90 miles an hour down them back roads
Blowing past the sheriff, hid in the woods, smoke bellowing off the engine
Running hot, must have been a sign
They rushed her to the emergency room
And barely made it to the bed
A few minutes later I was screaming for my first breath
""A little devil,"" the doctor said
He's got that look in his eye, ya know?
Reminds me of mischief
Yeah this ones gonna be trouble I can tell it
And then the lights went
Then mamma said doctor something's burning, I can smell it

And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around

[Verse 2]
Damn right, uh
You could hear lightning for miles around
And oak trees hitting the ground
The wind tore holes on that old Dixie flag on the capitol steps
Change is coming, my great grand mamma said
Quietly clutching her Bible, sitting in a rocking chair, smoking a cigarette
And the wood creaked beneath the porch and the old dog moaned and cried
As the sirens passing by
And Mr. Williams brought a mean batch of that moonshine to the wake
You know one comes and one goes as they say
And they laid a flower on the grave
Buried on December 29th for robbing a bank
And killed by the police, see you in the next life old friend
Little did he know, his old friend was back again
As the son of Sheila Diane

[Hook]
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around

[Verse 3]
You know how the story goes, c'mon
See me, I'm a curious soul
A stray bullet to some a chatter and whisper at night and the head of a following storm, a rebel at heart, a devilish grin
A leader of men, a preacher at ten
I was already in to spiritual sin
Back in the saddle again
12s in the back of the trunk, making it rattle again
Giving them nothing but punk
Living, the baby, the babie's got powers, the baby is haunted
Fuck a church, I'm a confession
Professional, public annointed
Came from the wrong side of the tracks
Bring the wrong crowds out the back
Keeping these gutter dogs raised
With these alley way cats
Seen what these others can't see
My poetry is a reflection of ? up from the bottom
And climbing that fucking tree, but I brought a chainsaw
I come to build a house up out of it, chopping
Limbs off this culture, and putting soliders up inside of it
Nails, brick, mortar, board up the windows
For the tornado, I'm a fatal blow to these honorable foes
Bag up the hot potato

[Hook]
And it was trial by fire
I'm just under a plane singing to burn it down
You better watch your step
When I come around"
Yelawolf,True To Yourself,/y/yelawolf/true+to+yourself_21135439.html,"(feat. Bones Owens)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Here we go to church on Sunday mornin'
Hangovers on 'em
Whiskey pourin' out of skin, it's like a poison
Beer-soaked boots from the barroom floor
It's perfume to a sinner, it's allurin'
Prophet for the slums, prayer for the dark
Barber straight razor blade, pocket watch
Rings on every finger, sacrificial skin
Story written in his blood, he's akin
To animals and criminals alike
Hood, project, trailer park, Backwoods
Sprinkles of the cocaine in his nails
Tank full of propane on the shelf
Fire's in the soul, the child is now a man
The enemies of good now become a friend
Watchin' God play his life violin
Happily, an instrumental in the wind
You will never fit, you're a misfit
You're a quiet voice no matter how loud you get
Despite the effort, you remain reckless
You remain helpless in the same outfit
As your father did before, you're a song
Better sing the praises of the written wrongs
Only time will kill your spirit if you let it fall
And that's why there's...

[Chorus: Bones Owens]
No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
The rifle's in the corner, money on the table
Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle
Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him
Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor
And takes another toke, smoke fills the room
Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom
Cops on the run, sirens in the distance
Wild small town, violent and resistant
In the street, they rage and fight
Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin'
Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war
Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings
Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals
Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em
Steel with the trigger finger, take your life
Billy in the basement, wasted, makin' pipe
Bombs take it light, wrong take it real
Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal
Take the front, son, run for the hills
Cowards under power make sonic seals
Cast a shadow over underprivileged minds
While they're chasin' money, hit some basic rhymes
If the world gives you pen and paper, draw the line
Because there's no time

[Chorus: Bones Owens]
There's no time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool
To somebody else

No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true

She can't breathe with this funk, what I conceive in the trunk
They disbelieve in the son, bitch, best believe I'm the one

I'm a businessman, I don't keep it political
Fuck the world and I'm not sorry
The priest was thinkin' I'm Illuminati 'cause Eminem is a close kin
He might as well be 'cause I give 'em hell for that white bread, put the toast in
Not simply a rapper (Uh), but I snap like a crispy cracker
When I peel the pages out the book and hook it, that's a life story, no empty chapters

Throw a lot of Hooters, hit the alleyway and paddle my way over to the studio, I'm travelin', a mover
Head rattlin', I'm at church with the newer God
On another level, bitch, better grab a ruler
Quarter back of anything slum and I'm throwin' bullets
Could've been a stylist, you admire this mullet
Wanna catch a vibe, then take a violent bullet
Walk a country mile and take a ride in my Gillet
For the 808s up under the bench of the Chevy
For the Bettys gettin' ready, throwin' the confetti, hittin' the powder heavy, uh
Catfish deep gettin' heady, alien shit for my ship, SETI
And it's a walk in the park when I'm talkin' the talk, like walkin' a dog
No leash for the beast, no caution at all
Be alert if the dog starts barkin' at y'all
'Cause I'm a marvelous shit starter

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]:
I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet, uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child (A soldier from my country)
I'm a soldier from my country (A slave unto my gun)
But a slave unto my gun (The screams to echo louder)
The screams to echo louder (Kill, kill)
God, what have I become? (Whoooa)
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the vanity
I trusted America, she took my sanity

[Hook: Lee Brice]:
Winds of change rollin' in
Take your love back again
I'm your fool, Amen
Just a bow for your violin
You played me
You made me your violin

She looks at her reflection
Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She says she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife (He runs around town)
But he runs around town (Lies, lies)
He's a cheater and a beater (She's sleepin' with the enemy)
She's sleepin' with the enemy (No one believes her)
But no one believes her (Whoooa)
A diamond ring, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter ""to hell I send thee""
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

Just a bow for your violin

Uh, used like a rag
I've been washed up, I've dragged
Through the mud like a thief
My beliefs and my loves
Take it up, take it down
Took a left, took a right
It's the one to be found
To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause see this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made are mine
But I swear that all can not be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Take away everything from me
And ask why more?
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
There's a prayer I'm saying 'Why lord?'
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and fight more
I'll travel along road
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
'Cause I'm just a violin

Couldn't be Peter Pan cuz he's got a fucking evil grin

Billy that's ya again
Fucking right I'm coming out to play, Michael ya should bow and pray
Luck up to the sun and blind yourself cuz I'm bout the only one to relate
To the Michael that ya want to fight
But it ain't really gonna pay off cuz that fucking outlaw inside you's gonna get ya either way
Now be the? Fo' the order
Obviously you're the sort of kind of warrior
The border prolly don't want to let thru the do'
Cuz all the commonal is that you're poorer to the poor and overworked
Bodies singin' out the story they can all be proud of
But the sound of power showers over louder speakers in the boring hiphop court lobby
I'm a supa freak, Rick James ****, ya can do fo' me
I take a nine smoke ya man and drop him off wit a lighter down on hooka street
I'm everythin' ya could be, make ya emcee read his elegy while I pull my zipper down behind a tree
Man somebody died here, Yela', ya can pee? Yep
I don't care bout a grave owner
Hater I don't care if I don't pay when I enter places
If it's a million people waitin' to enter
Fuck a vip I want to see a stage and listen to no roast
Just a wave of a bunch of from the days and I blaze this place, me in the center
I'm sicker than a hiccup
In a heat wit syphilis and hepatitis
Sucking on a pipe of cannabise
Plus a virus that can't be identified
It's prolly betta that ya grab a sweater
Better yet a leather jacket from a closet rack
And maybe get a pack of antibiotics fo' the psychotic hifi phonics that I share
Cuz there's a catfish breathing air
There's not two, there's not a there
That's not a they, that's anotha year
That's anotha ball park all together
Frank got a fake gold No Limit's tank
A golden forty five pointed at the pitcher
Muthafuckas wanna play a pickup game?
Bones hit the strands
I'm so on my own **** that I won't quit
I'm so on my own out here that I can't quit
If ya quarrel leavin', paint it, and grenade the gains in the ground of the shameless Hollywood
Fuck bodies bang this in yo church
Ya can sang wit me it's free
Styles I got piles, flows I got miles
Show I got crowds, hoes I'm not proud
Open yo mouth, slow leakin' out, love ya a beer
Towels on the flo', vowels on the flo'
Grounds on the floor, now ya record? Loud as a boar
Why would a boy look in the mirror?
I say today is the day that I wake up and walk outside
And the entire globe turns bright purple just by poppin' this lil pill here, ya dig?
I'm the reincarnate of a Vietnam vet. Chasin' a group thru the jungle
Wit a mind like a tumble-weed, blood shot eyes, and I'm chewin/ on a twig
My great great grand daddy fed me pepper and told me it was chocolate
He must of known I need some spice in life, I was too big fo' this piece of **** town
Ya try puttin' a dream inside a box, that box would implode
Dilapidate, evaporate, desaturated wit sound
Fo' the folks in the back of the broken Volkswagen
Parkin' the bug in the parkin' lot and rollin' baggies
Walkin' around the festival, then profitin' off the these people yearnin', burnin'
Fo' that lsd, fo' the lettuce head in me

Keep yo tiedie and flip flops

Shoulda been the motherfucking Truman Show
But if you seen me getting raped as a child
You probably wouldn’t give me room to grow
Heavy blow, take a heavy sigh
Like a runner on the dailies, high oh my
You’ll be good, baby boy, don’t cry
I can make a boat with the broke up rhymes
God made me the Cherokee like no
I can’t let the world off the hook this time
And if you didn’t want this catfish shit
In fact, you should’ve never shook that line
Readied that hook, took this time, to press play, then rewind
I would rather be drunk than be blind

I'm a ready made party
I'm whiskey in a bottle now
Lalalalalalalalalaa
I'm whiskey in a bottle now

[Verse 2]
Still on that gas like
The bottom of my signature shoe, 'Bama red
I'm on that ass like Alabama did LSU
You said ""Oh lord"" Bible Belt raised
In your mouth like a cold sore
Rolled Ford's? Nah roll tide and rode Chevy's
My mama rolls joints
Smoke rolls off with a timp
Daddy's a rolling stone
I'm rolling in shit with these pigs
And the south side
Who you rolling with in the sticks?
With hair weawes and airstreams
Cigarette stained walls
Fuck, I can't barely breathe
Spittin' shutgun pellets
Out of my fuckin' chili bowl... 
But am I a hill billy, no! 
I am the truth behind these fuckin' illusionist
Yellin' redneck, you about as red as the color blue is
Call me a redneck, and I just tatoo it
Because of the abusin' I use it as therapy in music
So...

[Verse 3]
Still on that grass like
John Deers this yard is already cut
You can't get no work here
You fags started with swag, you was stealing
It turns out I got no peers
Just years of street smarts
So here you go retards
Come hit this bulls eye
I'll give you three darts
One, my last album flopped
Two, it wasn't my time
Three, my fuckin' mama's selling my pajamas online
(Lalalalalalalalalaa)
But guess what?
(I'm whiskey in a bottle now)
Fuckin' right, I'm aged
I'm dirty-3, I'm not a child who plays with crack to get a piece
Don't clap, for no MC who's wack
Then get a free slap
Fuck out my car when I smashed in a Caprice
I'm Jack sippin' still
Whippin' wood wheels
Truck on steriods
Illegal to play ball
But damn it how good it feels
Drop that black card

He's just the waving, everybody's welcome
All he can say about the youth is lord help 'em
Got a couple grand babies, but they never call though
? Left? In the south and they moved to chicago
Wifes in heaven and, he's saying ever since

Jimmy's not a man and he can't provide you
He doesn't want to, but you keep it anyhow
Nine months down the road, what you gonna do now
Go to the food stamp, ?
You can find a job, it'll help you get by
And you made it when you didn't know how
Now that's a real star put her name in the clouds

Your boss at work loves giving you employee of the month
May never be the first dream on a champion team
You may be the star the world just hasn't seen

Load it up, shooting bottles off the porch

And it bubbles up to surface
Took it out on writing songs
Put the seed up under the dirt
God gave me water, blessed
Two sons and a daughter, blessed
I pray and pray harder, now why
Record and play harder
I visualize, put thumbtacks over outline
When they say I was out of my mind
I put more gold in the pipeline
This is my time

Losing my mind
And they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side, with a rhymepack
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five
Eh

It's kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain, oh, main

Part of me wanna get down, down, down
Making you go low, inside

Critics hate the lyrics cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
I'm riding round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo

Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tee's, you still huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact, what you used to steal from
You been playing fools, like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game, when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still son
Woah, this old rock, it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas and they hammer the?

I'm not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
60 seconds I'm going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
It's probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds?
Hooligans, hooligans, hooligans
But really who's a friend?
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Watch your manners I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war
You don't want it
Shady records I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit

Dog don't gotta lead
Dog's already home
Jack, dog I'm a beast, I'm a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Shhh, tell him how we gonna sell 'em man

Been working hard all week
(So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably)
So won't you bring that back to me
(And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a halloween)
I got blisters on my feet
(To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing)
So won't you bring that back to me

Ima bless her
With a 5 star kiss

She ain't chasin no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta

And all them hatin ass hoes
In da club wanna fight her
She was born in da ""A"",
Went to school in dc
Gotta job in Dallas Texas,

And the shoe game
All you gotta do is google trina
See da proof mane?
Cause aint none of these hoes,
Doin shows in the recession
They cards get declined,
Now they sufferin a depression
While I'm spendin mils
Signin all kinda deals
I'm a 5 star bitch,
Eating 5 star meals
My whole life style
Like comin to America
All my Louie luggage
You see my bag
How I carry ha?
Walkin through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin on to e-Trade

[Chorus:]
That's a 5 star chick (4x)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your hear sum'n fine

Fendi on my slippers& my cookies always slippery
I don't need help,

So I be yellin ""fuck em""
With a dildo sign
Five little mama, you a Three star
I aint sleepin when

Oh did I studda?
Harajuku hyphen,

I was just gluing my weave in,
When you hit the stage
They was booin and leavin,
Young money red flag,
No more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star bitch is!

[Chorus:]
That's a 5 star chick (4x)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your hear sum'n fine
You a five star chick (4x)

It's amazin' what 365 days can do for you
This time last year niggas was like
Talkin' 'bout cuttin' budgets and shit
I dropped the biggest record of my career, yeah
Nigga business partner with JAY Z
Shout out to Ty Ty, wassup nigga?
Emory, what it do?
You see 'em

Gotta pick 'em wisely
Gotta choose 'em carefully
Got niggas I know that weren't there for me
Got bitches I know that don't care for me
Could of went on tour with your favorite rapper and declined
Why? I'm tryna break CMG
So fuck that, I'm doin' mine
It's CM9, CM8, folks up in the last streets, call me back
Say they miss the old Gotti, old Jeezy, old Boosie, that was real rap
In New York with 3 bangers
Did Jimmy Fallon with Meaghan Trainor
I guess the sets won't taint him
Guess the money won't change him
Decisions
Homie on probation
Took him up to Roc Nation
Let him meet Jay, told him be patient
Decisions, and lil homie really got it
Trying to tell him wait his turn
He ain't learn, lil homie caught a body

9 times 9 is 81
I'm an 80's baby born in '81
From a family full of hustlers, youngest son
They say get that money, show 'em him how it done
They say 9 times 9 is 81
I'm a 80's baby born in '81 (from the crib, though)
They say get that money, show 'em him how it done (I am, I am, I am, I am)
They say get that money, show 'em him how it done
How it's done, Gotti, Gotti how it's done
You would make that shit look easy, how it's done
Gotti you make that shit look easy, how it's done
Gotti you make that shit look easy, how it's done

Biggest year of my career
And I can feel the pressure, gotta follow up
Same time I can feel the feds gettin' closer, lockin' niggas up
Decisions
Closer partners, they in prison
Never want to be the biggest
I just want to be the realest
I pay 6 figures a year for a hitter
Knockers, see your goon, he my nigga
He got the city divided
Bring it together, I tried it
Fuck them lil niggas, I tried it
Fuck them lil niggas, I tried it
I am the king, your highness
You want a problem, well find it
I was too busy gettin' too many million
Like now the perfect timin'
Let them lil niggas in
They what they do to bitch
I don't be trippin' at all
Whatever come with it, I'm with it
Lil nigga, I swear I'm good for it all

9 times 9 is 81
I'm an 80's baby born in '81
From a family full of hustlers, youngest son
They say get that money, show 'em him how it done
How it's done, Gotti, Gotti how it's done

Yo Gotti,Ain't No Turning Around,/y/yo+gotti/aint+no+turning+around_21049381.html,"I’m from the hard knock life, that all white lie,
Pop it with it at the phone when they’re getting that bad life,
Nigger goes like gospel, kills me in the chorus with the drop head after,
You’re a sleight master, you don’t care, barely in the blur,
And I’m enjoying team, ‘cause I have my own line.
Got my own man, saw my own math, fifty one hundred like a hundred’s on time.

Won’t you put your hand on that pot?
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
Won’t you bush your first glock?
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
Won’t you jump off that porch,
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
These streets hot like a torch, yeah, nigger,
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.

I’m from the hard knock life, that all black lights,
It’s making sales on a mountain bike, yeah, that’s that crack life.
Bring the whole one down and sell ‘em on next,
Couple days later, four door six.
Lord, I love shimy spray every day’s a hiny day,
Fuck, you think we’ll charge you like you needed it anyway.
Yeah, just look at those that took a nap,
When you’re on the road to riches, nigger, ain’t no looking back.

Won’t you put your hand on that pot?
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
Won’t you bush your first glock?
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
Won’t you jump off that porch,
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
These streets hot like a torch, yeah, nigger,
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.

Shots five men down, says he was hands down,
Pull the brutality, nigger, the reality.
Trade the money all in a black hoodie,
You nigger big and fat, waiting for a bully.
Big babies is the world on drugs,
What you’re seeing in, you see my god damn pearl.
Why you fit here you see my god damn self,
I have more love for these streets than my god damn self.

Won’t you put your hand on that pot?
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
Won’t you bush your first glock?
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
Won’t you jump off that porch,
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.
These streets hot like a torch, yeah, nigger,
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around.

Young nigger’s wiing, shooting shit rapidly
To give him ten years, they do that happily.
They don’t understand, they bring him down the faculty
And wait about to front, is this the nigger’s that some back on me.
Grown man be at, that’s how you handle it,
Reputation is everything, it’s over when you’re damaging.
Money is easy to get, is just hard to manage it,
Always remember the rules before you get your hand in it.

Before you put your hand in it
You got to be the man in it,
Got to understand it, got to know the rules of the game,
Gotta sacrifice, gotta know to fight,
Give your sin as for it break away.
Is your record clean? Lord knows it’s a poor sight,
Caught up in the snitch-snatch, will you imagine that?
Remember what I told you, fuck you, you can turn your back now.
Once upon a time he a realy, he a redneck.
Never turn your back on niggers that you thug with,
Bitch that you really like never fall in love with
Never seen you plug with the money up front,
If you smoke get your own ‘cause don’t hit a nigger blunt.
Remember, dog, go sales and bitches gonna leave soon
Niggers go to jail, so that’s a day from hell.
You nigger all will think that he’ll pleel
Now he ain’t do these bitches on the wall and his male.
But he ain’t tell, so niggers got salute him
And when you hit the streets again, making sure he eat again
He won’t be a beast again, he don’t have to kill again
For eighteen five, you nigger go lie"

Yo Gotti,Back Gate,/y/yo+gotti/back+gate_21589237.html,"[Verse 1]
You want an ounce?
Nigga, meet me at the back gate
Pull up, cut ya car off
Never sipped lean in the first place
'Cause I ain't never wanna nod off
I was cooking cocaine getting hard off
A .25 and a sawed-off
8 dimes for the 80
Hope and foreign, the baby
Put a pound, hot nigga
Head to start off

[Chorus]
(Back gate!)
Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!)
We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Pull up at your own risk (back gate!)
Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!)
Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!)
Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!)

[Bridge]
Ay, I'm talkin' 'bout
That back gate made a nigga
I seen that same back gate break niggas
You wanna fish a nigga, I advise you stay on top

[Verse 2]
Lost nigga in through the back gate (back gate!)
Trap came fucked up the crime rate (back gate!)
Old head fucked up my mind state
Watch him killing me cold blood in the broad day
If I ain't know God I would've lost faith
Niggas couldn't eat while they lost weight
Niggas ain't going on no diet
Niggas kill a nigga by they pride
Niggas gon' slide
Niggas gon' do 25 in a cell for' a nigga switch sides
You can see it in my eyes
That's pain, lost niggas to the game, and ain't the same
Did it for the check, I ain't do it for the fame
Only time you shot a pistol is at the motherfucking range
You a pussy if you gotta close your eyes for' you aim

[Chorus]
(Back gate!)
Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!)
We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Pull up at your own risk (back gate!)
Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!)
Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!)
Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!)

[Verse 3]
Told the plug meet me at the bottom (back gate!)
Showed me two bricks and I shot him (back gate!)
First time I ever did a robbery (back gate!)
Ever since then they been hard for me
I'ma cut throat nigga's arteries (back gate!)
I shouldn't be trusted properly
Reach Chris turned me to a savage
Used to couldn't flip on a pissy ass mattress (back gate!)
I know a lot of killers is activing
Know a lot of rappers that's active
Used to get my work from the plug I was paying on the backhand
That was back then when I was trapping
First time I ever shot a pistol I was 13
Glock hold 17, black with the red beam
First time I ever shot a nigga, rival hood shoot-out shit
Feeling like a wet dream, fell in love with the streets
Got a couple choppers, fell in love with the beef (back gate!)
Got a couple bricks and we all gon' leave (back gate!)
Back gate jumping like the coddle (back gate!)
Ain't no other hood trapping harder (back gate!)
Saved a hunnit thou when I was 16
I was moving bricks by the 16
That millimeter hold 16
Turned the back gate to a crime scene

(Back gate!)
Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!)

I just went to Neiman's, and I just blew a bag
Copped that new Givenchy, and I didn't see the tags
Thirty two fifty, half a quarter for a shirt
And we call it that sauce, work
Pull up in a [?] , leave the valet
And when I hit the gas; skirrt
Take of a like a rocket, if you the plug then I'm the socket
Niggas hate but they can't stop it, I just blew another bag
Dealership with 'nother tags, swapped it up another swag
Bought my bitch another bag, another bitch I know she mad
I just blew another check, I just bought another Tec
I been waitin on pussy niggas, Ima die for this respect

Half a brick for a section, Im in club Liv flexin
I can't wait till that confetti drop, when they play me and that Fetty Wap

When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass Ackwards

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards

Let's talk about that four letter word love
I think you deserve a king
I think you deserve the world and everything in it
And I try to go get it to show you I meant it when I
Tell you I'm sorry, tomorrow I promise that I
Try to better, I'll do whatever for mine
And I ain't tryna be your friend's friends
Or your quote unquote fake friend, that's why I hate friends
I'd rather see you laugh to see you cry
I'd rather see you lead and tell a lie
And you ain't gotta say it, you deserve better

I deserve better, better than you
I deserve better, (I deserve, I deserve) better than you
I deserve better (I deserve, I deserve better)
Tell 'em what they already know, I deserve better

What you would do for any other motherfuckers than yourself?

[Chorus]
These big homie rules, I give my lil' homie jewels
Some shit they can use
You give your lil' homie tools (Yeah)
And tell 'em go do some shit that you wouldn't do
You breakin' big homie rules
Big homie rules, it's a big homie move
'Cause this what big homies do
Never fold, lead by example (By example)
Never let nothin' come between the family

These are big homie rules
Big homie rules (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Rule number one, believe in your dreams (Okay)
Always understand it's more than you, it's a team (What else?)
Rule number two, niggas' bitches off limits (Yeah)
We don't do that in the family, no distractions while we winnin'
And rule three, it's kinda sensitive to me (What's that?)
This table full of plates, we make sure everybody eats
And communicate your issues, we can agree to disagree (Okay)
But talkin' family business that's out the family, that ain't G (For real)
Ain't no rats in here, so ain't no leaks (Ain't no bitches)
All my brothers' keeper, fuck these freaks (Fuck these bitches)
And rule number four, if you ever get fronted
Despite what you hearin', always pay their money
And rule five, this the only rule I don't really like (What up?)
Put a snake with a snake, you get a bite for a bite
And rule six, you must protect the brand with your life
I'd rather help you get a million than help you give a strike (True story)
And do you understand your publishing? Whether you rappin' or you hustlin'
Treat that like real estate and pay the government (Okay)
Family first, money second
You ain't takin' care of your family, I just can't respect it

Some shit they can use
You give your lil' homie tools
And tell 'em go do some shit that you wouldn't do

Never fold, lead by example
Never let nothin' come between the family
That's a big homie move

These are big homie rules (Rules)
Big homie rules (Rules)

[Verse 2]
Ain't no jealousy in the crew (Why?), 'cause if I got it, then you got it
Lil' homie got a problem (What?), big homie solve it
Niggas talkin' boss talk, they never been a soldier (Soldier)
I just wanna cook up one more time to get some closure (Whip)
When it come to this beef shit, it is what it is
When a homie don't fuck with you, shit is what it is
They call it investment, I just believe in my dawg
Buss it down how you wanna, I just wanna see you ball
You ain't a boss, you're a mistake, nigga
How they put you in position when you fake, nigga? (Fake)
You lie to your team, you sell your niggas' dreams
When there's war, somehow you always in-between
The family and the opposition
Me, I like this nigga, but know my position
So it's fuck 'em and it's fuck 'em forever (Fuck 'em)
I take loyalty to a whole 'nother level
I get the information, pass it down (Down)
My homies know that's on my life, I always held 'em down
Last rule (Last rule)
If you gon' be a big homie (What?)
Treat your niggas with respect, not like a lil' homie

These big homie rules (Big homie rules), I give my lil' homie jewels (I do)
Some shit they can use
You give your lil' homie tools
And tell 'em go do some shit that you wouldn't do
You breakin' big homie rules (What else?)
Big homie rules, it's a big homie move

I feel like its my job to tell these niggas the facts
15, 20 million dollars no plats
Cruisin’ down the street in my new lambo
Bad bitch big pussy that’s my MO (gotti)
If you run up on this car
I’ll send ya to god (blat blat)
Truth is none of these rappers are hard
And everybody gangsta when they come to ya city
Always calling niggas hold em’ down in your city

You say you run the town but you never in the city
Ion. Ion give a fuck when they come to my city (Memphis)

Hanging out the window lat lat till I get it

I done seen real niggas stay real and fail
Tell they stories through music and end up in jail (damn)
Ian signed to no label

So if my album come out late

Motherfucking come up over here shawty. Hell naw!!

Shawty was so real back in '96
Before the big life all the ice and all the bricks
Was small time grindin', high school rhymin'
Just broke up with my bitch so it was like perfect timing
She wouldn't a dime piece, she wouldn't a nine piece
But bout a six or a seven but was real sweet
But she was gangsta in other words thugged-out
But she was trafficing and manufacturin' drugs out
She was a little older she was a little bolder
Than all my other hoes, she drove a blue Corolla
We used to walk to class, I used to hold her folder
You know that in-between green shit to win her over
But fuck it, I'm a soldier, by now she should've noticed
That ya boy gone spit vocals or gone sell yola
She had nice goals future thought-out with a plan
But let me tell you how this bitch was trying to break a man
[Chorus:]
Tryin', tryin', to break a man
I don't understand
[Verse 2:]
I told you she was real, at least I thought she was
I fucked with her for years, but that was just because
The situation seemed like it was meant to be
Until the money came I thought we was the perfect team
I worked a little harder, yes, I was like my father
All through the rain, sleet, and snow like it was no tomorrow
I had to stack my dollars, real niggaz do real things like the lifetime in
Volume 1 of Sean Carter
I started flippin' cars, she started flippin' out
I tried to figure out what the fuck she bitchin' bout
She go a little crazy, she got a little lazy
No more with future plans and goals she only talkin babies
I''m only talkin maybe
She constantly talkin' give me
Don't wanna hustle don't wanna work, I guess she out to get me
My money won't decrease by any circumstance
I ain't gone give you shit, you ain't gone break a man
[Chorus:]
[Verse 3:]
Now we didn't have a pot to piss in
Shawty that's when you would listen
My down ass Memphis bitch, just playin yo postion
This before you had my son, this before I had a name
This before I copped the deal, this before I let it wang
Told you was my plan was to try to come up on some change
Do my music out of town, I got to hoppin' on the planes
All the time away from home, shit you wasn't in my trust
While I'm out of town Rap Hustlin', doing this shit for us
All of a sudden you need some space, so I let you breathe
Went and got yo own place, and I was wrong for lettin' you leave?
Now I'm back to fuckin' niggaz hoes, back to fuckin' bitched friends
Seen the spot I'm livin' in, got mad when I went and got the Benz
Now you want some dividends, now you wanna go to court

I got faith she gon' hold it down

[Chorus]
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, back and forth and that shit filled with dope

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Yo
Why the trap smell like onions
What's that loud odor
I've been sackin' brown bags like I work at Kroger
Not concerned with no payment nigga, what the total
I jumped out my Bentley coupe into a Toyota
Seatbelt, rental car trafficking
Blood on my diamonds, bitch I'm African
Quit puttin' your bag on that 'gram, boy that real life
You'll have them feds and them robbers at you, real life
I put my money in the ground and molded
Put my trust in a nigga and he folded
Can't believe that nigga took the stand and told
Fuck your bitch in the trap the dick she rode

[Chorus]
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor

Of course, full-force, I done made it now

I feel like you can't stop me now
I'm tighter now
More of a writer now

Got me payin' taxes now
Can't relax now
Got big corporations, sending me faxes now
More than just Yo now
Ceo now
You see them diamonds and them??? In my rope now
I'm on a roll now
Got me doing shows now
And when my album drops, it's certified gold now
Woah now
My pockets on swoll now
Hold now
Uncles Sam askin' how many units I sold now
Thinkin' bout makin' clothes now
Movies and videos now
Puttin it down for big dope boys, make all the noise now
Money come legit now, I put it in the bank now
Withdraw, atm, from my account now
Check never bounce now
Plat by the once now
So many karats, that it's hard for me to count now

[Hook:]

[Yo Gotti]
You ought to see the way I be ballin' now
You ought to see the way the girls be callin' now
Sweatin' me now, talkin' bout get married now
I'm laughin' now, she gettin' about her karats now
It's so funny that it hurt now
She think I'm Captain Kirk now
She ain't spending mine, unless she puttin' in work now
Got me cashin' checks now
Bout time for me to flex now
Bezzled-out Rolex now
Bout to buy a lake now

I refuse to quit now
Cause Gotti is the shit now
Never thought I'd drop a tape and come up wit a hit now
Take it how you wanna now
Don't smoke no marijauna now
That was in my younger days, like youngsters on the corner now
Platted out my grill now
Bout to sign a deal now
Moved into a crib now
Retired from the hill now
Tired of doing dirt now
My niggas on that yirk now
Feel like I owe the Lord, so I'm goin' to church now

[Hook:]

[Yo Gotti]
Niggas got they hand out

Constantly askin me for vip's to my shows now
See me in the street now

My shit in the stoes (stores) now
Rollin' wit the pros now
Cause my shit is sellin' like the Ralph Lauren clothes now
Clicked up wit Dirt now, people do my track now
Never ever ever will you say my shit is wack now

[Don Dirty]
When you see us banged out in the stretch Lex wit the brains out
Done sold two million or mo' we gettin' change now
Don Dirty left the game on hold, it aint the same now
Police walkin round in plain clothes, and constantly layin 'round
Police filling phonies with friends, but try to spot me
Set a nigga up for 10 O's and still couldn't stop me
But they watch me
Run in my house just like a hobby
I'm a smooth mastermind in the game
They still can't stop me

Can I show you what a millionaire look like?
Aye let me show you how to cook right
This what a millionaire look like

Young nigga in the hood watchin out for hustle
All these niggas with me, I love em like my brother
I am the struggle, I am the hustle
I am the city, homie proud of me did you
I used to say pin this mouse, this nigga co-dependent
Hard way nigga, I got my meals the hard way
Selling crack, millionaire, I love the smart way
Exit the game and got rich, that’s a fade away
Ha-ha, what a millionaire look like?
Yea I can show em how to cook right
Turn a man to a half, turn a brick to a jet
Nigga you do the math, you can aim right
Mixtape doing show for the 40
All I need is one mic and a Glock 40
Tot bomb for the killers who never honor the deal
And then ugk to the ceiling,
Can’t describe the feeling

I am in this – fortunate
I am success… fortune live
Mansion life in the crissy
Young niggas with tints
Headshots in the day
Throwin our lives away
I understand her
I come from that land hoe
That’s where they would kill a nigga and I was the man hoe
Shots fired, bullets flying
Coming out that lando
Family cryin, say that shit so times, hardcore

Mafia, I grew up when freaks and shit were poppin up
I was hustling, thuggin and keep the cocaine and we’re poppin up
I have bricks down, choppas up, it wasn’t no nigga real as us
City fuckin with me cuz they know a nigga real as fuck
Yea, then the shit got easy
Told my dog I had a million and he didn’t believe me
I told him cool, roll a brick, bringing 22 easy
I would live it up and die before I heard about Jeezy
For real

I could show you how to cook right
And what a millionaire look like
Yep I could show you how to cook right
And what a multi-millionaire look like nigga

I Am
I Am

Self –Made just like Ross said nigga
You know they gave me shit potna
Relax about me nigga

Yea I got cutt off yo bush

Yeah yeah (This call may be recorded at any time)
Don't forget the bag, don't forget the bag (To accept the charges)
You know I'm getting cash, I won't forget the brag hah, lead off (Lito)

Been to Honda for rices, F 'n' H, no license (Bahh)
Forty dollars for a box of bullets, life's cheap and priceless
And we're like this, we grind all day (all day) and workin' the night shift
When the sentence they offer them end it with life 
Forgot not to mention the wife shit (Shit)
Indictments is really frightening (damn, aghh) 
There's niggas fighting for they freedom every day, 'bout speculation and hearsay
Got sick of making excuses, make reservations and get away (Get away)
Like Mobb Deep, it's just me, too heat, solo creep (Lito, Lito, Lito)
They taking photos 'cause there's no doughs on they photo G
Oh no, I swear I don't remember that bitch, even though your hoe know me (Agh)
Lito break a bell up in a bathtub, need a soul to seize
All I need is one brick, I'm so low-key

Don't forget the bag when you niggas gon' be shopping
Don't forget the, don't forget the duffel bag and broccoli
All I need is one brick, so get with it, chopping
All I, all I need is one brick, sell that bitch for dirt cheap

Niggas act tough on the internet (Internet) 
Gangsta niggas trappin' on Craigslist
Niggas do it all for a download
Me I'm just trying to do the very least
Niggas sell they soul for a Worldstar beat
I'm in Miami with a base so real, with a bitch so bad that you see on TV 
But still got a plug, that's a bird's eye view 

Got a hundred handles, that's priceless
I don't chrome with niggas, they're shysty
Two, two Cuban links, that's pricey
All I get is chicks like Nike (chick chick)
I can get the word for the dirt cheap
Ridin' down Jefferson four deep
Four F N's in a stash fight
On that Grey Goose nigga, you don't know me
Or you might do, or you might be, say I swiped up, shit I might be 
I don't really know
I made ten million dollars off a dope flow, from a drug hit
Owe my whole life to a porridge box, work my whole life for a Rolex watch
Bra-brand new Phantom and the top gon' drop
That's a lot of money but them home go buck

Don't forget the bag when you niggas gon' be shopping
Don't forget the, don't forget the duffel bag and broccoli
All I need is one brick, so get with it, chopping
All I, all I need is one brick, sell that bitch for dirt cheap

Came a long way
Started from the bottom
Ridgecrest apartments, M&M's I got 'em
Name duckin' no problem
Niggas know it so they tryin' to put the bait on me
How we from the same hood
Watch me make it out, but then you pour hate on me
Shame on you
I was finna put the chain on you
Now I gotta put the aim on you
How your enemies the same, homie
Damn homie
Big homie shit (get the bricks and bust 'em down with you)
War shit a thousand rounds with you
I was wrappin' bricks and sending pounds with you
Now I'm on TV
Diamonds drippin', [?]
Deep inside you wanna be me
Federal 3 that shit on repeat
Reach for my chain, [?] (aye)
Feelin' like Yeezy so I need a cape
Talkin' bout Kim or talking to [?]
Black [?] on the side of the Wraith
When it come to the bag they know I don't play

Sellin' no crack no more
I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go)

I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah (gon' make 'em hate me)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Ain't gon' lie
Sometimes I wish I could retire
Wish I didn't have to tote the fire
I wish my name wasn't always in the news
I can't go no where without the tools
If you go against me you gon' lose (lose)
Me and all the deals close every day
I barely made it outta school
Fuck credit, cash rules
Be like tell youngsta calm down
Put the guns down but I kinda feel 'em
You will never understand
You ain't from the hood, niggas tryin' to kill 'em
I tryin' to put my youngin' on the chart
They trying to trick my youngin' out of spite
You tryin' to cop a Benz off the lot
I'm tryin' to pull up in my own yacht
I got different dreams, different goals
We in different brackets, we got different hoes too
I don't [?] supposed to
Spread rumors, that's what hoes do
I was sick and tired, sick and tired of sellin' crack
If I have it my way I'm never goin' back
I hate a disloyal nigga and a rat
Fell in love with fast money and the strap

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go back
Sellin' no crack no more
I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go)
Shootin' them Macs no more (brrt)
I don't wanna go back (I don't want to)
But a nigga gon' make me
If I don't go back
I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah
I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go back)
Sellin' no crack no more (Sellin' no crack no more)
I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go)
Shootin' them Macs no more (Shootin' no Macs no more)
I don't wanna go back (I don't have to)

Just touched down at Coachella
Ayy, Southside, where you get all that drip?
Ayy, let that beat ride
Ayy, I'm big Gotti to you niggas, too
Can I keep it all the way G? Put some respect on that

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I just touched down at Coachella
Half a brick of raw, hunnid a gram, none lesser
Let's get these suburban kids on they level
Better yet, these artists, whatever
My backyard like a resort
Just beat another day in court
Palm trees in the skyline
Four Rolls-Royces and they all mine

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I may paint them bitches Nipsey blue (Whoop, whoop, whoop)
All my niggas trained, no talk, just shoot
And all my bitches trained to pull bitches
And if you snitchin', nigga, keep your distance (Woo)
My bedroom look like the St. Regis
Freedom in America, I pledge allegiance (On God)
My closet lookin' like it's Saks Fifth (Ftt)
I may buy your girlfriend a gift
Double C's got my closet like it's Crip walkin'
I'll silence these niggas if they keep talkin'
My bitch look down like I'm a pimp, you speak, she keep walkin'
Still in touch with my plug, sometimes we speak often (Hello?)
'Cause I cherish my relationships ('Migos)
Every month I'm at the dealership (I am)
Who need a runner when you get it shipped?
Safe landing, pilot get a tip

Just another day in court (Huh)
Palm trees in the skyline (Skyline)
Four Rolls-Royces and they all mine

Might put X-X-X on all my tags (Extension)
Tell Virgil I want all the bags
Louis duffel and it's see through (See through)
A couple million and a Drak',  too (Brr)
My Rolls truck white-white (White)
I was sellin' niggas off-white late night (Nights)
Junkie put her in a shooter (Pew), take flight (Gone)
Black and white jet, Puma, out of state flight (Yeah)
I just sold out the arena
My mama proud, you shoulda seen her
All smiles when she see her son (Her son)
I'm a gangster, look what I've become
I'm at Prive havin' lunch
Conference call with Roc Nation, 30 million in a month (Woo)
You niggas 4th and 30, that's a punt (Punt)
Five hundred on a watch, that ain't a stunt (Stunt)

My backyard like a resort
Just beat another day in court
Palm trees in the skyline
Four Rolls-Royces and they all mine (Maybach Music)

Phantoms in the parkin' lot, look at it, made man
Just left the jewelry store, don't I look amazin'?
Every where I go I got them things with me
Wanna see my niggas on, it's still the same with me
Do it for the loyalty, not just a chain from me
All through my niggas cribs, it's picture frames of me
Shots from assault rifles when my name come in
A hunnid for the walk-through is when the planes come in
Five number ones, I think I broke Def Jam (Def Jam)
I had them people at that table like a meth lab (Meth lab)
Street dreams (Street dreams), street kings (Street kings)
Rip to Nipsey on his C thing (Uh)
Three rings (Uh), D. Wade (Huh)
Two words from mama, ""Be safe""
I got your back, I pray you got mine
Biggest Crip to walk the usa to top five
Headlines (Pop), shots fired (Pop)
Arch rival in the dark, threw out my archive
Franchise fat boy (Woo)
Never been to Coachella, but still a landlord (Maybach Music)

Hood nigga, all this fame don't excite me

Facts

I don't care where a nigga from, what he claim (facts)
If the nigga a real nigga we could get some money

Know this rap shit changed my life, I know I'm blessed for that
Just spent 500 on a drop head, I ain't stressing that

Don't disrespect me and try to squash it, no reversing that

Facts

Come sign with me and get a pack
Or play with me your shit gon' splat

Trap house jumping off the meter like my shows and features
Before they started sending threats, I always kept a heater
Bring some pills in the back and plenty bowls of reefer
Them other niggas was bustin' heads, I always kept em cheaper
I remember selling bombs, then I blew up like a bomb, profits off the bomb
Put it in my charm, couple karats on my arms
Real nigga just putting words together, I'm not no rapper
And them niggas just putting words together they not factors

Facts

And I go federal, federal, federal
I'm on perks, xans, et cetera
Honey, came home with me, she was a miracle
Fucked the lil bitch, to date might
Niggas gon talk, but I don't be hearing them
Niggas gon bluff, but I don't be fearing them

Came to school, filled the lot up

A full-time d-boy gettin it how I live (ya know)
I full-time grind so I full time shine and
I'm full-time strapped wit a fully loaded nine

[Verse:]
I'm startin off my day wit a tank full of gas
A clip full of hollows, a pocket full of cash
A wrist full, a ring full, a chest full of ice
And a bitch in the rental wit a trunk full of white
I was ridin behind tent gettin bent at the light
Seen the laws make a left so you know I bust a right
That's the d-boy detour switchin up my route
Check ya resource invoice the bird in the drought
Got a phone full of missed calls, beeper full of codes
One eight behind a number mean they want a half of a whole one
Fully loaded most bird punk that'll bang ya
Full-time thug and I'm a full-time gangsta

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I'm full-time switchin lanes, rims spinnin, swirvin
Full-time on the grind in the North servin
Keisha and Tameka and Shanika, Marilyn
Were full-time freaks but were part time virgins
You were so blind you couldn't read between the lines
See ya baby momma slash right was part time mine and
I didn't really care about a part time hair
Or a part time feelins and chillen wit y'all chillin
I'm a full-time pimp you a part time spouse
I just burn her brains, get them thangs, throw em' in her house
I was out the frame, movin cane, runnin in and out
When them people came, know the game, shut ya fuckin mouth

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
You a part time soldier runnin in the battlefield
Talkin loud, sayin nothin, that's how you got ya homies killed
Full grown man wit a part time plan
So you walkin round, head down, lookin for a hand
I'm a part time rapper, full-time trapper
Copped my own bricks and shit and own my own Master's
Done the shit myself so I can get it done faster
Promised to myself that I wasn't fuckin wit you actors
Full-time boss you a part time C. E. O. From never never land
Peter Pan you's a middle man yea
Yo Gotti got the money and the power
You part time snitch and you a full-time coward

It all started out at a I&E fest
When Grip told Gotti to bump his best
He said 'Go Go Gotti, Go Go Go Gotti
Go Go Gotti, Go Go Go Gotti'

Go Gotti go
That's all I know
It started out
In a small project, where I was turning it out
Credit for Grip
He never tripped, he kept it real
Had the bankroll and the knowledge, and I had the skill
I was twelve years old, Grip was fourteen
Grip was gettin' work, I was servin' fiends
I been a wigsplitter, slash money-go-getter
Ever since I was a itty-bitty lil nigga
Thank I was the wisest youngster out there hustlin'
Twelve year old kid on the block cuffin'
Packs in my ass and rocks under my tongue
Gotti ain't doing drugs cause Gotti ain't gettin' sprung
Rappin' came eazy
It was a gift, that I got from Jeezy

I told you once, and you didn't believe me
Now with the help of Grip, it cost to see me
I'm a thug and drugs is what I live by
So if I speak it I mean it, cause I don't liz-ie
When I turned fifteen, I had ten G's
Me and Grip colaborated and bought a key
And for a hobby, you know I was rappin'
But never thought that this cd shit would happen
I dropped my first album, they went crazy
And at random I was fuckin' these nigga's ladies
Don't play no games, and please don't criticize me
Who had a hundred G's, my age, beside me?
I went to school with platinum chains, and platinum grills
A sports car, a big truck on twenty wheels
You won't believe the shit, that I done been through
The cats I roll wit, and who I'm kin to, I'm kin to

[Hook:]
It's hard to believe (It's hard to believe)
I made it through the years (I made it through the years)
I guess that I'm blessed (I guess that I'm blessed)
Cause I didn't get popped (or I didn't get killed)

[Yo Gotti]
It's hard to except
The cards I was dealt
The life that I chose
???
A life full of crime
A bag full of dimes
A hood full of jealous ass niggas wanting mine
But now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take
I seen it, all this ana fall, never thought I'd make it out
Broad-daylight, I seen my homeboy get takin' out
They shot at me
They got at me
Never could they get at me
I gotta thank the Lord from shielding me from all my enemies
Ran mo' blocks than fugitives
Sold mo' dope than Cubians
Kept my mind on dollar signs and never was abusing them
I think I got the feeling jone
I'm seeing millions jone
Come into my residence
But that's irrelevant
2000 was on jone
2000 is gone jone
2000 and 1 is here, I'm still droppin' songs jone

[Hook:]

[Denaro]
Don't shit exist in this galaxy, that's like Denaro
Ain't facin' shit, but tragedy from out of my baro
Witnessed too much shit at a age like mine
Beef off in the streets got me on stages wit nines
My nig Gotti get the mic, and yo I'm watchin' the crowd
I see a nigga start to reachin' and let that heater go pow
Took too many losses, felt sad feelings out here
My nig lost his mom and dad, I lost my lil' one this year
We be exposed to a lot of shit our eyes shouldn't see
But I'm composed of a lot of shit y'all niggas couldn't be
Cause I'm a real nigga, meaning I'm limited dog
Fake shit done played out like sega Genesis dog
They used to call me Ghost, cause I had a nigga that spook
Just a young nigga, strapped up and ready to shoot
I played it smart this year
Life was hard this year
I kept my lawyer fully paid and beat my charge this year, nigga

[Hook:]

[V-Dog]
It's hard to believe I made it nigga, but I made it nigga, yeah I'm here
You thought that I wouldn't make it nigga, but tell me who you hear
It wouldn't my time to go, so I ain't gone nowhere
I'm still bumpin, keepin' you jumpin, while I'm smokin' my square
I be V slash D uh O G nigga, I'm just like a nigga, holdin' my pants when I
Pose nigga
Still fuckin' hoes nigga
Doing my shows nigga
And listening to you niggas say this bitch is cold nigga
I'm out of control nigga
I can't be stopped bitch
I made it through the years with out gettin popped or killed
I said I'm out of control nigga, I can't be stopped bitch
I made it through the years with out gettin' popped or killed

I remember, see I remember like yesterday
Vividly, everythin' I went through

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I remember long dice games
Been fucked up to steppin' up my ice game
Openin' at dark stages then the lights came
Went to Mexico, met a plug, then my life changed
And I was on vacation
Never was with waitin'
Always been impatient
Always 'bout the money
Never been with hatin'
Believe in loyalty, I help my niggas fight they cases
Don't believe in hope, I tell 'em hold they head
I tell 'em stack they bread
I tell 'em pipe it down
Before you get up in the feds, homie talkin' loud
Between you, I think you scared
'Cause if you really want the problem, he'll end up dead
And that's some real shit
I don't talk about niggas 'cause it's a waste of time
And when I talk to my young'ns, I tell 'em go and grind
And when I talk to the plug, I tell him double up
It's summer time, nigga tryna fuck the city up
I remember my first 9 like yesterday
Oil based, fucked up the kitchen lost an ounce of yay
Plug don't give a fuck, he like niggas still got to pay
My ounces 24 grams, not 28
That's the make up and every day I wake up
Grab my strap and talk to God
Make sure that I'm prayin'
And once I leave the house I may bump into a hater
And imma shoot is ass in the face, straight up
Don't believe in hoe problems so I leave these hoes
You need that time by yourself so you don't need these hoes
I'm worth 20 mil nigga, but a 100 to go
It was 375 a half, it's 650 an O
I been a partner with LA Reid and Jay Z
I'm still hangin' with niggas who coppin' half a keys
Still runnin' with niggas gettin' pounds
And still game to let your ass down, nigga, for real

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm your rappers favorite rapper, I'm a trap hero
My whips KKK white and my guns negro
Black, white, white, black, I'm color blind
Nigga if your life matter, well nigga so does mine
Yeah this shell 9, streets call for it
It was just amount of time
And the phone sell the record, fuck I still fine
I'ma still hold my head high and still shine, yeah
I drop without a single
Man I used to throw 10 thousand singles
Used to have my dope in a can of Pringles
I sell every pack of paper
Can 30, I done need some net
Street nigga at heart and I'm oldschool
My niggas used to smoke loud, now they on dog food
It's no average life, nigga this average life
Partner killed a partner, go to the funeral, go the burial
Talk to his mama, this shit can get scary
I'm known none of this is gon' worry us
The cars material, money deteriorate
Bitches gon' vanish and still illuminate
I got plaques on the wall, niggas in the jailhouse
Got my advance check, bail my niggas out
Played my role nigga, fishin' them birds out
When you the kingkin, there ain't shit you can tell 'bout
Look around nigga, who you see
We in streets, nigga chance is learnin'
Gettin' Lamorghini, 200 k advance
And that ain't label money, that was mine nigga
'Cause l my young'ns got the same dream as mine nigga
You tryna be a young millionaire, me too
Move your family out the hood, me too
We jump coupes
And we ain't makin' WorldStar, we makin' news
So don't get this shit conferred, nigga

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I remember when they tried to play me, huh
Notice how I said 'try'
On everythin' I love, that will never happen
I remember when I made my first milli'
I remember, on everythin' I love, I remember
I remember when they tried to count me out
So I count it up
On my mama, I remember
I also remember those that showed love
I'm forever grateful
I swear to God, I remember
I remember, they wanted to see me broke
They wanted to finish me
They wanted me to be miserable
So I decided to make 25 million
In 11 months to be exact

And it's California kush she got me talking like I'm Done (Done)
Playing with my money then I'm calling my attorney
And them people can't believe that Gucci man got jungle fever
And I think I love this girl because her price is hella cheaper
And like lu said it's better to loose a love than love a leaver
Running around town with them choppers about the same size

I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)
I love them pretty little white white girls (white girls)
I'm in the spot full of white girls (white girls)
I'm in the drop with the white girl (white girl)
I fell in love with the white girl (white girl)
It was love at first sight girl (sight girl)
I'm in a club full of white girls (white girls)
I'll be your boyfriend for the night girl (night girl)

Mexican, hose, Virgina you don't say
Chopper bullets, rotate
Hundred round AK
Young nigga thuggin' bitch ya know I'm colour blind
Pocket full of money and all i stack is dollar signs
I'm white girl crazy, rich don't got lazy,
Never been a racist, 'cause white girls pay me
My credit card black new bitch brown skin
Duffle bag full of that green shit
Ain't nothing like my white friend
White Benz, white on white,
Rolling on my grown man
30 corners in that bitch narrow with them thangs
I love that white girl, and I beat her like I'm OJ
Ridge Crest a promise junkies screaming like the OG

I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)
I love them pretty little white white girls (white girls)
I'm in the spot full of white girls (white girls)
I'm in the drop with the white girl (white girl)

I'm in a club full of white girls (white girls)
I'll be your boyfriend for the night girl (night girl)

Creep out through the day, creature of the night
Let her sit on your face, she'll get you high as a kite
She knows just what you like, I know just what you need
If them white girls you like, bet I got one your type
Have a blonde for the day, brunette for the night
She got my pockets aight I bring her out in the light
I got the crowd I got them
I got them vans (it's Gucci)
I got her tucked off in my van
She fuck with me cause I'm the man
I'm passing kush out to my fans
And I don't think you understand
She got me folding other brands

I fell in love with that white girl (white girl)

Rappin' ain't no fucking thang block burna big biggidy bang
Me and my guys be sellin' them pies since 95' we out the frame
Gotti representing the streets so Swizzo let 'em feel the beef
Try to steal my flow but niggas know they ain't real as me

Prayin' harder than ever, know I oughta do better
I be talkin' to God, while I walk with the Devil
Sell the carpenter skills, work in horrible weather
Can't hold a hammer and nail, pistol and an umbrella
The clip watch back I'ma stab him, get too close, I'ma scalp ya
Jump up out the Benz Sprinter, all white Berlinetta
What that is, a Beretta? Character or Sylvester?
Ain't no shinin' when I'm grindin' on my mind is whatever
Mike Brown murder only talked about for a week
They say Gates what's your take? We just wanna hear you speak
Where I'm from, this go on every day in the streets
Stood on allies with Leonard, they won't work, I'mma flood
Even when it's hot, I thug, make 'em work for the bust

I got on two chains, no, I ain't Tity Boi
I'm dream chasing, but I ain't from Philly, boy
Bitch bad, and she said I can get it, boy
This a hit and I'ma make a nigga feel it, boy
My flow deranged, my swag insane and my campaign on ten
I like the bitch, she bad as fuck, but I'm really into her friend
House up on the hill, got it off of cocaine
Aventador Lamborghini, condo off of Biscayne
Bitch, I'm in my lane, fresh as hell, no stains
Robin's Jean with the stones, Giuseppes match my chain
I’m different, I was built for this, my bitch only rock Tiffany
You a rat, you’ll sing a symphony
And I’m back, street's been missing me
My watch silly, my clock ignorant, and I'm the king of my city
I'm ban'd up and I ain't in a band
But my flow just like an instrument
Bass, feel that, yellow tape of the trizack
Hating is a disease, pussy, where they do that?

King shit and you know what it is
Shorty smell like a pound of that loud
But a nigga look like a hundred mil
But I drive Ferrari, fuck the motherfucking dealer
Pay ten million for a mansion, that worth more than your opinion
I got racks all in my cargo pants
Extended clip with that hollow, man, yo bitch ass
If yo bitch bad, she get fucked fast, ain’t no romance
My diamond dancing in 3D, nigga
Like the Vegas strip when you see me, nigga
Your money wrong and my money long
And I'm playing with it like P.E., nigga
Real nigga, no joke, don’t think there, nigga, no ho
I got mini Mac-10 and a 100 round drum
In the carpet up under my car
And nigga, I don’t wanna smoke your weed
Plain gas the only thing I smoke
And I gotta thank God for the niggas off Bankhead
Shorty, they taught me everything I know
Like how to whip it, cook it, cut it, deal it
Hand it to your partner, let him flood it through the city
Really, we 'bout that action, you try us and we blasting
We turnt to the max, that’s a motherfucking fact
I'm a real nigga, fuck these rappers

Door up, doors down
When I’m in the club, bitch, it's going down
Shorty thick as fuck, hands down

Down, down, shorty fucking head down

Once I busted at the rapper, then it hit the town
Chiefin' numbers in the city, boy, it going down

This that dope boy academy, them three letters been after me
The F.B.I. ever catching me, my family might witness a tragedy
Shorty open her legs up happily
I ball hard like an athlete
Young, black nigga in a big, white Phantom
Nigga, I look like a referee
They blowing the whistle, they telling
If I do the crime, I'm jailin'
This bitch turned up, making it rain
When I'm in the club, you yelling
They talk about these Bentleys that I'm getting on the daily
One feet in the game and one feet out, swear I barely made it
I'ma real nigga 'til the death of me

I care more bout the dough, and even more bout the Benz
Niggaz look at my chain, then they clutchin' they burners
They think they got us, we ?? finna get ugly this summer
Yeah I roll with a stunna, I got a lot on the line
But still its kill or be killed before a nigga take mine
I give a pass to niggaz, when they look at my bitch
Just they admire her walk, or just impress that she thick
I'm reppin' Southside ?? nigga, nigga Yo Gotti!
Bricks in the dashboard Benz big body
Royce 5'9"" and them hustles out of Detroit
Get it how we get it 'cause they importin' Ex boy

[Chorus]

Why you so hard nigga? Pause
I done tried so many times
To get my violent temper to comply with my mature side
But the other side is where the 45 is, hidin'
And I'm fa' sho childish, hi, I'm countin'
1, 2, seeking you niggaz with the peace, with the peek-a-boo trigger
When I come, through, with the honorable spirit
Eyes lighting up with shine like the ""Chronicles of Riddick""
Nigga forget it
Nine times outta ten, times' on my side
If your nines in the car, 'cause mines on my side
Why you lookin' like dat?
Nigga ain't no hoes here
I'm about to ask the waitress what she put in yo' beer
We can get it on, we can do whatever boy (whatever boy)
Don't you ever push your pedal, pump your brake
Better untwist your face
Spoken word, mixed with school, mixed with crunk
This should hit you, get you pump, if it get you drunk
It can get you jump!

[Chorus]

Bitches trip, niggaz quick
To pull out they chains on sight
Niggaz flip, soon as they announce my name on the mic
So I, gotta kinda watch them niggaz
You know them niggaz roll up beside you
You don't know if they like your car, they don't like you
By the way they lookin', you can't tell if they grimmin' you or admiring you
Whether envy you when they see your tires spinnin'
So you greet 'em as polite
Ly as possible, that nine sit on yo lap, be disrespectful then you leave 'em at the light
Hit that window and squeeze that toaster
Pull off fast and I promise
That I just put his Regal in 3-wheel motion without havin' hydraulics
I call it like I see it
Walk it like I did it
Nigga coughin' up yo kidney
Cough, talkin' bout the kid
My people, I came expectin' the same kinda respect that you want
Some of you steppin' in something by coming and testing it once
They won't let you do nothin' unless you cutting a check
Let me ask you a couple a questions, nigga

Aye say ma, you know I wanna apologize for any and everything I ever put
You through, and I also wanna let you know that any hurt I caused it was
Non intentional. I'm here to tell you I'm sorry.
Verse 1
Mama, I just wanna apologize for 20 some years of pain now I realize
All this shit I put you through, back and forth to juvenile ma ian have a
Clue
When grandma went to church, I was selling work
Walked up in Trezevant high wit dat 38 under my shirt
They tried to kick me out mama came act a damn fool
They let me right back in, but what I go and do
Skipped class, catch me on all 3 lunches, smoking og kush a nigha had da
Munchies
All the hurt I caused high speed chases from da laws
Neighborhood gang fight a nigha done it all
Ma overall I just want a better life
For you and my sister that's why I start sellin' white
Ma every night and every day
I contemplate about da day dey came took chuck away
Den I wasn't afraid, to go to jail
Dats when I hit da streets, start givin' dese nighas hell
But in yo eyes, I know dat wasn't da right choice
I thank you for yo love and support
Dats why I jus wanna pologize.
Chorus x4
(Cause you know I messed up baby)
Yeah, a this this real life shit homie
See nighas make musik

Dats da only way I know how
Verse 2
Daddy he a og brutha he was a hustla too
Shit run in my bloodline
What the fuck you think imma do
Mama down bad
Car repoed and the rent was due
For I let her starve I'm off da porch without a fuckin' clue
Pistol in my hand no mask
Who would ever knew
Goon turned rapper to millionaire
Look what life a do
Mama got a big house on the hill and it's white too
Think she goin' cocaine crazy jus got a white coupe
Mama say she proud of me
All dese nighas who doubted me
Raised me ta be a real nigha
Memphis brought it out of me
Ridgecrest apartments
Slangin' dope down on Garland
Feds givin' out too much time, fuck it um robbin'
Mama say she gon pray fa me
Know dat dey got a place fa me
Told her I had a plan
And this musik gon make a way fa me
Sorry fa all the pain
Tears and all the shame
But mama you know I love ya
And I promise you imma change (I am)
Outro (Gotti talking')
Hands in da air
You know I speak fa all real nighas around the world
Nigha we fall we get back up
We make mistakes we make up nigha

Jumped out da rental car and now you had to leave it there.

Said I ain't raising no pussies I got one daughter nigga

Asked me where you at and I wouldn't talk to niggas

Shout out my Auntie Janet she a muthafucka
PeeWee did 10 back out and she still hustling
[?] used to write you letters tell you that she love you
Then we used to drive to visit you up in Kentucky
Like we went from being rich that shit was super ugly
Then my momma got a job man she selling groceries
Used to have a house in Vegas when we was doing good
And a house behind Elvis now we in the hood
Used to have a Benz now we got a Nissan Sentra
And I can't get a pair of Jordans that's fucking with my mental
I'm just tryna let you visualize what I done been through
And this shit public record nigga you could check my credentials
Facts

I switched the family hustle put us back on top
Momma live on 5 acres brother, in that drop
Sister she an entrepreneur get her own M's
Feds still watch the family but we don't even see 'em
I ain't tripping nigga this the art of hustle home
I went from flipping dope to buying houses, flipping homes
Momma taught me fuck your losses just keep moving on
If you get caught just never snitch one day you coming home
Momma, gave me the game and for Mother's Day, I spent a million and a half for you at Prive
And you the owner, I'm a worker, this shit yours do what you wanna you deserve it
Momma

I grew 'round hustlers that turned me to a hustler
Was raised by a woman I watched my momma hustle
I just want to be a kingpin, when I grow up
Teacher asked me what my momma do, she a queenpin
And this my family tradition
I'm just keeping on my family tradition
We built a legacy
And when I grow up I want to be a kingpin, I remember sayin'
Teacher asked me what my momma do, she a queenpin"

And the watch face blue likes a New York giant
And no commercial trapping homie when I take my trips
Ya chick shops at the mall mines own her kicks
See these other niggas doing it but not like me

The coupe looks delicious the rims are waving bye

Cologne Kush and Henny, I'm gone in that Hemi
I'm gold but you don't hear me, four to the dome if you can hear me
They say I need a pull-up when I pull up I'm the shit man
When I grow up I wanna be like t-pain a hit man
But do yourself a favor partna don't be talkin' shit man
Your broad done up and broke your heart my whole squad hit man
Hold up I see dead people, its just the dead white guys on my bread people

I'm high as the moon and I'm flyer than a mosquito
Stacking my chips I got a bank full of Doritos
I'm too cool for school so I'm teaching a class
Chiefin' on that purple rain partna puff puff pass
See im higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream
Rolling off of mac Dre leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh so clean exhale sticky green
I got the top steady droppin' like record sales
Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite
I'm so high

[Chorus]

I believe I can lean spite and codeine
Someones sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt fire it up lets get high
You can call me g5 cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile cuz I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin' with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? dont you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

Fly fly fly

The teacher asked me what I wanted to be
I stood in front of the whole class and I told her I wanted to be a gangsta

[Hook: K. Michelle (Yo Gotti)]
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty (It’s my city nigga)
And you don’t have to travel to another world
Cause there’s a war zone in my city (It’s a war zone out here)
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me (Ever)
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes, my city make me a real hustler
(True hustler)

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
First Three Six break up, and every day I wake up
A nigga got a problem with me
I got a hundred clips, a hundred guns, a hood full of killers
And I dare something could happen to me
See my city at a different state, its no honor
We used to have to make it through the year now it's the summer
And everybody mob somthin’, everybody rob somethin’
Everybody scrap and everybody shot somethin’
Young niggas like ISIS
Killin’ like they got a license
Life used to be priceless now it’s worthless
Niggas gone on missions ain’t even worth it
Homie chill (chill)
Lil homie chill (chill)
Lil homie don’t respect the big homies no more
Drakos and choppers, no more handguns no more
Four deep, four hundred shots, everybody under 16
I remember I was getting’ bricks for the 16
The city changed nigga

[Hook: K. Michelle]
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty
And you don’t have to travel to another world
Cause there’s a war zone in my city
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes my city make me a real hustler

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
You know it’s rules and regulations when you king of the city
And niggas comin’ for the throne, some niggas don’t make it home
Ain’t talkin’ that rap shit, I’m speaking about real beef
Where big homies can get wet and niggas can’t get sleep
Put a 10 on a nigga, fuck that put a 50
Make his friend do the nigga, this Memphis, Ten, nigga
Home of the poverty, home of the robberies
I be goin’ through some real shit like nigga don’t you bother me
It’s goin’ down in the DM
Nah nigga it’s goin’ down when I see him
Biggest record of my career, I’m becomin’ a star
And I’m shootin’ an AR out the car
Just look at your favorite rapper
Just be patient, he gon’ fuck up, he a Memphis nigga
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t, thuggin’ in a nigga
Money don’t change that, fame can’t change that
I’ve done shit to niggas in the streets I can’t take back
So every second of my life I got a gun and I hate that
But this Memphis, if you get caught without you gon’ regret that
So fuck it

[Hook: K. Michelle]
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty
And you don’t have to travel to a foreign land
Cause there’s a war zone in my city
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me

Neighborhood supa stars
It's them boys with the candy sprayed on their cars [x4]

Bitch you might not know me, but in my hood I'm famous
I fuck the baddest bitches and hang with all the gangsters
My SLABs is the meanest, my jewelery is the best
You think I get close, freak, cause everyday I'm fresh
And everybody know me, from young to the old
Everywhere I go, they're like ""Thugga, boy, you cold""
They love to see me hit the club and ball out of control
Pop the bottle after bottle til I fall out on the floor
Surrounded by dro clouds, they be like ""No smokin""
I laugh at their bitch ass like ""Ho, stop jokin""
Keep some candy on them rims, that's pokin
And everytime I hit the board I leave that ho broken
Thug Boss, bitch

[Chorus]


I'm a legend in my neighborhood
Plus I'm connected and respected of in every hood
Chrome on chrome, twenty racks under my
You see my name in that bitch, so get that understood
I'm an outer space star, bitch I'm up in Mars
And if you wanna talk money, I got all type of cards
Just know I meant it, if I said it, nobody in my family got credit
And if you got a million, I bet it
Nigga, pockets on fredit, broken niggas talkin loud
In the club, but that bitch you
My jewelery too loud, my cars from overseas
You tryin to book a show, that gon cost a couple ki's
Cause, bitch, I'm Yo Gotti

[Chorus]

Yeah, long money til I flatline
We tryin to spend some cash, hit me on my batline
I swear rappin 'bout my last grind
Got me on a money marathon with no halftime
When we hit the club, we walk 
You can come inside with us, if your ass fly
Get cash, I cash ride
I'm beatin all the competition by landslide
Neighborhood supa star in my swag high
Take a nigga bitch, put him on stand by
And if he ever ask me hold my head high
I'ma take a stand and tell a god damn lie

With the money and the fame, through the sun and the rain
Nigga I never changed
They tell me that it's all a game
Camera in my face, young nigga its still the same
I never changed, I never, I never changed
I never changed, I never changed, I never changed

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I seen OGs turned to haters
Lost respect I had for 'em off of paper
If money change niggas, why I still 100?
I ain't runnin' from no problem, if you want it run it
Dr. Dre beats, street shits in my headphones
Nigga if you a rat you dead wrong
And your momma should be ashamed of the ground you walk on
The phone tap, watch the devices you talk on
Ride foreign, think about the times I walked home
We talkin' change on change
Cause I been gettin' money, I got this shit out the game
Six figure nigga sit in, bricks for the fit in
Money under the soul of the joints, crackin' my jizz-eans
Born hustle, genetic, yea shit in my gizz-enes
With these eyes here, you can only imagine what I've seen
Baby momma turned enemy, home boy befriending me
Own cousin upped that strap on me full of that Hennessy, damn

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
I still wake up with them cold sweats
Real street nigga, did more and spoke less
Oh yea, pull up, haters looking so stressed
I get money, don't boast and don't flex
Been there and done that, streets I come from that
Been gone for a minute nigga, don't call it a comeback
A lot of niggas doubted me, hated and had it out for me
Grandpa would be proud of me, pray to God for my balcony
Fuck all the competitors you characters ain't scarin' us
I see you plottin' homeboy but I'm way ahead of ya
I got my cheddar up, haters don't know how to take it
Well I don't know how to fake it, sick like fuckin' doctor patients
Used to clock out the vacant, stash the Glock by the basement
Still get them pounds in, I need to watch what I be sayin'
Cause niggas snitchin', pointin' fingers it was them
Officer the only pounds I move are in the gym
You feel me?

Bad credit, cash it out, fresh up off the lot
No back and forth, yippin', yappin', niggas gettin' shot
10 million, 20 acres, that's the new spot
Flooded out my crib and told my dealer you the illest
Renegotiate my contract, told my label I ain'tt feel it

Broke up with my bitch 'cause she was too much in her feelings
I may fuck her friend, fuck it, I may fuck her friend
Between me and you, I always wanted to fuck her friend

Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it
Couldn't though, why? cuz I owed the nigga for it
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda
I remember this shit like it was yesterday
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go

Forgive me for my sins, once and once again

Remember me coca'ina you like my best friend,
When I was down and fucked up you got my ass in

Far as I remember my nigga my life is full of pain,
I posted up in the snow I stood out in the rain

I laid that white on the table I watch em catch a drain,
I knew right then right there that I would never live the same

I'm like a bird myself nigga wrap me up and move me,
I got a stamp in the middle the whole hood approve me

But you can't break me down (down) you gotta sell me whole (whole),
It's a drought on real niggas you already know

I'm that ether nigga that fish scale,
You that oil base homie you don't cook well

I'm yo gotti the king and I got that young cash,
New money in a muthafuckin dufflebag

All hundreds in a sour creme ruffles bag,
Young money bitch I keep a couple hundred stashed

Coca'ina heavily cooking dope excessively,
Heavy risk activity my god given ability

Hid the bricks in the 6 wait 'til they get low to downtown, charleston, sc
Shawtys start a lotta problems let her start it off wit bricks

Gucci mane the dope boy point me where the jays at,
Heres a 50 slab watch my'74 to payday

Shawty want some hardball baby want some powder,
I'm so high I see stone mountain

Gucci got da birds I aint talkin bout da falcons,
Gucci slangin birds also known as a dragon

Hundred pounds of midgrade stash that in my magnum,
Roll it to the country then them country boys I tax them

Gucci mane bastard cook dat dope faster,
Make that dope stretch like a 80 inch plasma

Coke skank dope skank smokin on my airplane,
80 in the air man bricks over here mane

Yeah, I never thought I would be ridin dirty on i-10 just reup and flip again,
Rent a car from enterprise license proof of insurance

Speed limit 65 so I'm goin 62,
Both hands on the steering wheel drivin like a old lady do

Crackers pull me over they aint got shit gotta let me dip,
Purple haze is all I smoke but she couldn't make it on this trip

Usaully keep a pistol too one in the chamber clip full,
Not today on i-10 it's nothing but me and redbull

Collared shirt brown slacks lookin like a business man,
Bible on the passenger side yeah I'm a christian man

Yeah I pray to god let me get these bricks back lord,
Please don't let these crackers try to search this lil ol' honda accord.

Shit I'm wide awake, I aint sleepy so I aint gon swerve
Told you I like the traffic when it rain I call em thunderbirds

Man, what happened to the real niggaz
They in the feds, they gone, I put my life in this song
Man, what happened to my real niggaz
Homie, just feel my pain, this shit gon' drive me insane
I wrote this hear for all my real niggaz
Man, what happened to the real niggaz

You a real nigga, what happened homie
Heard you running with the enemy, you tripping homie
You ain't raised like that, that ain't your background
You got a little money with niggaz, that's how you act now?
Streets a motherfucker
Not to mention, niggaz treat you like my blood brother
But once you cross that line, you gotta stay there
And if you playing both sides, know you got to lay there
Damn, pissed me off, and no more playing fair
Hundred bands and guns, that's what I call warfare
Ain't nobody safe, any nigga get it
Don't call my phone, ain't shit to talk about, you know you did this

Man, what happened to my real niggaz
Man, what happened to the real niggaz
They in the feds, they gone, I put my life in this song
Man, what happened to my real niggaz
Homie, just feel my pain, this shit gon' drive me insane
I wrote this hear for all my real niggaz
Man, what happened to the real niggaz

Once upon a time you was a real nigga
But now you disloyal, you just a field nigga
What type of nigga your nigga brought from the other side
We don't shake hands with the enemies, we do homicides
It's Ridgecrest mafia for life, and fuck the other side
You never see me say a word, you just see gun fire
Cause gangsters don't talk, and drama don't slide
One thing I hate the most, a nigga playing both sides
Just know you don't slide, get his ass from both sides
Make him scream, oh lord, like he in church getting baptized
I'm on my fuck the world, don't really fuck with me
My young niggaz, that's all I got, this other shit ain't nothing to me
Old ass niggaz better sit down
Pussy ass niggaz better get down
I need a ? C.M.G. The motherfucking squad
Any nigga round me best sound hard
Nigga best be squad, down to do their time, to catch a charge
This a family nigga, and you must play your part
Now they say I'm crazy cause I go to war with the whole city
But fuck nigga, I give these hoes the business
And I put that on me, I ain't never give no statement
I ain't never copped no plea
I let money fight my cases, I get money and I go hard
I let haters do the hating
When you pussies ready to face me, I be right here just waiting
Matter fact I'm getting patient
Sipping on that hen' getting wasted
I'ma catch a murder one and I can taste it
How you get so far, then go back to the basis
I built up Gucci and Boosie, some of this shit you just can't shake it
Some of this shit, you gotta embrace it
Some of these problems, you gotta erase it
So I keep ? Fuck their bitches till I run these niggaz crazy
Niggaz ain't real anyway
We the G in gangster, you the G in gay, pussy"

Styles P, you know I get high

Dam, life against the odds
Finally got a plug, lost the feds, he got robbed
Damn, since I been running with the mob
Ain't nun but drive by's, homicides and shooting up niggas cars
Whats the point of being a street nigga kicking with the stars
Though the niggas that you really loved locked behind bars
I was hustling in the day, pulling moves in the dark
Nigga ya ain't even got a clue 'bout me, I swear to God
They say I'm real and they say I'm humble
Get money out the hood where I'm most comfortable
Play with me and Imma go bucks
Shot a video in the middle of Yonkers
Real niggas, what's up?

[Jadakiss talking:]
Know my pops from Memphis
I use to got out there every summer as a kid, know what I mean?
Ride around listening to the O'Jays and shit

Only thing I ask Pools to do is loop the beat again

See you at the cross roads that's if we ever meet again
School never lets out, a lot of shit you never know
Sitting on the motherload these niggas telling tho
Fell back I can't be around y'all haters
Praying for my downfall, downfall prayers
Then you wonder why I be around ball players
Cause these niggas doing the Feds small favors
Yeah, I survived in the trenches
I reside where the strength is, salute North Memphis

They hollering D-Block on these blocks
10 pounds of mid green in my weed spot

Got on a seat belt watching for speed clocks
You see a road block you know you gotta detour
35 in the drought for a kilo
I'm getting money on the east shout to B-more
Get these haters out my view so I can see more
Clearly, it clearly niggas is not the one they say they is
Its clearly that they not bout that life they say they live
Ian not a trap rapping nigga I speak real life
I just beat a case I was facing 10 to life
I'm a multimillionaire if I die tonight
Five off this rap shit, and one off the white
Me an Kiss did some epic shit
And to you fuck niggas this some disrespectful shit

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yo, they hollering CMG, when they see them G's
Cause they see them pounds and they see them keys
And they see this ice and they see these V's
But the shooters squeeze on S.I.T.E
I use to dream on having one key of that white
Now I got a whole trailer you can see them tonight
If he try some funny I got two Glocks for'em
My man's 'bout to come home I got a shoe box for him
Youngin' told me he thuggin' I played some 2Pac for him
Then I gave him some work and got a new block for him
Then they hate when you get it so say that you frontin'
Fuck niggas, die slow, ion owe nobody nothing
Few things that I love that's my weapons and plug
On a graveyard shift tears sweating to blood, what?
Me and Gotti and some hood shit
Ah migos just hit me said he got some good shit
Ha-ha"

Old school throw back Memphis sho-bo
Lorenzo jersey to hide the 4-O

Zaca flesh shake up the block, that's worth a hundred grand
Put that voodoo on you niggas so that gun'll jam
You know them niggas killers how they name ring
You know them niggas winners how they chain swing
All the bitches sellin' pussy charge the same thing
Richest nigga in the hood, we call him Rain Man

I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen

A nigga a motherfucking brand
Like What a nigga stand on
Nigga gone die on that shit because
Niggas turn up for that shit
These Niggas in the streets don't understand
What a Nigga talkin about
This shit more than music nigga
This shit a lifestyle
You got Niggas in the fed Niggas in the graveyard behind this shit


[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
L.A. Reid put the building on me
I Am surprised a nigga fucked up the streets
They tryin to say that I'm the underdog
But really they talking money I'm not under y'all
I dropped the record with cole
And they like woah he can rap
They put my shit on a blog Site like gotti Just snapped
And I'm like fuck wrong with these Niggas I been in the trap
And I been rapping the same since I first got on the map
I guess these industry Niggas don't pay attention to content
Because I come from the Hood they think I'm talking that nonsense
Bitch I was struggling my life sacrifice for my family
Selling dope pulling plays everyday gambling
Fuck a Grammy Fuck any award I want money boy
?door brand new rolls Royce no tonka toy
Rollie watches for the whole team
They like trophies
Realest shit you ever seen
Do you know this nigga
Bought my Nigga a stingray and my Nigga an Ashton
Them the same Niggas that was with me bringing them bricks I carried
I motivate Niggas I don't talk down on Niggas
I put on all my Niggas holding down all my niggas
My brothers is my Niggas cause we like brothers
We family ride or die for each other



[Verse 2: Wave Chapelle]
I swear that I'd die for this shit ride for this shit
All you Niggas do is lying and shit
I'm king of the jungle I'm lion and shit
You ain't riding the wave then you riding then you lie in a Ditch
I'm sizzling hot like I'm frying some fish
Came from the gutter put on for my click
6 months in the making that shit kinda quick
I rather stand out I ain't trying to fit
Wait and I ain't trying to diss
It's cmg everybody who we better than
Young Ricky but I spit it like a veteran
Working late night like David Letterman
Yea homie witness the takeover
Better get to work cause your breaks over
Too real and you Niggas Just fake soldiers
I'm not high but I rap like I ain't sober
Like I lost my mind I swear to God it's like I lost my mind
They let me loose so it's about that time
You know it's a rap you ever cross that line
I run up my bands through the brackets
Stack so much paper it look like a package
Can't touch my green boy that shit like a cactus
If you don't listen my hitters attack ya
Ride around town with a piece that's attractive
The Park i come from man that shit is Jurassic
Watch em fall down homie ashes to ashes
My money stretch like that shit is elastic
Uh gotti taught you Niggas how to act Right
I'm gone teach you Niggas how to rap Right
All over the world homie I am like a satellite
Niggas wanna feature like What is that price
I spit some shit so cold they like is that ice
They sleeping on me What that nap like
Compare to the greats What I rap like
Jay Z Nas Nigga I'm that nice
Uh and I'm on the frontline
I'm feeling like a warrior Right now
Gotti told me this was more than rap
He told me it was more like a lifestyle
That's it I gotta get it I guess we'll converse after

Fucked the DA on my way here

I seen your comment on my way here
I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentyaga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun cock it back then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sadity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spent three hundred thousand or better that's on all the cars
That Maybach park itself, nigga
That range rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back I'm eating filet mignon
He been .44'ing all year I put the Rollie on
Trapping good all year put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets you gotta keep a drum
Said a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga, I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
I got the clappers, finessers, and the trappers
Before the rap shit, you gotta go dap 'em
Don't forget to look a nigga when they after ya

I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga Hallelujah
I'm grateful and if you diss me then I might shoot ya
Brrr you don't fuck with me the feeling mutual
Fuck you, half these rap niggas owe the jeweler (fuck 'em)
I was selling keys to success
I was coppin' keys outta Texas
New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Real soldiers, young shooters put they heart in it
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients
And the fed's allegations have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy I gotta be grateful
You tryna get that 100 mil I'mma race you
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga
Billboard reporter ""LA Reid just sign a trap nigga""
New York Times read ""Jay Z just signed a trap nigga""
Kitchen like ""it's Thursday, you heard?"" Might bring it back nigga
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest
Gotta be grateful I never break the promise
I know my plug love me, I know my bitch hate me
I heard my hood salty I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault
It's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'mma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
If she ain't fuck the first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial poker face I'm all in
Patek Philippe, the AP, 40 mil I’m all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'
I work so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands (like Future)

Law #1: never underestimate the enemy
See this a very important law
Law 2: if a man show a flaw that mean that flaw really exist
Never take it for granted never
Rule #3: make sure you never break it never sleep where the sack at

[Verse 1:]
I'm the hustler's constitution
Feds giving back time for retribution you snitching that shit excuses
Bang! that's execution and thats my only solution I got from stopping these rat niggas from moving
My life a movie not a short film
Big budget Denzel Washington, Will Smith yeah
Scarface, Al Pacino, Godfather, Marlon Brando
A word to the wise watch your guys niggas snakes in disguise
Meeting bitches off the gram know they living and lying
Cold heart never cried if I did it was blood
Little nigga big pride murder that's what it was and that's law

[Gotti talking]
See if a nigga
See when you got that muthafuckin chip on your shoulder and that big ass pistol and a nigga come playing
You gotta show a nigga you mean business you know what I'm saying

[Verse 2:]
I'm fighting pain, fame, I never want to change
I'm the same still running with the gang
Still down to kill a nigga about something petty like a chain [?]
You a million dollar nigga got to get that in your brain
Now get that in your brain, Bang it’s all about the aim
We savages we all live the same
And it's the art of war nigga like the art of hustle nigga
They looking for the goonies but Im the muscle nigga
Ima shooter like Durant
I got heart like Russell nigga
I lost a million to the plug I never trust another nigga
What if I sell a million records will that change the code
Will my niggas try to betray me cause I know they vultures
Will LA Reid see my vision, let me see them wrong [?]
Create me a better way to put my people on
Will my baby mama finally quit texting my phone
Kiss my daughter and my son tell em I'm coming home
Tell my niggas put the pistols down I'm in the zone
I been dropping nothing but gangsta shit on every song
This that shit they been waiting for forever long
They gave my patna 30 years for talking on the phone
I had to watch his mama cry and tell her let's be strong
Ima hold him down he won't do all that time alone
What if I wasn't a rapper the streets would get annoyed
Cause don't nobody tell it how I tell it and you know it
What if they say I changed cause I went outside the box
What's good I kept my plug number so I can get some blocks
18 wheeler full of cocaine I'm talking lots of dope
Not believing Mexican plugs fuck a horoscope
If you a star where your telescope
These niggas high they on hella dope
Your favorite rapper hella broke
Cars leases they got hella notes
Houses rented got eviction notes and everybody already know
You fabricated and I'm factionated
You sold a million records I got millions of dollars
Who really made it huh"

How to hustle nigga

Glock .40, Smith & Wesson nigga
Streets will never ever stop testing niggas
Youngin' give 'em a head shot, send a message nigga
Part rapper, part goon, still finessing nigga

And it's fuck em kill em all if they don't fuck with us
Them three letters mean a lot boy, sacrifices
Cocaine Mafia, double check the prices

Niggas crossing over like they Allen Iverson
Fuck that iPhone 6, they be tracking niggas
I'm about to get a beeper, fade to black on niggas
Gotti, goodnight, I'm gone
I be back when they quit living through phones
When niggas put the gram down and pick the grams up
You got follows but no dollars man that shit ain't adding up
Nah, and all the dirt I done, all the bricks I sold
I can't sleep at night, paranoid it shows
I be strapped on stage, fuck the award show
'Cause I shoot this bitch up and only God knows

I keep fighting doing this for y'all.
Every time I get somethin' in the mail
Whether it's strapable or not from the courts
I keep putting it down because y'all my motivation.
I appreciate the love

And they kill a family member for that envelope
I'm the Lionel Richie to these Commodores
We flip pies to franchising Dominoes
I speak for dope boys every track I'm on
Until this day my people never rat or told
Posted 20 in, I'm talking fed pen
The line between us both have gained so very thin
Amongst my boys of W.E.B. Du Bois
Souls of black folk to hustle wasn't a choice
Rap game everybody skimming off the top
Fuck interest as long as you pull it off the lock
Hoes wanna fuck, haters wanna hate
Certified sack boy, black Ronald Reagan
Double M no longer that Buick Regal money
Nickel bag niggas so don't make me put a kilo on it
Negotiating for it or either we take it
Niggas even shooting choppers in a fuckin' cadence
Fell out with some people that I still love
I guess that's how it goes when it's real blood
I remember counting cash standing in the trap
I turned my hat to the back, had a hundred stacks
60 m's later and 300 tax
Still losing weight with the south on my back, nigga

I pray you play by the rules
I came so close the edge

I pray you play by the rules
I came so close the edge

I pray you play by the rules
We came so close the edge

These tears I cry sure won't be the last (Ayy, rest in peace to Nip)
They will not be the last, no (Ayy, the album was done, I had to go back in on this shit)
'Cause this pain inside (See, I feel even more trapped)
It never seems to pass me, I said it never seems to pass me by
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Where'd we start off? How'd we go wrong?
Niggas risk it all to put a nigga name in his song
Niggas fighting over blocks that we don't even own
Leave the house to get a bag and never make it back home
Bulletproof truck, I'm full time rapping
I wasn't living like this when I was still trapping
Son seen me shed a tear, he like, ""Daddy, what happened?""
I'm like, ""Daddy aight, but Daddy don't know what's gon' happen""
Niggas rapping gangster lyrics and thinkin' it's cool
'Til you the suspect or victim they post on the news
So the dope that you selling the dope that you use
Y'all made poppin' pills cool, you niggas confused
I'm a true independent, you niggas should listen
Whether record label or not, I was investing my millions
I spent millions on my artists and did it consistently
If it ain't real boss talk, nigga, watch how you mention me
Real estate, got a check, twenty mil on that
Thirty in the bank, I'm fifty off, I'm still at that
I seen a hundred bricks, I had a hundred Dracos with a hundred shots
But 'til I see that hundred mil', I ain't really did nothing, nigga
I ain't impressed by a killer
I'm impressed by a hustler who's taking care of his mother and his brother
And his significant other
Put his niggas in position to show 'em he love 'em

[Interlude]
'Cause this pain inside (Ayy, you know I just moved to la, right?)
It never seems to pass me, I said it never seems to pass me by (So I had to ride down Crenshaw just to see it for myself, damn)
So I thank you, said I thank you (Just got a call back home too, said shit ain't lookin' good)
Said I thank you (Just life)
For makin' me a woman, oh

[Verse 2]
I just paid eight mil' to the irs
I don't agree, but then again you can say I'm blessed
Late night, no sleep, you can say I'm stressed
Bruh called, say he fighting for his life, say less
Quarter mil' to the lawyer, straight cash, no check
Never lied to my niggas, I'ma stand on that
I done cried to my niggas (Cried to my niggas)
'Cause real brothers really love each other and nobody threats
I just went to Jay house, got hit with reality
I got a long way to go, for real, this shit baffling
Ninety mil' on a crib and he not an athlete
If I don't make it for my family, this shit gon' be a tragedy
I'm tryna live life and make sure they proud of me
I give no energy to critics or niggas who doubted me
I'm a black-owned business owner, entrepreneur
We all from the gutter, from the mud, from the sewer
Send a text to Meek (Yeah), told him move safe (Safe)
Send a text to Youngsta (Youngsta), I'm checking on your case
Send a text to Bagg (Bagg), boy, you're on your way (You're outta here)
Don't get caught up in these streets, you one hit away
I sat down with Bloc (What up?), told him, ""You're young, but you gotta take this shit serious"" (You gotta)
Life 'bout more than guns, hoes, and a lot of jewelry (For real)
I just hope that they hearin' me, I love these niggas dearly
They like, ""Gotti, you changed,"" yeah, I call it maturity
I gotta get to the bag, and these labels be fearing me
Five million in watches and no stones in the jewelry
Fn on me, nigga, I'm securing security
I'm tryna get a hundred mil', fuck facing a jury

[Outro]
(Said I thank you)
See, niggas think all this lil' shit you doing cool (Said I thank you, for makin' me a)
'Til it's you versus the motherfuckin' federal government, nigga
Then what? (Said I thank you)
Then what you lil' niggas gon' do? (Said I thank you)
Start telling every motherfuckin' thing you know, huh?
That ain't a real nigga, that ain't no gangster shit
All these niggas on Instagram posting they motherfuckin' business and shit
Draco this, big sack that
And they gon' be the first nigga to rat on a nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
Whole social media shit the police, nigga
When you niggas gon' wake up, nigga?
Nineteen, nigga still tellin' on himself
Where they do that it?
This rich gangster shit forever
Fft, let me hear that

They will not be the last, no)"
Yo Gotti,Wanna Play,/y/yo+gotti/wanna+play_20676425.html,"Tuesday night, I was laid up in the bed
Tired as hell, I'm hearing voices in my head
Heard some knocks, grabbed my tone, ran to the doe (door)
Screamed, ""Who is it?"", but I ain't hear that shit no mo'
Cocked my nine
I went to peekin' out the blinds
Thought it was fine
But at a unexpected time
The doe (door) flew in, I got a two-story home
Seen 'em comin' wit they face masks on
Bust the choppers, down the stairs, they hit the cut
Two of them got away, but the other two got stuck
Hit 'em again
One in the neck, one in the chin
Then called the Law and said I did they ass in

[Hook:]
Ok, you wanna play
You say you know where I stay?
Well, come today
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it
You bitch you
Ok, you wanna play
You say you know where I stay?
Well, come today
Bring yo bad ass on, I'm waitin on ya
I got a K wit a motherfuckin' shank on it
You bitch you

Say whodie, you won't believe what happened to me
A nigga all in my spot, and he askin' for me
See I wouldn't at the spot, but my broad was there
When she hit me on the phone, it's niggas in there
They knocked me off for a bird and my platinum chain
Them niggas from round there, they just doin' they thang
I respect the game
But they got to respect it, I aint no hoe ass nigga
I'm gone take car my business
Next day, broad-daylight, rode the track
The first nigga looked suspicious had to get in the back

[Talking]

Bitch, we ain't straight no mo'
Hoe we used to have fun, we don't play no mo'
Them niggas that you run wit, they kicked in my doe
So I'm gone shoot you in yo face if you don't cough up that dope, bitch

[Hook:]

This situation is a cold thang
I got to explain
Cause nigga this a cold game
I was keeping my pounds at a spot in Raleigh
But I was moving them thangs, like they was hot tamales
Well, hot tamales, I played the cards I was dealt
Because I knew befo' long that they'll hang they self
I ain't no fool
Nigga that's why I play it cool
I know the shit you will and won't try to do
But what you came in wit, that's what you left wit (Ahh haa)
Because I'm three steps ahead, it's like you brainless
I been fuckin' wit money, I been having birds
I disassociated my self from bad nerves
Cause once you under pressure, you'll bust trick
And you the type of nigga that I can't trust bitch
And the nigga that went, you just a send-out
I tried to kill yo hoe ass, but you went out, the window, bitch

Shhhhhit, I don't know, guess the same old bullshit, Fed's said dp got caught with half a brick, that damn near stopped my heart, cause me and knowing my brother I'm thinking this shit hard, but luckilly it was soft and fortunately he was straight, we're findin' to take it to trial, but went on sign for eight, mama we're gon' be straight, li'l sister we're gon' be cool, I know that my brother strong, so I did what I had to do

Chorus:
Mama we're gon' be aiiiiight,
He gon' be okay,
Shit, I didn't know but I was walkin' on faith,
Li'l sister we're gon' be aiiight, he gon' be okay,
Got me a brick and started moving that weight

His sister taking it bad, mama trying to be strong, couple calendar years, I never shedded a tear, wrote him a couple letters to tell him I'm doin' better, told him I took his Chevy and put the shit back together, told him I'm gettin' money, I counted a hundred g's, told me to slow it down, play the shit low-key, told me to make it happen, focus more on rappin', cause fuckin' round in these streets that anything can happen, told me I had heart, plus he knew I was smart, the only thing that'd break his heart is if I fuck around and catch a charge, told me to watch my sister and never let mama suffer, and do what I had to do to overcome the struggles

Chorus x2

Finally made parol, they think he gon' change his life, I axed him what he gon' do, he said he's gon' walk light, it wasn't a year later, he smokin' behind tint, half an ounce of the reddy rock, mane they got his ass again, judge gave him a bond, now he out on the run with that fuck the world attitude, still totin' a gun, still havin' his fun, we clubbin' it on the weekend, had conversations bout going to turn himself in, wanted to raise his son, gon' get the shit behind him, plus he knew it's only so long before they find him, lawyer was talking good, say he gon' get three, when the prosecuter quit yellin' they gave my brother eleven, my mama damn near fainter, my brother didn't want to accept it, the hardest part for me, I couldn't do nothing to help it, rap shit paid off, now we all on tv, my brother say he good, he finally feel free

Yo Gotti,What Happened,/y/yo+gotti/what+happened_21465643.html,"We was just playin' in the ave the other day
I never thought I'd be makin' this song
Shit crazy, but look
I don't even know where to start but

When I first met you, all you talked about was Wu-Tang movement
Then I introduced you to this Cocaine Muzik
And every other day you expressed your love for Ray
And your love for Ye then we used to debate
'Bout how your partners in the industry thought I still sold yay
We were both geeked up by doin' the deal with Jay
I got my first number one and you was on the run with me
Never want to leave the country if I can't take my gun with me
You weren't with the gangster shit but yet you still hung with me
Next time I go to Disney, I'm a take your son with me
First we went to London, then we went to Dubai
You was off the Hen, I was smokin', I got too high
Damn, time flies by

It's like I knew your whole lifetime, my nigga
We accomplished so much shit
We talked about so much shit
We done so much shit, like
You know me, I'm a stubborn motherfucker
Like, I ain't listen to nobody, like
I'm just movin' how I'm movin' and like
You were  just the nigga always could get through to me
I don't even know like, how you was able to do it like
Like when the whole shit about
They were tryna get me to go overseas for years and years
And I ain't give a fuck how my money was, I just
I wasn't movin' like that 'cause
All my niggas convicted felons
I couldn't get the straps across the motherfuckin' customs
I just can't move like that bro, you know what I mean?
And I remember like Civi or Rome callin' me late at night like
""You really need to do this for your career, this made it
Be on the biggest record in Europe right now""
And I'm still like, ""Fuck it"", you know what I mean like? I wasn't even trippin'
And you're like, ""Bro we gotta go, man, we gotta go international, we gotta""
I'm like, ""Man look bruh, I ain't fuckin' with it bruh, now dead on that"" you know what I'm sayin'?
I called you back that same night like, ""We goin' to London""

We used to walk inside the office give them people hell
I knew you was loyal when your partner went to jail
You never missed a court date, you stayed on the lawyer
And I know P. Mims gonna miss you he was really for you
Use to tell me to my face when I would bull of shit
I ain't tryin' to win, I'll do some other shit
I respect you for that more than you'll ever know
I had issues with niggas, you told me, ""Let it go""
You helped me realize I was bigger than just a street nigga
Took your advice, got security but I still keep my pistols though, yeah
Took your advice, got security but I still keep them pistols though

See like, I remember we could go back and back and forth about
Man you get too much money to be like
Ridin' round with all these crazy ass guns and
I understand them young niggas and
I understand y'all come from a certain life
But if you wanna go to that next level like
You gotta act like it
I ain't gon' lie, like that shit just go in one ear and out the other ear
'Cause I'm just from that culture homie
Like where I just don't see nobody protectin' me like me
These young niggas with me gon' die with me bruh, like
I'm a die with them and this understood so
I just always felt like that's that security, we our own security

You told me youngsta' a superstar but that nigga crazy
I introduced you to Bag, you say he's amazin'
We both done fucked up 'bout Snootie, we had a plan for him
We know he had his little issue but we were prayin' for him
I remember you called me excited, sayin' you had talked to Ye
I can't lie, I was geeked, I'm like, ""What he say?""

You was on some shit like, ""My guys, they wanna work with you""
I ain't even gonna front, like, you had told me all the Ye stories and shit
And we had been working together like probably a year and a half now like
I was like, ""Man, I don't really know if you fuck with Ye like that""
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm just bein' G
And you like, ""No for real, like he wanna work with you""
I'm like ""When?""
You're like, ""Tomorrow""
Nigga shit was so crazy 'cause you know I don't even like flyin'
Like, nigga, I would jump on a motherfuckin' Southwest flight
Like nigga sittin' way in the back
Me, I don't give a fuck nigga like
We was on a first thing smokin' nigga to LA
We're gonna work with Kanye
That shit was crazy
We walked into the studio and nigga was eatin' pot pie and chicken and shit
He was just a cool aired nigga like I just
Immediately screamin' and droppin' joint after joint, after joint, after joint
And I ain't give a fuck was it was gon' be on
If it was gon' be on anything, and it was just
I always wanted to work with Ye and you knew it
It was crazy

Now I told you I want to sign with Jay and you asked me why
You didn't really feel this shit but you was down to ride
Then we went up to the office you had a different view
And you were rushin' me to sign like the shit was you, crazy

See I always knew Minute was your man and shit 'cause you always talked about him, but
We met TaTa and Shaka there
You remember we sat down in the room with Jay?
And that nigga was just kickin' some real shit to us
We were holdin' out the pose on some G shit though
We see 'em G, you know what I'm sayin'?
We get money too, you feel me?
When we left the office we were like, ""Damn""
I mean, nigga was just amazed at like
Niggas that grew up together and built an empire together
And I was really motivated by that
That day I told you that was how I wanted me and my brothers to be and me and my niggas to be
And then we went to this little private party, remember that shit?
Jay got to them to pop the Ace in it, that shit spilled all on the table and shit
I remember you pulled me to the side
You were like, ""I've been in the game a long time, this is 
Like the very, very first time I've felt like an artist""
You were tellin' me like you felt like an artist, you were like, 
""Nigga I'll sign the contract right now if they break that motherfucker out""

Damn, if I knew talkin' to you was my last time
The other night it wouldn't have been about no CM9
I would have let you know I value your participation
And would have thanked you for your patience and your conversations
No you weren't forced to question God, and you were somewhere better
But we were supposed to get rich and gon' retire together, what happened?

I don't know
How can I go on?
Continue to stay strong
Continue to pray hard
Keep singing your name on
And we're gonna just record
It was many nights like this
When I could call you
And you could pick the phone up
'Cause you was my partner
And you was there for number one records
Believed in dreams and all of my visions
And I can't thank you enough"

Been through alot of shit with the same clique of niggas
You don't see him round then the nigga wasn't wit us, (Fuck It)
Or he was wit us till he did some foul shit
Look this lawyer ass nigga, put him on the bench

When he put you in the game
Stupid ass...

When Philippines was discovered by Magellan
They were sailing day and night across the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island

Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the shore
They did not understand the speaking they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray man

When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very happy
All people were baptized and built the church of Christ
And that's the beginning of our Catholic life

When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
And drive Magellan to go back home

Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
'Mactan island we could not grab
'Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard'

Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

Oh, mother mother I am sick
Call the doctor very quick
Doctor, doctor shall I die?
Tell my mama do not cry
Tell my mama do not cry
Tell my mama do not cry

That's the end of Magellan
In the island of Mactan long time ago

Was it just a dream?
I know, yes, I know,
It seemed so very real,
It seemed so real to me.

Took a walk down the street,
To the heat whispered trees,
I thought I could hear, hear, hear, hear,
Somebody call out my name, (john)
As it started to rain, (john)
Two spirits dancing so strange.

Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse,
Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse,
Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse.

Dream, dream away, magic in the air,
Was magic in the air.
I believe, yes, I believe,
More I cannot say,
What more can I say?

On the river of sound,
Thru the merry go round, round,
I thought I could feel, feel, feel, feel,
Music touching my soul,
Something warm, sudden cold,
The spirit dance was unfolding.

Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse,
Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse,
Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse.

Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse,
Ah! b?wakawa pousse, pousse,

Only thing she was good at
Was telling stories of faraway lands.

There was a guy who couldn't say,
Who couldn't say what he wanted.
Only thing he was good at
Was cracking jokes to make people laugh.

So many words he swallowed,
So many thoughts she kept to herself.
And when they met they made love
And talked about the world and the weather.

So many cities he walked,
So many countries she traveled.
And in their dreams they would listen
To the sound of the sea they heard together."

Faded like the moon at dawn.

When I was young I thought I was facing
A very aware world ahead,
I didn't know it was going to be
Beware of dogs instead.

I said no, I said no, I said no,
I said no a million times to no.
But the yes that was in its last breath
Still hovered in a room with a permanent flu.

When I was young I didn't know
That one can only read life in braille,
I was still struggling to catch life on its tail.

I said why, I said why, I said why,
I asked why for the billionth time.
And my bone slowly lost its moist
Like a leftover coke bottle on the street.

Yes, this dry whiteness of a thing on the square,
That's my bone.
It lets the wind pass over like the last tender fraud,
Makes a little noise like old campaign billboard.

I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,
I prayed a thousand times yes.
And the no that was hanging over faded."

Oh, john -
Peace.
Good morning meine damen und herren, this is the peace call.

John: what were really doing is sending out a message to the world, mainly to the
Youth, especially the youth or anybody really that's interested in protesting for
Peace, or protesting against any form of violence and we say everybodys getting a
Bit heavy or bit intellectual about it. everybodys talking about peace, but nobodys
Doing anything about it, except for a few people, and the things are, the grosvenor
Square marches in london. the end product of it was just newspaper stories about
Riots and fightings. and we did the bed event in amsterdam and the bag piece in vienna
Just to give people an idea, that there's many ways of protest and this is one of them.
And anybody could grow their hair for peace or give up a week of their holiday for
Peace or sit in a bag for peace, protest against peace anyway, but peacefully cause we
Think that peace is only got by peaceful methods and that to fight the establishment
With their own weapons is no good, because they always win and theyd been winning
For thousands of years. they know how to play the game violence and it's easier for
Them when they can recognise you and shoot you. they don't know how to handle
Humour, peaceful humour and that's our message really.

Questioner: what do you think was the biggest success in history, about 300 years?

John: haven't a clue.

Yoko: well, maybe it's still yet to happen, you see. that's why were trying to do it. in
Other words, by very, very peaceful methods to bring peace, you know instead of
Peace through violence, that's what were trying to do and if we succeed in that,
That's the biggest happening yet in the last 300 years, because it's never been done and
Nobody has really tried it, you see. and that's what were trying to do.

Questioner: what would you do in case of a war?

John: how do you mean?

Questioner: what would you do immediately if you would wake up in the morning, read the newspapers and they would tell you england is in war with france?

John: I'd die of fright.

Yoko: I don't think that should happen. you talk as if somethings going to happen
Aside of us. we are all in this you see. we are all in the same society and in the same
World and everything that happens to us is our responsibility, you know. like any
Violence going in the world is just a symbol of all the violent atmosphere that is in
The world, you see and when the nazism persecuted the jewish people that wasn't only
Hitler, who did it or germany, who did it, but just a symbol of everybody in the world
Who had the feeling for the persecution of jews, you see. so we share everything, so
That's not gonna happen, if there's war suddenly, that's our fault, you know.

Questioner: so what do you think about the behaviour of austrian and germans during
The second world war? don't you think that they're a little bit more responsible
Than the others?

John: no, not particularly.

Yoko: no, not particularly. no. the whole world, if the whole world was really
Aware of it and if the journalists and the communication media of those days were
Really aware of their responsibility as well and reported everything correct, you
Know, well, which is almost impossible, Im sure, but as much as possible and if the
Whole world was aware of their responsibility, it could have been stopped, Im sure.

John: well, we know that britain and a few other counties waited quite a long time
Before they made any decision about what to do. Im not quite sure of the facts, you
Know, but after czechoslovakia and things like that, they couldve stopped it earlier,
But they waited until it's on the doorstep, you know, until it involves their money,
Their territory.

Questioner: there's a special type of petition that is vetoed by special contents ..

John: no. I don't think so because...

Questioner: hitler could have been voted by the french, for instance.

John: every nation will have a prototype. I think I was out talking to one of the
Austrian tv guys. I said can you name me one european country which hasn't sort of
Raped the world and he said austria actually was the only one that didn't attack
Anybody else. they were always on the defensive side, I don't know whether that's
True.

Qustioner: but they were silent at the wrong moment...

John: okay, that's bad, I agree that silence is bad. but I mean there isn't one european
Country that hasn't had it's hitler in one way or the other, including britain, in what
They did to india and south africa, you know.

Yoko: so lets so back to the future, you know. so that's why were here. we want to
Talk mainly to the young people all over the world, because those are the people
Who are going to be the next generation. they're going to be the next world, you
Know, and we just want to say we are with them. were not preaching or anything like
That. we want to be with them and were with them and in our way, were just
Announcing that were open to all invitations or suggestions or anything to work
For the world peace, you see, and were doing it now, in our own way, which we think is
The best for us and also the young people have to realise that this is just as bad as
Before the second world war or right in the middle of it, you know, that everything,
All the violence that is happening in the world now are our responsibility and if we
Don't really realise it and immediately start something, action, you know, it's going
To be bad, you know. and it will be exactly like you said. one morning, we find in the
Newspaper, find that the whole world is going to disappear, you know.

Questioner: I agree with you, but don't you see, I mean, it's a fact that by through your
Behaviour, I think it's okay, but for a lot of people, through your behaviour, to get
Suspicious. they don't think that this can be correct, people sitting under a
Tablecloth protesting against wars. they don't think...

Yoko: okay, before they criticise us, you know, and if they want to criticise us, okay,
Go ahead, and they should do it in their own way, but do something, you know.

Questioner: so everybody should throw out his part of hitler out of his soul, then?

John: yes, yes, we all have it in us. in a way, were saying we want peace and were
Staying in bed for peace, but Im as violent as the next man, and Im sure yoko is just as
Violent just as well. were violent people, you know. I prefer myself when Im non-
Violent. I prefer me friends when they're non-violent. it just makes for easier living
And if we have to have violence, lets channel it, you know.
I don't know how, you know, there's other people can work out how to channel it, or
Give them somewhere to play and kill each other or something. but I don't want to be
Involved in their violence. I prefer to live in peace, you know.

Yoko: all you need is courage, you know. you can just go out in the street now and
Take off all your clothes and just say peace you know and you'll be in the news you
See. just courage and if everybody gets courage and of course they would,
Because they would think all right maybe this is a little bit embarrassing thing to do,
But look at john and yoko they're doing worse, so I can do it, you know.
That's all were trying to do, you see.

Questioner: so you're putting courage, also, into the world?

John: we hope so.

Yoko: I hope so.

John: okay.

Stay in bed!

John: look there's a fly flitting around. just makes you laugh.

Yoko: what time is it?

John: what's the time?

Yoko: what?

John: 9:30.good morning. I was saying about bagism,you see, you get in this bag and you
Jump out the window. next thing you know, you got a policeman on your head. you want tea?

Yoko: you know what I want, john?

John: what; what, what, what. oh, give us a chance! you want one before I do. yes, our
Name got round a lot. could I have room service, please. do you want toast?

Yoko: just tea. which do you want, coffee or tea?

John: tea.

Yoko: tea.

John: two teas please. yeah, 902 and some toast. yeah, brown toast.
Good morning. yeah, yeah. I know and some toast. brown toast. yeah. thank you. bye, bye.
Alright then....

John: hello, dog. it's beautiful no, no, no. it'll just take a lot of looking after. well
Think about you, amsterdam. it's a lovely dog, huh.

Yoko: yes, it's lovely.

John: thank you very much.

Visitor: here you are.

John: thank you. you gonna take him off me now!

Visitor: yeah, if you don't mind. thank you very much.

John: I thought you were giving

Visitor: bye, bye. bye, bye. no, no.

John: I sort of was under that impression. she gave us the dog and then went away. very nice.

Yoko: it's rather sort of really swinging though. don't you think so?

John: the thought of the long haired beatle in the 19th century sanctuary. please
Stop this nonsense. go home. we don't like people like you. go to a doctor to be
Normal, you get this? go to a doctor to be normal. were seeing a psychiatrist today,
So maybe hell fix us up then. bloody marvellous. we don't get through on some level,
As you notice. was under marijuana. beautiful, beautiful. keep smoking. nothing illegal
Beautiful, beautiful. hey, those kids are as hard as the real press.

Yoko: yes, amazing.

John: amazing. they're just as tough as the real press. very sexy. it's a boy, it's a boy.
Questioner: why are you staying in bed for 7 days?

John: ah, because...

Questioner: well, first of all, let me say congratulations on your marriage and that
In dutch is gefiliciteerd met je getrouw.

John: oh, dank u wel, oh, chocolat!

Questioner: how about explaining this mission you are on at this moment!

John: well, you start...

Yoko: well, because we thought of this idea about staying in bed for 7 days for
Protest against violence in the world.

Questioner: did you think of it's geographical situation as being the centre of europe?

John: no, I didn't realise, is it? oh, fantastic! it was magic then, you see, cause the way...

Questioner: well, they call it the centre of europe. it's an advertising campaign for an
Airline.

John: okay, well give us a free ticket and well be all right.

Various people: stand up! bend over towards us.
Stand up on your knees, maybe. turn up, turn up on your knees.
As soon as we can ......(unhearable) ....but we need you here

John: so, anyway a policeman came in and an elephant jumped on me head, so I said
What's going on and he said cabbages and the next moment I was on film, yeah.
Love, peace and bed!not forgetting jam of course.
Okay, guess now it's over?

Qustioner: are you cold?

John: no, no, no!

Questioner: yeah, music, you know, if you go back to the days of a, of a, lets see, where do we start now, we start with do you love me?

John: not, not particularly.
How about that?

John singing: good bye amsterdam, goodbye.
Stay in bed,
For bed-in,
For peace of the world,
Stay in bed,
Grow your hair.
Grow your hair.
Okay, good night.
Now it's time to say good night,
Good night, sleep tight.
Now the sun puts out his light.

Yoko: what a beautiful day it was though, very tiring, though. it's so turning like
Crazy, you know.

John: you can say that sort of hot?

Yoko: grow your hair.

John: bed peace.

Yoko: hair peace.

John: hair peace, bed peace.

Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken,

We live with no reason, kicked round for no reason,
Thrown out without reason like tools.
We work in a prison and hate in a prison,
And die in a prison as a rule.

When I'm at work, I thank god,
I still have that smile ma used to say lit her day.

But something inside me, something inside me died that day.

People say I'm cool,
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.
Ev'ry day I thank god
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.

When I'm with people, I thank god,
I can talk hip when I'm crying inside.
When I'm with friends, I thank god,
I can light a cigarette when I'm choking inside.

People say I'm cool,
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.
Ev'ry day I thank god
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.

A friend lent me shades
So I could hide my eyes that day.
Was a snowy day,
The shades have seen a lot of things I didn't want to know myself.

Was like an accident, part of growing up,
People tell me.

But something inside me, something inside me died that day.

What do you do-oo? What can you do?
What do you do-oo? What can you do?

The world suddenly looks a strange place,
People seem talking in foreign words.

And something inside me, something inside me died that day.

What do you do-oo? What can you do?
What do you do-oo? What can you do?"

Cars and buses and planes and people go by.
But we dont care, we wanna know,
Wanna know in each others eyes
That hard times are over, over for some time. (yeh!)

Ah -

This is hell in paradise,
We're all asleep or paralyzed.
Why are we scared to verbalize
Our multicolor dreams?

When will we come to realize,
We're all stoned or pacified,
While the boogie men organize
Their multilevel schemes?

Underqualified for love,
Overqualified for life,
Sticking our heads in slime,
Thinking we're in our prime.

Mesmerized by mythology,
Hypnotized by ideology,
Antagonized by reality,
Vandalized by insanity,
Desensitized by fraternity,
Sanitized by policy,
Jeopardized by lunacy.

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh....

This is hell!

Penalized by apathy
And living in the world of fantasy.
Dancing on hot coal, waiting for the last call,
It's adam's ball, eve's call.

Wake up, shake up, check out, work out, speak out,
Reach out, it's time to, time to, time to,
To, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to.

This is hell in paradise,
None of us wish to recognize.
But do we want them to materialize
An endangered species?

Mobilize transition,
With inspiration for life."

Smashing my face in a clear glass window
But instead I went out
And smashed up a phone box round the corner

I never had a chance to choose my own parents
I'd never know why I should be stuck with mine
Mommy's always trying not to eat
And daddy's always smelling like he's pickled in booze

I never had a chance to choose my own name
I'd never know why I should be stuck with mine
Mommy's always talkin' 'bout family pride
And daddy's always hiding 'bout his week-end rides

All day long I felt like
Smashing my face in a clear glass window
But instead I went out
And smashed up a station wagon round the block

I looked at the mirror and told myself,
I'm glad I still don't look like them at least
Mommy's like a film star in a distorted mirror
Daddy's like a guy who lost his stomach in the war

I went to shake hands with the president in miami
I went to a rock show to see mick jagger
And you'd never believe it, surprise to my life
They had paint on their faces just like mommy's

Am I going crazy or is it just you daddy?
Am I going nuts or is it just you mommy?
Am I plain gone or is it the world?
Daddy I'd rather have you dead than crazy

Trying to talk to them is like eating tv dinner when you're angry
Trying to get their love is like watching ice cream ad when you're hungry.
They gave me a watch that's guaranteed not to break
But my mommy and daddy broke up last fall

Am I going crazy or is it just you, daddy?
Am I going nuts or is it just you mommy?
Am I plain gone or is it the world?

Yoko Ono,I Learned To Stutter/coffin Car,/y/yoko+ono/i+learned+to+stuttercoffin+car_20148614.html,"Recorded live 3 june 1973 at the first international feminist conference, harvard university, cambridge, ma.

While john is setting up the amp...
What happened to me was that I was living as an artist and, who had relative freedom
As a woman and was considered the bitch in the society.
Since I met john, I was upgraded into a witch and I was... And I think that that's very flattering.
Anyway, what I learned from being with john is that the society solely treated me as a woman, as a woman who belonged to a man who is one of the most powerful people in our generation, and some of his closest friends told me that probably I should stay in the background, I should shut up, I should give up my work and that way Ill be happy.
And I got those advises, I was luck, I was over thirty and it was too late for me to change,
But still, still, this is one thing I want to say, sisters, because, with the wish that you know
Youre not alone, i... Because the whole society started to attack me and the whole society wished me dead, I started accumulating a tremendous amount of guilt complex and in result of that I started to stutter. And I consider myself a very eloquent woman and also an attractive woman all my life and suddenly, because I was associated to john, that was considered an ugly woman, ugly jap, who took your monument or something away from you.
And that's when I realised how hard it is for woman, if I can start to stutter, being a strong woman and having lived thirty years by then, learn to stutter in three years of being treated as such, it is a very hard road.
Now the next song is called coffin car and this is a song that I observed in myself and also in many sisters who are riding on coffin cars.

Okay

Coffin car, shes riding a coffin car,
She likes to ride a coffin car.
People watching her with tender eyes,
Friends whispering in kindly words,
Children running, waving hands,
Telling each other, how pretty she is.

Coffin car, shes riding a coffin car,
She likes to ride a coffin car.
Friends making ways for the first time,
People throwing kisses for the first time,
Showering flowers, ringing bells,
Telling each other, how nice she is.

Coffin car, she likes to ride a coffin car,
Shes riding a coffin car.
Wives showing tears for the first time,
Husbands taking their hats off for the first time,
Crushing their handkerchiefs, rubbing their nose,
Telling each other, how good she is.

Half the world is dead anyway,
The other half is asleep.
And life is killing her,
Telling her to join the dead.

So evry day, she likes to ride a coffin car,
A flower covered coffin car,
Pretending she was dead.

Coffin car,
A flower covered coffin car,
A flower covered coffin car,
A flower covered coffin car."

I want my love to rest tonight
So he can face the world tomorrow.
I want my love to sleep tonight
So he can deal with tomorrow.

Sisters, don't blame your man to much,
You know hes doing his best.
You know his fear and loneliness,
He can do no more, no less.
He was told by his mothers to never trust girls,
He was told by his fathers to never shed tears.
He sees girls chasing after superstars,
While their men are sitting behind bars.

I want my love to rest tonight
So he can face the world tomorrow.
I want my love to sleep tonight
So he can deal with tomorrow.

Sisters, don't blame our men to much,
We know theyre doing their best.
We know their fear and loneliness,
They can do no more, no less.
They were told by us to get ahead,
Be gentle and tender, yet hard and strong.
Nothing short of a living god,
Nothing short of james bond.

If we all knew that no ones to be ashamed,
But that the society is to be blamed.
We could then come together again
And direct our energies towards changing the world.

Were all blind and crippled mates,
Frustrated would-be presidents of united states.
We don't know how to cope with ourselves,
Or to love our mates for being themselves.

I want my love to rest tonight
So he can face the world tomorrow.
I want my love to sleep tonight
So he can deal with tomorrow."

When I was in a restaurant, talking to my friends,
Watching their mouths move faster and faster.
I thought of the kite that was flying in the sky
And made sure that my hand was holding the string.
That was a long time ago,
Many skies went by since then.
Now my hands stopped holding anything
And I've learnt to take a walk instead.

Then one day in the evening light,
I saw something strange shining bright.
The sky was dark, with swarms of larks,
And in the midst of it all, yes, it was my kite.

How did the kite get there, Ill never know,
Floating away among the clouds to where nobody knows.

I held my gun with both my hands,
Slowly aiming at the shining dot.
The shot went off, the dot blew off,
Since then I've never seen the kite again."

That itll be a good day, a good day for us.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Let me count the ways how I miss you,

Its like that first summer I spent in egypt,
Its like that warm evening you read to me
Both knowing deeply that its a good time,
A good time for us.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Let me count the ways how I see you,
Its like that lake in the mountain you heard about,

Whispering strongly
That youre always there, always for me.

The memory will grow in us
And make you and I a family."

Yoko Ono,Looking Over From My Hotel Window,/y/yoko+ono/looking+over+from+my+hotel+window_20148660.html,"Age 39, looking over from my hotel window,
Blue dots and red dots skating away in the park.
I used to be there twenty years ago,
Huffing over a mug hot chocolate drink.

Age 39, looking over from my hotel wind,
Wondering if one should jump off or go to sleep.
People tell you up is better than down,
But they never tell you which is up and which is down.

Age 39, looking over from my hotel wind,
95 pound bundle but it's trouble when there's nowhere to leave.
People say stardust and golddust are it,
But they never tell you it chokes you just as sawdust do.

Age 39, feeling pretty suicidal,
The weight gets heavier when youve bled thirty years.
Show me your blood, john, and I'll show you mine,
They say it's running even when you're asleep.

No trace of resentment, no trace of regrets,
One bloods thinner but both look red and fresh.
If I ever die, please go to my daughter
And tell her that she used to haunt me in my dreams.
(that's saying a lot for a neurotic like me.)

Age 39, looking over from my hotel window,
Trying to tackle away with heart of clay.
The weight gets lighter when there's nowhere to turn,
Gods little dandruff floating in the air.

Age 39, looking over the world,
Age 39, floating over the world,
Age 39,...mm-mm...floating along."

And I'm watering it evry day.
I watched the late night talk show
And asked the man in a suit
Why he was laughing so when my wife was dead.

He didn't reply,
No, he didn't reply at all.

And buried in our garden.

Through the haze.

But wait! what's this
I see?
Could it be?

Mount elga, mount elga,
A high mountain,
I climb as i'm dreaming, a-huh.
Mount elga, mount elga,
A high mountain,
I climb as i'm dreaming,
Catching me hell.
To climb this hill
The more i try to climb,
I'm slipping still.

Me body run down,
Me feeling weak.
The more i try to climb up
This mountain peak.

Mucho mungo, sweet thing,
Sweetest little thing since sweet sixteen.

C'est la, c'est la, c'est la vie,
Sail across the ocean,
Sail with me."

Yoko Ono,Peter The Dealer,/y/yoko+ono/peter+the+dealer_20148710.html,"We were waiting for peter, the dealer,
He comes in the evening when were fussing in bed.
He says, good morning, heres your breakfast,
And give us plates of stone.
Take a pinta blood each from us to give to the poor.

We count the windows in the cities and tell each other,
Yes, life is a helluva lot of waiting time.

Our minds are objects of constipation,
Our bodies are subject to dissipation.
So keep your intentions in a clear bottle
And leave it in the cupboard when youre out.

We were waiting for peter, the wheeler,
He comes in the morning when were fast asleep.
Gives us a trip that's spending hundred years in a day,
And takes a bone each from us to give to the dogs.

We count the wrinkles on the globe and tell each other,
Yes, life is a helluva lot of waiting time.

Our minds are objects of constipation,
Our bodies are subject to dissipation.
So keep your intentions in a clear bottle
And leave it on the shelf when you rap.

We were waiting for peter, the blower,
He comes in when were fixing snow on rock.
Gives us orange juice laced with sunshine and spring,
And takes a heart each from us to give to the world.

We count the memories that are lost and tell each other,
Yes, life is a helluva lot of waiting time.

Our minds are objects of constipation,
Our bodies are subject to dissipation.
So keep your intentions in a clear bottle
Throw it in the ocean when you go.

We were waiting for peter, the weaver,
He comes in a flash when were wide awake.
Says the world can't give us answers
Cause its stuttering in its mind.
Takes a head each off us to give us some peace.

We count the lights in the universe and tell each other,
Yes, life is a helluva lot of waiting time."

Bankok, thailand, theyve launched an air-sea search for a fishing boat carrying some foreign ietnamese refugees, the boat was towed back out to sea for a ride in thailand. Sources said that it was because of a breakdown in communicatin. Oh lord, the boat was towed into thai waters by a german freighter and the thai navy are unaware that the refugees have been guaranteed a resettlement and worst the only took the boat out to sea after providing all passengers with provision.
Hey, that's deep man.

The chinese newspapers have made the first reference to the countrys curtain wall posted campaign according to vice premiar deng xiaoping. And said that the countrys stable and its leaders are confident and planning modernisation and programs., oh this should get me in the village bar.
Deng gave blessing to the campaig but he commented not all the opinionsof the masses are carefully thought out nor can we demand that they all be correct. Adding this is nothing terrible. It bad enough, but its not terrible.
From a prison, richard nixon, on his second trip outside the united states, sent his fesignation with a smiling hand shake politician again. Greedy crowdsoutside his hotel, and trying a little french.
They sure as hell didn't try it on pam nixon., mr. Nixon is in paris and inside this suite to be interviewed on french television. They thought of going on to deliver a speech in england, hell participate in the french collegue program and said he will answer questions in welsh.

That's pretty big mr. M. Ahhh, I'm so cynical, I could just keep on doing this forever because, you know, they aint gonna be lookin for my golden bunnions in a hundred years from now.

Growing beside an old bark hit by lightning.
I asked the young tree how he wished to be,
He shook his leaves and sung to me:

I'm a strong oak tree like my father used to be,
Though deep in my heart, the memorys still there.
The sky is clearer now and the wind is fair,
The world is beautiful and I like it out here.

When I hear thunder, I think of my father,
He taughtme about life, that was when I was five.
Its true that some days are more than grey,
But we learn to get by day by day.

I feel its my duty, not only as a human being but as a person
Or was it not george formy who said there are four billion three hundred and twenty million
Mortal or earth years which is one day of brahma.
So, one way of looking at it is simply not to look at it at all.

(Gold rush) Where all the old buildings stood
(Gold rush) And they keep digging it down and down
(Gold rush) So that the cars can live underground
(Gold rush) They're swinging a wrecking ball
(Gold rush) Through these lath and plaster walls
(Gold rush) He's letting all the shadows free
(Gold rush) The ones I wish still followed me

(Please don't change)
(Stay) Followed me, followed me
(Stay the same)

[Verse 2]
(Gold rush) I remember a winter's night
(Gold rush) We kissed beneath the street lamp light
(Gold rush) Outside a bar near the record store
(Gold rush) That have been condos for a year or more 
(Gold rush) Now that our haunts have taken flight
(Gold rush) And been replaced with construction sites
(Gold rush) Oh, how I feel like stranger here
(Gold rush) Searching for something that's disappeared
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) For what they say is the greater good
(Gold rush) But all I see is a long goodbye
(Gold rush) A requiem for a skyline
(Gold rush) It seems I never stopped losing you
(Gold rush) Because every bad becomes something new
(Gold rush) And all our ghosts get swept away
(Gold rush) It didn't used to be this way

(Stay) Be this way, be this way
(Stay the same)
(Cranes) Be this way, be this way
(Devour the light)
(Strange) Be this way, be this way
(At the time)

[Bridge]
I've ascribed these monuments
A false sense of permanence
I've placed faith in geography
To hold you in my memory
(Gold rush) I'm sifting through these wreckage piles
(Gold rush) Through the rubble of bricks and wires
(Gold rush) Looking for something I'll never find
(Gold rush) Looking for something I'll never find

A memory came to me from times before

I remember when my dad was called away
My mother put his pictures all away
And now the time had come for me to go
To my love my tears I tried not to show

Chorus:
With tear drops on my face
Thinking 'bout that old homeplace
Riding across the planes in the rain

The letters from my dad described the war
His food was canned, his boots they made him sore
And one letter from my dad spoke of a friend
Who got lost between the water and the land

Now I'm the one writing letters to my son
I'll be home as soon as the fightin's done
With my gun in hand I guess it's hard to see
What it was that used to be inside of me

[ Chorus ]

Today we moved in sight of the enemy
Though I didn't even know what they had done
The general yelled to me, when I count to three
Get on your feet and start to run

That's the last event I can recall
The tent was big but could not hold us all
Though I'll never know what got the best of me
I swear I felt my dad looking over me

I'm saying goodbye to you
Leaves me nowhere at all
No place to fall, nothin' but blue

Tell me and tell me now
As sweet as you can somehow
That you'll miss me each day
And that goin' away is only your style

'Cause I'll wake up at night and feel
The face in the dream was real
But I'm nowhere at all
No place to fall, nothin' but blue

I'll tell you it's sad but it's true
I'm already missin' you
And you ain't even gone
I'm already stoned with nothin' to do

I'm thinkin' I've had enough
The fool in me's feelin' rough
You left me days without end
Got crazy again
Kept smokin' the stuff"

Are you gonna be my angel?
The Devil's never gonna let me save my poor soul

Shovel that shines like silver
Digs a hole in the ground

To another place far away from you

I close the door behind me and fall onto the bed
There's nothing on the tv and not much in my head
When I think of you it makes me smile and I realize
It's another day without you

Chorus:
Now wait for me little darling
I'm coming home, I hope you'll understand
I long for you little darling
Can't wait till I can see you again

And as the days turn into weeks
I'll call you when you're fast asleep
The air outside is cold enough to snow
In all the little towns I see
Another road has taken me
To some other place far away from you

The man behind the counter says room 225
I can't recall the place I'm in by the looks inside
And sure as every hotel looks the same I realize
It's another day without you

My heart full of sorrow and pain
And I sing an old familiar song of the place that I belong
When my mind starts to think of home again

So many miles and so many roads
And people who don't even know my name
So many times I've looked to western skies
Nowhere I go is quite the same
As that sweet home waiting for me
At the end of the day

Now my feet grow tired and the wind, it grows wild
And the road never seems to end
And my mind, it races on from the sunrise???? (she is gone)
Thoughts of old start to fill my head

[ Chorus ]

And it's too much confusion, too many lies
Too many times my heart has been broken right in two
I've shed too many tears thinkin' about those times
Cried too many rivers over you

Well, the lights up ahead they mean that I am near
I can smell the wood smoke in the air
And when I go back out again???? (and I long to return to)
My old home, I know she'll be there

Baby's left me without warning
Sometime in the night
And I'm flying down to Houston
Forgetting her the nature of my flight

As we taxi toward the runway
With the smog and smoke reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city are extremely real

All the nightlife and the parties
Temptation and a seat
The order of the day
It's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in L. A.

[ Chorus ]

Now our golden jet is airborne
And flight #50 cuts a path across the morning sky
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us flight #50 is the way to fly

And our hostess takes an order
Coffee, tea, or something stronger to start off the day
It's a bloody Mary morning
And I'm leaving baby somewhere in L. A.

Would you hold it dear, would it fly away with you, with you

Long ago, it felt like we were both so much younger
Here we are a repeat of a classic situation
Did you build us up just to say how high?
Would you let me down?
Even notice that I was with you, with you
There you go, gone again without an explanation
So anyway get through the day and try not to remember
Even if we found nothing to say
Would it finally hide all the reasons to stay with you, with you"

There was a battle, in that far country, to that dark land was that old soldier bound
He held his true love, he kissed her softly, said? Darlin? Fear not, I? Ll come back around?
From a rear window, the lover watching? Watching as her tears fell to the ground
The nights grew cold, her heart grew lonely, along the streets she would walk and she? Cry
Her heart was tender, her thoughts went yonder, she? D gently kiss the ring she? D wear upon her finger

Distance makes the heart grow fonder
But passion makes the fire bright
Loneliness and Confusion
Darkness and Light

One night while dreamin?, she saw her true love, by the old rock he sat a-weepin?
His eyes were shinin?, his head turned skyward, asking? God above, how could this be??
She jumped up from her bed, her heart was pounding? She went out to calm herself in the cool night air
She started roamin?, by the edge of town, while the lover watched her go all alone
She soon grew weary, her body tired, by an old rock wall she settled down
Her lover approaching? Approaching gently, lonely love was his favorite hunting ground
The very next morning, the lady rising, she felt confusion, like never before
She awoke in her own bed with a tender feeling thought she heard the sound of her sweet soldier aproachin
A knock came upon the door, she jumped up running, only to see a strange soldier with medals a-shinin?
He said? Sad lady? Sad news I bring you? Your soldier died last night while the bullets were flyin?
No, no, no, this can? T be? For just last evening, my soldier sang to me love? S true song?
Wracked with confusion, she fell a-weepin?, while the lover, from his window watched all along?"

Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

Stars are bright and they push me on and on
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide
And the stars they guide my way across the night
There's a half moon rising, pushin' me on to another mountain top
Push me on, no i'll never stop, push me on home
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight now the shoes on my feet, those soles broken down and my coat is tattered and worn
And the hunger in my belly, and the fever in my head will vanish 'ere my first glimpse of home
And even though the rain may now be fallin'
The passion is deep and pushes me on
There's a still at dawn like the sound of your loves breath as she lies sleeping
Down below me now in the valley is the only piece on earth that I ever want to know
And her lips are as soft as I remember
She alone has brought me back on home"

Love is something that you might find, but pain is what you learn
On a hilltop looking for my love below

I blew my whistle loud, I blew my whistle clear,
Picked up a fiddle, sawed off a tune, looking for my dear
I searched this whole world over, through the country and through the town
I'll keep on looking for that little girl 'til I'm in the loansome ground
On a hilltop looking for my love below

For years my heart did ramble, [???] without a home,
Put down my ancient tired eyes, rest upon my bones

And there ain't much left to keen in my book

Hangin' on to someone else, he tells you that peace sells
And you see him like all's well, I ain't jealous
Though you used to listen to me,
My inner thoughts have made you flee
I know you were just tryin' to be what you want to be

I let you in to see me for real
And you walked right out that's what I feel
You said you needed time to be alone

And like the youth I looked above
Feeling stranded without love
The time was wrong, and you left me in a hole
You left me in hole (you left me in a hole)
You left me in hole

The rain it comes, the rain it goes
The question is, she friend or foe
The story-teller looks to his toes, he's stuck here
The dragon's breath is on my neck
Which way is home, hold on a sec
The bartender put a bottle of beer on the table

Many people, they believe that Jesus came here to relieve
All the problems that we breathe on each other
And I don't care just what you do,
Or what you think, that's up to you
You see, those thoughts of yours are not new to me at all

And is it these thoughts that made you believe
That there's nothing here so you shall leave
While I sit here with my guitar in my hand

And all I can do is sit back and sigh, what's my problem
Ignore the problem, that's the key
Said the woman beneath the tree
If your eyes are closed, you can't see the sunrise

The phone, it rings, who could it be
Well, it ain't her, and it's not for me
Forgetting's as easy as 1-2-3 my friends say
Her face is still all too clear, her leaving me was my biggest fear
Something's got to help me steer away from her

You have your life, and I have mine,
Maybe we'll meet again some other time
Down the long road, on another plain

Will I still hear the barking dogs and the shouts of men
Looking back over my shoulder I see things I should have done
And I've got a funny feeling that I've seen my final sunrise
A bitter wind it came blowing in
Lord and all I wanted was to shout out loud
But a bitter wind carries any mournful sound
Then the one I'm sure to make if they find me

Looking back over my shoulder got some miles on me now
Not much more that I could do to keep my deal from going down
I'm tired in my bones and I've starting to wonder
Can we really call it livin' when your livin' on the run

Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town

The town line's far away and
He won't sleep for days
Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife
Now the sheriff's men have got him running for his life

He should have known that girl was trouble but he wasn't thinking clear
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer
But a deputy did see them and tracked the sheriff down
Just had time to grab his clothes and high ball out of town

The town line's far away and
He won't sleep for days
And even if he makes it, there's nothing he can do
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasn't heard the news

A man stood in the shadows thinking about the past
About all the women he had known and living life too fast
But he heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head
Should have known the sheriff wouldn't rest till he was dead

The town line's far away and
He's six feet in the grave
He's lying there with Annie, who was the sheriff's wife
Till the sheriff and his men robbed them of their lives"

Are my tears that follow a reminder
That you left me for somebody new

Chorus:
Would you ever come back into memory
Would you think of our love that used to be
As your heart comes from beneath the river
Is my picture in a tear you cried for me

Did you hear that ol' night bird cryin'
He's cryin' for someone who's gone away
(???) through the nighttime
And you'll come back to him someday

[ Chorus ]

Did you hear the sound of the freight train
The same one that you rode on out of town
Well it whistled and (???) through the nighttime
Like the blues that surely got me down

There's still ramblin' in the rambler let him go
You'll never tame him darling and you know
He'll break your heart in two
And after that he still ain't through
There's still ramblin' in the rambler let him go

Up till dawn and drinking every night
Bailin' him out in the morning after another bar room fight
Cook for him a supper he will never see
Briefcase-totin' boy you know he'll never be

[ Chorus ]

Wonderin' if the car is wrecked, if he's dead or not
He'll meet you at the ballet after just one more Jaegermeister shot

That five hundred bucks you loaned him that you will never see
Briefcase-totin' boy you know he'll never be

[ Chorus ]

Finding him in the morning passed out on the kitchen floor
He explains that's where he fell down when he came in the door
After all of this my darling ain't it plain to see
That old whisky drinking, bluegrass listening, Carhartt wearing, all night roaming rambler he'll always be.

Yonder Mountain String Band,River,/y/yonder+mountain+string+band/river_20544175.html,"The river rolls and the river winds
And it seems to do something for my peace of mind
Though I didn't know it, I came here looking to find
A place to forget about my troubles for awhile

I saw a mother with her little baby when I was walking here
There's something 'bout a little baby that makes me laugh
They don't seem to have a care
And I wonder if I'm ever gonna feel that way again

Until then, I'll find some time to spend down by the river

I spend a lot of time looking forward
Looking back and looking down at my feet upon the ground
I fell backwards and when I opened my eyes
I found myself staring straight up in the sky
And it seemed like there was something there to learn
When I realized I had nowhere else to be
And the only sound that mattered was the wind that blowed so gentle through the trees

Such a harmony down by the river

Well I heard music, it was soft and clear
And I sang out for the first time, I didn't care who would hear
Because I found my answers in the wind and waves
And the magic in the little things that happen every day
And I played that tune on my old mandolin
And I didn't hurt at all for company
Because the river likes to sing along and knows the words to every song I play

Such a lovely day down by the river
Such a lovely day..."

And said, ""Dust is all I know""
And you're so clean and I'm so tired
Like lovers' smiles and green marker miles

[Chorus]
Can't go back that's much too far
I'm asking you to laugh
But after all
You love a tragedy

Hope remains a sidewalk star
Could you stay right where you are
You're so smooth, and I'm on fire
Holding on, just watching it unwind

The morning sun does rise and fall, and the midnight wind it does whistle and wind
Like a dust cloud from the flatland with the force of the mountain behind
Stood in front of me, a vision ya see, with her thumb aimed to the sky
Yes she jumped inside and spoke her name, Cecelia Dee from Abilene
I caught her eyes, as I was hypnotized, like a fire fed with kerosene
Just one look, that was all it took, I was trying to put up the good fight but I was hooked
Down the road a ways she said to me, and then we'll see how far we go

Chorus:
Steep grade, sharp curves, a treacherous stretch of highway
Put me in a tailspin that I just might never get out of
Steep grade, sharp curves, said she was going my way
Wishin' now til my dying day that I had never believed her

Yeah, there began the ride of my life, oh cheap drinks and neon lights
My vision, my lines of reality blurred, no heaven or hell, no wrong or right
Took my face to her hands and kissed me like none ever before
Said do what you want, do what you will but don't you dare leave me tonight

[ Chorus ]

Now it's three days later the time doesn't matter, just tell me where's my watch and my cash
Forgive me please for how I might have behaved, for I can't seem to remember what happened last
It was like a dream, one of heaven's schemes, Cecelia Dee from Abilene
Last thing I remember she was smilin' like the devil and laughing like all hell
As she rode out of sight

Flyin' down country roads that he's been down before
One of just three men that the sheriff cannot catch
And he's travelin' 90 miles down the Bolton Stretch

The first time we had seen his face was back in '84
He walked right into old O'Hare's, he robbed that liquor store
The sheriff tried to catch him but the man he got away
And he didn't show his face in town again until today

Didn't come for justice, didn't come to make amends
(He) doesn't ask forgiveness, he's not looking to make friends
Just that he was passing through with money wearin' thin
Now he's travelin' down the Bolton Stretch again

He watches all the trees fly by, but doesn't seem to care
Knows it's time to leave again, but doesn't know to where
And though he stole a lot of money, it's not enough for bail
And there are two blue lights behind him now, the sheriff's on his trail

Since the day that he was born he spent his whole live livin' free
With nothing but the loosest ties to friends and family
No punishment will make him care about the things he's done
And if he lives another 20 years he'll live 'em on the run

Didn't come for justice, didn't come to make amends
(He) doesn't ask forgiveness, he's not looking to make friends

Cursing all the miles and the nights we spend alone

About the things I saw while I was there.

They had the same clothes, they had the same name.
Oh, I took off runnin' right out of that town,
Hope I never have to go back again.

Chorus:
I won't tell ya just where it is,
Case I ever have to go back again.
But you're going to know it, if you ever pass through,
Provided that they let you in.

Well the moms and the dads they drove the same cars,
They had the same jobs and the didn't think alot.
And if I didn't think I'd get in trouble with the law,
Tell ya I'd have laughed out loud.

Kids got the same grades, the wore they same shoes
Struttin' in maroon velcro kangaroos,
Which I liked enough, I tried to get a pair
But they didn't have any to spare

Had the right color eyes and the right color skin.
But I didn't know the work or the magic word,
And I think they knew that I smoked a bit from time to time

Money in my pocket's gonna help me not to think
Of you at all, no I won't think of you at all

Cos' this life is made of violence
Sixteen, he's already on his way
Next victim the clouds and the pearly gates

When the room goes quiet
Nobody knows
And it's all your fault
And it's all your fault

Wish that I was younger
Wish that I was smart enough
To keep my composure
Keep my head straight

Oh you can be my headache
And I'll make your name famous

Showing you just how cool he is
The powders could be the catalyst

When the room goes quiet
Nobody knows what to say
And the room goes quiet
And they don't (and it's all your fault)
And it's all your fault

When the room goes quiet
Nobody knows what to say
This is the part when we say what a shame
This is the part where we shoulder all the blame

To get a grip and cherish their good health

No ones talked us out,
The problems that have come
Haven't yet torn us down.

You can make your own decisions; you can make your own mistakes,
I'll live and let die all the promises you made,

He’s in all black
And he thinks he’s all that
That’s for sure
A word in his ear
My initials appear
What’s the score?

I think I’ve figured it out
You and I, we will not work
‘Cos when my back is turned
You find a way to make things worse
I call for calm
But the storm comes first

I can’t hold back
Can’t hold back on you tonight
(Ooh)
I won’t hold back
Won’t hold back on you tonight
Won’t hold back no

You’ve got that passive going on
Regression coming on strong
I see no reason to lead you
I follow, I follow you

Oh when you figure it out
Your time has come and gone
Lost your bottle
Lost your touch
And now all the bets are off
The curtain call on your cover up

I can’t hold back
Can’t hold back on you tonight
(Ooh)
I won’t hold back
Won’t hold back on you tonight

I wanna roll if you are rolling
You’ve got your leather on and got me falling
Shoes with red soles, you’re taking me home

Won’t hold back on you tonight

You have just lost me along the way
Somewhere between the fake smiles and your free drinks
Please don't smother me

Because they tell you all you need to know about who and what you are
No smoke without a fire, with that, our names are a pure lie

We were young,
We were in our teens.
It wasn't real love,
Spent behind bars.
Oh it's sad to think,
We just let it be.
Prisoners of love.

It's so easy for it to be,
Something second guessed.
Easy to read,
Don't let it become,
A meaningless routine.
It's meaningless to me.

But when I looked at her,
I thought of only you.
If only there was proof I could use to show it's true.

Just crash, fall down,
I'll wrap my arms around you now.
Just crash, it's our time now,
To make this work second time around.

We grew up,
We worked and changed our ways.
Just like wildfire,
Been burning now for days.
Tearing down those walls,
Nothing's in our way.
I said, nothing's in our way.

And I know,
I've said this all before,
But opposites attract.
We try and run away,
But end up running back.

And all I want to do,
All I want to do,
Is lie down and...

Crash, fall down.
I'll wrap my arms around you now.
Just crash, it's our time now,
To make it work, second time around.

One that keeps you around for a while
I wish for small things, not losing this feeling
I've seen this coming I've seen you leaving

I know it's sad to touch some things
It'll make you feel a little empty

Every bridge I see I seem to burn

And tell a little truth to everyone 
Sick of saying sorry when I'm not
But after a little love
That's, that's all I've, it's all I've got

Wrestled with the voices inside my head, no longer heaven scent

What happens when the body’s gone, does the soul live on?
I don’t know how to lose somebody yet, I’ve got all these voices inside of my head

You gotta pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Never gonna feel as good, the way I know life should
I need some space from it
Feeling misunderstood, rust under my hood

Always something in the way
It took some time to realise, this is real life, closing time in paradise"

You always find a way out
I I I I I I I
Its time I had my moment now
We could always move in circles if we had to
Its time to cut that loose and move forward with what we do

Never saw an easy sign
To let me know the good times had arrived
Oh I was always on your side but now

You’re so predictable
Do what you always do
Go back to where you came from, from

Pain has a way of playing out in slow motion
If things get worse I hope I come to your mind first
This hate is spreading through my veins just like a wildfire
Can’t put it out, I don’t know how, id even start

Now you know the truth it hurts
It’s better than living in reverse
Oh we used to fall into each other
Like love & now its died

You’re so predictable
Do what you always do
Crawl back to where you came from

I’m taking no advice
I’m shooting on sight tonight
My aim is good, you know you would if you could aim that high"

Walked hand and hand with your trust
And everybody was kissing on fire

It'd be safer, to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

Caught you having a laugh
Did you catch me have the last?
I've been smiling like this for days
Just to make up for my mistakes
In the dark, I watch everyone disappear
And I am beginning to let myself down
I am pushing everyone that was in, out

Than to love her and to lose her

To live and die on the inside
Nobody knows what it's like
To be one of a kind

You Me At Six,The Dilemma,/y/you+me+at+six/the+dilemma_20979360.html,"Let me tell you a story bout' a boy and a girl,
A very different version than you've ever heard.
Ok so I'm lying but all I'm trying to say,
This isn't about the one that got away.

Watch it from your ivory tower,
Paint the sky grey, like a coward.
How long you got?
I can go for hours.
A sweet little tale that ended sour,
My words will ring in your ears.

Take my advice and leave right now.
You can't find a way to sell yourself,
To someone who cares,
To someone desperate.

First came along my friends were dubious,
She cared for the stage, not who she was with.
I brushed it off and hit the road,
Only to hear she's in the other's 'pose'.

It was the end of summer in 2009,
I wasn't really looking but what did I find?
A golden girl with golden hair,
When I was with her everybody stared.
And I couldn't believe my luck had changed.
And I asked so nice but I 'wouldn't stay'

Take my advice and leave right now.
You can't find a way to sell yourself,
To someone who cares,
To someone desperate.

'Beggars can't be choosers',
I wouldn't choose you,
I've got better things to do with my time
I will bear in mind,
What was in their 'side'

(Na na na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na)

She said who do you, she said who do you,
She said who do you, she said who, do you! ?
Who, do you? Who do you?
I said who do you, I said who do you.

Who do you, who do you, think you are,
Who do you, who do you, think you are,
Who do you, who do you, think you are,
Who do you, who do you, think, you, are!"

Some more.

I'll stick around to watch this town fall down to it's knees,
You can pray the day that you hope is coming round real soon.
I will run and stay away in a place that I don't know well of,
You can choose a different song that you will soon love.

Well here are the reasons that hurt me the most.
Call off the search I'm coming home,
People lie once, but not on the third,
Not without reason, not for a girl.

The names will vary, the names they may change,
But the game, the game it stays the same, Oh love, we want the ones that we will grow to hate, to hate.

It's just so
Oh no, oh no. Oh woah, oh no...

And I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone.
You can't blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more

Here's a list of the things you said and I wont get over it,
You want to know, you, want to know and.
The games that girls will play,
Makes me move away so I can train,
Train myself to trust again.
Oh Over hill will you teach me the games you play so well and,
I'll drink to that, will you drink to that?

You've made your bed, so sleep in it, but never call me again.
You've made your bed, so sleep with him,
But know I'm the best you'll get.
And I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone.
Can't blame a girl for trying even though she keeps on lying more

You whore, whore
You whore, whore
You whore, whore
You whore, whore

I wrote this song so you would know why I look up to everyone.
You can't blame a girl for trying, even though she keeps on lying more

These words will convince you to never love me again,
You want to be friends, but I wont do it.
These words will convince you to never sleep with me again,
You don't, and I don't do friends"

Plus de grandes tours, moins d'espace
Le monde tourne, on fait du sur-place
Plus de réseau, moins on s'parle vraiment
On kiffe en surface, l'enfer, c'est les autres dans c'paradis d'ciment
Plus on apprend, moins on sait, plus on l'dit, moins on s'aime
Des villes à cran sous Tranxène, des bâtiments, on saigne
Y'a plus de remèdes et moins d'guérisons
Trop d'merde, plus de chaînes de télé et moins d'vision
Plus de corps mêlés, de chair, plus de sexe et moins d'envie
On s'tue à gagner sa vie sans la vivre
J'me cherche, plus de technologie et moins d'temps
Plus d'ogives, de tanks, moins d'logique, plus de Printemps
Plus de strass, moins de héros, moins d'réel, trop d'reality-shows
À l'échelle d'la planète, on est qu'des rêves, des petites choses

Plus on l'enseigne et moins l'amour est essentiel, salam
Plus de procédures, moins d'objectifs
Plus de murs, plus de disques durs et moins de mémoire collective
J'm'en fous de ce qu'ils disent, fuck leurs icônes
Pour moi, c'est kif-kif, plus de Chief Keef, moins de Biggie Small
Plus de roulette russe, moins d'glamour, moins d'héritage
Plus de virus, moins d'amour, plus de VIH
Plus de lâches, moins de risques forts

Y'a cette musique dans la poitrine

Donc prends ce titre comme une première danse
Et tant pis pour les aigris et c'que les rebelles pensent
Ils veulent au pire que la relève flanche

Et qui dansent encore au milieu de la foule
Alors on respecte tous ceux qui respectent notre culture
Je rappe à l'excès, et mon présent sera leur futur
On n'est pas sectaires, leur vision du monde est alléchante
Mais je suis perplexe, j'ai connu l'rap à l'adolescence
Et j'ai pris perpet', experts, on assure le récital

Chacun de nous a la niaque de Shaka Zulu
Pour chaque claque reçue sur chaque joue
À chaque joute qu'on livre on en rajoute dans les livres
Sur la façon dont on se délivre et dont on devient libre
Chaque fibre qui me relie à chaque frère est plus solide
Que chaque menotte de flics et chaque chaîne
Mais chaque scène de nos vies c'est des frères qui s'entretuent
Des conflits ethniques jusqu'au gangs du ghetto qui se tuent
Chaque tune que je gagne ne vaudra jamais ma culture
Les insultes ne me blessent plus car ce qui ne tue pas laisse des points de suture
Le futur de chaque môme est inscrit dans chaque paume
Mais nos mômes ont les paumes posées sur chaque chrome
Chaque tome de ma vie rend hommage à chaque noir 
Ceux dans le manque, ceux qui pètent la banque chaque mois
Chaque mot dédicacé à chaque bled
Chaque ghetto dans la merde, chaque poto qui souffre en scred
Chaque rouge, chaque vert, chaque jaune
Chaque cage, chaque faune, chaque village et chaque zone?
Aux icônes qui respirent dans nos récits
Aux nôtres à la mosquée ou à la messe ou qui attendent un autre messie

Chaque merci à chaque M.C. qui sait fumer le M.I.C.
Parfumé à la fumée de chaque sensi
Chaque insigne de police me laisse perplexe
Imprime chaque peine pour frère qui a pris perpette
On respecte chaque brave lascar, de la cave au placard
Dans les pavs ou dans les traquenards 
Trop de tracas dans chaque cas de figure
Á chaque fracas c'est la bac qui vient nous mener la vie dure
Chaque bitume que j'arpente, que j'emprunte
M'habitue à ce que la poésie ardente soit mon empreinte
Chaque plainte vient des nôtres
Comment rester neutre ?
C'est parce que des flics ont tué des mômes
Qu'il y avait des mômes dans les émeutes
C'qui m'émeut c'est l'amour de chaque Mama
Pas le désamour dans le boule de chaque nana
A chaque carnage, à chaque drame
On relève chaque carma on rallume chaque flamme
Chaque femme que j'ai aimée m'a rendu mature
Chaque fois que j'ai gamé j'ai fait des ratures
Ma nature se révèle dans chaque rime de chaque vers
Mon rap représente chaque cri de chaque frère?"
Youssoupha,A Force De Le Dire,/y/youssoupha/a+force+de+le+dire_21465521.html,"On me reproche les memes colères, les memes foutus thèmes

Nos esprits sont descendus à force de les réduire alors nos speechs ne seront entendus qu'à force de les dire
On me reproche les memes colères, les memes foutus thèmes
Moi j'fais du rap populaire dans tous les sens du terme
Nos esprits sont descendus à force de les réduire alors nos speechs ne seront entendus qu'à force de les dire

A force de le dire, à force d'écrire sur mon ghetto et sa malchance un jour mes rimes sont sorties de ma chambre
Adolescent, à force de rap et de rythmes effrénés j'suis passé d'illégal à la cigale à guichet fermé
A force de rapper sur ton crunk comme une petite tas' viens pas faire le thug moi je fais toujours pas de dirty south
Suce la tendance jusqu'à la mort, t'es dans de beaux draps, moi j'm'en fou de la mode par définition elle se démodera
A force de voir nos plus grands leaders assassinés j'pleure pour leurs mémoires mais tous leurs combats restent enracinés
Et le savoir sera mon arme c'est décidé puisque les hommes qui ont les balles combattent souvent les hommes qui ont les idées
A force de m'comparer à ceux qui ont détruis Manhattan à chaque fois que vous parlez vous ne faites que des islamalgames
Et les soldats ricains sont devenus héroïques en 2001 quand tous les musulmans du monde sont devenus terroristes
A force d'etre trahi mes amis je les dose, j'fais de l'acuponcture tellement j'ai de couteaux dans le dos
J'ai fais de l'homme l'ennemi de mon destin parce que le jour où je serai son meilleur ami il me traitera de chien
A force de juger nos gueules les gens le savent qu'à la télé souvent les chroniqueurs diabolisent les banlieusards
Chaque fois que ca pète on dis que c'est nous... j'mets un billet sur la tete de celui qui fera taire ce con d'Eric Zemour !
A force de viser le trône j'ai fais le serment d'etre un leader car le deuxième est le premier des perdants
Les jaloux crachent mais moi je ne les comprend pas, comme la police si tu me clash tout ce que tu dis sera retenu contre toi
A force de voir les flics écarter nos jambes j'me demande si je suis né en 2008, le 4 novembre
J'me rend bien compte de la victoire noir américaine mais on ne change pas le monde en un week end avec un « yes we can »
A force de dire que le FN est mort, à l'évidence on oublit que ses idées elles sont encore bien vivantes
Qu'elles alimentent le programme du président élu quand il parle d'identité nationale une fois dans les urnes
Ma jeunesse est opprimée mais qui prend sa défense ?
A force de clichés pour expliquer tous les sifflets dans le stade de France
Est-ce qu'il nous aime ce pays, je sais pas du tout
Hey Malik c'est la France qui nous insulte et ca c'est pas du lourd
A force de supporter les cris et les saluts nazis, avec ces skins Paris la nuit n'est vraiment plus magique
Et si l'homme descend du singe le kop de Boulogne te le rappellera renoi le jour où tu joueras au parc des princes
A force de s'aimer sans lendemain et sans latex on vieillit mal avec l'idée du VIH dans la tete

J'm'entete à force d'avoir la tete dans un nuage de fumée
On s'ramolit sans cesse mais on a du mal à assumer
A force de subir l'occupation de ses territoires la Palestine est meurtrie et j'nique tous les colons de l'histoire
Militer pour que le message s'exporte, un peuple humilié au milieu des murs et des checkpoints
A force de s'bloquer dans des cases on a menti, il faut de tout pour faire un rap le but étant de rester authentique
J'fais pas le gangster, ca c'est véridique ! ma génération a connu le rap francais à travers Benny B
A force de m'rappeller de ma vie d'gosse, à Cergy le hip-hop m'a frappé lorsque je rappais sur des beatbox
Sapé à la Kris Kross j'lâche une petite strophe, quelques rimes houleuses pour mes gars des touleuses et Saint Christophe
Youssef, Marcel, Abdulai, Abdel, Pedry, Mounir, Frederick et Mohamed,
Et moi-meme j'dois tout à Diable Rouge, j'ai les mots en peine, et qu'Allah nous écoute afin que le frère Ali repose en paix
A force d'agoniser, à force de blâmes, à force de s'noyer dans des larmes alcoolisées, à force de drames
Mon rap contacte sans blackberry ni bluetooth, j'communique avec des rimes et c'est terrible comment j'vous touche tous
A force de rever disque d'or et Olympia, on veut tuer mes efforts comme le Tibet durant les Olympiades
J'peux pas plaire à tout le monde, en toute amitié, dans un monde où meme Dieu ne fais pas l'unanimité
A force de rire du bout des lèvres étant donné que les blagues de Michel Leeb me font moins rire que celles de Dieudoné
Quand l'humour est acerbe il prend des risques de fou et je dois bien reconnaitre qu'on ne peut pas toujours rire de tout
A force de subir une guérilla sauvage mon pays meurt dans l'oubli et dans l'amnésie internationale
Y'a cette tragédie humaine dont l'opinion se moque pourtant la guerre au Congo a fait plus de 4 millions de morts !
A force d'avoir mon dialecte qui balance en argot et en Francais sur mes lettres mais j'oublie pas ma langue
(?)
A force d'évoluer dans ce game intolérable combien de fois j'ai eu envie de rentrer au bled et d'arreter le rap
Mais la suite me fait saliver car le succès d'A chaque frère reste la plus belle chose qui me soit jamais arrivée

On me reproche les memes colères, les memes foutus thèmes
Moi j'fais du rap populaire dans tous les sens du terme
Nos esprits sont descendus à force de les réduire alors nos speechs ne seront entendus qu'à force de les dire
On me reproche les memes colères, les memes foutus thèmes

À part certains reufrès qui rappent et quelques éclairs de Steven Gerrard
HLM résident, blédard bucolique
Rien d'évident, mon Président s'appelle ""Nicolas Berlusconi""
Ça nous méprise, guette la moindre anomalie
Et si les jaloux maigrissent, le rap game devient la Somalie
On veut me stopper dans ma quête
Mon succès est aussi suspect qu'un suicide avec trois balles dans la tête
Je pense aux petits couzs qui n'écoutent que quand les voyous causent
En 2012, le Petit Poucet sème des cailloux de coke
Y'a même du péché virtuel, ma gueule
Depuis qu'Adam et Ève ont croqué dans la pomme de Apple
Qui veut me test peut dead rien qu'en essayant
Quand tu m'insultes dans ton rêve, toi-même tu t'excuses en te réveillant
C'est le nouveau Youss', on avait dit, ""Pas de geste!""
Fais tourner le son en boucle, le bouche à oreille fera le reste
C'est ça même

Dire qu'ils nous prenaient pour des fous à lier
Mais aujourd'hui ils nous plébiscitent
Mon frère si tu nous vois franchir un palier
Il faut vraiment que tu nous félicites
Et n'oublie pas qu'au fond on est des êtres humains
On ne saura jamais de quoi sera fait demain
Et dire qu'ils nous prenaient pour des fous à lier

Quand ça parle de yé-bi
Mon slogan, ""Il n'y a que maille qui m'aille""
Je mange les thunes avec S-Pi, car on ne change pas une équipe qui graille
Rends-moi mon biff et qu'il n'en manque pas
Les hommes mentent, les femmes mentent, mais les chiffres ne mentent pas
J'ai fait du rap, parce que je connais bien la merde
Et que le temps m'a rappelé que ""R.A.P."" signifie ""Rien À Perdre""
Et ma riposte les a beaucoup trop heurtés
Je suis tellement hip-hop, que mon médecin de famille s'appelle Dr Dre
Mais certains an-ienc' ne veulent pas que les jeunes avancent
Maintenant que t'es en iench', tu dis que le rap c'était mieux avant
Et c'est cette phrase idiote qui va te faire la peau
Même le vinyle est mort quand DJ Premier s'est payé un Serato
C'est comme l'ironie du biz de shit
Pour narguer la Police, préparer ses barrettes dans une cuisine Schmidt
C'est le nouveau Prim's, on avait dit, ""Pas de geste!""
Fais tourner le son please, le bouche à oreille fera le reste
C'est ça même

On ne saura jamais de quoi sera fait demain
Et dire qu'ils nous prenaient pour des fous à lier
Mais aujourd'hui ils nous plébiscitent

Y'a les gens qui veulent pas que tu changes
Et y'a les gens qui veulent pas que t'évolues, fais le tri
Y'en a qui te complimentent pour que t'en crèves
Et t'as les autres qui t'insultent pour sauver ta vie
Vaut mieux la fermer quand tu fais des yé-bi
On parle pas pendant qu'on mange, ta maman t'a pas dit?
Je ferai pas du rap à vie, faut que je me planque mieux
Repose en paix, Colonel Gaddafi
J'ai bâti ma galaxie
Les gens trop lucides finissent à l'asile ou salafistes à Karachi
Les petits voient le puera comme un paradis
Un jour tu prends des royalties, un jour tu vends des Royal Cheese
On laisse des traces intemporelles
J'ouvre ma bouche pour les murs,
Au moins je suis sûr qu'ils ont des oreilles
Ils nous prenaient pour des fous
Mais 4.000 ans plus tard, les pyramides tiennent toujours debout

Dire qu'ils nous prenaient pour des fous à lier
Mais aujourd'hui ils nous plébiscitent

We were on the floor, and so much more
Kept moving that way
And we left the club and fell in love
And then I heard her say

But after all,
I can't recall, I can't recall one thing

L'équilibre entre l'enfer et le paradis fils

Va dire à ta pute de prof que j'écris mieux que Victor Hugo
Vous êtes vite morts, ce tube dans vos transistors
Ma génération, Tchernobyl, sida, Chirac et X-core
Vite sors et capitule, on m'a dit, ""Belek pour les thunes
Les Paris BM, les putes dans le taxi BM, les aventures caribéennes""
Indépendance Guadeloupéenne, illusion fatale
Chez nous le petit Poucet prépare les cailloux de l'intifada
Regarde, ça m'rend suspect d'avoir des rêves, je suis libre
Les gens me regardent de travers comme si j'revenais de Syrie
Je suis riche de mes souffrances, Dieu seul porte le pardon
J'suis pas chez Def Jam France, j'suis mon propre patron, merde
Hypocrites, entre pleurs et ricanements
Je suis de droite que pour le fric 
Mais j'suis de gauche lyricalement
Mais d'où vient donc ma réussite
Le monde à l'envers médicalement
Vu qu'on respire qu'avec du shit et qu'on s'tue au médicaments
Come on, baby, baby, come on
J'suis laconique
Ne pas croire en Dieu est un péché 
Que même le Diable n'a pas commis
Come on, baby, come on
J'imagine, que c'est le monde que j'ai décrit 
Que j'vais laisser à Imany, merde"

C'est les aventures extraordinaires de Bakary Potter
Applaudissez, applaudissez!
Yeah, uh

Toujours, le verbe intact, oh no
Nouvel impact, oh no
Y'a ceux qui jactent et ceux qui s'imposent par les actes, bonhomme
Économe parce que la misère me dégoûte
J'écoute le métronome, découpe les normes, ce couplet est énorme, poto
On parle de rap, poto, flow cannibale
Je dis qu'Paris c'est la Province, et que Kinshasa c'est la capitale
Le rap français panique
Vu qu'en indé', j'vends plus de disques que neuf rappeurs sur dix en major company
Mon rap une bactérie, si ça vous branche
J'ai l'angoisse de la feuille blanche, même depuis que j'écris sur BlackBerry
Mais ça caractérise mon écriture
Populaire et prodigieux, le volume deux s'appellera ""Négritude""
Plénitude et amour véritable
J'fais des classiques dans une époque où le hip-hop est produit périssable
Insaisissable du rap français, je suis la catastrophe
J'peux faire un gros single tout en cassant des gueules sur ""Paname Boss""
J'suis pas à la mode, comme un clébard à la bonne
J'fais mon truc, un peu rasta, un peu blédard sur les bords
Je dépasse les bornes, c'est ce que l'on croit
Rap Game Of Thrones, j'viens vous traumatiser, comme l'épisode neuf de la saison trois
Ah, c'est donc ça, c'est cette vision qui me rend fort
Et si je prends position, venez pas m'dire que j'suis en tort
Encore une polémique et je suis dead, gros
Rimes abusives, si je quitte Bomayé Musik, je signe chez Death Row
J'me perds trop, coups d'éclats et illusions
Quand la radio diffuse les clashs, bien sûr qu'elle appuie la division
Trop d'ambition, j'avoue je n'ai pas d'état d'âme
J'attends qu'les rappeurs s'entretuent pour revenir et recompter les cadavres
Nouvel album, nouvelles angoisses paranoïaques
Mon sommeil devient délicat comme Rim'k et sa Team Insomniak
Faudra d'la gnaque, faut l'admettre
L'album s'appellera ""Négritude"" mais il n'sort pas chez Pascal Nègre
C'est dead, c'est dead
Bomayé Musik, got to know!

To sutuki kaka, to fandaki na ngambu to yoka kaka
""Panganaka ndanganaka obelé ngweeeiinn"", ahaha

Yeah (Bomayé, Bomayé, Bomayé)

Pépère sur des p'tits bancs,

On fais des p'tits clans et on s'entretuent

Et n'écoute pas les aigris qui viennent te dire qu'il était mieux avant
Ça devient du pur vice, comme dit Alpha
J'rappe sur l'rap parce qu'à cause de lui je n'ai plus d'vie
MC, ne teste pas, pourquoi tu veux qu'la France respecte le rap
Puisque, nous mêmes, on ne le respecte pas?
Faut pas qu'on reste calme, mes gars bougent
Toute ma carrière, je la dois au Ménage à Trois et à Diable Rouge

Attends, attends, attends, attends, Nodey
Viens, on s'fait un vrai couplet d'rap français, tah les oufs
T'en dis quoi?
Ouais, de toutes façons, fais c'qui te plaît

Le même amour mais pas les mêmes peaux, on court le même tempo
Congo, Kinshasa, Africa represento
Notre horizon est toujours vide, j'garde la vision, toujours vif
On dit que l'rap est mort, sans remord, j'essaye de toujours vivre
Grandir sans père, c'est dur, mais j'ai visé le top
J'suis tellement aiguisé, j'te braque même pour du toc
Personne comprend les codes à part mes acolytes
Nique le proc', nique le protocole et nique la police
Impolis, garder d'la frappe : on fera tout pour
Hé tonton, dis-leur qu'ce putain d'rap sera toujours
Une musique pas faite pour cent personnes
Mais pour des millions, c'est ça, pour des millions
Arrive un peu comme une rebellion dans le milieu
On est à mille lieues d'un modèle qui s'en va
Pour certains, c'est mortel, moi hamdoulah ça va
Mais on s'rejette la faute quand tout part en couilles
Et que c'est gore, hardcore, comme reconnaitre ses torts
C'est pour les gros durs et les familles, les orduriers, les famines
Les torturés, les fortunés, les gosses durs et les gamines
Les victoires de la musique, c'est pété, c'est pas les Grammy
Ici, c'est toujours autour de la cité que l'on gravite
Chaque quartier compte son QG, ses ghettos, ses jeunes en mandat d'dépôt
Le poids sur les épaules, les mauvaises fois, on connaît
On a traversé le même mal, fais pas ta re-sta
Car, si jamais on prend le mic', j'rappe mieux qu'toi
J'pète la capsule avec mes riffs de Dakar
Putain, quel rap de crapule, putain, quelle rime de bâtard
Putain, quel rythme de barbare, essaye de nous stopper
Si tu veux, où tu veux, renoi, quand tu veux
Ok, écoute-moi, j'fais mon job à plein temps
J'gratte des couplets d'barge depuis presque vingt-trois printemps tsch tsch
Ça commence à faire long, tout c'temps passé dans l'arène
J'vais sûrement arrêter le rap avant qu'le rap m'arrête

Han, que t'avais jamais entendu de rap français, ok ?

J'suis qu'un MC relayeur
Puisque que le monde nous donne des frayeurs
La raison du plus faible est-elle parfois la meilleure ?
Et d'ailleurs à force de perdre j'ai prouvé ma vertu
Une emmerde de perdue, dix de retrouvées
Regroupés, l'espoir de paix nous rassemble
Nos peines se ressemblent et nos pertes se ressentent
Nos plaies sont récentes, d'Afrique en Amérique
Plus dure sera la descente car l'opinion publique est amnésique
Ma musique incomprise des dirigeants
Mec, c'est souvent en son-pri qu'on apprend à braquer la diligence
J'ai pas dix mille chances de devenir millionnaire
Visionnaire, pour y arriver, j'ai besoin d'un flingue ou d'un dictionnaire
Dingue révolutionnaire en Air Max requins
En marge mais tu retiens à la marque du refrain
Les re-frés vivent en otage ou en autarcie
Du chaud au froid comme s'ils passaient de Gwada à Bois D'Arcy
Je vois la cible, la gloire comme objectif
Impassible, du mal à croire à la victoire de mon effectif
J'ai pas l'air festif, j'ai pas l'air cool
Donne un salaire qu'on investisse, parce qu'on galère tous, t'as vu
Finie la garde à vue c'est l'heure des big boss
Y'a même des gosses receleurs ou hustler à la Rick Ross
Flics, procs, et le mépris s'installe
Comment faire du fric propre quand mon équipe a les mains sales ?
Je m'installe, à vous de juger celle-ci :
Faut gruger pour avoir un jet ou le budget de Chelsea
Y'a pas d'éclaircies l'avenir est nuageux
Les jeunes sont plus rageux et même le gun n'est plus un jeu
Cousin, y'a plus d'balles à blanc on s'tire entre nous
Plus de mal qu'auparavant on s'nique entre nous, putain
J'te l'avais dis qu't'avais jamais entendu de rap français

(Dangereux) Où que j'aille c'est la pression
C'est la bataille ou l'oppression

Les miens sont-ils différents des vôtres ? C'est la question

(Dangereux) Où que j'aille c'est la pression

Les miens sont-ils différents des vôtres ? C'est la question

OK, mon rap choque comme un attentat
Attitude punk, arrêtez les beats crunk putain on n'est pas à Atlanta
On entame une nouvelle épopée
Ca fait long time qu'on est de taille vu les entailles dont on a écopé
On a un biz à développer, esprit d'entreprise
Dis toujours opé' même si le mépris des gens te brise
Gentleman, trop de femmes ont fait de moi un homme
Dédicace aux sœurs, aux mères, qui remettent nos vies en ordre
Loin des normes ? Tout reste à vérifier
Peut-être qu'en vérité y'a que des tapettes chez les V.I.P
Toi tu te la pètes, en équipe, équipé
Plus tard tu baisseras la tête quand y'aura des gifles à éviter
Si l'rap était dirigé par mes lascars nègres
Mes nègres feraient des Pascals sans Pascal Nègre
Au lieu de jacter dans les ténèbres
Essaie de taffer pour que ton label devienne célèbre
Et reste intègre, intègre...

Ok, c'est pas parce qu'on est fils d'indigènes que l'histoire se termine mal
Si le talent était cancérigène je serais en phase terminale
Rage interminable et animal
On essuie pas le sombre passé de nos pères avec des perles lacrymales
Ils veulent que je m'acclimate ou que je parte
Et ils font de l'audimat avec des perquis' dans nos apparts
Où j'en serais sans Rosa Parks ou Toussaint Louverture ?
On a voulu m'abattre avec mes valeurs et ma vertu
J'ai mal vécu leur politique, la haine est prolifique
Et dans notre histoire, ils se donnent un rôle positif
Mon disque est un dispositif à ta disposition

Ptetre que notre histoire aurait été meilleure dans une autre vie
La peur du vide, les profs nous méprisent
Dès le collège sous l'emprise de la colère, trop d'échecs scolaires
Avec les collègues on partage les memes reves
Faire connaitre à la mama le bonheur d'une villa au bled
Mais le problème c'est que l'argent nous fait défaut
Et c'est rageant de se voir pauvre
Alors on fraude et on commet des fautes
A qui la faute ? Ca me désole
Putain j'voulais nous voir dans 10 ans sur les marches de la place des grands hommes
Mais aujourd'hui trop de potes peinent à joindre les deux bouts
En son-pri trop de potes ont perdu la boule
Trop de potes nous ont quittés et laissent un vide
Ptetre qu'on aurait mérité un meilleur sort dans une autre vie

J'voudrais dire à cette fille dont j'ai croisé le regard
Que je garde en souvenir son joli sourire à mon égard
Dans cette gare ou les gens passent et s'entassent
Moi j'ai les pensées qui s'égarent j'ai vu un ange sur le quai d'en face
J'ai cherché des grandes phrases à lui dire
Mais je bafouille comme un naze et elle ne peut pas s'empecher d'en rire
Elle est timide donc elle me parle assez bas
Maintenant je sais qu'une femme est encore plus belle quand elle ne le sait pas
On se sépare elle me dit qu'on se reverra
Effectivement on s'est revu affinité love etc
On se ferra mais le bonheur est trompeur
Elle m'avoue que son entourage désapprouve les raisons de son cœur
Elle prend peur son père est sévère
Mais on persévère alors je me fais goumer par ses frères
De l'amour à la guerre on est passé trop vite
Elle ma laissé un vide on ira s'aimer dans une autre vie

J'voudrais dire à mon père que le temps fait son travail
Que meme si on se voit peu j'apprécie nos quelques retrouvailles
Où que j'aille on me parle de lui
Son parcours est de taille donc c'est dur de le suivre
Moi, j'ai fais toute ma vie loin de la sienne
Sa présence me saisit à travers ses vinyles à l'ancienne
Et les années qui s'enchainent nous éloignent
Tous ces mots qu'on enterre pour ne pas que le cœur témoigne
J'voudrais lui dire que je n'ai manqué de rien
Que je suis fier d'etre son fils et que j'attends de meilleurs lendemains
Et tant pis si on a pas pu se connaitre ici
Sans doute qu'on sera plus proche dans une autre vie

I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling
Giving flying falling, fighting, crying, living, writing when you love me

Je suis parti de mon bled forcé sous les bruits de balles

J'ai le flow de LL Cool J quand j'ai besoin de loves
J'ai une main sur mes proches l'autre sur une femme
J'ai une main sur le microphone l'autre sur une arme
Le succès est de taille mais faut garder nos repères
Plus belle sera la médaille plus lourd sera le revers
J'écris ces quelques lignes car souvent je m'y perd
La défaite est orpheline la victoire a mille pères
J'ai un œil sur nos vie un œil sur le monde
Un œil sur mon fils un œil sur la montre
Ma vie sans la foule triste anesthésie
Quand je soufre pour vous je souffre avec plaisir

Marginal dans vos stats, (sage et dans vos stades)
Mets-moi sur un pied d'estale, y'a-t-il un coin d'paradis pour les squalls
Viens pas rater dans nos squats
En moyenne y'a autant d'caille dans nos poches que de cailleras dans des Porsches Cayen
Ma boite crânienne abrite mes cauchemars
Tu vois c'est pas ma carrière qui va effacer mes fautes man
Trop de fois on s'acharne à se poignarder
Stop la mascarade c'est entre camarade qu'on aime se canarder
Ca va barder, nouveau projet, tu vois qu'on fait des progrès
On veut tenir les objectifs qu'on promet
Mais sans se compromettre, dans le game on se promène
Le geste tu le connais : plus de money, plus de problèmes
On oublis pas ce proverbe, les frères qui le profèrent
Se trainent entre les procès, guette c'est ainsi que l'on procède
Aucun de nous n'est prophète et seul dieu nous protège
La route est longue inchalla on se verra à la prochaine
On brille sur les pochettes, le biz nous intéresse
Mais difficile de repérer le paradis avec un GPS
En despi mes respects à S-PI
Ice Criminel et Prim's, malsain de corps et sain d'esprit

Dédicacé à mon équipe Bomaye Musik
La famille en Afrique, les frères et sœurs au casse pipe
Une spécial pour mes frelots du 95
Et une pensée pour les soldats que la vie nous a arrachée : AMINE

On vit en marge mais on ne lâche rien (en marge et on ne lâche rien)
On taffe pour ne pas s'plaindre (on taffe pour ne pas s'plaindre )
On vit en marge mais on ne lâche rien (en marge et on ne lâche rien)
On taffe pour ne pas s'plaindre (on taffe pour ne pas s'plaindre )

Youssoupha,Entourage,/y/youssoupha/entourage_21465105.html,"Entre poème et vulgarité
J'nique mes rêves, et je ne crois pas aux chaînes de solidarité
Chacun pour soi, la pression est palpable
On est tous solitaire mais on se soigne par le partage
Envoie ce son à 3 personnes de ton entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes de leur entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes de leur entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes et ainsi de suite

J'suis en pleine fuite, au moment où j'te parle
Faut pas qu'je sois en pleine cuite, que le bon Dieu m'épargne
J'me répare malgré la rue et ses méfaits
Dans une époque où ce qui est cru est plus important que ce qui est vrai
Tout ce qui m'effraie, c'est les refrés que nos légendes gênent
L'ultime séjour, les mauvais jours pour les gens que j'aime
Mon oxygène, c'est quand je veille près de vous
Et mon public est somnambule, je rappe des histoires à dormir debout
Alors j'me bouge entre dédales et cris d'colère
Entre étoiles et vie d'bohême, entre meilleurs freestyles et pires poèmes
J'ai mille problèmes, tant de soucis mais tellement d'inspi'
Si j'avais eu un psy, il aurait eu besoin d'un psy

Tout ça m'inspire pour vivre et lutter, mes rimes sont réputées
Mais ce n'sont pas mes rimes qui vont vous éduquer
Ce rap game est truqué comme une pub
Ils prétendent tous faire du lourd alors je reviens léger comme une plume
Le passé lourd comme une enclume, mes démons me l'apprennent
Demain c'est loin, notre futur c'est la seconde d'après
J'étais pas prêt, sorti des bas-fonds
L'histoire, y'a ceux qui la lisent, ceux qui l'écrivent, et y'a ceux qui la font
Toucher l'plafond, rêveur et indépendant
Être patient, c'est pas attendre, pour moi, c'est agir en attendant

Alors pendant que ce pays me prend pour un intrus
J'prends mon temps, en dilettante, laisse tourner l'instru'
J'suis paro comme un stup' sur le déclin
Selon l'humeur, j'écris des vers à moitié vides, ou à moitié pleins
Plein d'ironie, mes contradictions deviennent des impasses
Moi, j'suis un genre d'alcoolique avec une licence IV
Je suis d'une puissance calme, ne porte pas de gun
Silencieuses sont les batailles, alors fermez vos gueules
Vous n'êtes pas seuls, n'ayez pas peur, on tolère tous les genres
J'fais pas du rap pour les rappeurs, j'fais du rap pour les gens
C'est pour les bêtes et méchants, les têtes et les jambes
Les thèmes, et les textes de légende
Qu'on a écrit pour s'engager
Même si je sais qu'on peut avoir le bon message tout en restant un mauvais messager
J'viens cracher mes états d'âmes, et mes cas d'conscience
Y'a que les connards qui vont croire que c'est du rap conscient
Pourtant, j'n'ai pas confiance, même en mes propres dires
Entre rires de déprime et larmes de crocodiles
Pas de gros deal, que des risques forts

Maintenant qu'j'ai plus de maison d'disques, j'ai une maison de disques d'or
Triste sort face au charbon, il fallait du cran
Mais je cherche pas à être bon, je cherche à être grand
J'ai pas de clan, j'préfère éviter, parano
Je crois toujours aux mensonges et doute souvent de la vérité
Quelle idée, vu qu'ici je tourne dans le même schéma
Parfois, je doute, parfois, je pense à retourner chez moi
Laissez-moi libérer mon gospel

La France ne reconnaît pas les communautés mais nous traite comme telles
Quand les gens sont boycottés, forcément, ils se lassent
Quand on met les gens de côté, forcément, ils s'éloignent
C'est pas les lois qui font les hommes, c'est l'inverse
On témoigne sans respect, un signe de paix sans l'index
Sans déc, les beaux parleurs peuvent mentir, c'est les actions qui comptent
J'écoute pas ce que les gens disent, je regarde ce qu'ils font
J’m'en bats de ce qu'ils sont, j'ne vois qu'un cœur
Quand on voyage, le monde devient plus petit alors il fait moins peur
Viens, on prend de l'ampleur, quoi, viens, on fait une pause
Et, si y'a quelqu'un près de toi, check-le de l'épaule
Et je me pose, authentique dès le départ
C'est plus facile d'assumer ce qu'on est que d'imiter ce qu'on n'est pas

Que Dieu m'épargne de l'aigreur de perdre ma voix
Et qu'il m'épargne de l'erreur de perdre ma foi
Vous êtes ma flamme, je suis fou et malhonnête
Mais, tous les jours, je me soigne et j'apprends à vous connaître
Comme dit le poète : je le cite et je le chante
Faudrait essayer d'être heureux, ne serait ce que pour donner l'exemple
Ça tourne comme un sample, de Paris à Dakar
L'amour nous manque, prends ce texte comme une Sadaqa
On reste calme avant le carnage, qui m'aime me suive
Je cherche la paix pour mon Karma, moi-même, je suis

Bipolaire entre poème, et vulgarité
J'nique mes rêves, et je n'crois pas aux chaînes de solidarité
Chacun pour soi, la pression est palpable
On est tous solitaire mais on se soigne par le partage
Envoie ce son à 3 personnes de ton entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes de leur entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes de leur entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes de leur entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes de leur entourage
Qui l'enverront à 3 personnes et ainsi d'suite"
Youssoupha,Espérance De Vie,/y/youssoupha/esp+rance+de+vie_21464391.html,"Appelle-moi Youss' on se connaît
Prim's, on se connaît
Lyriciste Bantou, mais avant tout, on se connaît
Black, Beur, Babtou, de partout, on se connaît
""Parle-nous d'amour avant de nous parler de monnaie, Youss'""
C'est ce que me disent les an-ienc', les daronnes
Loin des pinces et des charognes
Et même en iench', je n'ai qu'une seule parole
Quand vient la mort, on t'enterre sans tes milliards
Est-ce que t'as déjà vu un coffre-fort à l'arrière d'un corbillard?
Encore ignare, on m'a dit que le savoir est une arme
Mon frère en prison m'a dit que le parloir est une larme
Aux hommes, aux femmes, enfermés loin des palais
Et qui m'ont apporté leur flamme lors de mes concerts en maisons d'arrêt
Je suis dans l'arène, on me parraine, mais j'ai le trac
Et à ce qu'il paraît on nous traque
Je disparais après ce track, putain!
Après la trêve, je ne sors plus
Comment veux-tu que je mène une vie de rêve alors que je ne dors plus?
Pour un peu d'or pur, on devient vite des ordures
Et tu le sais déjà, y a des dégâts, les désaccords durent
L'argent incite les hypocrites à faire semblant
Ils oublieront que je suis Noir quand je leur signerai des chèques en blanc
Check l'ambiance, la musique est mélancolique
Mais tu peux entrer dans la danse si ton esprit est encore libre
Je délire, mais je me délivre des grandes gueules, loin des grosses bouches
Je suis plutôt du genre ""Enfant seul"" demande à Ox' Pucc'
Ils osent tous dire que le ghetto c'est cool, téma
Les mômes poussent pendant que les métaux s'écroulent, et moi
Je vois leurs sourires tout jaunes
La rue nous tue, certains la traitent comme une mère,
Alors je l'appelle ""Véronique Courjault""
Pour toutes les zones, loin du pays des merveilles
Ce pays est beau ? Va dire ça aux gens de Montfermeil
Je m'éveille, rêve de plage pour les petits reufs, pas d'une terre infâme
Car faut pas croire qu'on fait du surf sur un terrain vague
Mais comment on s'évade? On vient déjà de loin
On était déjà dans les vapes quand on avait vingt ans de moins
Dis-leur qu'on n'est pas fêlés, les médias n'en parlent pas
Marre de regarder la télé car la télé ne nous regarde pas
Et ils nous parlent de consommer plus à Noël
Si ils pouvaient, ils nous mettraient même des spots de pub dans nos rêves
Même cette vie devient commerce, entre risque et ristourne
Va dire aux commères que je veux vivre de mes disques et de mes discours
Je cours pour ne pas tomber comme un domino
Si dans ce biz faut le bras long, je suis la Vénus de Milo
Et quand mon stylo porte plainte, c'est pas de la provocation
On me conseille de faire le point, je fais des points d'interrogation
Pourquoi je n'ai pas peur de ma mort mais de celle de mes proches?
Pourquoi Marianne a des remords, mais qu'est-ce qu'elle me reproche?
Sur l'identité nationale, qu'on me corrige
Mais mes ancêtres avaient-ils vraiment la gueule de Vercingétorix?
Moi j'ai la rhétorique du bled et de nos banlieues froides
Mon cœur est si torride, que je ne peux pas tout dire en deux phrases
Alors je frappe les esprits au bon endroit
Je suis un éternel incompris, donc seul l'Éternel me comprendra
Ça part en drame, l’orgueil est une maladie
Quand des hommes et des femmes pensent avoir le monopole du Paradis
Fuck les religieux mégalos
Je préfère un athée qui se comporte comme un croyant
Qu'un croyant qui se comporte comme un salaud
Je me jette à l'eau avec ce texte un peu bavard
J'ai payé le taro, mais la crise a fini par m'avoir
Je voulais savoir comment faire plus de thunes dans le circuit
J'ai demandé à la Lune, elle m'a pris pour Nicola Sirkis
Ne sois pas si triste, mauvais karma
Quand tous les rêves de la street viennent à tourner au carnage
Car moi, le temps des briques m'a dépassé
Et la vie, c'est comme un Bic,
Tu peux bien faire une croix sur tes erreurs, mais pas les effacer
Trop fâché, mais assez ivre pour sourire
Je sais pas si l’espoir fait vivre, mais moi il m'empêche de mourir
Et l'amour peut me nourrir, d'un coup mon pouls s'accélère
Je veux être un homme heureux, histoire de chialer comme William Sheller
Et si parfois, j'ai l'air loin de la tourmente, Maman
Ma vie est belle, mais il y a toujours toi qui manques, Maman
Je pourrais chanter comme je suis fier, mais sans prétention
Dieu accepte surtout les prières, pas les belles chansons
La seule rançon, c'est le salut des gens qu'on aime, Amin
Pas de tension, on gagne tous à se connaître, Amin
Avoir toutes les vertus est impossible
J'ai une pensée pour tous les gens que j'ai perdus, pour tous les vôtres aussi
Le nombre de mesures de ce texte, si t'y penses
Est juste égal à l'âge moyen de l'espérance de vie en France
Mais ce n'est pas une question d'âge, de chiffres et de stats
Moi je te parle surtout de rage, de kif et d'espoir
Espérance de vie"

Fire

Is anybody listenin'?
The city's on fire
The town is burnin' down
But there's no water

Eight million citizens, nobody's really listenin'
Nobody's really watchin', eight million ignorant
Eighty thousand teachers, way too many preachers
And thousand of leaders, but nobody leads us
Three million beggars, four million pleasers
We are the world but they don't really need us
Ghetto got no funds, ghetto ain't no fun
Ghetto kid's got guns, ghetto got no one
Ghetto got no funds, ghetto ain't no fun
Ghetto kid's got guns, 'cause they got no one

One love pour mes soldats
One love pour mes petites sœurs
Prisent en otage avec une bombe à la place du cœur

Is anybody listenin'?
The city's on fire
The town is burnin' down
But there's no water

Is anybody listenin'?
The city's on fire
The town is burnin' down
But there's no water

On m'a appris à haïr
Mais je vous aime quand même
On m'a appris à trahir
Mais je vous relève quand même
Je ne suis pas venu seul
Viens ma sœur que je t'emmène
Je n'ai pas ma grande gueule
Pas de gun que des emmerdes
Viens que je t'emmène viens que je t'enlève
Viens que je te sauve
Que je te cause et que je t’engrène
Graine de colère, mon ghetto est sous pression
Jour de tonnerre peu d'réponse trop de questions
Nos terres parle au pression qu'on tombe de sommeil
Comment nous faire de l'ombre
On est les enfants du soleil
Viens, viens on reste dur
Que notre bruit dure quand même
Même entre les murs qu'on se murmure quand même
Viens, viens on brûle le mic putain
Parce que ma rime est on fire
Ma vie est on fire, ma ville est on fire
Grève, guerre des nerfs
Démerde, vé-nère, brailleur
Grave besoin d'air, j’émerge besoin d'ailleurs
Donc je me répète, ma rime est on fire
Ma vie est on fire, ma ville est on fire

The city's on fire
The town is burnin' down
L'amour en cendre, une bombe à la place du cœur

Nobody's listenin' to the sound of the street
The clamour, the violence, the sirens, the heat
Five million scared, three out of fire million desperate
One million's hurt, thousands arrested

Allume ton esprit, sors de leurs gifles
Relève ton estime, sors de leurs chiffres
J'enchaîne les coups de gueule
Mais on ne libère pas un peuple
Un peuple se libère tout seul
Fire

The city's on fire
The town is burnin' down
There ain't no sounds of silence
Tell me who's gonna help us now?
Nobody's listenin'
Eight million people dying
Looking for shelter
But they got nowhere to go

Is anybody listenin'?
Allez leur dire que ma ville est on fire
The town is burning down
Et j'ai une bombe à la place du cœur
Is anybody listenin'?
Rien à faire ma vie est on fire
The town is burning down
Et j'ai une bombe à la place du cœur
Is anybody listenin'?
Aller leur crier que ma ville est on fire
The town is burning down
Et j'ai une bombe à la place du cœur

Moi, je vous fais pas la guerre mais le game est déjà crispé
Les rageux me désignent et Noir Désir est déjà pisté
Le choc est obligé, je suis négligé des journalistes, et
Cette fois c'est plus des blagues, mettez mon blaze sur toutes les listes
Tous les gars que j'estime font de l'esquive quand y'a les kisdés
C'est le son de la Gesteam, et pas celui de Dipset
Sam's et S-Pi, trop de-spee comme dirait Myst et
Tu vois qu'on charbonne, voilà l'album après la mixtape
J'ai réussi à mixer le Geste et le sérieux
Les guests et les curieux, les bests et les furieux
Et je baise les injurieux, en avance dans ma fast life
J'avais déjà écrit ""L'Effet Papillon"" depuis l'époque de Rap Line
J'ai mis des pipelines entre New York et le bled
Et quand je rap live, y'a des pull up et des begs
Une casse-ded' pour les caïds au ballon
Moi je touche pas la cocaïne, moi j'ai le nez dans la poudre à canon
Me dis pas non (Nan!) Je suis plus un ghetto youth (Nan!)
Mais j'oublie pas les déferrés qui ont la mort aux trousses (Nan!)
Et personne ne peut m'effrayer maintenant que j'ai le juice (Nan!)
Et même ton rappeur préféré ne rappe pas mieux que Youss' (Nan!)
Beetle-Beetle-Youss', dis le trois fois, j’apparais
Ils ont la frousse, je n'ai qu'un micro comme seul appareil
À ce qui paraît, l'habit fait pas le moine, la gueule fait pas le millionnaire
Je connais des aveugles qui sont visionnaires
Ex-prisonnière, ma musique est en vale-ca
Les fards-ca, le fracas, le braquage, le vacarme, hé!
On a l'air calme, mais on compte les loves
Chez nous la Guerre Froide, c'est quand on cache les kalashs dans le congélo
À ceux qui font des loves, à ceux qui vont vers l'autre
À ceux qui font des fautes, même ceux qui sont pas des nôtres
Le poids des mots, inutile de nous pomper
Tu sais mon frère, en Enfer ça sert à rien d'appeler les pompiers
Et je repars du bon pied pour grailler dans l'arène
Travailler, vous le voyez, c'est Bomayé qui me parraine
À ce qu'il parait, t'es un gangster, un héros qui deale
Tu fais le Black Panther, t'as le charisme de Hello Kitty
Ni-ni-ni-nique le reste, c'est le Prim's qui revient
Et vu que ça part en geste, y'aura sûrement pas de refrain (Non!)
Reufré la rage d'un piranha
Je fais pas du rap moi, je ""rom pom-pom-pom-pom-pom"", demande à Rihanna
Paris a mal à coup de bim-bim, braque tous les Brinks-Brinks
Raque pour le bling-bling, Black désir
C'est l'album, et cette fois-ci, c'est la bonne
Branche le M.I.C. d'abord, revoici-voici la donne (Oh!)
J'ai des doutes sur ce que la rue m'enseigne
J'ai l'insolence de Phil Hellmuth avec le sang-froid de Gus Hansen
Je suis passé du block à la scène
Si y'a plus d'instru', on fait des battements comme un concert de rock à l'ancienne
Et je lâche pas j'enchaîne,

Faut qu'on brasse-brasse, Sam's est dans la pièce poto
Viens on geste un passe-passe
Sans clash-clash, j'arrive, me place-place, avec classe-classe
Nos phases méritent d'être classiques comme une paire de Nastase
Comprennent pas nos phrases ni nos
Gestes, ni nos frasques, ni nos
Textes, ici y'a pas d'minots
Gee Money, Brown Nino
Sénégal-business sur les écrans

Ici on aime se saper chic, mais chez nous ""D&G"" ça veut dire ""Dieu est grand""
Oh! Laisse pousser l'instru' que je la saigne
Des paroles claires comme l'eau de roche? Non!
Je viens de dégueuler la Seine
Mais dès qu'on nous harcèle
Notre son t'arrache l'oreille comme Mister Blond d' ""Réservoir Dogs""
Ma gueule, imagine la scène (Nyama!)
Bons baisers de la Gesteam
Depuis que je sais que l'argent rend beau,
Pour moi Booder ressemble à James Dean
L’Afrique est bafouée dans leurs livres
Nos mères ont tellement frotté le sol,
Pourraient être des championnes de curling
Je te le dis, le bif, l'honneur, oublie le reste
Fuck leur discipline, mec la force est dans le Geste
Mec la force est dans le Geste
Force est, force est dans le Geste
Fuck leur politique, subir l'affront c'est dans nos gènes (Nyama!)
J'explose, tout droit sorti de Province
Paname j'aime pas ta mode, je te le dis, tes jeans sont trop minces
La réussite, un corps d'athlète avec un petit zob
Un jour t'es riche, demain tu crèves, demande à Steve Jobs
Je te le dis, le bif, l'honneur, oublie le reste
Fuck leur discipline, mec la force est dans le Geste
Mec la force est dans le Geste
Force est, force est dans le Geste
Fuck leur discipline, mec la force est dans le Geste

A mon père, le plus grand, le plus grand,
À mes tantes vous êtes aussi ce que j'ai de plus chère au monde,
Ça fait beaucoup de richesses, à mes sœurs, à mes frères,
À la mémoire de ma mère, de ma grand-mère,
De mes tantes, de tantine Démita, XXX,
De Mohammed Koulibali et tout les proches qu'on a perdu
Durant ces longues années et pendant les mois de la conception de ce disque,
Que Dieu les apaisent amine, amine, amine

Chaque visage que l'on touche
Chaque étranger sur la route
Tous ces espoirs émis dans le doute
C'est un peu de tout ça qui écrit l'histoire

J'raconte les épreuves accomplies
Les rêveurs incompris
Les misères, les hivers, 
Les p'tits frères en son-pri
Les décès, les écoles
Les excès, les alcools
Les machines, les racines, 
De martin et malcolm

Les tounqueurs, les palaces
Les coups de coeur, les palabres
Les ruelles, les plus belles
Les lumières de paname
Les one love ready, les bad-boy diddy
Les burqa, les coupables
Les 2pac et biggy

Les absents, les soupirs
Les accents, les sourires
Les barbares, les bazars, 
Les bagarres, les fous-rires
Les délits de sale gueule
Les délires, les battle
Les rançons, les tensions
Les chansons de michael


Que des histoires vraies

Refrain

J'raconte le futur, les heures passent, 
La luxure, les queurs-bra
Les teigneux, les haineux
Les émeutes du 93
Les bourgeois, les vres-pau
Les coups-bas, les repos
Les poupées, les loupés
Les couplets de renaud

La flicaille, les problèmes
Les freestyles, les poèmes
Les cdistes, les grévistes
Les vraies vies de bohème
Les clichés, les big loves
Les fichés, les big-boss
Les amours, le glamour
Le rap lourd sans beat-box

Les honneurs, les malaises
Les bonheurs, le mal-être
Les rancoeurs, les grands coeurs
Les grandeurs du maghreb
Les confrères, les potos
Les concerts, les pogos
Les douceurs, les douleurs
Les couleurs du togo

(Que des histoires vraies)

J'raconte le coeur, la terre, 
Les soeurs, les mères
Que des histoires vraies
J'raconte la joie, les pleurs
L'espoir, les peurs
Que des histoires vraies

J'raconte les femmes, les fautes
Les uns, les autres
Que des histoires vraies
J'raconte la rue, le ciel
La lune, les rêves
Que des histoires vraies

Youssoupha,Irréversible,/y/youssoupha/irr+versible_21464411.html,"Panique pas, y'a qu'à l'envers qu'on peut me lire
De-de-de un, je revendique le droit de gester et de me contredire
Je te raconte le deal, le rap compte me kill
""Noir Désir"", c'est les chroniques d'un rappeur solo contre mille
Je compte revenir après tout ce que j'ai enduré
Et sur ce son, si je pars en vrille, Julien y'a qu toi qui pourras me censurer
Rap d'enculé, la vie de cachot est écœurante
Je suis incompris comme un manchot qui, chez les flics, dépose une main courante
Un coup je rentre, un coup je me chie dessus
Un coup je tente, un coup je ne pige plus
Intolérant, je me dispute
Je vise plus les plans galère, je me téléporte
Et rêve que le montant de mon salaire soit un numéro de téléphone
Faites péter les formes
Faites péter le bif
Vu qu'en affaires faut de la force
Car le dernier mot est souvent un chiffre
Et souvent j'insiste, j'ai pas la bonne mine
Mais empêche-moi de rêver, moi je t'empêcherai de dormir
Et je domine, mais j'ai perdu du temps
Et j'ai même perdu du poids, mais ce n'est même pas le régime Dukan
Moi j'ai du cran, incompris jusqu'à la fin
Ils disent que je suis anorexique alors que je faisais une grève de la faim
Je fais pas la feinte, je tente pas de gruger
Je voulais parler de nos plaintes, je finis sur le banc des accusés
Accusé pour un speech
Dans un pays où les plus honorables soutiennent la morale de Roman Polanski
Trop pensif, me raconte pas de ragots
Offensif, les rues de Paname profitent, mais je me pavane trop
Les gens sont paranos ou lunatiques
Si je rappe ""Retour aux Pyramides"", ils diront que je suis un Illuminati
Ce n'est qu'une rime active, je n'en ferai pas un drame
Depuis que mon âme est partie, j'ai vraiment maigri de 21 grammes
Ça devient grave, est-ce que c'est la France que tu veux?
Boulevard Auriol, des familles crament, mais bon l'État n'y a vu que du feu
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, j'y vais direct, pas de ricochet
Si le savoir est une arme, alors l'ignorance est un godemiché
Que les poucaves oublient les consonnes, on le sait
Avec un canon dans la bouche, y'a que les voyelles qu'on sait prononcer
Les rageux poussent mon buzz, me faire détester est une chance
J'écris mes textes entre l'envie de gester et l'urgence
L'intelligence est un étrange appareil
Et quand tu parles avec un con, peut-être qu'il est en train de faire pareil
À ce qu'il paraît, on a la poisse ici
Et si le monde te malmène, repense à Mohamed Bouazizi
Avec le temps, les armes changent, mais j'ai les mêmes cibles
Je sais que ça vous dérange, mais rien n'est irréversible
C'est ça même!"

Allez faites péter les claps, je suis revenu
Gesteur, en quinze années de rap, je suis devenu
Toujours pas de Porsche Cayenne dans mes revenus
Depuis que je rappe en Super Saiyan, je suis chevelu
Vous êtes prévenus, Youss' a changé
Ghetto blaster, Gesteur avec un grand ""G""
En danger casse-pipe, hip-hop dans nos veines
Je fais tellement de classiques qu'ils finiront par m'appeler ""Beethoven""
Le ghetto veille sur les lâches et les mauvais rôles
J'ai quitté le quartier, j'ai plus l'âge de traîner dans les halls
Pendant que les thugs feintent, y'a pas de bluff zinc'
J'étais clando, j'ai pas tourné le dos au gens du Neuf-Cinq
Les reufs' trinquent, se demandent si je souffre ou pas
Je n'ai pas peur, les autres rappeurs font du sous-Booba
Je plaide coupable, en ce qui me concerne
Beaucoup de choses ont changé quand j'ai vu mon public en concert

Appelle-moi Youss' on se connaît, Prim's on se connaît
Lyriciste Bantou, mais avant tout, on se connaît
Black, Beur, Babtou, de partout, on se connaît
Parle-nous d'amour avant de nous parler de monnaie

Prim's on te connaît, Youss' on te connaît
Lyricist Bantou, mais avant tout, on te connaît
Blacks, Beurs, Babtous, de partout, tu les connais
C'est vrai que t'as changé, mais malgré tout je te reconnais

Et avant qu'on ne me regrette, avant qu'on ne pleure ma dépouille
J'ai promis à mon cœur et à ma tête de moins écouter mes couilles
Faut que je me grouille de faire des thunes, cartonner à long terme
Fuck la rancune, moi j'ai même pardonné à mon père
Pour mes compères, je dérange parce que j'en veux plus
Et comme je change, le rap français ne me ressemble plus
Car seuls mes classiques laisseront une trace
Je ne suis pas un d'ces MC basiques qui pourraient crever pour un Planète Rap
N'aie pas le trac, c'est le changement
Je traque jamais tendrement
À chaque nouveau track, c'est le tremblement
Je pense à faire du cash, à mon ness-bi
Donc ne me parlez plus de clash, j'ai arrêté avec, Ah!
Et je ne suis pas dupe
Comme dit Rocé
""Je suis l'un des rares MC de trente piges à rapper comme un adulte""
Et je me catapulte loin de vos conseils
Beaucoup de choses ont changé quand j'ai vu mon public en concert

Appelle-moi Youss' on se connaît, Prim's on se connaît
Lyriciste Bantou, mais avant tout, on se connaît
Black, Beur, Babtou, de partout, on se connaît
Parle-nous d'amour avant de nous parler de monnaie

Prim's on te connaît, Youss' on te connaît
Lyricist Bantou, mais avant tout, on te connaît
Blacks, Beurs, Babtous, de partout, tu les connais
C'est vrai que t'as changé, mais malgré tout je te reconnais

Ils veulent me crosser, me marbrer
J'ai la force de la madre
Je les laisse faire les boss, moi je bosse comme un padre
Un gosse à encadrer, je sais pourquoi les parents stressent
Avant je cherchais à être en place, maintenant je cherche des places en crèche
Toujours dans la brèche avec mes gars actifs
Mais j'ai honte pour mes ancêtres quand j'oublie ma galaxie
Les gars de la street m'appellent ""le Lyriciste Bantou""
Mais j'ai tant négligé l'Afrique, j'ai dû devenir un peu Babtou
Moi je suis de partout, origines inégales
J'ai retracé mon parcours pour retrouver le Sénégal
Je ne pense plus à l'illégal, mais la monnaie me racole
L’adrénaline me régale depuis que j'ai ralenti l'alcool
Je décolle, mais tout reste à faire, je suis posté
Entre la fureur de mes concerts et la pudeur de la mosquée
Je refuse de me bloquer, ça vous consterne
Vous êtes choqués depuis que voyez mon public en concert

Appelle-moi Youss' on se connaît, Prim's on se connaît
Lyriciste Bantou, mais avant tout, on se connaît
Black, Beur, Babtou, de partout, on se connaît
Parle-nous d'amour avant de nous parler de monnaie

Prim's on te connaît, Youss' on te connaît

Youssoupha,L' Amour,/y/youssoupha/l+amour_21464387.html,"Nouvel album, de l'amour dans les yeux
Je peux pas craindre les hommes,
Ils pourraient se croire comparables à Dieu
Que mes aïeux freinent ma chute, de toute façon
J'ai tué ma vie d'adulte avant l'enterrement de ma vie de garçon
Comme un glaçon, le game est figé
La passion d'un prodige j'ai
Garçon, voilà une ration pour ton DJ
J'aurais pu die black crazy
Mais je braille par plaisir
Et j'ai appelé mon bail ""Noir Désir""
C'est ça même

Prim's Parolier, le Lyriciste Bantou
De l'amour, ce n'est que le commencement

Un jour l'école m'influençait moins
Comment leur dire que les poèmes d'Apollinaire
Ont moins de verve que ""Demain c'est loin""?
Y'a des témoins sur mes fautes
Mais à quoi sert de faire des maths,
Si on peut pas compter les uns sur les autres?
Laisse pas tes complexes te mettre à l'amende
Bien sûr que le meilleur rappeur de France a un cheveu sur la langue
Mais quand je dégaine il n'y a pas de lol
Moi je pourrais vous faire la guerre avec un ""One Love""

Yeah
C'est pour les quartiers d'France, du Maghreb et d'Amérique latine
Pour mes Ouest-Af' et pour mes Bantous

Yeah
J'étais parti en vrille, car je voulais prouver
Papa m'a dit que c'est parfois en se perdant qu'on finit enfin par se retrouver
Et moi j'emmerde ceux qui ne m'ont pas épargné
Bizarrement, depuis que je n'ai plus rien à perdre, je ne fais que gagner
Inégalé pendant que le game s’entre-tue
J'suis en clash avec moi-même, et ce qui ne me tue pas me rend têtu
Le savais-tu qu'on les gêne, donc ils nous enlèvent?
Geste pour les têtes en l'air
Et jette un ""Y"" en l'air
Jette, jette, jette, jette un ""Y"" en l’air
Jette, jette, jette, jette un ""Y"" en l’air

Ma sœur,
Et j'invite toute la foule en guest
J'ai la rime flow Winchester
C'est pour tous nos absents, les grands enfants et pour les Gesteurs
Une dédicace au Congo, Africa dans mon logo
Mon public est magique, quand je m'agite il part en pogo
Y'a du feu dans mon karma
J'ai les yeux de la mama
Elle m'a dit ""Oui, tu peux"", mais bien avant Barack Obama
Un stylo dans le fusil, Philo est dans le building
Prêt à défourailler, qui peut grailler Bomayé Musik?
Mais dis-moi qui!
Je fais mon beurre pendant que le temps s'écoule
L'avantage avec le buzz, même ceux qui ne t'aiment pas t'écoutent
N'attends pas que je m'écroule quand les vivants se montrent
Celle qui me tient encore debout n'est même plus de ce monde

Yeah, uh
T'avais jamais entendu de rap français!

Tant qu'il y a de l'amour tu sais
Tant qu'il y a de l'amour
Tant qu'il y a de l'amour tu sais

Faudrait que je change l'enfoiré que je vois dans mon miroir
Mais trop lâche pour assumer d'abord
Comme vous tous, je me nourris de préjugés, trop rancunier, alors
J'en veux aux policiers qui me prennent pour un bandit, sache
Qu'ils sont arrogants et me fouillent devant les gens qui passent
Fuck ""Les Experts""! Je ne serai jamais flic
Et si un jour, j'étais un flic, je serais Dexter
J'en veux aux mecs de mon quartier sous alcool
Qui bicravent dans le hall, devant mes nièces qui reviennent de l'école
J'en veux aux profs qui voulaient m'orienter vers les ténèbres
Qui m'ont fait lire des auteurs qui me traitaient de nègre
J'en veux aux Arabes qui me disent qu'on a les mêmes valeurs
Mais qui s'empressent de dire que ma religion c'est la leur
Ceux qui m'appellent khouya quand on est seuls
Et qui crèvent de jalousie quand ils me croisent avec une de leur sœurs
J'en veux aux Blancs, cyniques et condescendants
Qui pensent que le monde ne se voit qu'à travers les yeux de l'Occident
Je préfère répéter que je suis noir, comme ça y'a pas de risque
Qu'ils disent un jour que j'étais blanc comme ils l'ont dit du Christ

On a des ghettos dans la tête qui nous rendent solitaires
Comment changer le monde si on n'est même pas solidaires?
On fait des erreurs, mais on préfère rejeter la faute
Et on se contentera de dire que ""l’Enfer, c'est les autres""

Comment changer le monde si on n'est même pas solidaires?
On fait des erreurs, mais on préfère rejeter la faute
Et on se contentera de dire que ""l’Enfer, c'est les autres""

J'en veux à mon public qui dit me soutenir à la mort
Mais qui m'oubliera au prochain rappeur à la mode
J'en veux à ""Ni putes ni soumises""
Ça me déçoit que Fadela Amara fasse carrière sur la mort de Sohane
J'en veux aux Noirs, Afrique, Antilles, on se laisse pourrir
Car les Noirs veulent le Paradis, mais ne veulent pas mourir
Te parlent d'unité, mais quand les portes se referment
Chez le marabout, t'as guidé le mauvais œil sur ton propre frère
Un destin qui s'enlise, et les gens disent
""Si tu veux cacher un truc à un Noir, faut le marquer dans un livre""
J'en veux à la femme africaine, car je la prône
Ma sœur t'es belle avec ta peau d'ébène, pourquoi t'éclaircir la peau?
J'en veux tellement à tous ceux qui manquent de modération
Qui vont cautionner le sionisme et ses aberrations
Ceux qui n'oublient pas l'histoire des tyrannies
Mais qui font les amnésiques sur les massacres en Cisjordanie
J'en veux aux huissiers qui nous bougent, au blues de nos mamas
J'en veux à Mobutu, à Bush, à Barack Obama
J'en veux à Osama, à BHL, à Benoît XVI
J'en veux au monde entier, y'a que mon peura qui m'apaise

On a des ghettos dans la tête qui nous rendent solitaires
Comment changer le monde si on n'est même pas solidaires?
On fait des erreurs mais on préfère rejeter la faute
Et on se contentera de dire que ""l'Enfer c'est les autres""

""Quel est votre définition de l'intolérance?""
""C'est le refus de reconnaître la liberté des autres,
C'est-à-dire leur droit à exister différemment.""
""C'est bien simple, c'est une maladie de la différence.
On passe de l'indifférence à l'opposition,
Et puis après on passe à l'exclusion.""

En fait, je m'en veux à moi-même, entre mes crises et mes caprices
Je cache mon mal-être, et dissimule mes cicatrices
Et je fais l'artiste derrière un masque
Car c'est facile de faire la morale quand on est planqué derrière un mic
Qu'est-ce que j'en sais du mal des autres, en vérité?
À force de vivre dans un clip, j'ai perdu le sens des réalités
Je m'en veux de faire partie des lâches de ce monde
De perdre mes repères, de ne pas être un père digne de ce nom
Et plus je monte, moins mes proches profitent de mon aide
Et puis j'ai honte, vu que j'ai carrément zappé mon bled
L’homme est un loup pour l'Homme, et je suis un prédateur
Je prie seulement quand tout va mal, toujours ingrat envers mon Créateur
À tous les gens que j'ai jugés, condamnés trop vite
À tous mes sentiments grugés, à mes clichés trop vides
Le Paradis, ça se mérite, et j'accumule les fautes
Ma mauvaise foi me fera dire que ""l’Enfer, c'est les autres""

« Fiston! Vas y tu me fais honneur « 
Un raciste tout fait mon reuf, contre le devil
J’mettrai sa race sous chambres à gaz ou sous les chaînes de slaves
Ne t’attends pas à ce que je sois forcement de segpa
Ma grosse tête gars, c’est faite tricarde dès le placenta
T’attends pas à ce que je garde la peur au ventre
Vu le spectacle
Man, mon rap, apporte plus de résultats que le Smecta
C’est la mort de ce rap qui te fais marcher à reculons
Y’a pas écrit voleur ou insulteur de femme sur le curriculum
C’est la mort de ce rap qui encourage mes man à s’auto-detruire
Fait par le divin, dans ce corps humain du Congo ex-Zaire

Tel que j'suis parti, personne m'arrêtera
Personne, oh no no, ne m'arrêtera
J'ai stoppé la manie d'leur laisser d'l'espace
C'est pour annoncer la mort, mort, de la pe-tra
J'vais tout donner pour pouvoir bouger
Nos lifes en commençant par changer ce game
Tel que je suis parti, personne m'arrêtera
C'est bon annoncez la mort, mort, de la pe-tra

T'as vu une blague dans mes propos?
Pourquoi tu goles-ri quand j'dit que je hais le morceau ""I'm in love with the coco""?
Une life pour mes locos
C'est c'que j'peine à leur faire bouffer pour remplacer les pennes ou l'plat d'alloco

Vénère en veste croco
Ma couleur vous emmerde mais j'suis trop nègre pour le tchoko
Donc retenez bien mes propos
J'suis pas de ton microcosme
Je prie pour l'prochain blanc qui me demande:
""T'as pas d'la coco?""
J'suis ni dealer, ni clodo
La France et moi? Le courant passe tellement mal qu’on dirait la baignoire à Cloclo
J’viens t’expliquer le topo, faire répliquer mes potos
L’instru est découpé encore un couplet qui fait po po!
La gloire essaie de m’échapper faut d’abord que je l’attrape

J’monte l’estime de soit mon gars par la grâce, pas le karma
De Kinshasa à Panama, j’pète les chaînes et les cadenas

Avec une balle dans la tête, je pourrais dormir d'un sommeil de plomb
Et si l'ivresse me racole
N'oublie jamais qu'aucun maître-nageur ne peut m’empêcher de me noyer dans l'alcool
Je refuse de voir les fœtus avortés dans la contrainte
Le rire des soldats qui viennent d'éventrer des femmes enceintes
Il faut bien croire que la paix est impossible
Moi je veux plus voir le nom d'Allah juste à côté d'une ceinture d'explosifs
Je veux pas croire que l'amour puisse faire si mal
Je veux pas voir les sidaïques squelettiques dans leur phase terminale
Est-ce que l'amour, c'est massacrer sa vie?
Est-ce que c'est ça l'amour, un bon père de famille qui va baiser sa fille?
Pourquoi les politiques me laissent indifférent?

Je veux pas voir vos grands-parents que vous avez laissés crever comme des chiens
Moi je veux pas voir les fascistes pédagogues
Qui font des croix sur le passé, et des croix gammées sur des synagogues
Je veux plus entendre ta douleur
Je maudis vos décibels
Vends-moi du rêve, et dis-moi encore que la vie est belle

Paraît que la vie est belle

Nombreux sont les rappeurs, rares sont les lyricistes
Nombreux sont les interprètes, rares sont les artistes
Pourtant le rap doit continuer à dire des choses
À quoi sert notre musique si ce n'est à défendre des causes?
Alors la vie n'est pas toujours belle
Mais en tous cas ce qui est sûr, c'est qu'elle est courte
On n'a plus le temps pour les rimes creuses et sourdes
C'est pourquoi Youssoupha, donne-leur des mots qui éduquent
Des mots qui percutent, mais des mots qui ont un but
Car tant que l'autre rap existe, le nôtre ne doit pas mourir

Demande à Marianne pourquoi elle n'fait que de me battre
Elle à qu'à m'rendre tout l'argent des colonies que je me barre
A la barre on m'demande pourquoi mon art est barbare

Ca parait injuste, ou anormal
Mais dans cette chute tout s'achète surtout les armes et les organes
Normal d'etre sur le vif car c'est cette vie qu'on subie grave
Tout l'monde coure après le beef, tout se biz ou se bicrave
Braves sont les frères qui se battent et qui en bavent
C'est sur cd que je grave le récit de ceux qui les entravent
Le problème central c'est la zermi
Et comme l'argent est une arme les plus riches se croient tout permit

Ils en ont rien à foutre de ce que les gens disent

Ceux qui écrivent à l'encre rouge hémoglobine
Ignorent que le ciel est beau car les bofs nous embobinent
Trop débile, trop fébrile pour bouquiner
Croire en qui ? Trop rancunier, c'est les flics qu'on aime enquiquiner
C'est brooliké mais apprends à cogiter
Le cerveau trop niqué par les idées que t'as vu au JT
Pour t'agiter les medias vendent de la peur
Le choc est immédiat : mort aux barbus et aux rappeurs !
Délit d'orateur en attendant qu'on me crâme
Ici le livre de la vie c'est l'évangile selon l'Oncle Sam
Le savoir est une arme, si t'as envi d'apprendre
Sache que l'Euro est une arme et le monde est toujours à vendre

[Kool Shen]
Le savoir est une arme
Meme stupide, si t'as des sous tu peux t'constituer la plus grande armée
Le monde est à vendre, chassant souvent l'envi d'apprendre
Du fric à prendre effacant l'envi d'attendre

Youssoupha,Le Score,/y/youssoupha/le+score_21466189.html,"Paraît qu'il faut s'y plaire, qu'il faut l'accepter, faut s'y faire
Combien renoncent, choisissent la facilité? La rêver un peu plus belle
Aujourd'hui, ma vie n'est pas celle que j'imaginais
Celle que j'imaginais, je garde la foi
Ne veux pas céder, ne veux pas céder, ne veux pas céder
J'ai dû tenir le coup, lutter, me battre, apprendre à ne pas céder
Ne pas céder, ne pas céder
Rester debout, les poings serrés, résister

J'fais l'tour du monde, mais j'oublie pas ce que la vitesse cache
Qu'en cas de crash, on crève en premier dans la business classe
Avant qu'j'éclate, on m'voyait pas malgré mes sapes XL
J'rappais comme un fantôme, un putain d'MC Patrick Swayze
J'ai plus le time pour les rêves et les regrets, j'me rachète plus, moi
Kinshasa karma, deux cent quarante-trois degrés sous mes baskets Puma
La juge m'accorde un non-lieu, les rageux bavent, oh mon Dieu
Pendant qu'ils ragent, je rappe au Jazz Festival de Montreux
Pendant qu'la critique cause, Philo m'a tout appris, ma gueule
Et, moi, si j'étais né Michael, il serait Quincy Jones
Alors j'viens ici, j'pose, vicieux, t'as failli merder
J'touche les cieux et ma liberté, ambitieux jusqu'à la muerte

Ne veux pas céder, ne veux pas céder, ne veux pas céder
J'ai dû tenir le coup, lutter, me battre, apprendre à ne pas céder
Ne pas céder, ne pas céder
Rester debout, les poings serrés, résister

Entre le cœur, la monnaie, trop de doutes bousillent l'ambiance
Trop d'argent tue l'amour, trop d'amour tue le compte en banque
Diffuse l'info, la nouvelle frappe, c'est mon karma qui l'impose
J'ai tellement d'flow, chaque fois qu'je rappe, on dirait quelqu'un d'autre
Combien de vitrines? Combien de parades?
Combien de victimes? Combien de balafres?
Ils veulent clore notre horizon
Combien de critiques? Combien de barrages?
Alors je pète le score en indépendant
Monsieur l'agent Ramadan, j'suis innocent en attendant le ftour
Faut que j'me valorise, faut que j'm'élève, j’arrête le 'sky
J'suis beaucoup trop célèbre pour être alcoolique anonyme
Continue d'tanguer, tanguer, ma sœur, t'es tankée, tankée
Ils rêvent tous de la vie de gang, je rêve de banquer, banquer

Youssoupha,Les Apparences Nous Mentent,/y/youssoupha/les+apparences+nous+mentent_21465525.html,"Parce que la mort nous donne pas d'préavis, j'suis devenu hardcore et avide vu qu'aujourd'hui c'est l'premier jour du reste de ma vie
J'me fie qu'à mes songes et ma vision car l'etre humain vit d'eau fraiche, de mensonges et de trahisons
J'fais plus confiance à la télé, à la presse, ils disent de nous qu'on est felés, traitent ma religion avec maladresse
Ils nous agressent, manipulent la réalité, et les héros qui nous font sont des bouffons d'télé-réalité
J'fais plus confiance aux cainris et à leurs reves, à force de vivre à leur rythme on finit par se plier à leurs règles
C'est à New York que je suis rentré dans l'arène, loin des clichés MTV B j'ai vu la misère dans les rues d'Harlem
J'fais plus confiance à la France, elle nous accuse d'etre dissipés mais ses dés étaient pipés d'avance
Et j'm'en tape de tous ces rappels à l'ordre, bientôt j'me taille au bled dépenser l'argent de tes allocs
J'fais plus confiance à nos icônes, Ze Pequeno était idiot et Scarface était un toxico
Meme si les parrains de la mafia nous sous-estiment, j'suis le fils à Malcom X, rien à foutre de Jacques Mesrine

J'me méfie de tout et de tout l'monde
Car beaucoup se défilent et trahissent quand le ton monte
J'accumule les tumultes et les tourmentes
Les apparences nous mentent et j'attends le dénouement
(x2)

J'fais plus confiance à ma plume, depuis qu'elle est sortit de la brume mais qu'elle me rapporte de la tune
Elle perpétue mes idées, ma condition, donc j'espère que mes écrits resteront fidèles à mes convictions
J'fais plus confiance à la démocratie, les députés qui m'représentent sont tous issus d'l'aristocratie
Pris en otage, le système nous kidnape et j'oublie pas qu'en 2002 il m'a contraint à voter Chirac
J'fais plus confiance aux rappeurs, la plupart s'inventent une vie d'voyou quand au mic ils deviennent narrateurs
Les vrais bandits se sont déjà arrachés, toi MC tu joues le ouf parce que tu piaves du panaché

J'fais plus confiance aux hommes car selon mes sondages, souvent ils violent leurs filles, battent leurs femmes car souvent ils sont lâches,
Mauvais pères, refusent d'assumer leurs devoirs et la plupart vendraient leurs mères pour une fouf ou pour une heure de gloire
J'fais plus confiance aux femmes, dans la légende certaines ont un chèque dans la tete et une calculette entre les jambes
Elles jugent les gens souvent sur le matériel, ces demoiselles ont plus l'instinct d'fauve que l'instinct maternel

J'me méfie de tout et de tout l'monde
Car beaucoup se défilent et trahissent quand le ton monte
J'accumule les tumultes et les tourmentes
Les apparences nous mentent et j'attends le dénouement
(x2)

J'fais plus confiance à l'alcool meme si son arôme me racole, son ivresse m'a rendu hardcore
En désaccord j'ai cru qu'la tize donnait du style, mais j'ai vu la betise et le sheitan dans un verre de sky
J'fais plus confiance à la science c'est dramatique, elle n'avance que pour fabriquer des armes de destruction massive
Elle nous promet le bonheur et le progrès et nous laisse dans l'horreur car le profit reste son projet
J'fais plus confiance à la vie j'suis lucide, on dit qu'à 20 ans elle est belle mais trop de jeunes ont recours au suicide
Pour éviter la mort aucun subterfuge, chaque jour Dieu me rappelle que meme les disques d'or sont superflus

J'me méfie de tout et de tout l'monde
Car beaucoup se défilent et trahissent quand le ton monte
J'accumule les tumultes et les tourmentes
Les apparences nous mentent et j'attends le dénouement

Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Si tôt le matin je me réveille

Et quand je me lève, la vie est moins amère
Hier j'ai fait un rêve, j'y ais vu ta grand-mère
Elle c'est mon amour
Le seul véritable
J'espère ta léguer sa bravoure en héritage
Tu est venu au monde et tout est devenu magique
Le bonheur à un nom le mien je l'ais appelé Malik
Tellement de craintes, ta vie est une offrande
Quand ta mère est enceinte, c'est moi qui ais mal au ventre
Papa étais un thug, des flammes dans la rétine
Il à rejoint le club, des peluches et des tétines
Fini le baby blues
Met trait sur ton portrait
Mon cœur qui fait boom
Désormais je me sens près
Alors je te chanterais

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Et quand je rentre le soir, que la vie me fait morfler
Il est déjà tard, tu es dans les bras de Morphée
Ce monde me brise, je ne suis pas infaillible
Et c'est pas le showbiz qui fait les bons pères de famille
Hip-Hop marocaine malgré les offenses
Je veux pas que le rap game te vole ton enfance
Bizarre la roue tourne
Si tu manque de repères
Tu me reprochera un jour ce que je reproche à mon père
Et ton grand-père te dira qu'on porte son visage
Il t'a appelé Maldiba comme ceux de son village
Dans notre culture les mots d'amour sont rares
J'ai appris à l'usure qu'ont avaient tord d'en être avare
Alors laisse moi te dire
Tout se que je t'aime
Même si ce n'est qu'un disque et que j'ai samplé ce thème
Une place dans ton cœur, j'aimerais y être d'emblée
J'aurais toujours peur si tu me laisse pas y entrer
Alors je te chante

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon coeur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Si tôt le matin je me réveille
Devant ta photo je me recueille
Je sort sans déjeuner
Je part pour travailler
Qu'il vente, qu'il pleuve ou qu'il neige
Qu'importe le temps, tant que je t'aime
Le soir je vais revenir
Je fait ton avenir

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Pitié toi mon amour
Pitié toi mon cœur
Je travaille nuit et jour pour ton seul bonheur

Pitié

Ils comprennent pas pourquoi je saigne, pourquoi mes veines virent à l'Eden
J'suis une enfant de l'erreur partagée entre laideur et beauté face à l'horreur et la cruauté de mon coeur
Je reste seule dans l'noir, je suis contradictoire,
Et si j'suis plus petite que toi je reve de crier victoire
La rue m'a poussée aux trucs louches, aux feux sanglants aux cartouches
Eparpillées autour de moi car les jaloux m'ont tirés dans le dos
En désaccord c'est dans mon sang c'est dans mon corps
C'est dans les yeux de tous ces hommes qui m'aiment encore malgré mes torts
Et je sais plus si j'suis docile ou de ceux qui dominent
Si j'suis d'humeur nocive ou plutôt de ceux qui s'obstinent
Je suis incontrôlable car y'a la vie, ses aléas
Y'a la famille peu malléable car la culture s'installe à table
On n'contredit pas sa mère donc on feint la transparence
Moi j'connais pas le mot « parent » j'reste une enfant en apparence
Mais dans l'fond qui suis-je ? Mes origines sont en panique
Trop réaliste le succès m'a prit de panique
Noir ou blanc, trop réservée ou trop dingue
Trop préservée ou trop facile à atteindre ( ?)
Mon pire ennemi c'est Melanie, qu'on se le dise je reste triste
Qui m'aime me lise car je n'me livre que dans mes titres
Encore un texte côté dar, pourquoi cet homme dans mon appart' ?
Pourquoi mon coeur est à l'étroit, pourquoi t'ai-je pris pour un cobaye
Pourquoi n'sais-tu pas que je peine à vivre
Toi tu m'aimes à vie, moi j'suis trop frèle,
Trop de tristesse car je suis très naïve
J'ai pas guérie malgré la gloire j'suis amaigrie j'fais peine à voir
A peine atterrie j'veux quitter le territoire
Moi j'suis toujours en opposition, toujours en bonne position
Toujours dans l'action bousillée par la réflexion
Cherche pas à suivre ma belle, je ne sais pas qui je suis
Mon pire ennemi c'est moi-meme et peu m'importe qui me suit

Laisse parler mon côté ying
Laisse parler mon côté yang
Y'a des jours c'est pour ma click

Et y'a des jours c'est pour les gens
Mon coté pile fait face à mon côté tendre
Dangereux quand tes meilleurs ennemis deviennent des anges
(x2)

[Youssoupha]
MC de mauvais augure, meme si c'est trop dur
Je procure comment boycotter mon côté obscur
J'inaugure encore un triste anniversaire
Comme impostures : le temps et la fortune sont mes pires adversaires
J'suis acerbe dans mes speech, rien a perdre on est speed
J'te rappelle : si la peine nous appelle on l'esquive
On a beaucoup d'estime pour les frères, on s'entraine
Puis sème le mauvais engrais, histoire de gangs, on s'engraine
Trop d'quartiers en guerre, remballe ta rengaine
Puisque la paix est en panne et que ma campagne est en grève
On en crève de ce putain d'orgueil
Melanie, dans le cercueil j'verrais mes ennemis parmis mes amis
J'examine les causes de ma ruine
Partagé entre les reves de ma prose et le cauchemar de Darwin
T'sais ma rime sur le beat arrive subitement
La meme équipe le meme équipement, nos différences de pigments
Nous ont conduis à trop d'incompréhension de non sens
Laissez-moi ma présomption d'innocence
Putain, tout nous oppose faut qu'on se pose pour faire union
Mais pas l'temps de faire une pause la famille attend ses Western Union
Soldat du temps avec des flingues dans les artères
Mon peuple ne se distingue que dans les charts et dans les charters
On a un sale caractère à force d'agoniser
Atomisés nos pater font des gosses alcoolisés
Mon trajet est à corriger mais j'accélère
Il m'faut une baraque comme le Colisé pour m'arracher des HLM
Dans ta morale y'a des dollars chez les ennemis
C'est pas l'argent qui pourrit les gens connard c'est la zermi
Nos meilleurs ennemis chez nos proches c'est nos sales attitudes
Et leur amour n'a d'égal que notre ingratitude
Comme d'habitude tu fais du mal à ceux qui t'aiment
J'ai jamais su pourquoi on fait du mal à ceux qu'on aime..."

Si j'ai le blues est-ce-que tu m'aides?

Est-ce-que ta bouche se souviendra de mon name

Années 80 mon enfance en Afrique,
Kinshasa entre espoir d'indépendance, misère et trafics
Moi j'suis à l'aise avec les miens qui m'entourent
Ma grand-mère est sénégalaise, mon père est Lyriciste Bantu
La dictature de MOBUTU, le pays se dégrade

Enragé trop tôt j'rap avec Abdulaï et Walaï

Pourquoi, j'baise les huissiers, les policiers, les déménageurs.

J'venais des cours et j'ai vue nos affaires sur le trottoir
Trop tard, une femme et quatre enfants jetés a la rue,
Le cinquième a craché sa haine à la France, il est en garde a vue,
Comment s'en remettre ?
De la bouffe, des habits, la vie d'une famille balancé par la fenetre,
Y'a peu de fric dans ma destinée,
Trop de haine anti-flics dans ma destinée,
De rancunes, d'amertumes dans ma destinée

Je sais d'ailleurs que sans eux c'est l'enfer
Et que je me sens meilleur a chaque fois que je les rends fiers

C'est pour les petits qui cascadent entre les briques pendant
que les grands jouent à cache-cache entre les Brink's
On se brise : le sort nous empeche de rayonner
Besoin de biz pour rever, besoin de biff pour réveillonner
J'essaie de raisonner les petits frères, leur dire que la haine est quotidienne
et qu'on n'finit jamais par s'y faire
On est si fier mais sans rancune
La plupart des gens n'accepterais le quart de tout c'qu'on endure
La vie est une aventure, on est des héros alléluia !!!
Comme dit Psy4, on est des hijos de la luna
Malgré les outrages, donne de la force aux mômes
de ton entourage car il en faut du courage
Grandir sur le Macadam-dam
Et vivre comme un pion dans un jeu de dames dam-dam-dam-dam
Jeune sans états d'âme-dam
On a les crocs mais c'est la vie qui nous dame dam-dam-dam-dam
Depuis que l'innocence a quitté les gosses
Les p'tites veulent briller avec du gloss, les petits veulent tirer avec un glock

Elevée à la loi du block par ici, v'là la jeunesse qui s'exprime par les blogs ou par les graffitis
Géographique est l'histoire de notre périple vu que les bâtiments sont ternes au delà du periph'
Mais on refuse le péril pour nos gamins et nos gamines
L'espoir n'est jamais mort quand on l'réanime
Grandir sur le Macadam-dam
Et vivre comme un pion dans un jeu de dames dam-dam-dam-dam
Jeune sans états d'âme-dam
On a les crocs mais c'est la vie qui nous dame dam-dam-dam-dam

J'ai écrit ce texte pour mes neveux et mes nièces :
Mamadou, Karim, Keisha, Ousmane et Inès
Pour ceux qui naissent loin des pavs et des paillettes
Ils veulent pas nous connaitre car on n'est pas de la meme planète
Pourtant le monde est palette de couleur et de culture
Et ils nous jugent sur le paraitre et ma douleur est dans mon écriture
Mauvaises attitudes, mauvaises habitudes
Petit retiens que les lascars titubent sur ce sale bitume
Faire des études, rendre fier la daronne
On veut lui rapporter des tunes mais on a souvent que de belles paroles
On a été des gosses terribles peu importe où ca nous mène,
je sais qu'on deviendra de bons parents nous meme
Le ciel nous aime meme si les hommes nous ont renié
On reste fort car les derniers seront les premiers
Une seule chose à apprendre : l'honneur personne te le donne
mais personne pourra te le reprendre."
Youssoupha,Maman M'a Dit,/y/youssoupha/maman+ma+dit_21466183.html,"Maman m'a dit tout c'que la vie peut reprendre et redonner

J'gagne ou je perds, au moins, j'aurais pris des risques d'homme
Plus rien ne me ramènera ma mère, même pas des disques d'or
Je suis noir, jeune, ambitieux et je vais changer la donne

Dites aux ennemis que j'suis béni quand j'prends le microphone

Fils unique par ma mère, pourtant je ne suis pas seul
C'est de l'amour que je ramène le calme quand ça gueule
Y'a forcément ceux qui m'aiment, et y'a ceux qui m'en veulent
Moi, j'essaye de décrire des arcs-en-ciel à des aveugles
J'fais pas ça pour le fun, faut pas qu'je parte en vrille
Me jetez pas de fleurs, j'suis encore en vie
Le cœur endommagé
Si les rageux me voient marcher sur l'eau
Ils diront que c'est parce que je n'sais pas nager
Mais, désormais, je n'suis plus apeuré
Car on voit mieux certaines choses avec des yeux qui ont déjà pleuré
J'gagne ou je perds, au moins, j'aurais pris des risques d'homme
Plus rien n'me ramènera ma mère, même pas mes disques d'or

Dans ce foutu rap, y'a qu'à mon mic à qui je fais grave confiance
À ce niveau-là, j'ai pas de morale ni de cas de conscience
Nique l'auto-tune, nique le trap, nique le rap conscient
Il faut que tes gars se concentrent, il faut que tes garces contemplent
Cash comptant, boug toujours indépendant, mais regarde ce qu'on tente
Que le rap français me néglige, il n'sait pas ce qu'il rate
Si j'étais né vers Queensbridge, je serais Nasty Nas
Ils parlent de shit, guns, gangstas dans leurs singles
Mais calme-toi, ma petite gueule, à ce qui paraît, t'as un big buzz
Chercher le buzz, ça reste le biz' des blaireaux
T'as dû faire deux cent mille vues la s'maine où j'ai fait deux cent mille euros

Ok, pendant que le temps te détend en dilettante
Dans l'attente, militant, prends le temps de décoller
Dédicace lyricale pour tous les gars
Délicats qui régalent, illégales sont les données
Si tu fais les comptes, y'a les condi', les condés
Les tombes et les bons, si tu tombes, t'as déconné
Si y'a des balances, alors tendez-les, bandez-les
Pendez-les bien avant qu'elles tentent de nous donner

Kinshasa karma, Bakary Potter
Et j'ai l'humeur qui change beaucoup, va demander à tes potes
Je suis tyrannique mais un peu cool #SaddamHusseinBolt

J'mets ""all in"" comme au casino, la putain d'case des marginaux
Le flow d'Ronaldinho, mentalité Mannschaft
Danger d'mort #Tarantino, brutalité mentale
Trop calibré et bancal, trop d’ego et grand cœur
Trop d'qualités dans l'crane, trop de défauts dans l'cœur
Prolonger l'plaisir éphémère, c'est tout c'que l'on veut, mais
Mauvaise nouvelle, y'a qu'en enfer qu'on fait vraiment long feu
Faut qu'j'accélère, que je m'énerve, que je m'élève, que je délaisse
Les crises de nerfs, les plaies, la putain d'peur de perdre, c'est 'cheum'
Déjà, c'est grave quand tes vieux démons te rattrapent
Pour moi, le drame, j'réalise que mes vieux démons à moi sont encore jeunes

Ce soir, j'vous parle de show-biz parce qu'il m'a peut-être emparé
Je mangeais au Resto du Cœur, maintenant je traîne avec Les Enfoirés
Mais faut que je ramène le staff, j'serai intégré pour ces boloss
J'irais danser le ndombolo pour Danse avec les Stars
On danse avec les squales, faut qu'on s'impose
J'suis trop ghetto pour le show-biz
Mais j'suis trop riche pour traîner dans un hall
Quel est mon rôle, dis-moi? J'ai vingt
Euh, attends, je rappais sur quoi déjà?

Yeah, y'a trop d'séries, j'dors plus la nuit, donc sur ma bio
J'ai plus d'vie sociale, même quand je dors, je rêve en HBO
J'traîne avec Tywin Lannister, le lieutenant Cavanaugh
Stringer Bell, Avon Barksdale et Tony Soprano
Pollos Hermanos, Olivia Pope, Jimmy Darmody
Frank Underwood, Maria LaGuerta et Nicholas Brody
Gustavo Fring, McManus, Ari Gold
Euh, j'parlais d'quoi déjà?

Yeah, maintenant, y'a plus d'peine, un jour tu rappes avec un frère
Le lendemain, monde à l'envers, il fait la pute nègre
Puisque tu n'assumes pas, arrête d'inventer
Des mensonges sur moi sinon, moi, je dirai la vérité sur toi
Je suis même pas en colère, on n'a rien à s'prouver, mais bon
Ne fais plus ta commère alors qu'en vrai on peut se retrouver
Fais ta vie de ton côté, bref
Je sais même plus c'que je voulais lui dire
Parce que la mort ne donne pas d'préavis, j'suis devenu hardcore
Et avide, vu qu'aujourd'hui c'est le premier jour du reste de ma vie

Euh, non, je l'ai déjà rappé ça?

On se rappelle plus du thème, on vient poser notre couplet en yaourt
Rap de mongole, je suis Gengis Khan, je suis dans ma yourte
Pourquoi ta mère fait semblant de pas m'voir sur Facebook quand je l'ajoute?
Complètement déchiré, j'ai la cervelle d'un moineau dans l'mazout
Je suis tellement imbibé que, pour sécher, j’attends le mois d’août
Eh mais, eh, mais sur quel album on rappe?
Euh je sais pas, m'en rappelle plus, moi non plus

Yeah, y'a des questions qui me laissent incrédule
Si tu peux lire Le Coran, pourquoi tu lis Le Coran pour les Nuls?
Pourquoi l'Afrique se dilapide? Pourquoi les geeks
Et les rappeurs blancs sont obsédés par les rimes multi-syllabiques?
Est-ce que ce morceau a un but? Est-ce que c'est un freestyle?
Est-ce que les riches qui meurent s'en vont au paradis fiscal?
Est-ce que j'me rappelle du thème de ce texte?

Vrai qu’on est trop hard, et puis notre art est de vous vexer
Pas de menaces de mort, mon rap ne sort pas de douilles, mais
C’est le seul son hardcore depuis que le rock n’a plus de couilles, c’est
Un nouveau record de polémique, on dit que je chante le mal
Je vous l'avais dit qu'il y a des indics, ladies and gentleman
Et dans leur bêtise, ils confondent ""crime"" et ""Islam""
Ils m'auraient trouvé plus gentil si je ne faisais que du ""slam""
Coupable idéal, MC mercenaire
La Rumeur dit que les NTM sont des Sniper de la morale comme Monsieur R
Pas facile d’ignorer ça, pas facile d’opérer seul
À la place de Orelsan, moi c’est clair que j'aurais le seum
On a les critiques imparables
D'une France qui oublie que les paroles de son hymne
Sont plus violentes que celles du gangsta rap
Je défends la cause des frères au Sud qui rêvassent du Nord
Mais ma liberté d’expression en chute est sous menace de mort

Il est grand temps que ça déménage
Il n'y a jamais de tendance irrémédiable
Les sentences sont inégales
Je fais du rap et ce que t’entends est illégal

Il est grand temps que ça déménage
Il n'y a jamais de tendance irrémédiable
Les sentences sont inégales
Je fais du rap et ce que t’entends est illégal

Depuis le temps, je guettais ce type qui vous mène à la baguette, mais
Parle de race en tête et puis nous traite ""d'analphabètes"", j’ai
Dis que j'étais du genre à réagir sur le BPM
Je ne tends pas la joue comme celui qui a vu le jour à Bethléem
Une seule ligne, dans ""À force de le dire""
Où j’exprime tout mon mépris, et là, s'amorce le délire
Des mots accusateurs, pour les rappeurs, j’en retrouve dix mille
C'est vrai qu'on touche le fond chez ce bouffon de Morandini
Mais sans rancune, de ma plume je connais le taro
Et la droite se déchaîne, m’affiche à la une du Figaro
Encore un article pour faire mentir le baromètre
Qui me confirme que certains journalistes de merde sont malhonnêtes
Nous ne sommes pas du même monde, l'Hexagone va mal
Mais j'espère pas que mon prénom vous a subitement rappelé celui de Fofana
Et la Police aboie pour que le tribunal me morde
Ça suffit pour qu’un juge m’inculpe pour ""Menace de mort""

Il est grand temps que ça déménage
Il n'y a jamais de tendance irrémédiable
Les sentences sont inégales
Je fais du rap et ce que t’entends est illégal

Il est grand temps que ça déménage
Il n'y a jamais de tendance irrémédiable
Les sentences sont inégales
Je fais du rap et ce que t’entends est illégal

Il y a de la rage dans nos propos
Mais comment rester sage, vu l’image de la vie que l’on nous propose?
J’ai plaidé ""légitime défense"" dans ma déposition
Qui peut prétendre faire du rap sans prendre position?"

Je prie quand tu pries alors, ton deuil, c'est mon deuil
Je vibre quand tu vis, un cœur pour un cœur
Puisque je brille quand tu brilles, alors je meurs quand tu meurs
Dis-moi pourquoi je m’essouffle et je m'entête
Pourquoi je tousse, pourquoi c'est moi qui m'étouffe quand c'est toi qu'on enterre
Pourquoi la vie ne dit pas ce qu'elle coûte?
Pourquoi on a beau tuer le temps, mais c'est le temps qui nous enterre tous?
Pendant qu'la terre tourne sans dérision
La mort s'en fout de vos doutes entre la science et la religion
Je crois au paradis sans preuve, trop de larmes
Et les sceptiques me taquinent et veulent mon Instagram de l'au-delà
J'ai des rêves en dollars, c'est percutant
Mais je ne cherche pas à gagner des thunes, moi, je cherche à gagner du temps
Mon tourment n'est pas un effet d'mode
J'avais la vingtaine, j'écrivais des chansons du genre ""Youssoupha est mort""
Énorme, personne ne sait ce que mon cœur regrette
Personne ne connait mes rancœurs secrètes
Je crée mes propres modes, j'ai pas d'modèle
Et, pour me sentir immortel, je vais aux enterrements des croque-morts
Entre la scène et la mosquée, je traîne beaucoup d'remords
Je mène une double vie, est-ce que j'aurai une double mort?
Et les gens ne croient que ce qu'ils voient
Moi, j'ai perdu tellement de proches, j'ai l'impression de mourir mille fois

Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Laisse-moi croire qu'un ""Au revoir"" ne nous sépare jamais
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Et on repart sans que le temps nous répare

Alors je parle de nos proches, du temps qui les emporte
Du temps qui laisse des marques, et puis des masques que l'ont porte
Nos bravoures et nos larmes, nos amours et nos drames
Le poids de nos parcours, le poids de nos vingt-et-un grammes
Nos trous noirs et nos flashs, nos coups bas et nos crashs
Et tout ce qu'on dit tout bas, et tous les combats que l'on cache
Car, peu importe de vivre tout, de vivre droit
De vivre fou, de vivre froid, puisqu'on va mourir mille fois
Et, même en mille phrases, j'te jure, les mots me manquent
Et, même en mille phrases, toujours la mort qui me hante
Chacun son propre vide, quand on enterre un être cher
On enterre aussi une partie de sa propre vie
Un deuil est un deuil, j'essaie pas de faire la dif'
Quand on est jeune, on ne meurt pas, on perd la vie
Loin des vices à la mode, je marche seul
Même si je sais que, marcher seul, c'est un peu s’entraîner à la mort
Alors j'ai vraiment l'air anéanti, quand on m'a dit
Que les derniers seront les premiers, disons qu'j'ai ralenti
Repenti mais jamais trop faible
Je vous laisse croire en vos psys, laissez-moi croire en mon prophète
J'ai trop d'frères qui m'relèvent à chaque fois que j'me penche
Mais trop d'frères qui me crèvent et qui me plantent
Je repense à 2Pac et Biggie, le rap game te souhaite la mort
Et, à ta mort, il fait des t-shirts à ton effigie
J'me réfugie jamais dans la rancœur
Papa, j'te porte dans ma tête, et Malik te porte dans son cœur
Mes souvenirs sont vides à ton enterrement
Je ne pleurais pas mon père, moi, je pleurais le grand-père de mon fils
Les sacrifices nous rendent avisés
On ne sait pas vraiment de quoi on est fait tant que l'on n'est pas brisé
Mais on se relève toujours, tu l'vois
Même si perdre tant de proches donne l'impression de mourir mille fois

Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Laisse-moi croire qu'un ""Au revoir"" ne nous sépare jamais
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Et on repart sans que le temps nous répare

Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois
Mourir mille fois"

Et dont j'écris l'mal-être, qu'Allah nous guide, amen
Écoute bien, j'ramène la vérité, tez-ma
Y'a ceux qui pouvaient crever pour percer dans l'rap, et moi
Qui n'envisageais que le renoncement
J'avais la vingtaine, j'ai craché le classique ""Éternel recommencement""
J'étais le rookie de l'année, on est en 2005
Et puis, pour moi, tout est gagné puisque j'en domine plein
Mon peuple a dix-mille plaintes, la France est trop sévère
Donc mon album aura un titre en hommage à Césaire
Mais c'est l'désert quand le marketing te contamine
Quand vient le buzz, la signature en Major Company
J'avais du Solaar dans mon écriture
J'ai pris des dollars mais, putain, j'ai pas appelé mon album ""Négritude""

Courageux mais pas téméraire

Dis-moi pour qui tu rappes, je te dirai qui tu es
Et dis-moi quelle est ton arme, je te dirai qui tuer
J'étais pas habitué, mon identité m'échappe
Mon album est trituré, c'est un échec dans les charts
Pourtant, j'me fie au cœur de mon public à mes concerts hip-hop
Eux, ils se fient à Skyrock ou bien au top IFOP
À cette époque, j'suis blessé dans mon ego
T'as beau changer le nom de ton album, tu restes toujours le même négro
Frérot, la naïveté n'est pas une excuse
Et, comme j'ai dix ans d'avance, je prends dix ans d'recul
Les disques d'or m'esquivent
Donc j'apprends qu'on n'devient jamais millionnaire en n'récoltant que des succès d'estime
Alors, plus tard, ""Noir Désir"" me fera repartir
J'enchaîne les hits, les Zénith, les disques de platine
Je fascine quelques jeunes sur la pellicule
Mais, bordel, j'ai pas appelé mon album ""Négritude""

Y'aura des mauvaises langues et des grandes gueules
Mais notre identité est grande, faut qu'on soit digne de sa grandeur
J'ai de l'amour, peu de bravoure, mais j'ai un grand cœur
Ma négritude met ce pays face à ses grandes peurs
La rancœur, la pression est telle
Tant de questions pour une culture à la couleur ébène
Et, même entre nous, on se plafonne
T'imagines pas le nombre de frères qui me conseillent de renoncer à ce titre d'album
Changer la donne, ""Négritude"" en guise de signature
Cherche pas le mal dans quelques erreurs et quelques ratures
Caricature d'un jeune renoi, dis-leur
Ça serait plus cool d'appeler l'album ""Nique ta mère"" ou bien ""Drug dealer""
Me prends pas pour un leader, j'suis limité
J'suis un mauvais porte-parole, j'en n'ai même pas la légitimité
J'ai imité le poète en reprenant ses termes
Je rends à Césaire ce qui appartient à Césaire

""D'une identité, c'est sur, d'une identité, réconciliée
Avec, avec l'universel
Pour être universel, il fallait commencer par nier que l'on est nègre
Au contraire, je vous disais, plus on est nègre, plus on sera universel""

L'amitié est chose fragile mais, putain, fallait qu'j'me vide
Fallait qu'je vive dans ce HLM de merde à Cergy
Fallait qu'j'me brise dans une ghetto-mentale qui m'a asservi
La sère-mi, c'est un concept interminable
À cause des potes, j'ai failli finir comme un délinquant minable
La garre-ba, la gâchette, la racaille, le racket
Les tracas, les traquenards, le placard, les plaquettes
C'était pas mon rêve, moi, je valais mieux qu'ça
Et puis maman veut pas qu'son fils devienne un mec sale
Tant pis, on s'engraine comme des merdes jusqu'à pourrir
Mais, comme dit le poète ""La jeunesse est un risque à courir""
On traîne en bande ou sur un banc, on se croit immortels
On devient grand, on devient gang, on se dits immortels
Ali est décédé, Mohammed est décédé
Et j'ai l'air con quand j'pense aux paroles qui ont précédé
Excédé vu qu'ma rancœur grimpe
Petit, ça fait déjà longtemps que je ne représente plus le neuf-cinq
J'ai fui le quartier et son cafting
Putain, c'est rude, j'veux pas faire du rap de rue à trente-quatre piges
Et je pense tellement au temps d'avant, trop tragique
Que mon prochain ""Planète Rap"", je le ferais sur radio ""Nostalgie""
Et je m'agite pas pour les codes de ma ville
J'dédie ce couplet à tous mes potes, ceux qui ont niqué ma vie

C'est pour ceux qui nous esquivent, ceux qui restent braves
Ceux qui galèrent en équipe, ceux qui grandissent comme des barges
Ceux qui nous motivent, ceux qui nous poussent à l'outrage
Ceux qui nous estiment, ceux qui ne tournent pas la page
Alors lève la main si t'es en guerre avec les tiens, cousin
Lève ta main si tu te perds à cause des tiens, mais bon
Lève ta main si t'es solidaire des tiens
C'est pour ceux qui nous estiment, ceux qui ne tournent pas la page

Mon frère a niqué ma vie, fallait qu'j'lui dise
La famille est chose fragile mais, putain, fallait qu'j'me vide
Fallait qu'je vibre, que je laisse enfin la raison parler
Fallait qu'je vise une autre ambition que la maison d'arrêt
À c'qu'il paraît, les regrets te capturent
Vu qu'au moment où j'rappe ce texte, tu crèves encore entre quatre murs
J'capte plus là où tu veux vraiment en venir
J'cale dur depuis que tu m'mens, que tu te laisses partir en vrille
J'ai plus d'envie, il y a ma rancœur qui s'voile
Les gens ont peur de nager juste à côté d'un homme qui s'noie
Et, toi, t'as failli tuer mes études et ma carrière
J'ai brûlé mes vertus à force de couvrir tes arrières
Les barreaux, les barrières, l'amour me délaisse
Du coup, je t'envoie des mandats
car j'ai pas l'cœur pour t'envoyer les lettres
Dans ta cellule, si tu entends cette chanson
J'espère qu'elle te fera mal, comme j'ai mal à chaque fois que tu tombes
On est ensemble mais, moi, j'ai grandi dans ta pénombre
Montre l'exemple parce que mon fils porte ton prénom
Fraternité parfois compliquée à vivre
J'dédie ce couplet à mon frère parce qu'il à niqué ma vie

C'est pour ceux qui nous esquivent, ceux qui restent braves
Ceux qui galèrent en équipe, ceux qui grandissent comme des barges
Ceux qui nous motivent, ceux qui nous poussent à l'outrage
Ceux qui nous estiment, ceux qui ne tournent pas la page
Alors lève la main si t'es en guerre avec les tiens, cousin
Lève ta main si tu te perds à cause des tiens, mais bon
Lève ta main si t'es solidaire des tiens
C'est pour ceux qui nous estiment, ceux qui ne tournent pas la page

Mais qui a niqué ma vie? Fallait qu'j'vous l'dise
La critique est chose facile mais, putain, fallait qu'j'me livre
En vrai, la rue ne vaut d'être vécue sans révolte
Elle aurait fait de moi une victime si j'avais grandi sans mes potes
Alors laisse-moi leur rendre hommage, hommage à mon frère
Pour tout ce qu'on a partagé, pour tout c'qu'il m'ont offert
Parce que, sans eux, je serais mort au casse-pipe
Putain, je pense à dire merci, j'le réalise qu'à trente-quatre piges
J'parle du pire plutôt que d'garder le silence
Puisque, le contraire de l'amour, c'est pas la haine mais bien l'indifférence
Sans eux, mon public n'aurait pas le rappeur que je suis
Sans eux, Malik n'aurait pas le père que je suis
S'il y'a des gens dont j'ai forcé l'admiration
J'aimerais qu'ils sachent à qui je dois tout mon vécu, mon inspiration
Mon cœur n'est pas vide
J'dédie cette chanson à mes potes et à mon frère parce qu'ils ont sauvé ma vie"
Youssoupha,Noir Désir,/y/youssoupha/noir+d+sir_21464401.html,"Les abrutis diront que j'ai toujours le même thème
L’Histoire se répète, donc j'utilise les mêmes termes
Tant pis pour ceux qui pensent que je bloque sur l'Afrique
Cette chanson c'est comme la France, frère, tu l'aimes ou tu la quittes
Les dilemmes de la street quand les frères se bim-bim
Des renois crèvent à la suite pour des rêves de bling-bling
Et forcément, je nique tous les colons du globe
Qui voulaient me faire oublier tout l'or qu'ils m'ont volé avec une carte gold
Noir est le code, certaines luttes nous terrassent
La négritude, c'est une histoire de culture, pas une question de race
Et ça dérape quand l'espoir se meurt
Où est le devoir de mémoire si l'Histoire souffre d'Alzheimer?
Dans la clameur, pour mes gens, la Terre est grande
Mais rien qu'on s'extermine à base de guerres ethniques et guerres des gangs
Je guette les angles quand la peur et le temps éclatent
C'est l'histoire d'un peuple au cœur de roi et au sang d'esclave

Mutu muindo lamuka telema pé o tala hé Ko uta bu coco nayo
Yo Sali se ko lala lamuka nano o tala nde nge moyi ébimi

Mutu muindo lamuka telema pé o tala hé Ko uta bu coco nayo
Yo Sali se ko lala lamuka nano o tala nde nge moyi ébimi

Les intellos diront que j'ai toujours le même thème
Leur connerie est sévère donc j'utilise les mêmes termes
Je passe à l'offensive, je les laisse parler du mal
Africain jusqu'au gencive, normal de broyer du noir
Renoi, c'est bien beau d'avoir été Pharaon
Mais le passé n'est qu'un caveau si le futur passe par la honte
N'oublie pas que le monde a fauché les poupées noires
Seule une balle dans la tête peut me causer un trou de mémoire
Mais peu importe le mal, je refuse la pitié
On a jamais été àl' dans l'union et l'amitié
Du coup, les complexes continuent encore de s'empiler
Vous m'avez traité de nègre, monsieur l'agent, mais vous êtes Antillais
Je calcule pas leurs commentaires par ici
Pendant que des familles entières mangent des galettes de terre en Haïti
J'écris en graffiti la bénédiction des âmes
Viens pas dire qu'on a subi la malédiction de Cham

Mutu muindo lamuka telema pé o tala hé Ko uta bu coco nayo
Yo Sali se ko lala lamuka nano o tala nde nge moyi ébimi

Mutu muindo lamuka telema pé o tala hé Ko uta bu coco nayo
Yo Sali se ko lala lamuka nano o tala nde nge moyi ébimi

Les médias vous diront que j'ai toujours le même thème
Ils changeront mes paroles sans reprendre les mêmes termes
Pour l'Afrique je gueule, mais parfois je me résigne
Un continent en forme de gun : c'est vraiment un mauvais signe
L'avenir se dessine, alors j'ai gardé la foi
Le silence devient un crime, alors j’ai gardé la voix
Le monde s'entretue dans la guerre de l'or noir
Le premier ennemi de l'Homme noir reste l'Homme noir
Le doute est normal, c'est dans ma culture
Depuis qu'on a voulu me faire croire que votre passé sera notre futur
Et comment notre Histoire peut être corrigée
Quand on a les religions des gens qui nous ont colonisés ?
Récupérez vos Voltaire et vos Guevara
Mon Histoire est écrite par Frantz Fanon et par Sankara
On y arrivera malgré les différences et les enclaves
C'est l'histoire d'un peuple au cœur de roi et au sang d'esclave"

Beaucoup d'MCs maquillent leur stricte débilité en steet crédibilité
Peu d'probabilité de succès
Sucer ne sert a rien certains ariens me trouvent suspect
En césarienne j'accouche des lyrics prématurés
Donc libérez Omar c'est le dollar qui m'a tué
Une feuille blanche immaculée
Un bic et je m'attriste pour mes reufs, 99 immatriculé
C'est la matrice les illusions de ma street
Ont baisées les frontières bien avant les accords de Maastricht
Tu sais, voila ma griffe, tu connais mon blaze
Y a cette poisse qui m'agrippe et tu veux etre a ma place
Tu fixes sur ma plaque, flippes sur mes blacks, vibre quand je braque
La ville dans les bacs on me vise on m'attaque, me file et me traque
Et les flics nous matraquent quand le biz nous rattrape
On vit dans une trappe, le tiéquar et ses vestiges
Le ghetto c'est la plus grosse bebar que la France m'ait mise
Tu vois, dans la turevoi des tetes cramées qui remuent la tete
J'sui pas un youvoi, mon rap (clame qu'il remue la tess)
Je l'atteste ma tess est a l'agonie

Ils veulent ma tete les mises a prix sont pretes
Mes lyrics t'indiquent le chemin tu peux t'les tatouer comme dans Prison Break
En attendant que ma paye devienne concrète
J'évolue dans la compète du rap game jusqu'à la conquete
J'suis le MC que l'on guette pour ses phases
Puisque ma rime est complète, que la concurrence s'efface, nan ?
Mes faiblesses et mes frasques me font flancher
Mais sache que t'avais jamais entendu de rap francais
C'est pas juste un slogan arrogant
Mais une manière de tout remettre en cause tout restant éloquent
Et mon camp kiffe le son car c'est la vibe élémentaire
Lève le poing a l'unisson facon black panthère

J'assume tous mes pas, car seul Dieu nous guide
Et quand on se parle, l'histoire est écrite
Ne me remercie pas, t'inquiète on est quittes
La rue m'a fait vivre, mais la rue m'a dégoûté
L'école m'a fait lire, mais l'école m'a fait douter
Maman m'a appris que l'argent n'est pas une fin en soi
Que vieillir est obligatoire, mais grandir est un choix
On m'a dit ""ne te rate pas"", y'a personne qui m'aide
J'aime pas le rap, moi, c'est le rap qui m'aime
Il m'a rendu au centuple tout ce que je lui donne
Et parfois quand je ne chante plus, c'est là que je m'isole
Et je n'ai pas d'idole, à part le plus grand
À part mon créateur, plus j'en parle, plus j'en tremble
Plus rien ne me tente, à part quelques doutes que je promène

J'ai un label qui monte, tant pis pour la critique
Et puis plaire à tout le monde, c'est plaire à n'importe qui
Le but de ma musique, du rap que j'expose
C'était de rester authentique, pas de rester pauvre
Et la France m'a fliqué, ses apparences nous mentent
Mon bled me fait flipper, ma famille me manque
L'amour m'a fait chialer pour tout ce que j'éprouve
Mais la haine m'a installé des yeux waterproofs
Prouve que tu luttes, prouve que t'exultes
Prouve que le but c'est briser les cœurs bruts
Ils veulent qu'on se buttent, attendent les erreurs que l'on commet
On se ressemble, appelle moi Youss', on se connaît!

Nous font et nous rassemblent
Il y a de l'amour dans mes paroles
Tu chantes avec moi et je m'envole
Tu te retrouves en moi
Je sais qu'on se ressemble
Tu bouges la tête sur la musique
Le temps s'arrête et c'est magique!
C'est là toute l'histoire de ma vie
Et tu la connais, on se connaît
Un autre pas vers l'avenir
Je t'invite encore à me suivre
On se connaît

Je garde mes codes, même si ma cote est montée entre-temps
J'me vois en big sur les affiches, en big sur les écrans
En vrai, ma vie est p'tite quand j'mentalise à quel point Dieu est grand
Il m'faut du cran, renoi, il m'faut du cran
La mort m'attend, il m'faut du temps, donc regarde
Il m'faut du temps vu que le ton est devenu aigre
Je crée de nouvelles règles
L'album, c'est Négritude mais il n'sort pas chez Pascal Nègre
Dites à mes sœurs que, dans mon cœur, elles ont le monopole
Dites à nos détracteurs que leur aigreur est monotone
Et dites aux langues de putes que j'vais pas répliquer
Que j'préfère mourir incompris que d'passer toute ma vie à m'expliquer
Hip-hop des blocks épinglé, nous, on a la côte et la pop est flinguée
Faites péter l'époque, mon époque est blindée
Je me téléporte et me porte en indé'
Mes potes qui bloquent le rain-té, la prod qui choque est teintée
J'ai à peine commencé, j'rigole parce que le score a grimpé
Dites aux p'tits frères de chez nous qu'la rue est redoutable
Et dites à Zemmour qu'il s'étouffe, j'suis jugé non coupable
Dites à ma clique que la France peut être immonde
Dites à Malik que j'étais un moins que rien avant qu'il vienne au monde
Depuis, je mêle amour, violence et colère
Flow insolent, j'ai mis un cheveu sur la langue de Molière
Putain, j'suis tellement en avance, bordel
Mon album n'est pas l'disque de l'année
C'est déjà l'disque de l'année prochaine
Seul au monde, ma mère me manque au maximum
Étrangement, parfois
Je l'entends dans la voix de Nina Simone (Thank you very much)
Dites aux rappeurs qu'on revient fermer des gueules
Dans ce rap game, j'suis pas l'meilleur, non non non, je suis le seul
Mon Dieu, redites à Céhashi que sa musique est visionnaire
Dites à Philo, tant que je rappe, il sera millionnaire
Et dites à mon public que je n'ai pas de talisman
Que seule la foi me guide quand je gagne ses applaudissements

Ok, je brille dans mon domaine, ma vie est douce
Vu qu'en c'moment ils s'posent tous sur les mêmes instru' trap de merde
(Han!) Place, place mon blase tout près de mes icônes
(Han!) J'kick en passe-passe même avec Biggie Small
Ha! Sicker than your average! Voilà mon crew
Je ne parle pas, je fais les choses, je n'promets pas, je prouve
Bulletproof fort dans la contrainte
J'ai pris le trône du rap français, mais il me sert juste de strapontin
À mille contre un, beaucoup de putes nègres au départ
Si vrais reconnaissent vrais alors, en vrai, tu n'me reconnais pas
Et on débarque intifada pour caillasser
Les vandales veulent kalacher pour tous nos soldats qu'on a cadenassé
Flow carnassier avec de l'or dans les molaires
Dis-leur que Youssoupha a bien mis un (?) sur la (?)
Check ma colère d'Africain en mission
Comme dirait Socrate ""Trop de social, ça tue les ambitions""
Le crime est permis, nique la 'sère-mi' (Han!)
Trop hip-hop depuis l'époque d'Public Enemy (Han!)

""Yeah, boy""
Qui parle de buzz tout en étant dans la 'sère-mi'?
""Don't believe tha hype"", Public Enemy
Je suis à l'heure de Flavor Flav, non, masta
Ça, c'est pas du rap de rue, c'est, c'est du rap tout court, en fait
L'album s'appellera ""Négritude"" mais il ne sort pas chez Pascal Nègre, hein
Zongisa, zongisa, yeah!

D'un gangster, je n'ai pas l'étoffe, j'voulais pas épouser la rue
Mais, à ma première garde-à-vue, elle m'a dit ""Mazel tov""
Enchaîne les strophes, tête de rasta, frère
Nous, on est tellement dans les dièses que nos vies d'rêve s'écrivent en hashtag
Fallait qu'je cascade, mon rap a fait son territoire
Fallait qu'j'me castagne, ma rage est-elle rédhibitoire?
Écris l'histoire du 'pe-ra' avant qu'on ne l'éteigne
J'suis c'genre de renoi qui préfère Secteur Ä à NTM
Plainte des haines des rageux, d'la peine à l'dire
Ils me voient hors-jeu, même quand je mets une panenka sur penalty
Schizophrène, un ange dans un corps de quarterback
Vu qu'j'ai un côté Heisenberg, un côté Walter White
J'vais pas m'battre pour des broutilles, mec
Pendant qu'des rappeurs illuminatis peuvent se payer les Brooklyn Nets
J'guette la vermine, t'inquiète, je termine
Vu qu'""Négritude"", c'est maintenant #PublicEnemy

On vous avait dit ""C'est pas maintenant""
Mais finie, la récréation, c'est maintenant
""To sutuki kaka, to fandaki na ngambu to yoka kaka"", encore?

My man Fibra
Rock-rock that shit
Seh, il Fibradelico sul beat
Insieme a mio frate Youssoupha
2015, Squallor

Ho cominciato a fare rap ancora quando non era una moda
Chiuso in camera pensavo:""il mondo mi odia""
Sulla base mi sfogavo con le prime rime
Adolescente come tanti che si deprime
Finisce un'era, io cresco veloce
Il tempo cambia le amicizie e la voce
Ora tutti muovono la testa sul beat
Sì, ma in pochi hanno capito oltre a questo cosa c'è
Entra nel vortice e dimmi cosa vedi
La fama distorce e dipende a chi lo chiedi
Cosa vende e cosa piace
È triste ma la gente prende sempre la parte più facile
Storie già viste ho il suono che resiste
Chi ascolta non resiste, smettere non esiste
Avvisa tutti sono tornato nel gioco
E mi sa che stasera il locale va a fuoco

Yeah, yeah
J'ai grandi dans le bruit d'une banlieue précaire
Les charley, kick, caisses claires
Prim's, Fazabrizi laissez pratiquer les experts
La connection que t'espères, la collision est externe
Flow d'canibale, Madiba Hannibal Lecter
Comptez, trop de victimes à compter
Imagine le mélange Youssou N'Dour-Paolo Conte
Imagine qu'on dérange, beaucoup d'histoires à raconter
Imagine qu'on est grand, notre rap est toujours concret, fuck that
J'ai pas d'affaires d'brolique, j'ai pas de break bolide
Toujours actif, on est massif, tout comme les frères Gomis
Le rap c'est dur, j'ai pris d'l'avance avec des textes solides
J'suis dans le futur pendant qu'tu danses encore la Tecktonik
C'est pour les mecs trop libres que le temps fait briller
Mon rap reste rare comme un 29 février mais j'ai mauvaise mine
Quand j'ai le karma de Mario Balotelli 
Avec un tee-shirt ""Why Always Me""
Prim's Parolier

Passavo il tempo a lamentarmi, ma che vita piatta
Il primo disco nel mio studio, raga ce l'ho fatta
O si coltiva o la passione muore soffocata
L'invidia rende la tua faccia una foto sfocata
I soldi sono un peccato tutti ne parlano ma nessuno dice quanti ne fa
Vuoi la prova che sia aperto il mercato sulla stessa 
Base c'è Fibra con Youssoupha

Trop d'frères qui manquent à l'appel, immense est la peine
J'essaie de cicatriser mais immense est la plaie
Quelques nantis tiennent ce monde mais immense est la plèbe
Parmi eux y'a t-il un nom pour financer la paix

Sérieux, aucun rageux de ce rap jeu n'peut me donner des ordres
J'suis ambitieux car celui qui craint Dieu ne redoute pas les Hommes
Dans ma tête, c'est le désordre et j'peux partir en vrille
Et dis-toi qu'le rap n'est pas mort puisque je suis toujours en vie
Moi, j'connais pas la trêve quand ton pays me pénalise
Pourtant, la nuit, je fais des rêves et, le jour, je les réalise
Et j'me présente à tous, que tout l'monde se montre
Je m'appelle Youss', et j'ai l'meilleur public du monde
Et nique la tendance, je n'rappe que ce que mon cœur porte
Car, être dans le vent, ça reste l'ambition des feuilles mortes

Certains d'mes potes ont vendu plus de drogues qu'j'n'ai vendu d'albums

Mais sois pas triste on a la culture de la street et la figure de l'Afrique
C'est les contes de la crypte chez moi
Et le comble de la crise c'est que nos vies ressemblent à leurs schémas
J'ai mal pour nos mômes à peine arrivés,
Trop d'mal dans nos villes parce que nos vies sont scénarisées
Pénalisés dès le départ au fond d'la classe,
L'école nous fait la gueule mais les rues nous font d'la place
Et on remplace les cours par les tours en bas d'la tour
On nous fait croire tour à tour qu'être un lascar est un atout
On a tout pour réussir c'est c'qu'on nous this
Mais y'a qu'ce foutu hall pour nous réunir c'est c'qu'on oublis
Fatigués par les profs et les remises à niveau
Fascinés par les grands qui finissent en zonz ou dans l'canivo
Voilà le scénario d'la vie qui nous est destinée,
A nous de choisir de la subir ou de l'esquiver

Refrain:

On joue tous le même rôle dans ce scénario
Prisonniers du hall dans ce scénario
On est tous illicite dans ce scénario
Tous des victimes dans ce scénario
Trop de clashs trop de peine dans ce scénario
Trop de rage trop de haine dans ce scénario
Trop d'mal à vivre dans ce scénario
J'veux pas finir ma vie dans ce scénario

Entre les potes que la chance à ratée et qui commencent à déraper
Faut s'choisir un avenir et comme on sait ap on s'fait un cap
Mal orientés car les conseillères nous mentent,
On voulait devenir banquier mais on finit par braquer la banque
On veut faire partit d'un gang pour brasser des bars
Placer un berreta dans la manche pour pas s'faire bé-bar
On prend la vie de face, en missionnaire
Attendant qu'les choses se fassent, flémards au rêve de millionnaire
Coup de tonnerre quand la perqui' s'établit,
On veut la vie de Tony M mais la juge n'est pas de cet avis
Avide de beef pour les frelons,
On veut gravir les échelons mais le chemin d'la vie est un peu long
Toujours dans l'ombre on a du vice avec les shmits,
Car beaucoup d'entre nous refusent de vivre avec le smic
Voilà le scénario d'la vie qui nous est destinée,
A nous de choisir de la subir ou de l'esquiver

(Refrain)

Sans salut sans salaire la chute est très rapide,
On veut guérir de notre galère en prenant le bédo comme thérapie
Partagés entre la crise et la colère
On devient bon qu'à faire couler la tiz... Et les larmes de nos mères
On attise l'attention,
Sans faire attention on dramatise car nos passions sont radioactives
Tout c'qui nous arrive prolonge le désordre
Et on espère que la salle de muscu' fera de nous des hommes
Pères indigne on fait des gosses avec les filles d'un soir,
Mais un bébé n'a jamais sa place dans la vie d'un squall
Trop instable quand la pression s'installe,
Toujours au chômage seul le bitume nous a offert un stage
Dur d'échapper au destin et à sa dictature,
L'état et les médias font de nous des caricatures
Voilà le scénario d'la vie qui nous est destinée,
Dans une autre vie peut-être que je saurais l'esquiver...

You make me, you make me, you make me smile
You make me, you make me, you make me smile
And in a little while, I don't have to more tears to cry

Y'a tous ces rêves que je promène, blédard est mon accent
J'ai pas réglé mes problèmes, les coups, j'en ai fait quatre cent
J'ai pas tenu les promesses, perdu dans mes passe-temps
Et, quand les autres progressent, j'ai l'impression d'être absent
Tout ça n'a pas d'sent, et ça me donne le tournis
Comment régner? Parmi les araignées, je suis une fourmi
Mais, toujours mon sale orgueil qui résonne comme un écho
J'sais pas si j'ai mal à mon cœur ou mal à mon ego
Tous inégaux, tous énervés
C'est pour ma tante et tout le travail ingrat qu'elle a fait pour nous élever
C'est pour les femmes qui ont apaisé mes soupirs

You make me, you make me, you make me smile
You make me, you make me, you make me smile
You make me, you make me, you make me smile
And in a little while, I don't have to more tears to cry

Mes tourments échappent à certains, pourtant, ils parlent à d'autres
Et, plus le bonheur me tend la main, plus je suis parano
À nos actes manqués, à nos embouteillages
À nos joies tourmentées, à nos coups de théâtre
Et y'a tous ces moments où je décroche, où j'pense à me retirer
J'pense aux reproches et à mes proches quand mes défauts remontent
Si j'aime autant mon fils, c'est pas seulement pour ce qu'il est
Mais aussi pour ce que je suis depuis qu'il est venu au monde
C'est pour mon grand frère dans le din, pour tous ses conseils
Pour tous ces gens qui m'ont fait grandir à travers les concerts
C'est pour les sœurs qui m'ont pas laissé souffrir
Qui m'ont vu quand j'étais seul, et m'ont redonné le sourire, refrain

You make me, you make me, you make me smile
You make me, you make me, you make me smile
You make me, you make me, you make me smile
And in a little while, I don't have to more tears to cry

J'ai pas envie de fuir, mama
On garde le sourire et on prie, même dans les pires moments
J'ai pas envie de fuir, mama
On garde le sourire et on prie, même dans les pires moments
J'ai pas envie de fuir, mama

J'étais amoureux d'Amélie, elle me semblait si calme
Elle est discrète et timide, c'est tout ce qui fait son charme
Pour elle je serai sérieux, surtout qu'elle est si belle
Elle me dit qu'on sera heureux si je reste fidèle
Mais elle, bizarrement, beaucoup de gars frappent à sa porte
Et quand je lui demande, elle me dit, ""C'est juste des potes""
Qu'il y a rien d'intime, que je m'en fais pour rien
Quelques tentatives, mais ça va jamais plus loin
Mais vite je réalise que ma copine est malhonnête
C'est fou tout ce qu'on découvre grâce à des photos sur le net
En fait t'étais la fille la plus fourrée de tout Paname
Moi j'ai failli t'écrire une chanson pour te déclarer ma flamme
Pff, plus jamais!

Souhaitez-moi tout l'amour du monde
Mais priez pour que jamais je ne retombe sur une bitch, bitch, bitch
Plus jamais sur une bitch, bitch, bitch, plus jamais!

Souhaitez-moi tout l'amour du monde
Mais priez pour que jamais je ne retombe sur une bitch, bitch, bitch

J'étais amoureux de Awa, sa beauté me maltraite
Elle a foutu le dahwa, dans mon cœur et ma tête
Même si le temps est compté, un jour elle sera ma femme
Mais quand on s'est rencontrés, j'étais encore à la fac
Le problème c'est qu'Awa n'aime que le luxe et le brillant
Comment lui offrir la Lune avec un job d'étudiant?
Elle cherche à débaucher un gars qui a la cote
Et comme j'étais fauché, elle a claqué la porte
Des années après, le succès, mon rap se vend
La miss me rappelle pour rattraper le bon vieux temps
Elle rêve que l'on roule en Benz-Mercedes
À qui t’ira donner ton boule quand je retomberai dans la dèche?
Donc plus jamais!

Souhaitez-moi tout l'amour du monde
Mais priez pour que jamais je ne retombe sur une bitch, bitch, bitch
Plus jamais sur une bitch, bitch, bitch, plus jamais!

Souhaitez-moi tout l'amour du monde
Mais priez pour que jamais je ne retombe sur une bitch, bitch, bitch

J'étais amoureux de Nadia, notre histoire était ainsi
Fallait que je m'adapte au respect de ses principes
Et elle m'a mis d'accord, dès le démarrage
Elle veut préserver son corps jusqu'au jour de son mariage
Moi ça me dérange pas de partager sa morale
Mais ma chérie prend du poids d'une manière anormale
En fait un autre mec avait laissé son empreinte
J'ai appris par sa mère que ma vierge était enceinte
Y'a pas eu d'au revoir on s'est quitté sur cette erreur
Si elle entend ma voix, je lui souhaite le meilleur
L'amour n'est pas une feinte, voilà où ça t’amène
T'as voulu faire la sainte, tu t'es mentis à toi-même
Donc plus jamais!

Souhaitez-moi tout l'amour du monde
Mais priez pour que jamais je ne retombe sur une bitch, bitch, bitch
Plus jamais sur une bitch, bitch, bitch, plus jamais!

Frustrated by my senses, I've reached a point which I can't ignore
Despite my fears she moves within my arms
I've never felt her near me, I whisper words to keep me calm
We are silent, we play our parts
We need the violence, but hold eachother gently as we dance
Panic found me after all
Blood runs even faster, Im holding on to what Ive been told
""Just take my fears and colour them as you please""
I whisper to her softly, I think she laughs when as she looks at me
We are silent we play our parts
We need the violence, but hold eachother gently as we dance
I sleep tonight, a mattress on the floor
Im waking up beside her, the pain is here as it was before"

I am trying to smile as I give you a kiss
But you're holding your hand in the way
I am starting to age, I'm starting to shake
And I will never be the same again
I perform inside your mouth
Am I clean? There is a doubt
I am disease, you are the sick

It's easy to get used to, it really doesn't bother me more

It's like a fire
And you can feel it if you're one of my kind
It holds your potion
And if it's blended with my hatred fine
I couldn't look at anybody, I meet, I'm just as scared
I'm terrified somebody will know
But all that I can do is hide it to myself
Knowing that one day it will flow

It's coming at me, it doesn't matter how I try
It's closer, but it's eating me up from inside

I guess I'm lonely
With no attention being as good as you
I should comprehend
The way that I turn to lose
And I'm pushing things a little bit hard to feel at ease
And everything I try do

And something that's not me,
And something that's not real are change kind from to cruel

It's coming at me, it's never gonna let me go
I need it - it gives attention to my soul,

The ache in me from a night before
I'm taking a ride to suburban plains
I'm looking for a face to compare mine with
Only to find them staring back at me
Cruel is the morning that i face right now
People and they're moving out
Oh my head
I'm coping with the ache
And i see
I try hard to look alive
Stepping out in a distant zone
I'm taking my ride to suburban plains
I couldn't care less if i miss the train
I've never been here, but i know my way
Oh my head
But i'm coping with the ache
And i see
I try hard to look alive
And i know
I've been here so many times
Yes i know

I've got this wish, I'll be the one who takes you home
Last night before we met
My only comfort was a television set
In my mind it's kind of a task:
Will I have the courage to look at you when I ask?
Still there is some time
And I'll be damned if you don't end up as mine
Right now this is the scene
The in-crowd is here, and I am someone inbetween
I see you, and where you stand
There is a line for those who'd die to shake your hand
They're eager, I know, cause so am I
But I'm restricted by my fear to catch your eye
And I think: am I afraid?
Maybe this is the worst mistake I've ever made
I look up and there he stands, I don't know what to do
His repulsive smile says: ""(I want you) How are you?""
You answer: ""I'm fine, but worse is I'm alone.
So I am looking for someone special to take me home""
He invites you, you accept to take his hand
Things run smooth now, just exactly like he planned
There's another hand of his around your waste
You think you're only dancing, but you should see that look on his face
I see this, now am I about so loose?
I can't believe that he will be the one you'll choose
No I just can't believe
I can't believe
I can't believe
No I can't believe
I can't believe that he will be the one you'll choose

I'm alright and I'm not alone

Feed me with my broken heart,

About things that didn't matter
But were important to you
I said: I'm frustrated and lovesick
Looking for the nearest way out
So you don't find out what I'm all about
We started out together
Twoard an ending, me and you
We kissed away the hours
Like young lovers do
It was never my intention
To become distant and cruel
Now I'm somewhere else
And whit someone new
I said: I'm frustrated and lovesick
Looking for the nearest way out
So she doesn't find out what I'm all about

If I try again, will I be rewarded?

As you'll meet me tonight
Painted eyes and painted lips
As you'll meet me tonight
But that dress you wear feels wrong in a way
And your face makes a grin in that reflection of yours
'Cause I will use the same old words
To say those things that you want me to say
And you will look happy, but no
It's just because you know that I want you to be
It's not better for me
Face to face in a crowded place
As conversation runs out
And plans are made for another try
As conversation runs out

To say those things that you want me to say

And I know I'm too good for this.

Just 5 more minutes

Fuck you!

What I ever did
Was give you my attention
You love me then leave me alone
But there's been some things
That you'd forgot to mention
All this time you've been holding your tongue
Unfinished business
Things we'd left unsaid
But I'm here to tell you exact
I say I'm leaving
You say just leave then
Something keeps holding me back

Must be

Fuck you!

For three years and two months
Only one day it took, you've been breaking
All the rules in my book
I've always suspected,
But never was sure
I've had four minutes, give me one more.

Give me one more minute
To just finish, said this three times before

I had 5 more minutes,
And, I just did it

Needed only 5 minutes to say

From vanguished desperation

Hoping for enlightenment

Being moved but not ready to cry

Or finished school just like my parents wanted

And I feel I need some guidance
And my heart will let it show
In a world we're always finding 
I'm gonna make it on my own

Working late to earn my keeping
Cos no one is gonna pay my way
The night is cold I should be sleeping
But I'm waiting for my morning train.
And I do this till I reach my goal
Because no one's gonna do it for me
And the night is young but time is old
And I'ma do this till I reach my glory.

Ayy, I ain't crashed in like 4 days
Liquor got me goin' more craze
Left the record by Scorces'
I lie and say the world's yours

I put my mama in a million dollar condo
I just made a million dollars off a convo
My gorilla strapped up like the gun show
Had this motherfucker lookin' like the Congo
Uh, I made it out the jungle
If you hatin', bet this dick gon' reach your tonsils
Huh, bitch call me Papa Shango
I'ma beat, beat it up just like a bongo, hey

Thinking you a bad bitch
Really, you just doing bad bitch
Fronted on me when I ain't had shit
Until I came up like a savage
Foreign girl with a accent (yuh)
She can barely fit that ass in the Aston (yuh)
You fronted on me when I ain't had shit (you)
Until I came up like a savage

Left the record by Scorces'
I lie and say the world's yours

You fronted on me, fr-fr-fronted on me
That's the worst you could do when you done it on me
I fucked your friends 'cause you used to fuck my homies
She told her friends, ""That nigga stunted on me""
Pull off in that Lambo'
Burnin' rubber and my eyes low (bitch, back the fuck up)
I tell her she can fuck up my life
Just don't fuck up my cash flow
Walk up in this bitch, Louis, Gucci, lil' Prada
Went from none to somethin', been like tada
When you hear how I ball, don't call
This is not your cheese, you get nada
You did me wrong when I ain't had shit
Got done like Ellie, you a bad bitch
I used to sleep on mattress
Now I got ex hoes on my tracklist

Thinking you a bad bitch
Really, you just doing bad bitch
Fronted on me when I ain't had shit
Until I came up like a savage

But that's the enemy store we don't go there
Nigga I'm from Bompton
I know ese's and all my enemies bitches wanna s** me
All my yg's give it up, enemies hit 'em up

YG,"Bool, Balm & Bollective",/y/yg/bool+balm+bollective_21320943.html,"Woke up this morning feelin’ bool and balm
Ain’t have to drank no drank a niggas nerves was balm
Was it 'cause last night I had some bomb
She got ratchet in the red dress we had a bomb
Then I pulled up at a light, some niggas banging real hard
I had to tell them little niggas I never heard of y'all
Tryna make a nigga lose his composure
Had to hit the gas on 'em almost spilled my whole soda
Still emotions, can't let 'em get the best of me
My curve skills on deck they want the recipe
They like how you do it and then keep it movin’
'Cause see me I usually lose it
When nigga act stupid, like he ain’t know my record ruthless
Actin’ like he with the business but he ain’t worth me down’ detention
Sittin’ in prison waiting’ for my niggas, asking for money from these bitches
When niggas start trippin’ I be wanna start tripping’
But I’m just bicken' and act like the bigger nigga

'Cause I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm, and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm, and bollective

So I pull up at Pammy House
Pammy stay next to my family house
And Pammy someone I used to dig out
I stopped digging she start tripping I had to dip out
Smashin' out of the driveway she threw a brick at my window
So I stopped she ran up and Keyed my '64
See when a real nigga hit it needy bitches go schizo
This dick is not a rental, should of knew from get go
Get go, get, get get go
I’m friendly like Casper but I wait 'til I hit to get ghost
She called her brother on me, say she from the Wood, I ain’t pussy
And real niggas don’t get it between dick and pussy
10 minutes later got a call on my cell
From a nigga that sound like he was fresh outta jail
“Ay gay little nigga don’t put your hands on my sister
'Cause I just gotta outta jail for manslaughter with a butcher
And she ain’t no hooker, she ain’t no bitch
My momma raised her right, my little sister got sense""
I told him I ain’t test her I just stopped giving’ her dick
Then I told him fuck you and hung up like click

'Cause I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm, and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm, and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm, and bollective

Gotta call little later 'bout this and that
All drama, have to hang up like this is wack
I shouldn’t be talking’ on the phone either 'cause I’m strapped
If the police pull me over, my black ass goin’ back
And that's right up they alley, but I ain't a alley cat
I’m a red nose pitbull matter of fact
Turned on some Jeezy that's what street nigga slap
Right on Leanna, left on Spruce we in the back
Now my older homie hollering’ at me
Bought some real life shit and how its ‘sposed to be
So he approaches me, get real close to me
Try to tell me 'bout some niggas thats close to me
So I listen and I listen 
And I had to put my bid in
Can’t keep it real with some niggas that ain’t real with me
He said to keep it P you is right
They ain’t never bool they better respect your life

'Cause I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective

You always got somethin' bad to say, you a hater
You niggas penny pinching, man, I'm itching for that paper
I want a big crib, glass floors, elevator
I like that in-house pussy like Flava Flava
You in that baby mama Benz, that is not a stunt
You swear you doing somethin', man, your head is corrupt
Get you a nigga like me, bitch, I'm what's up
I just had to take her to brunch she let me fuck

You talkin' like you got the motherfucking check, but is you cuttin' it?

The war cost money, nigga, get your dollars up

You all cap like my 4Hunnid logo
Hard bottoms, white socks that's my mojo
You fuck niggas wearin' Team Jordans and Polo (Ew)
I ain't change my number, you just blocked
Bitch, you ain't Chaka Khan, stop actin' shocked
I'm actin' brand new, like my watch
Said, ""Please hit me back"", please, bitch, you's a bop

[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Go back to my old ho, that's a no-no
Broke bitch, only want promo
Fucked around, that's why I'm solo
So bitch, don't call me no more
I used to go soft on a ho, now I'm hard on a ho
Fuck all of that sweet shit
I used to go soft on a ho, now I'm hard on a ho
Fuck all of that sweet shit

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Shake your ass, watch yourself
Bitch, your doin' too much, please stop yourself
I put you back in the game, I took you off the shelf
You doin' molly every night, bitch, watch your health, yeah
Lookin' around the room, I fucked every bitch in it
If it smell bad, then my tongue's not in it
Tequila and tabs, Jessie said, ""Let's send it""
She chokes on my dick, all my windows tinted
She got a 21 waist, she models VS
Her diet is sniff more, eat less
She said she only fucked five guys, BS
You ain't got a lot of meat, please speak less
E-40 gave me the Sick Wid It medallion
You need a verse, I text you $150,000
Four ice Italian, that's six hundred stallions
Fuckin' Jamisha to YG's first album, yee

Fucked around, that's why I'm solo

I'm agressive off the drank, just a little, I admit it
When I'm sober, I act different, know the difference, I be chillin'
But this ain't the motherfuckin' time to be chillin'
You see the homie in the corner, that's my nigga
The other homie in the corner, that's my nigga

I'm really West Side, I catch a case for this shit
Let the marathon continue, it's not a race with this shit
And I ain't even have no oldheads to lace me with shit
All my homies gang but now they changin' and shit
I mean, it's still gang gang but now they makin' some chips
Ooh, I represent this shit to the T
I represent this shit like I do Bompton trees
This ain't no smoke and mirror, nigga, fuck nicotine
Lookin' like the West every time I hit the scene
Me and Mustard kept this shit lit, ooh
Pac ain't the only motherfucker with the juice
Call Dre, call Snoop, call Game and Kendrick too
When you think about the West, it's me and Nip, red and blue, nigga

Talkin' 'bout the West Coast, I'm the face of it
Gangster in designer clothes, I'm the face of it
I told them hoes to get low, I'm the face of it

Drove the Maybach to the block, I'm the face of it
Dissin' all the opps, I'm the face of it
Hard bottoms, white socks, I'm the face of it
We gon' do this one for hip-hop

I'm on some thirsty shit
I want the recognition, on some thirsty shit
I want the recognition, on some thirsty shit
I want the recognition, clout chasin'
Whoever think different, I'll diss 'em

I be steady tryna tell these bitch niggas they not
They be tryna say I'm only urban, I say I'm pop
They be like, ""How you figure that?"" I say, ""I'm hot,"" bitch
I'm in the Lambo drop-top, bitch
I turn a good girl to a thot, bitch
We the reason that the strip club pop, bitch

Got knocked 'fore I could see him, tell him welcome home
Told his baby mama to threeway me, he call her phone
'Cause I know the pain, locked in them chains, all alone
And it feel like the walls closing and pray to Allah, hoping that
When he go to court, that the feds don't open it
Fake niggas putting up, ""Free you"" when they be posting it
But ain't no money orders in the mail when you open it
My young boy was toting that Glock, high off them opiates
Killed his dawg about some shit that wasn't appropriate

[Verse: Day Sulan]
You see the highlights of a life was not as a teen
Baby girl was homeless, had a nigga thuggin' in the streets
18, runnin' plays in the streets, dealin' with them weirdos niggas
In-between family wasn't no real love she ever seen
Head beat, mentally depressed, baby was not what she seemed
Always gleam, kept a smile on the face, avoid the questioning
Even though apparent how she moved, she done seen some things
Prolly had some dreams, diminished by the luck of things
Reality, lost her way and started strippin'
More pain, 13 and the fam yellin', ""Prolly all you'll ever be
Ho-in', strippin' in the streets, you'll be pregnant by 15"" Said bet money, they bet money
Mama ain't have time for her, daddy never cared for her Never had the guidance, only downin' words that's drownin' her
Cut off from the world, shit was cold to her
Tried to kill herself but shit, it didn't work
Mama laughed, it broke her heart
Built from scabs, so pain don't hurt
Never built a day she worked
Hard to get it back when all they did was stomp it in the dirt
Now look at her, 21 and numb, she still feel pain but it don't bother her
Puttin' family first, even after all the dirt"

What’s up my friend? como te llamas? my name is Jizzle
I heard you had them whole white squares down to the Medow
Give me everyone of them bitches you got I get ‘em off
We can sit back and split up the profit minus the cost
Right now I’m on my “get money” shit , no time to floss
Man I’m talking so much money in the room I’m getting lost
And you know we do it face to face not on the selling
If you want ‘em send them shots of the sea just like on belly
And this bad bitch I got from the plug she snort the eight
Told that bitch you should be same as yourself bitch wipe your face
On the floor my columbian nigga I told ‘em Cubo
Say you ’bout to drop me a hundred I need 2 more
All I fuck was mucho , wait, I’m talking sumo
I play them cards just like they go I’m talking uno
Go to sleep in the hood, woke up in that versace
With the feds outside it’s snapping like paparazzi

Pablo Escobar gave me 10 bricks

We make a million, spend a million life is a fairytale
If they catch me in the crew they gon’ throw us in the jail
If I think that they ain’t right then I ain’t making a sale

You know I’m kicked back , just peeping the conversation

I’m sick of trying countin’ these millions fuck is the billions
Got money in the couch, money all up in the ceiling

I know we all know a girl named Keshia
If you don't, listen to this

[Verse 1: YG]
Young Keshia, so fly, so diva
So wise, so eager, so hot, high fever
Everybody in the hood wanna taste her, she was teasin'
Everybody thought they had a chance with it, she wasn't easy
She knew the Earth was made of dirt
Daddy wasn't around but she knew her worth
You ain't have to tell her cross her legs when she wore a skirt
Life goal's to be a lawyer or a nurse
She let Ray hit it at 18 years young
Them grown-up bums had Ray sprung
Everybody knew she was the one
She ain't fuck with lil' boys since dun-dun-dun-duns
Photogenic, she knew her angles, huh
Everybody shot they shot from different angles, huh
Lookin' in her eyes, you saw angels, huh
You would've swore she was an angel, huh

Keshia had a baby (Pretty Keshia)
Keshia had a baby (So fly, so diva, so wise, so eager)
Keshia had a baby
Keshia had a baby (So hot, high fever, she was teasin')

[Verse 2: YG]
Ray was a young boy when Christ start comin' 'round
Chris was playin' ball so she couldn't turn him down
He was full of game, she got hers from her mama
Ray was lame compared to Chris, but Chris came with the drama
Mama always said she was Michelle, she need Obama
Mama said don't settle with no broke nigga, that's a problem
She ran that same game on Ray, that's sad
She left Ray for Chris, she in her bag
Now Ray all fucked up, Chris just lucked up
Ray probably suicidal 'cause he really love her
Chris a first round draft pick, he 'bout to blow up
Ray somewhere gettin' drunk, face on sad pup
Keshia ain't trippin', she don't think 'bout it at all
Months later, Ray seen Keshia pregnant in the mall
Jaws dropped like, ""Ahh"" (Oh)
Ray was really her dawg and she did him like a dog

[Verse 3: YG]
Chris finally made it to the league
Chris was scoring thirty points a game, MVP
Twenty mil' a year, the highest paid on the team
Life was good good, Keshia neck bling bling
Keshia wrist bling bling, Keshia ring bling bling
He was a made nigga with a bad bitch on his team
Couple goals, they was a meme
Anywhere they came, they came clean
This one late night, they was on a date night
Dinner at a beach house, you know that view was hella nice
Then Chris phone rang, it read, ""Boo Thang""
Keshia paused like...
""You bitch ass nigga, who the fuck is 'Boo Thang?'
Where she at? I'ma beat her ass and run her over in this Mulsanne""
He said, ""Don't leave me""
She said, ""Fuck you, I'm gone""
He said, ""We got a baby, where you gon' go?""

Keshia had a baby (Keshia, Keshia, tell me where you goin', Keshia)
Keshia had a baby (When they're dead, you can't leave 'em, 'cause the baby gon' need 'em)
Keshia had a baby (you know you can't leave 'em, 'cause the baby gon' need 'em)
Keshia had a baby (Keshia had a baby, ooh)
Keshia had a...

[Outro: Rose Gold & YG]
It was what you wanted, huh?
Now you know you fucked up, Keshia
Got a baby that you love
But the baby ain't enough for Keshia
I was raised to be secure and you know you insecure like Keshia
Now you lookin' like, ""Damn"" (Damn)
""Havin' Chris' baby ain't make him love me""
He take care of the kid
Don't you worry 'bout that bitch
That's the way they set up with
That's just how the story is, oh Keshia
What you did to Ray ain't cool
You left him, that was wrong
And now Ray won't answer his phone
Drama's at your door
That's how it goes

And how what's-his-name from high school locked up in the feds, yeah
Real down-to-earth, solid bitch
Fuck Donald Trump, the only time we talk politics
We was 'bout to vibe like some spiritual monopolists
I made sure she was good so she knew who I was rockin' with, yeah

YG,Ride With Me,/y/yg/ride+with+me_21321723.html,"You niggas sound like me now
Still got my plug on speed dial
Called so many shots, I re-dialed
Blat-that! Ring out
Snitch nigga pussy, a meow
Shoot a nigga bitch like a rebound
Ol' I wanna be down
Screw face cause I'm on the scene now
Fiend choke a nigga out before he get beat down
Leave a nigga body with no body
Second look 'em, fish hook 'em, only way he get [?]
You niggas taking deals to reduce time
You told police about your plug out in Tuscon
Your old homies don't fuck with you cause you too hot
See niggas like you be the reasons hoods be two sides
Oh, run and hide, nigga, patience a virtue
That paperwork got niggas ready to murk you
My lil' nigga kept it solid, did a 5 to 9
I wish a lawyer for all my niggas that's fighting time
(On God)

Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I didn't want a dime on me
Snitches through they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
Gotta keep the fire on me

I'm riding dirty on the L-O
Cause the judge giving niggas body parts, elbows
So I paid fifteen hundred for my stash spot
This janky dude, you fuck with it, it'll pop out
Ooh, I got a strike and a felony
But the homie riding with me say his record clean
So you would take this case is what you telling me?
Ooh, you better not tell on me
You went to jail for a lick and came home too quick
And you wonder why your homeboys never wanna tell you shit
But we wasn't too sure so the homie still let 'em lurk
'Til niggas saw that paperwork
Told the D.A., ""He was the driver, he plotted, he did it, he even threatened to fuck me up if I wasn't with it""
Now it's all bad in the hood and he can't come around
Conversations like, ""Something, something, gun that nigga down""

Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I didn't want a dime on me
Snitches through they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
Gotta keep the fire on me

I made it through my situation and I stayed down
For niggas [?] it's nothing much you can say now
I'm so accustomed to sucka' niggas that hate now
I pokerface and then touch 'em, my niggas play foul
It ain't no rules cause these niggas threw the rules away
If I could pick a place and time I would choose today
See I'm the type of nigga die for his jewelry
Gang related homicide is what the news'll say
Playing with my reputation ain't amusing me
Playing with a nigga patience who are you to say
Short temper, fuck it, I'ma blow a fuse today
And when I lose my mind I'ma shoot a face
I seen 'em get away with murder cause he knew the way
Killed a nigga, went to trial, then he beat the case
So what type of example do it set, nigga
Play with mine, you can fuckin' get wet nigga
Yes, nigga

Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I didn't want a dime on me
Snitches through they time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
Gotta keep the fire on me

I keep the fire on me, like a motherfuckin' BIC
She just want my balls, I just gotta throw the pitch
Fiending for the cash, I just got a slight itch
365 grind, yeah we runnin' in this bitch (hey)
I don't fuck around with a snake nigga, no, no
Fuck how you feel, nigga, I just want the bankroll
Riding with the fire on me
Master with the shit, no P
Hoes watching me like Glee
It ain't hard to see you on a beat
(Camp!)

Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me

[Verse 2]
Verse two, verse two
I got too much to spit for verse two
Just be careful on how you approach dude
Cause he done already heard about what you wanna do
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia down in killer California
What's their motive? What's their motive?
Shit, I'm the closest with some money that they know of
Lady problems, family problems
Homies problems, all this drama
On my mama, this the type of shit you sweat out in the suana
Grandma pray for me, devil keep away from me
Fell out with my day one, that was my ace to me
Mind blown, somethin' different when I'm on
All this shit got me in another rhyme zone
Lately, I've been at home
I grab the pistol when I answer the door

I ain't F with this, but I F with this
Can't complain about it, gotta find out where he gonna master it
Gotta put cameras all around the crib
Gotta, gotta wear the vest like a bib
Got some, got some problems, a whole lot 'em
So I stay dangerous, Osama
Nigga say they heard about a million dollars
So I gotta bulletproof the Impala
Man I'm 'bout to lose it
Homies I'm confused with
Money get involved, it's all bad, they switch too quick
It's too sick, thought you was realer, my nigga
Got popped, you ain't do shit
Thought you was my killer, my nigga
Oh! Shit get realer, my nigga
When niggas know you gettin' skrilla, my nigga
I don't know what's gotten into my nigga
Close from day one, I was with him, my nigga

Too much red, I might start a fire
Two bankrolls and both of 'em mine

Tryna leave a fuckboy's brains missin'
Try to take my chain, then you gon' get hit

Spent 20 out of that and get your baby daddy whacked (oh ohh)

All my life, wanted to love you, wanna make you proud
To never leave you or how they fly
Gave up my loyalty and paid the price
Got me asking why these people wrong you, but you done them right
They giving up and all you do is fight
You sacrificing, you would even die
And I thank God for never leaving me alone even when I'm on my own
Won't break up, stand up strong
And I thank God for showing the road to go
When the weekend feeling low, built up, but never show

Sorry, Ms. Jackson, I hate to call in this fashion
I understand it's late and you work harder than average
Plus I'm knowing that you and your son have been clashing
But Kenny called and told me to tell you what happened
He hit a lick with his homies, his homies switched it on him
They spent the money, he got greedy and put the pistol on him
Shots fired from both sides, but nobody died
I thank God he survived and got out alive
But this gon' hurt you to hear
Kenny went to jail, might be facing some years
Police say it's evidence he broke into someone's residence
The neighbors say they witnessed it and plus they found fingerprints
They say the bail like 50 thou
But it's gon' be like 5 thousand to get him out
Man, I told him not to fuck with them niggas
I'm sorry, I don't mean to curse, but I just never trust 'em at all
And he up in the pound, my dawg
And his girl ain't accepting his call

If I told you I was back, nigga that's what it is
I run the left side of the map and that's what it is
My homie got that pack and that's what it is
If you ain't trying spend that hot box then that's what it is
If you don't want to get that money and act like a bitch
I'm the one get the money and pass it out to my clique
Cause everybody know I'm rich
Everybody everybody everybody know I'm rich
Put the squad on my back (squad)

Backseat full of bitches
You can say a nigga riding with that Mack
Oh, life still krazy

I'm still paranoid though from what I left behind

Hey
Remember standin' in the trap wit 5 or 6 over-vision and a pirat
That nigga who oderderd that quarter ki ain't even came by yet
Blew a whole O of dro, and I ain't even high yet
Spent 4 G's or mo', and I ain't even fly yet
Viper truck, Bentley grill, big wheel pimpin'
They done gave her 20 mil, well big deal pimpin'
Think we fakin' when we spittin', better get real pimpin'
'Cause we still will kill, you just better chill pimpin'
Get it how he used to live, and keep on fakin' for the women
In life we all make decisions even when faced with collisions
Like me at 13, out in no supervision
Straight thug livin', bumpin' pot drug-dealin'
Seen daily on the block, need Yay we on the block
Keep the hatin' to yourself, 'cause that ak be on the block
Dougy C be in the V, me and kt, we in the drop
Went from standin' on the block wit rock, to standin' on the top

[Chorus:]

Miss the 17 fire, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Told y'all I was gon' blow, kinky B said so
Or not, back to chargin' 600 for an O
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before (True)
La hoop nigga, all you gotta do is score
I turn the brick into a label, nigga I'm a boss
Brush my teeth in the morning, I ain't even gotta floss (Haha)
Sold two million records, and half a million O's (Damn)
Add it all up, it's 'bout a billion rocks
You can't be serious, you niggaz ain't fo' real
Just my ears alone, iss like a quarter a mil' (That's right)
Hit ya by the tech, and blow half the budget (Yup)

One in the chamber on the table when you chillin for lunch,
And head up with your door open feelin your blunt,
Where I'm from 20 gone by the end of the month,
I get drunk smoke the weed to the end of the blunt,
Make sure 10 shells done been in the pump,
If it's on-first draw that's a nigga wit luck,
All niggas playin games start endin em up,
Cuz your block young buck will start bendin em up,
As soon as your adrenaline pump,
Make way dear lord cuz I'm sendin em up

Stack your cheese in all different ways,
Tote your strap and keep your khakis creased,

Ima show ya cats how to bus yall guns,
Hit a nigga up and leave his ass left numb,
Don't play with me,

And I don't smoke weed for the smell of it,
Just before I kill, I inhale the shit,
You can't trail me bitch I be in 50 states,
Paranoid, with about 50 cakes,
Once a nigga find out it's all heart no shake,
That's when I infest the place,
I'm thugged out,
Up in the drug house,
Got it all-from the beer to a quarter ounce,
We da real ass niggas, all work no slouch,
Can I get that there? All that count,
All they amount,
But when it go down and a nigga make all ya say all that out,
What you gunna do nigga what you about,
Either ride or die, when I'm raised in the south,
Love the block, when a nigga wake up,
I wash my face and then hug my glock,
Brush my teeth and scream south side,
Smoke a blunt and put on my socks,
But it still don't stop, from dusk to dawn,
A nigga been out here on his own-livin day to day,
See I'm only 17 but a nigga out here just gains farm"

And we'll be back seat with the cardier frames
The easier it got nigga the harder it came,
But I stayed in the game,

There'll be hell on earth if I stay in the game,

And I just bought another pack
Blow some weed in this bitch

Pillsbury Dough Boy painted on the side
Baking soda seats this my dope man ride
All the junkies see me comin'
And they all get to runnin'
Before I can get out they hollain' ""What you got for me?""
I make another stack
Then go check another trap
Got my mind on my money and my hand on my strap
The block throw a party when a cop get shot
So when they come through here.. They do not stop
And everyday we hustlin' like it or not
Just keep the old folks cool and we can set up shop
These young niggas act a fool start runnin' it hot
If a nigga break the rules I'm a show him what I got

Since a juvie I've been making movies with this Uzi
I don't talk like this usually but niggas done confused me
Shot it out with the best, I buried the rest of them
I know these niggas hate me, I refuse to let these niggas do me
Don't see demons, I have no nightmares
I did it all for a reason and who said life's fair?
My lil partner went in at 21 and he done got white hair
Keep telling me if he was here, he knew he would've been right there
Wish he never put his fingertips on niggas' clips
Loose lips seems to always sink a killer ship
These bitches flip, talk for that lil thousand dollar tip
These niggas get caught, and get hit all up in they whip

They put that shit up under that blue light and fuck up niggas' plans

Daddy when you're coming home?
I wish I could tell you but I don't know, If you don't work, you don't eat
Just be good while I gone...
Daddy when you're coming home?
I'm hustlin i'll be back in a week...
Make sure you do your homework and kiss your momma for me...
Daddy when you're coming home?
Don't ask me no more, i'm about to go
Can I go with you daddy?
Little girl shut my door
Daddy when you're coming home?
You know i'll be back I got to, but for now I gotta to do
What I gotta do I love you

(Vers 1)
I know I run these street to much but that's my life
And for you I trade it all my house, car, my ice
Every nigght I look at you.. I thank god(Thank God)
Knowing you got evrything you want and I ai'nt even got a job
Not to mention this thug-life i'm livin
I never let you go sleep in a brick building
The day you was born me and my niggas popped bottles
Fellin in the hospital drunk to going to see my daughter...
You already seen the look  in my eyes to hear my babygirl cry..
The happiest day of my life to see my babygirl smile..
It's a big world now
So you know to take it slow...
You don't need a nigga for nothing your daddy got do...
You gone live where you want to, drive what you want to..
As long you are alive you gone do what you want to
I put my life on the line for me and mine...
When I leave men she's saying everytime

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]

You think I like spendin nights on the street..
I do that, so daddy can keep keep nikes on your feet...
See the reason you can't come in the kitchen...
I'm cookin chicken..
We can go to the mall and ball soon as daddy finished...
Let me take care of my busines for a minute..
And anything you want I promise we gonna get it..
Can't wait to see my baby graduate
When that day come rolex, baggets, daddy gonna pay for..
Once a man make one, he'll see the way that I feel
You know that ain't no gangsta be play shit to real...
See kids bring bills you know it cost a little
Better keep working or tworking something that kid need meals...
I got my baby tatto on my arm..
September 27 is the day she was born
Untill I get back just holdin down for pappa...
And hurtin to my heart evrytime to hear you holla...

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]

And over this live before I wishin for a daddy
My baby will never grow up livin unhappy
I spend my whole life without my father it bother me bad..
I thank God for my momma she is all I had...
A nigga turn to the street to raise me...
I dropped outta high school look what it make me...
The chances that I never had...
My baby gonna have
So if my babygirl is in high school my baby gonna pass...
I sitting laugh cause she know that she looks just like me..
And me never coming home it's calling unlikely...
It's know that evrything I do is ment for me and you...
P. S your daddy Young Buck I love you...

Last night the United States
Brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice
Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi is dead
He was the founder and leader of isis
Us special operations forces
Executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid
The us personnel were incredible
I got to watch much of it
He died after running into a dead end tunnel
Whimpering and crying and screaming all the way
The compound had been cleared by this time
With people either surrendering
Or being shot and killed
Eleven young children were moved out of the house
And are uninjured"

Damn, look at what I call my life, a glock-9
And a eightball of white, I got mine
Well, not quite, I got signed
And 50 put me right in the light, it took time
Meanwhile I'm livin the life
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight
My rent due, baby need food and shoes
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose
So I smoke, lookin for the fools with jewels
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a uzi do
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up
You not here, so you ain't really givin a fuck
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin, I'm hustlin
I'm thuggin, and this is the reason because I

If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)
Tell all my niggaz goodbye (tell my niggaz goodbye)

Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)

I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same

Puttin all kind of thangs in our baby's name
Tell the hoes ""I'm rich bitch"" like my name Rick James
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain
Cause L. T. Got life, and Big Ju got fifty
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty
Come get me, seems like it's no way out
So when I say ""Dirty,"" you say ""South""
Tryin to put my hands on somethin, brush off my shoulders
Buy up some land or somethin, get what they owe us
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin is what they told us
Remember what the O. G. 's showed to the soldiers
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin to get it

I was on the news for knockin him out his shoes
But the dude got a son that go to my daughter's school
So I'm cool, cause I can grab what he love most

It's somethin that we live by, somethin that we ride fo'

All this time I'm the nigga that you pretend to be
Tables done turned now I'm like ""Remember me?
The same lil' nigga you overcharged for a ki""
Times hard on a G, you was larger than me
Young, but I ain't dumb, you ain't smarter than me
Give niggaz a inch, and they takin the whole mile
So I hop out the 6, and I takin they whole pile
Uh-uh whoa now, how many niggaz see this grown child
Shit gettin hectic then you shut 'em down
Tennessee to Uptown, niggaz is thuggin, mean muggin
Ain't no stoppin I'm hot, and the game is what I'm lovin nigga

Get money nigga!"

This for the block nigga, what?

[D-Tay]
I make one move, hit your block, and your whole spot hot
Uh-huh, if you're lucky have your whole block cocked
Now I ain't sayin that's gon' stop all my niggaz that chop
Cause in they mind, ain't no dyin, niggaz flip to get flopped
Shootin more than 50 shots and my heart catch not
When the gunfire a-start it ain't no callin the cops
Besides, you started beef, I'm just bringin it back
All my niggaz you hunt around so what you packin a gat?
Just leave that where it's at, or leave here on your back
Make one move like you're reachin and I'm leavin you flat
Warnings I'm givin you, but you never did listen
So I'm spittin Smith & Wessons 'til they out of ammunition
I'm clip totin, holdin rollin with my cousin Priest
I'm back, and ridin in the candy painted 'llac
We max, and gettin all these hoes for they cheese
We jack, and gettin all these ballers for they ki's

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Didn't think that I would make it this far, throwin rocks at the pen
Left niggaz layin dead and I did it in sin
And I'd do it again, thugged out 'til the end
Still we gon' keep ridin 'til we caught in the wind

[Rizin Sun]
Nigga I'm gon' make it if I gotta rob and steal
Cock back my grill, let 'em know this burner's for real
When the coast is cleared that's when I plan my escape
Wanted in 50 states, my first shot is debate
Don't be late, Buck we got hits to make
50 is you with me, if they really want me they'd come and get me
Now I'm a fugitive on the run, killers don't leave home
Without the gun, blaze one
They got me nationwide all over the world they tryin to turn me in
But the pearls, I think ahead on that
Fuck the pen, I'm tryin to see my money stacks
If you lookin for me I'm where the ballers at
Drinkin Cristal gettin smoked out
Try not to take the bar out, but they done, tapped my house
I'm goin all out, got me on some major shit
Dressed in black, when I attack, please believe that

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
I need to get my hands on somethin, I suggest you play it low
Get your last words in when the soldier's rag over my nose
Look the anger done build up, I'm damn near about to blow
Tryin to unhook a time bomb when I'm right at zero
Fuck a stolen vehicle, we gon' pull up in luxury
Bubbilize somethin, survive nigga you're lucky
When shit get ugly, bustin e'rythang that rush me
Swingin this fuckin chopper 'til my arms get musty
This occassion calls for military issue buddy
My fetti took a slight fall now y'all gon' be bloody
Young Buck, a.k.a. Frank Nitti of the city
Ain't fakin none to DT's, you got it then come and get me
But the form I come in, I swear it's hard to hit me
Not a face bein shown, just a chrome tucked in my dickies

What's goin on with the Unit these days? (let 'em know)
Well I'ma tell you e'rybody gettin paid

Took a couple losses, still we some outlaws
Ya bitch still lovin my swag
We let you niggaz eat, why the fuck is you mad?
I never left the streets, I really ran to 'em
And since I know they watchin me I let my man do 'em
Money, a house and a bad bitch
Way 'fore the rap game man I had this (niggaz know)
You don't know about bein broke
Standin on the block sellin fiends soap
Holla at me

Shawty you feelin this then put your back in it (hey!)
I'm back in it in an all-black fitted
In an all-black tinted-up drop top Bentley
Like - ayyy! You know what it is (yeah!)
I got my own jewelry baby, this ain't none of his (okay!)
Just holla when you need me
Show a nigga love when you see me
I can carry the weight, 50 just put it on my shoulders
G-Unit is the gang, I'm a motherfuckin soldier
They thought it was over, he let me out the cage (hey!)
So now they got me standin on this goddamn stage, like

[Chorus:]

[Young Buck]
Before I leave let me put this on your brain
If rap stop today, I still do my thang
I bought a Benz way before I bought me a chain
Took my momma out the Bricks and bought a car in her name
Paid my nigga Head bond just to get him on the streets
Hope if I get locked up niggaz do it for me
Keep the project lights on, payin e'rybody bills
All my homies dead, I'm takin care of e'rybody kids
And I got this, you can count on me
To come through, when the home team down by three
I'm gon' shoot, and even if a nigga did miss
I bet you next quarter I'll be back in this bitch, like

Nah nah, hold on
Y'know some niggaz out there

You niggaz is losin your fuckin minds man, ha ha
Aiyyo man I got this shit right now, ya mean?
Get the fuck out my lane, yeah
Y'know, that's why that nigga 50

State to state, slippin slate nigga
This for the block nigga
E'ry nigga out there who God damnit maintainin
Off slangin 'caine and all dem, thangs
And y'knowwhati'mtalkinbout I feel that (I feel that)
See I done been in that situation where niggaz flip birds
Y'all know the gangsta, lil' young nigga
Who thugged out all night on the curb, came up from a gram

And bitch I got 'em warrin for 10-5, the new nigga in town
I'm the king of this drug ring, just waitin to be crowned
You havin money by the ton, I got thousands by the pound
And the urge to splurge for all you niggaz want an ounce
Ain't no problem with the product, long as you got the amount
And every bit of my fetti, cause every bit of it count
I'ma roll in the low, rain snow hot or cold
Finish my narcotics and put my bitches on the road
First nigga try and jack, watch murder go kill them hoes
All white, no crack, how I get it, how it go
17 years old, I'm rappin 10 at a time
To me, front shit ain't punk shit, long as I get mine
And we can get down to shine, no more sellin them dimes
Put 20's on our rides, fuck hoes with thick thighs
Then maybe you can see, how it is to be rich
You ain't heard about a nigga?  I be servin them bricks

Nightfall to sunshine, 24 hour shifts
If crime didn't pay, I'd be still on the strip [repeat 2 lines 3X]
Nightfall to sunshine, 24 hour shifts
Look - if crime didn't pay, I'd be still on the strip

[Young Buck]
I've survived off this cocaine game, and it's a strain to my brain
To front a nigga a thang, 'bout mine he won't complain
Conversation rule the nation, y'all niggaz know the sayin
Prayin I don't catch ya wit'cha watch I'll take ya out the picture
Money run the country, similar to Adolf Hitler
Always been to drugs but see it's different kind of dealers
You pay what you weigh, or should I say, get my scrilla
Not tomorrow but today, okay, it's on the real'a
I ain't tryin to be a killer just a nigga 'bout his cheddar
And I ain't got it, you can't cancel the bill collector
Coulda been did your rump, put your family in the middle
But I chose to be a man and keep it on that level
Your potnahs done told you about this young runnin rebel
And the load he carries behind if I can't get mine
So robbin niggaz blind is the way I'ma play the game
Gotta respect my mind and if you don't you still payin

[Chorus:]

[Young Buck]
I'm a 100% for the Presidents
I never been hesitant, to leave 'em layin with no evidence
Gotta make the best of this, stack my cheese
Then come back and get the rest of it, transportin ki's
In the Benz with the leather kit, ride with me
When you hear that Desert Eagle click it's world war 3
This ain't how it 'posed to be, but ain't no fuckin role model
Besides people down in hell still want ice water
Now how you livin nigga?  When hard times come
Can you stand prison nigga, or you gon' run yo' tongue?
What's that on yo' arm?  You feel like it make a man?
Well let me get that and yo' charm, but turn around and count to 10
Can't turn soldier in one day, the thug gotta just be within
Your blood or yo' family, the streets gon' tell how good you been
But see I'm a young nigga {edited} in his face
Since 12 I had a triple beam servin them cakes

I remember walking up and down that alley you know
Trying to get some money
I finally met somebody

[Verse 1]
Malcolm X my brother assalamu alaikum
Trump ain't no different from Ronald Reagan
Black and white tv my antenna is a clothes hanger
My reality is jack boys and dope slingers
Might see your sister in the back room with crack fumes
Running this crack house like a barber and beauty saloon
We had the [?] to break these boulders down
Trapping and looking for carrot top when he come rolling 'round
Gentrification got niggas changing location now
I done took a loss and my pistol became impatient now
I know I'm a boss I ain't let all this weight just weight me down
I can't wait on nothing, I'm at you people like pay me now

[Chorus]
And I keep the pack from a democrat
Niggas scared to touch it, fuck it
Send me that crown
My Mexicans is moving we need every cent
So tell them go ahead bill me we gon' jump the fence
Trudging through this desert with these bales on my back
I'm gon' be chilling like a cholo if I make it
Told my people it's a chance that I might not make it back
But it's a chance that I'd ever have to take it

[Verse 2]
We done came up from the bottom and we co-defendants
I know you would never snitch on me nigga before the sentence
I put all my property in my momma name
I feel like they was watching me so I'm out the game
I got a problem with authority, won't stay in my lane
So I'm experimenting with other things than cocaine
I mean I am the poster child for that plant Mary Jane
And my nigga making meth in the woods now
We doing numerals on pharmaceuticals
The shit's unusual
I'm watching niggas grow cbd while watching [?]
Couple y'all done told me you're biting on your cuticles
We pulling up with two of those and shooting up your funeral
For real

[Chorus]
And I keep the pack from a democrat
Niggas scared to touch it, fuck it
Send me that crown
My Mexicans is moving we need every cent
So tell them go ahead bill me we gon' jump the fence
Trudging through this desert with these bales on my back
I'm gon' be chilling like a cholo if I make it
Told my people it's a chance that I might not make it back
But it's a chance that I'd ever have to take it

[Verse 3]
Baking soda and a microwave's a luxury
I started with a spoon and a lighter, I had to cook it up
Back when [?] had that Benzy bought from [?]
Jimmy had that Bonneville sitting on gold
Y'all can look it up
That was the days, it was beige
Looking around now it's brown, now a different page
Still I'm around now, walking through a different maze
Taking these pounds to your town, going a different way
Gotta keep extra bands where our bitches stay
Either we pay you in cash or we can pay you in yay
Facts
Building up my house with a brick a day
Watch a nigga lose his life and ain't got shit to say

And I keep the pack from a democrat
Niggas scared to touch it, fuck it
Send me that crown
My Mexicans is moving we need every cent
So tell them go ahead bill me we gon' jump the fence

And see how much juice was left cause niggaz came for me
Revolvers to fullies increasin my ki' movings
Soakin game from Baby watchin old mob movies
Two all gold clips, go with this platinum uzi
To keep you bitches losin 'round Christmas time when the jackers choosin

See when we beef we make yo' street hurt, check yo' beeper
The job is done when you get 911's
Receivin calls talkin 'bout son your lil' brother all alone
My attitude can quickly change potnah
Heads get bust open like Priest when he poppin bottles
No role models to look up to when you ghetto raised
Leavin no clues, stack revenues in different ways

Some niggaz playin with me are scared to stand behind their steel
Shake up and break up what was organized for years
Shed tears, when white folks hand a nigga a L
Ball up and fuck all up a nigga mail
Beeper reportin low, when you put in a Duracell
Put it in your mind, cause that's the first sign they on the trail
Where I dwell, there's plenty money shit be hard to tell
Who doin the yap yappin so they tappin up the cells
When you lived on the hill, was never late payin yo' bills
Now you back to the projects, shit out here gettin real
Somebody lackin they skills and they street smart
Ain't no sunshine playboy, they life dark
It takes one star, one car, one nigga who made it far
One thug, one grudge and it's life behind bars

[""Infrared on all straps"" sample repeats]

[Verse Three]
I stand all man nigga, though a child in age
I got my own brain, my own ways to go and get paid
Niggaz want you in the shade but when you come out and shine
Then here it is you owe 'em somethin, but what about mine?
I never signed a dotted line, therefore just let me be
T. I. P. Took me under and we headed to the highest peak
I might as well just speak, for the soldiers with Buck
Load your artillery, prepare to put your guns up
You think it'll get to this, Bowre told me it would
Said it's all good no more, puttin on your black hood
Still the same frustration that stay beatin my chest
If it ain't one of these bitches then these niggaz won't test
A meal ticket nuttin less, that's what I'm shootin for
And in my quest for chips, there's some shit you can't ignore
So I load up the 4, if you want it then let it be
All these fake niggaz tryin to be just like me

All these rappers wanna talk about how much money they got, how much work they done flipped
I don't see none a' you niggaz out here, nigga I'm out here for real
A nigga tell you my life is real nigga what?

Since everybody rich now
Fuck it I'm broke
All these rappers talking bricks now
I got the dope
I got murder on my mind
And niggaz tryna murda me
Bright like a bounty hunter blood in all burgundy
Gangsta like a crip hollerin 'cause you done heard a' me
Standin over this stove won't these niggaz worry me
Can't no rapper bury me
I be trappin thoroughly
Freeway Ricky Ross be home in the March
I got it all together
Ain't nothin fell apart
Be lyin if I sit here and act like this shit ain't hard
They tellin me ""celebrity""
""Buck you a celebrity""
But if I don't eat, that put my kids life in jeopardy
All this fuckin jealousy
I'm buyin all this weaponry
And I'm listenin to ever word that T.I. tellin me
And I'm flippin every last bird Jeezy sellin me
I'm talkin bout the music
Can't charge me with no felony

(Chorus)
Tell me did ya miss me?
Ya miss me?
They miss me
(x2) 
Well I'm back
I'm Back
(x8) 
Tell me did ya miss me?
Ya miss me?
They miss me (x2)
Well I'm back (x8)
I know these people miss me

Since everybody ballin' now
Fuck it I'm not
All these rappers on these private jets
I'm on the block
Fuck a watch fuck a chain
Fuck a phantom fuck a Range
Gimme life and this mic
And I'ma do the damn thang
I'm Insaneee!!
Crazy bout the money
All these traps made a nigga relapse
They see me and they wonder damn does he still rap?
He out here with the goons so ya gotta feel that
What happened to the morals
When niggaz had rules
You had to put in work and pay ya dues Or Ya lose
Now niggaz is confused
'cause now they gettin four and a half
Lease a car and make it look like you got more than ya have
And these rappers ain't no better they just sayin whatever
Will me and 50 work this shit out?
Naaw I ain't sayin never
But I will say now I'm on a whole 'nother level
From the music to the business to the ghetto.

Young Buck,Died And Came Back,/y/young+buck/died+and+came+back_20531654.html,"If I should die before I wake
Lord please... My soul to take

Man I ain't even ask for this shit...

There's no way I can hide it
You see the pain in my eyes
I aint thinkin bout college
Too busy tryin to stay alive
They done cut the water off
And I ain't trying to the lights go
Even little shit like 5 dollars i'ma fight for
My sisters only 12 and she's pregnant wit a baby
My brothers goin' ta jail and my momma's going crazy
I'm all by myself, muthafuck my old lady
!!! 'Cause soon tha money lil, she was fucking niggaz daily!!!
We already in hell, Lord, please will you save me
I'm riding with a 12 gauge I know these niggas hate me
I got a few birds and a few words for you niggas on the streets
I'm swirving in excursions I know you heard of me
I got em mad at me I hit the block top drop that nigga bad ain't he
We sell rocks plus glocks and keep our rags hanging
Thug niggas shooting at cops
Look we ain't playing, anywhere, setting up shop

I wonder if I died and came back
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat
There's gotta be somebody that who can come and explain that
I know

You got the ak bitches in the hood
These snitches in the hood
My suggestion to you nigga start getting it while it's good
If you crawl for your ball learn the game know the things that will get you knocked off
'Cause niggas out here aint playin
??? Being real done popped off???
Two pills in this home got me way in new york
Bout to run up in your home and I'm way up your floor
My money and I'm gone, if he paid me on time, then we wouldn't have to shoot em
But they got a place for him like they got a place for me
Maybe we'll meet again, we'll just have to wait and see
Thug niggas, I love killin, so c*** it back and bust
Remember me, I used to smoke weed on the school bus
Nigga wha? Nigga who? Nigga wotcha won do?
I'm young buck, now move? And let me come thru
Is it true before you die do you really see it coming                    Do the hardest nigga crying start running?

I wonder if I died and came back
Would god still make a nigga sit here and slang crack
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat
There's gotta be somebody who can come and explain that
I know

Politicians is bullshitting
And really bill clinton is the closest we gettin to ever havin a black president
Still I feel heaven sent and try to walk with my head up
'Cause now we got this anthrax shit to be scared of
Nobody prepared us for this
All they said was ""make sure you watch the news at six""
And we feeding all these other countries
What about that old man eating out of the fuckin dumpster?
Oh you don't know him but everything that goes up must come down
One look, and all the projects that they got go down
I'm rydin' with god
!!! Me and my squad nigga, you-t-p!!!
Now we ballin but remember how it used to be
So regardless, don't let nothing come between our family our money our dreams
And even when it seems like it's all over from Tennessee to the Magnolia
We gonna ball till we faulter

I wonder if I died and came back
Would god still let a nigga sit here and slang crack
Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat
There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that

I done been to hell and back, twice

You can't do it like me!

Now as the world turns, I let my bud burn
Police writin' down my tags, like I'm con'cerned
I graduated from the nickels and dimes
You need the F. E. D. 's bitch, to come get mine
Get on the grind hoe, and stay the fuck up outta mine fo'

I know, can't be humble in the jungle
Give a nigga an inch, he'll take a whole mile from ya'

They don't even read the paper work, just sign on the line

And I remain in the same fuckin project buldings,
I got guns everywhere bullet holes in the ceiling,

And it ain't with it seem
The streets ain't playin it fair
Listen up, ride with us, we can take you there
I ride cadillacs on custom hoods, caps and vogues
I ride black on black, back to back
Fresh from head to toe
Everywhere we go, more hoes, and plenty of dro
Everywhere we go, more shows, and plenty of dough

You're so crazy
You know that I'm your first lady
You're so crazy
You know that I'm your first lady
Boy you so crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Come here baby why don't you go turn them lights out
Tonight's the first night we gon' fuck in this White House
A glass of Don, the helicopter's on the lawn
I been testing nuclear bombs baby me and Kim Jon hey
How 'bout some sushi, catch a movie and do dinner later
Can't miss this meeting with Guiliani he did some favors
The reason why we in here fucking right now on this table
I couldn't win everybody's favor but he was able
Is that Obama's picture hanging on the wall
Go get security and tell them take it off
Let's change the sheets and sleep and hope we see tomorrow
Then go stand out in front these cameras let 'em see just who we are
Me and the first lady

[Chorus: Vyrgo and Young Buck]
You know I need you
You know that I'm never gon' leave you
Hey
(I'm fucking on the first lady)
No they don't believe you
But I know what you do is illegal
(She the first lady)
Well baby you know you heaven sent
I made you my president, it's evident
(I made her my first lady)
But baby what are we gonna do
Cause they don't want you no more but I still want you
I'm your first lady

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Let down your hair, put on your prom dress
I need you to look your best in front the congress
Put your hands around my neck and let your arms rest
We gon' dance tonight and wait 'til we get bomb threats
A couple meetings, I got briefings in the morning baby
Really don't know what I be speaking, they gon' think I'm crazy
Who's this Maxine, she keep talking 'bout this whistleblower
Maybe you should just go reach out and try to get to know her
Been trying to get some black votes so I been on tour
Taking pictures, eating chicken where the niggas are
Keep playing with me I will start a fucking Twitter war
What you think I put all these niggas in prison for

[Chorus: Vyrgo and Young Buck]
You know I need you
You know that I'm never gon' leave you
Hey

No they don't believe you

[Young Buck] I'm goin to war, I'm goin to war!

[Verse One: Young Buck]
You never know when death's comin, all you hear is gunshots
Lil' kids get to runnin, old ladies get off the block
When the poppin the truck music comes to a stop
Niggaz get on the floor with they front doors locked
Syringes and sirens the only thing on the street
People act like they don't know who did it, but they notice me
Every day's a death threat, but I ain't dead yet
So I go put a hole in a nigga from the next set
Don't know where I slept at, just know where my tec at
It's the first of the month, my bitch ain't got her check yet
Juvie left me in California, I don't respect that
I love him too much to beef, so I'ma accept that
But I'ma just step back, and focus on Buck
Tired of ridin in yours, I'm bout to buy my own truck
Got to try my own luck, ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'""
It's G-Unit 'til I'm gone, Lord knows I ain't lyin niggaz

[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2X]
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man

[Verse Two: Young Buck]
You don't know what I been through to get what I done got
If you looked through a scope, you couldn't hit what I done shot
Couldn't flip what I done copped, couldn't tip what I done topped
I murder you all-talk like a clip without a glock
When you holla G-Unit on some other shit
You need to do the research, and see who you fuckin wit
I smoke all your weed up, go run up your Beeza
Your baby momma want me, I don't want that skeeza
She's scratched my Beema, but I ain't seen-her
When I catch the bitch, I'ma gangsta lean-her - whoa
We be playin in them videos, with them pretty hoes
Cash bucks and the key bitches and New York City hoes
They learned it from Lil' Kim to let they titties show
I'm the King of the South, this is how it really goes
Lord knows, I keep all my jewels froze
As long as the check come, then fuck the award shows
You know me nigga

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: Young Buck]
Half of these kids never read the Bibles
But they can tell you how to kill a man better than I do
The reason they fucked up, they all been lied to
I know what it feels like when a nigga misguide you
My momma stay in the projects and I been havin money
I went bought her a house, but she told me she ain't want it
(What?) Right then I understood that the hood's in my blood
So I hollered cash real, lettin 'em know where I'm from
Niggaz know I got a gun when I come to the club
And if it go down, you better tell your people to duck
Why should I slow down, I just got started targettin artists
Wait 'til the bullets start hoppin out the cartridge
I come to get it poppin, pray to God the news watchin
So when they see 'em snitch niggaz'll know who got 'em
We came from the bottom to the top, from hoopties to a drop
And kill or be killed is the attitude I got nigga

[Chorus:]

[Young Buck]
I know you prayin I get killed nigga
He who fears death is in denial
50 told you niggaz, Young Buck showed you niggaz
Banks! Free yayo!
And tell the bitch ass niggaz put they vest on
I'm here now!"

50, don't call me, nigga, I don't wanna talk it out
The 40 cal'll hit your leg, go on and walk it out

I see it clear, you tryin' to sabotage Jimmy
See what happens when you talk after sippin' the Henny?
I'll send Haitian niggas at you, yeah, sak pase

Buck stabbin' niggas on camera and it's okay
'Cause my money make my lawyers make the shit go away

Cam, are you clear what you facin'?

You must ain't hear me, I done told you, I'm a boss
I'm eatin' good but I ain't chubby like Ricky Ross
Word on the street is that 50's not Jay
And Cam better stay out of his way

Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U., tryin' to hold on
Niggas in the waitin' room, been waitin' so long
Till they hear the flat line, the doc say, he's gone, he's gone
That's fucked up
When they say he's gone
He dead

Well, he knew that could happen, fuckin' with the kid
This is graveyard music right here, ya dig?
This is not competition, this is murder
Career endin', mind bendin', Southside, ya finished

Now look, niggas laughin' at Cam, down on Lennox
They heard what he did but they don't know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags
Come through with black mags
And have you niggas zipped up in black bags

For a second he was hot, now he cold
I apply pressure on niggas until they fold
But never mind me, man, that's just how I be
The game got me trained, they call me the hustle man

And like fame, my style will live forever
They thought I crossover 'cause they don't know no better
I think they think I'm laxed now 'cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back bustin', trust me, it's nothin'

Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U., tryin' to hold on
Niggas in the waitin' room, been waitin' so long
Till they hear the flat line, the doc say, he's gone, he's gone
When they say he's gone
It shouldn't have to be like this, man

Dipset, Cam, stay up, I'm not gonna destroy Dipset
Just gotta make changes, from now on, Jimmy's the boss of Dipset
And Juelz is the capo, he's gone
Cam's demoted to soldier, we like Jimmy better anyway

You niggaz got me fucked up, it's time to go to war
Nigga so what's up, I bust up, any muh'fucker feelin he rougher

Go inside his crib, find his kids 'til we find the shit
Go ahead and keep buyin shit, act like you run the town
On the worst day, your birthday, that's when I cut you down
Let me show you how, to make this money by the pound
Get a black dickie fit, can't forget the hundred rounds
Still a murder man, told myself I'd never hurt again
Niggaz out here hoes, so I'm kickin in they do's
And nobody knows when a nigga like me be comin
Nigga stop drop and roll when a nigga like me be gunnin
Wanna live to see tomorrow?  Better calm down your woman
And that shit in that plastic bag better be all hundreds
When my mask down, that mean I'm ready to blast now
Taught your ass a lesson, bet you'll learn how to act now

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

See I'm goin all out, like straight hoes to dykes
Switchin the game around like Reeboks from Nikes
Stayin in my black dickies, t-shirts all white
Thugged out, what it's all about, all right
Let's just shoot it out now, we can do it all night
It don't matter, the 50 caliber gon' bite
Watch 'em scatter, the loud sound got 'em all fright
Get the cheddar, then let them cowards hear the dual pipes
When we bite, we fight like pits on red meat
Is this life the shit nigga?  Yes it fuckin be
Freaks take a glimpse, they scream Buck's the shit
Now fiend for the dick, as I lean in the 6

[Chorus:]

Back in my 'llac the auto fo'-fo's and Optimos
Kickin in do's on the one stressin [?]

We kick up, that's what's up, cause I'm out, with the chrome
You fuck up, you get bucked, Buck'll getcha
Push a knife through your chest boy I ain't fuckin wit'cha

[Young Buck]
The Unit's my hood, my coke, my weed, my dope
My pills, my liquor, my family, my niggaz
We soldiers, we killers, they know us, they feel us
They know we Gorillas, you know who the realest

[50 Cent]
The Unit's my gang, my set, my mac, my tec
My protects, my family, do you, understand me?
My knife, my gun, my wife, my son
My love, my niggaz, my stacks, them figures

[Young Buck]
Buck shots, hit his ass from the shotgun blast
Black Dickie suit and a fuckin black ski mask
Shoot first, this is how I react and we act
Like it's nothin, Ca$hville niggaz used to that

Young Buck,I Ain't F******* Wit U!,/y/young+buck/i+aint+f+wit+u_20825934.html,"I tried to take you serious but you think I'm a fool
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you
'Cause if I ever caught you up, ain't no tellin' what I'd do
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you
Fuck y'all

He used to be a hustler, he ain't real no mo'
'Cause it's some shit in the hood we wanna kill you fo'
Loose lips sink ships, tattle-tellin' gets you killed fast
I hope you get knocked off wit' your snitchin' ass

Made a deal 'cause the jail had you scared
Can't do your time so you sold to the Feds
Nigga kill yourself, you a dead man walkin'
L. T. Got life and homie still ain't talkin'

So all of them niggaz puttin' wires on
Don't say nuttin' when your family get fired on
They say your man took the stand and he didn't think twice
They took his life and they didn't think twice

It's an eye for an eye, you rat you die
Ain't nobody 'posed to know when the pack arrive
See the judge is the pimp 'cause he made you snitch
Light you up and he didn't pay you shit, who the bitch?

I tried to take you serious but you think I'm a fool
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you
'Cause if I ever caught you up, ain't no tellin' what I'd do
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you

Trip, me and Cuz used to dress alike, wear the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, my nigga for life, so the gang goes
Nigga used to bang with me, smoke dope with me
Sold coke with me, went low with me, we gon' fold fifty

Oh so shifty, bitchy, bitchy switch the game up
Put me in the frame up, nigga came up

Sellin 'caine for us, tryin' to make a name for us
Sticky, it's tricky and quite dangerous, cuff and chain him up
Make him talk I bet he squeal, real shit I'm dishin' out
Why you niggaz be bitchin' now? I ain't make it up

I ain't break it up, Cuz you keep me on some bullshit
I ain't with that bullshit, my nigga I'm on this real shit
Stack a bill shit, crack a meal ticket
Every time I spills nig', yeah, I'm on this real shit
Now, don't you, come to the house Cuz, on the dub
'Cuz I put my gun in your mouth, now nigga bounce

I tried to take you serious but you think I'm a fool
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you
'Cause if I ever caught you up, ain't no tellin' what I'd do
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you

The life I'm livin' and how I do my thug thizzle
Separates me from all of them fuck niggaz
See, I don't deal with niggaz who ain't real
He in character, playin' some life that ain't his

He testify, wasn't wise and make deals
So stop talkin' on the phone, boy, the streets got ears
Here's some niggaz doin' 20 to 30 years
That'll lie on yo' ass and knock five off his

Affiliation with niggaz that's living ruggedly
Will get a nigga like me, charged with conspiracy
Before you know it, you been followed by the knuckleheads
And yo' job is to make his ass do his

Bein' in the wrong place, can really hurt your case
And ain't no sense to talkin' in codes, they already know
Them niggaz who you used to hustle with before
Kinda wanna play the role so they already told, you know

I tried to take you serious but you think I'm a fool
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you
'Cause if I ever caught you up, ain't no tellin' what I'd do
Ooh, I ain't fuck**** wit you

I ain't fuck**** wit you"

It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a hoe, bitch leave me now
I fuck when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike

Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma, I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy

Certain niggaz fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I fuck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin?, I'm in the club stuntin'
Ten grand buy the bar, Ma, it ain't nothing

If homegirl wit it, I'ma get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me every day, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby, check it
You look as good as a check

And when you're naked, I'm ready to fuck, a little head in the truck
If her tongue getting good, I'ma let her come up
And when the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down with the mack in the pound

I'm with G-Unit, see-unit
Nigga you're not ballin? on a G2 jet
Everything you wanna ever do you need D
O-P-E, on a fucking CD, it?s me

I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

She got a nigga on the countdown
Waitin? on it like, 3, 2, 1, yeah right now
You got skills in them high heels
When we leave this club, I'ma take you where I live

Do me before I get up
I might eat out tonight depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thang for me
She do whatever I say and I ain't gotta make it rain money

Go get it then she ghetto with it
Told shawty, don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me wherever she at, like yeah!

Yea bitch you niggas know what it is with me nigga

[Damn...]

[Verse]
[Young Buck]
Bulletwounds and tattooes is how I show my pain
I'm gone so much my little girl don't know my name
My palms covered in residue from cocaine
Been on the block since 6 in the morning
The neighbors complain about the traffic at my house (fuck Y'all)
When they need to borrow something they put their hands out
Little kids start running when they see my car coming
Just looking at me will make a nigga start hustlin
I aint a start nothing I just know how to count
Know how to eyeball an 8ball you wearin em out
Lips black from the blunt of that sour diesel and the desert eagle [I'm so illegal]
I can't even feed you what they put in the needles
Amsterdam got me thinking marijuana is legal
You can call me country but don't call me broke (Why)
We got all this money 50 where ya wanna go cmon nigga

[Chorus:]

Shit aint really all good but I love da hood
All I need is my weed I love da hood
We aint living like we should but I love da hood
But they still Tennekee yea I love da hood

All I need is my weed I love da hood
We aint living like we should but I love da hood
But they still Tennekee come and get it

They say can remember Whoo Kid let it ride
Fuckin wit G-Unit I let the Desert fly (gunshot)
Ridin thru Ca$hville wit Buck throwin my dubs up
For those who don't know that stand for west side
I blast on my enemies
Fuck you if you aint kinnin me
Knock your top off like Kennedy
Then sip hennesy
Ridin thru Tennessee
If you need coke Young Buck got the remedies
I got it for 9 5 if you wanna fly
Put em in a Range Rover if you wanna drive
If you only need 1 you aint gotta come
I just pack it up and strap it to a bitch' thigh
You ever seen a Impala drive
Seen hollows fly
Seen yellow tape everytime
Its a homoside
When it's drama I pull the glock from my waist
Niggas tried to make my mama cry

It's G-Unit nigga
You better recognize
I'll put you in the grave for that shit that Joe Budden Tried

I remember right there when my brother died
Then 2pac, Biggie Smalls and some other guys
So me and my homies ride
With a chrome. 45 in my lap and my waist an the double 9's
Niggas tried to kill me but it wasn't time
I took 5 shots from my own brother' 9
Went into a coma woke up in the hospital
Cops said they found drugs
I said it wasn't mine
Bad boy but I wouldn't shine
Matter fact wouldn't shit
Thought that cos I wouldn't sign
Now it's G Unit nigga read between the lines bitch

And keep one on me incase these niggas try and rob me
I'm sorry I'm not fifth in Corporate America
But your honor I still gutta tote a Berretta
I know a lot of niggas that wish they had one with them
When the money got dropped off the killers came to get them
Fuckin Pete got knocked off ain't nobody got a clue
So don't tell me I aint doing what I gutta do
You know who shot at who when nigga's tried and creep on us
Thought we was only talk and didn't have no heat on us
Watch these hoes man they fuck around and get you killed

Make sure the phene's still coming they know that I been touring
A ghetto nigga who still hang where he came from
Not one of these hollering gangsta when he ain't one
New York got a lot of rappers like to battle rap
I tell em' nigga I ain't with it homie grab a strap
My little brother like me he wanna sell dope
The Vice pulled him over he swallowed it down his throat
We all know the consequences when you fail to win
Half these niggas get out the pen the going again
What would you do if I told you it was a hit on you
Strap up? Or get rapped up? (ppplap) Back up!

I should've called 50, tell him I'm pulled ova (Nah!)
But he know I'm strap'd and he know I ain't soba
So lemme take a deep breathe, put my seatbelt on
When he walks to tha car, holla back - we gone
I gotta case pinned on me and I'm out on bars
So he gon' have his trynnah handcuff my arms
And he gon' have 20 niggas trynnah do him wrong
When only he had to do is sit back and be gon'
Fuck tha D.E.A. and tha Feds

Young Buck,If I Die Tonight,/y/young+buck/if+i+die+tonight_21028710.html,"[Chorus - Lyfe Jennings] X2
Oh, if a nigga die tonight
Make sure I didn't die in vain, and they feel my pain
Make sure my niggas ride for me
But don't end up on the side of me, side of me

[Verse 1 - Bun B]Man I'm a real trill nigga, I been out on them blocks
With them hustlers, them dealers, and killers selling rocks
Put in work in round the clock from when the sun went down
Till it came back up, and night came back around
I did a lot of shit them late nights for the dough
Robbing niggas on the low, laugh at them then I go
Sometimes it went smooth and nobody got hurt
And sometimes I had to leave a nigga's dick up in the dirt
I ain't proud of what I did, and if I could go back in time
I'd try to find another way instead of packing. 9's
Toting K's and holding mac's
But we know time ain't rolling back
And hungry hyenas, they ain't folding jack
So on these cold and black streets, wolves keep hunting
And a young black man can lose his life over nothing
If I got to go, please let it be for something real
Because this bullshit, hood shit
Is getting niggas killed, on the real

[Chorus:]
[Verse 2 - Bun B]Well if a deal goes dirty or the counts don't match
Or if I catch a motherfucker dipping in the back
Say if a nigga disrespect me or my fam'
And we take it to the streets and let the guns go blam
I don't really give a damn, or really know whatever's going to come

And I'ma represent where I'm from
Man I don't want to die, but I ain't scared to
Shit I just want to make sure that I'm prepared to
Can't leave without a couple chickens in the stash
So my wife, and my momma, and my children got cash
Because once I'm gone, who going take care of my kids?
And do the same things for them that I did
Man I'd rather do a bid
At the least they can see me behind the glass
Instead I'm reminiscing about the past
Nigga don't know what he got, until he passes on
So let him tell them that he love them before his ass is gone

[Chorus:]
[Verse 3 - Young Buck]We trapping hard right across from the graveyard
I just pray to God I don't have to work a day job
Niggas getting robbed so I'm riding with my ar
They are, not finna take what I done paid for
Walking through the bricks on my Jena Six shit
Like if you ain't from around here, you was getting hit
Send a O. G. Some flicks, make they time go by quick
You surprised what some pictures in the penitentiary did
We survived, but most of us die for some bullshit
Go to church but the devil standing on the pulpit
Niggas lie just to kick it, swear to God they got a meal ticket
Then they call you when they about to get evicted
A Underground King, I been one ever since I was sixteen
Pimp and Bun'll tell you just what Buck mean
A street nigga living the street dream, I seen
My whole team go to the feds, or get a hole in the head
This what I said

The Bubble Kush got me I can't get enough of it
I'm thuggin' in public
Bustin' like fuck it
They say i'm the reason my neighborhoods corrupted
Because I came from nothin'
Wouldn't change for nothin'
Started swingin' my chopper nigga just aim for somethin'
I need a cup of Grey Goose
Cause the renegade's loose
Leave your brains in your coupe
When the twenty gauge shoot
Tell the truth
That nigga 50 know what he got
The rap game ain't seen nothin' like this since Pac
I'm just breakin' down birds 'till my album drop
Back and forth to the A where I set up shop
Cruisin' down the street it must be around two o'clock
They done pulled me over and just found two Glocks
But i'm straight you know we got a license for that
So give me my ticket and hand my strap right back

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I'm okay in the A
I'm a stay in the A
Got the Yay in the A
So i'm good anyway
But I live in the 'Ville

God damn it
I don't understand it
If I was you I wouldn't take life for granted
Got to grind
I started from the back of the line
And waited my turn so now its my time
With a pistol grip pump yeah its all mine
Give your boy two months get rich or die tryin'
If I die tonight
Just get high as a kite
Tell my mama and my little girl i'm all right
Buck The World!!!!!
Throw the clip up
I'm 'gon hit up
Nigga git up
If you with us
Cause they know I know they want to kill us
Dope dealers
Cop killers
Sac stealers
Black Gorillas
The more Macs they give us
They got to deal with us
I'm a soldier
Never made it past the eight grade
But I could make half a million in eight days
So when I holla: ""Hey""
Do it the same way
It ain't about where your from its about how you stay

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I'm okay in the A
I'm a stay in the A
Got the Yay in the A

Welcome to da life of a young thug nigga
Only hang out wit dem criminals and dem drug dealers
I'm from even where da dead die
But try an do it big like da kid from bed stuy

I see death around da corna and I ain't scared
I got a [Incomprehensible] wit 15 and I'm fully prepared, that's right
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip

Shoot first and ask question lata
Da answer is it was all about da paper
And everything da game is shit to lose
And a new forty-five that I'm dyin' to use

Say if ya real like me
Throw ya hoods in da air so da whole wide world can see
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
Last of a dying breed

If ya real like me
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just da way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
Last of a dying breed

I done seen niggaz come and go
Shit da whole world done seen what I done before
We do anythang when da funds is low
I'm da reason outta town as don't come no mo

Let me show you niggaz how to break down da whole thang
My nigga B. G. Know Buck been a [Incomprehensible] man
It's got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't makin' enough I ma jack my plug

We was born in it not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit it
Make my mark so da streets gon' rememba me
Now come and git it nigga Cashville Tennekee holla back

Say if ya real like me
Throw ya hoods in da air so da whole wide world can see
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
Last of a dying breed

And if ya real like me
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just da way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
Last of a dying breed

Some of da dudes we thought was real O. G's was O. D's
'Cause they talk pleas and includin' G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period they convince da grand jury to allow a phone tap

And if they listen in
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in

I'm straightly gettin' betta yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin' all cars, it's your brother-in-laws
And tell 'em hurry up and come dem niggaz got gunz
Man down shots fired only fuck niggaz and cops died

First stage of a ride and dem fuck couldn't sneak by
When you on a witnessin' and shit five bitch be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And then da witness that they had to [Incomprehensible]
Was lyin' there dead

Shot in da street all red wit two shots to his head
'Cause he was workin' for da feds
And they last informant informed us they had it out for us
For a bird but he got popped for it

So ride or die for 'em, betta yet you betta kill 'em
'Cause I think he gon get da bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done all ready told
But then again with out a witness dem bitches ain't got shit, say

If ya real like me
Throw ya hoods in da air so da whole wide world can see
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
Last of a dying breed

If ya real like me
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just da way that it's gotta be

Let us pray(PRAY!) cause I'm about to do it again

I done been to Rome, you know the home of the Pope,
But right around the corner a nigga sold me some dope,
I been thinkin too late to holla just say no,
If you broke when the bus leave, you can't go,
If theres light at the end of the road then I'm comin,
I don't need no bitch my daughter is my woman,
Cause ain't no click like the one I got,
It ain't no clique out there this hot,
You get shot the fuck up, Pop the fuck up,This is not the work of a fat joe bussa,
I'm far from but close to the pen,
The judge say he never wanna see me again,
And Johnny Cochran dead, so what a nigga gon do?
Yea that's what I thought, whatever he have to,
Bow your head, and listen to the words I said,
I'm still here and ya'll thought I supposed to be dead

[Chorus:]
Let us pray(PRAY!) for the niggas I shot this year,
Let us pray(PRAY!) for the dead, the one's thats not here,
Let us pray(PRAY!) forgive me for I have sinned,
Let us pray(PRAY!) cause I'm about to do it again
Let us pray(PRAY!) for the niggas I shot this year,
Let us pray(PRAY!) for the dead, the one's thats not here,
Let us pray(PRAY!) forgive me for I have sinned,
Let us pray(PRAY!) cause I'm about to do it again"

You know, growin up in the hood,
Is gon' do all kinds of thangs, ya heard?
Some of it's good, some of it's bad,
But the things you go through in life, make you who you are
Look at me now!

[Mr. Porter]
From the day I was born, I've been hustle'n strong
Been strugglin' since a child, now them day's is gone
And you say'd I wouldn't do it, but I'm proving you wrong
N they got they hands out like I owe them so
I ain't got time for the bickering, and carrying on
It aint too much into who I don't know
How many times do I have to sit in and grown
I'm a young buck, but still enough to know when you niggas is hoe

[Young Buck]
I still remember them nights under the street lights
Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price
I'm trying to get right, get it and go
You see people is dyin' fast, and the money is slow
We used to hang in front of the store
Flag down cars to be a movie star, go get a glass jar
Once you cook it and cut it homie, go stand out in public
See the work sell's itself, if ya got enough of it
Plenty thugs get shot, but see it's all in the game
Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain
I aint dippin from that same lead project figga
I done went with no lights, and no water nigga
And I'm still hood, that mean I still cook
Get on the block and go get mine, like you should
How can I be good? When rappers wanna be suge
Suroundin' myself with family, so I can sleep good

[Mr. Porter]
From the day I was born, I've been hustle'n strong

I would light me a cancer stick, thinkin how can I get
My momma out the bricks, and my whole click legit
Lil jimmy in the fed's, it's just me and some ted's
We cuttin heads doin whatever to buy a lump of bread
The hot beat faces, I really loved it
To blow 50 g's, and don't think nothing of it
We show love, but won't get no loved show'd back
Whoa kimosabi, what part of the game is that?
This a fact, and my war wounds on me can prove it
But look how you made me, go and show ya I can do it
I sollomly swear to hold it down for my homeboy
Locked up and don't know if they ev'a coming home boy
Time's keep tickin', another baby is born
That's gon' go through the same stuff I went through, and more
You wonder why I hustle, my life's on the line
My baby gotta have milk when she cryin', come on da now

Now everybody got they hand out
Crackhead willin' spit these millions till they ran'd out
Shorty don't wanna holla now, cuz her man out
But just last week I couldn't get it out her damn mouth
No where to go, look like I'm stuck in these bricks
Seems like the good die young, the bad get rich quick
Enough of this lemme take you to a whole nother level
It's like stopin the police from rollin' through the ghetto
Ain't nuthing gettin better, but the bills gotta get paid
That money come up short then them tecks gotta get spray'd
Everybody gotta grave, we just waitin to go to it
No matter what we do, we still gon' go through it
Some say that I'm heartless, and don't give a damn
They wont ever understand until they get a gram
This who I am, not who I wanna be
Open up your eyes and see, what these streets have done to me

The game been good to me
I'm still runnin 'round where I use to be
The projects, where we move the Ki's
Tryna tear down the bricks, we refuse to leave
See regardless, ima do my thang
I don't care what set you claim, I just met you man
Be happy that I let you slang
Cuz if I let Tec know he gonn' bust yo brain
And if all yall niggas out here wanna hit it
Holla G-Unit South, let me know you with it
Shit bout to get crazy in a minute
That's why my bitch purse got A. 380 in it
Ima give niggas one more chance
We cool but I ain'tshakin no hands
Next time you wont hear bout whatever gonn' happen
My album went platinum I found out

[Chorus:]
Niggas change on you, so hard to keep friends
Seem like I can't find nobody, but I aint got no ends
Niggas change on you, that's why we bet these hoes
Soon as a nigga gotta let up somethin, it's when they let me know
A brother done changed on you

[Verse]
I'm all by myself in this Benz
Glock gotta extend clip on the end
Priest bout to come home from the pen
Ima make sure he never touch a bird again
Muthafuckas act like I don't deserve to win
Niggas claim they Kin but I aint heard of them
Like I aint hit the block and put work in
Like I aint still gettin them pounds of purp in
Say what you want but my bills is paid
I'm not tryna be 35 still on stage
Shit was all good but he turned his back
Them niggas stayed with him didn't learn from that
The tables turned, I went and got me a pack
So I could give a damn what you say on ""smack""
You know what it is and you know where I'm at
For real don't make me snap cuz

[Chorus:]
Niggas change on you, so hard to keep friends
Seem like I can't find nobody, but I aint got no ends
Niggas change on you, that's why I bet these hoes
Soon as a nigga gotta let up somethin, it's when they let me know

If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em

I never liked these niggaz anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a buildin? today
Hey, nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder
I ain't smilin? I ain't smirkin?, I ain't muh'fuckin? jokin?
See if you think somethin? sweet when your head open

Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck
I be out front your raggedy ass crib on a stake out
With a pound, two clips and Chinese take-out

You make it rain, I make it lead shower
You say your prayers, you in your last hour
I have you pushin? up daisies, the coke dump crazy
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me
You don't like me then spray me

I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?

No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

This is that face down on the floor, ski mask shit
If I fall off I rebound quick
Like Greg Odin, Tony Yay' I be holdin?
German mouths on my hip ?cause my wrist be frozen

How these rappers claim blood and the books is closed?
How these rappers claim cars and they gun don't smoke?
I catch a nigga on his deathbed
And rip the IV out his arm then jump in the Optimus Prime

Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on
In my bulletproof Ac', who you stylin? on
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out
You coward ass niggaz bring your jewelry out

I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?

If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em

I never liked these niggaz anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a buildin? today
Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

You may have to bring that, ain't nobody trippin?
Shit, niggaz is hungry, I ain't nobody chicken
I think a screw is missin?, I'm pimpin?, I'm livin?
Nice with the dice, deuce-deuce six'n

Look how the game change, bad for the system
Niggaz on game shows, two dudes kissin?
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame
The industry's punked out, we're not to blame

These niggaz been perpetratin? so long
If they can make it rain, I can make it storm
He's makin? a scene but I can make him calm
I just got a N.B. that'll break a arm

I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin?
Strap like it's legal, ridin? around bumpin?

It's guaranteed that them shooters gon' be comin' through
I move the mid, touch the ye, you know what's up with me
I do it big, that's the only way I know to do
Pac gone, now you mothafuckas stuck with me
I run with niggas only wear it if the fit is blue
Right before I go to sleep I load up the clip
Pray to God that I wake up cause I got dope to flip
Tinted windows on my cars, you know I roll up a zip
Niggas scared to go and get it but I take them road trips

I got work, I got enough that I can feed him too
All these bad bitches, nigga she ain't leavin' me
These hoes know the difference between me and you
I just cut the grass so I can see all of the snakes
Got 'em out the way and made 'em send me all the weight
Anybody ever doubted me, know that was a mistake
They tell me that they love me but now I know it's fake
I never let 'em lie to me again to my face
I never call these rap niggas friends cause they ain't
I used to let these niggas get a pass, now I can't
""This nigga lost his mind"" is what you think

Will I survive in the city where they let the birds fly?
If they bury me, bury me where the key nigga
Tennessee nigga
Passin' the rock like the flea flicker
You all know me nigga
Got the wrist of a chemist
Won't leave the block until my whole pack finished
Niggas mad cause I won't give 'em shit for free
So listen little man you ain't get shit from me
You get out what you out in and hold what you make
Sell all the weight
But give away the shake
Theres some rules to this shit that we live by
Never snitch or your whole family will die
Got throwback money been doin' this for years
Its hard but it is what it is
Tell me if I'm wrong for tryin' to feed my baby
I done took a loss so you niggas better pay me
I'm goin' crazy

Slingin' ever since I was an itty bitty kiddy
Way before I met Fifty
I was gettin' it.. Fuckin' with them digital scales
Never fucked with ya'll cause I knew niggas would tell
They say I'm different from the average little young nigga
This is just too much for one nigga
Let 'em say my name
I'm a keep doin' my thing
I put some candy on the Range
And bought another chain
Keep a bag full of rubberbands, money machines
Got to throw it in the washer to make sure its clean
See my P. O. Good so she let me smoke
Why violate me?, if I'm gone you broke
You ain't seen nothin' like this ever before
Pac told ya ""You take one, you make mo'""
The whole world thuggin' in they own way
I'm just wonderin' what the Lord 'gon say

I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure your ready
And prepare for war

[Bridge-Young Buck 2x]
Get your camolauge suits, and your combat boots
We aint going to iraq, we just pullin up and shootin
Your life is what I want dawg, you can keep the loot
This is how the G's do, salute (salute)

[Verse]
Put the potatoe on the end of the round
Make the sound quiet down
The block don't eat if a nigga not around
Like a sniper, i keep my chopper low to the ground
Milatary minded, and im South Side now
Got my canteen filled up with henessy nigga
A bullet broof vest, and my tank on spinners
Attention!!, you about to enter a war zone
Why you come around here homie you know it's on

[Chorus]
I got oozis, and AK's of plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Everynight i make sure that im ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure your ready
And prepare for war"

Why?
These Niggas Want Me Dead (Betta' Watch Yo Step)
Puttin' Prices On My Head (Cuz I Cock My Shit, And I Pop My Shit)
But I Ain't Gonna Change (I Don't Play That Shit)
G-Unit Do Ya' Thang

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
Some say I'm crazy for signin with 50 Cent
Them same niggas wouldn't offer to give me shit
Niggas hate you when you rich, but love when you broke
I never knew I had so many enemies before
My arm's is open to anybody who want beef
I promise ya'll I won't sleep, till ya'll layin 6 Ft
G-Unit that's what it is, that's what it's gon' be
Benzino or the Source can't hold me
I been heavensent to put a End to this nonsence
The handle of this 4-5'll make him unconscious
Most of these rappers, throw bricks, and hide they head
Come to our shows, then hide behind they man, they homie
I understand I'm a target, I'm on top
But understand if you start it, I'm gon' pop
I'm not and artist, buck is a street pharmast
One of the smartest, that gon' get money regardless

[Hook 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
My eyes low, hydro' leakin' out that Tahoe
I know, G-Unit's them niggas I'm a ride fo'
Nah ho, I ain't stuntin', nothin' that these niggas say
Fuck the rap, I can get ya' monkey ass hit today
Ain't nobody picked me up when I was pinned down
I'm double-checkin 'for I leave outta my crib now
Holdin' that 40 on me, sunk in the seat
Cause niggas feel comfortable when they get hit drunk with the heat
I'm ridin' round here dirty, cause they gunnin' for my top
I ain't duckin and dodgin, I'm only runnin from the cops
Spendin grand after grand, bought a hundred on my watch
Just got another buddy, and it holds a 100 shots
I never had a role model, cause he was in a box
So I'm up in the club with either a heater or an ox
Everyday there's another nigga bleedin on the block
But we ridin' with them burners on, even when it's hot

[Hook 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
You see these niggas get out the pen, and think it's good
Go get a pack, and come right back, to the same hood
They think these young niggas gonna post up, and let 'em get it
Ain't been home but 6 months, and got his wig splitted
Comitted to the block, guck these niggas, fuck the cops
Fuck these bitches, fuck ya' chain, fuck ya' car, fuck ya' watch
Ride and I die for mine, pop's, and I hide the nine
Swerving over these white lines, wonderin from the one time
Thug and I know I am, bird from a half a gram
Broke, so I sold dope, and I'd do it again
Don't blame that nigga for runnin up in my house, fool
Ain't no food in my daughter mouth, I'm goin out too
Just think about what your doin, cuz buddy, bullets burn
May god bless his ass, that was that nigga's turn
I'm not concerned with your death threats
You come down here with that shit, and get left wet
Muthafucka

In New York, Tha Projects is where we feel safe
Surrounded by the others like us, we embrace
All the bullshit, git you niggas a void
This is our life, we ain't got no choice
We enjoy ourselves in the middle of hell
Shots poppin', niggas mite run up on you wit' and tell
Blow you away, you'll die witcha gun on ya waist

Baby ain't nuthin', you know I'm spittin' that crack shit
Like I'm still on the block, picture police flippin'
Like I'm still in the kitchen cookin', workin' that Trip Beam
Have fiends baggin', watch dem lick the plate clean

Only the hard hitters get foriegn cars and all the ice

You lookin' right
But my money still I gotta count
It ain't no love lost
Baby girl my love cost
Let me get that out ya
You know this nigga love to floss
Both of us can ball bitch

Fucked around and be done lost this
Bitches gettin' tossed this
Yourself as my main ho
Pussy slangin' bed pro
You ain't got no money
Nigga what the fuck you ask for head fo'
Why, because I said so
Don't make me let that lead go
Better head yo ass back up in them hills
Like fuckin' Jethro
We down in the field posted up
Pourin' Cristal toasted up
If niggas got figures
Take 'em to the telly bitch you posed to fuck
Take it off bitch
Now look at me workin' wood wheel
Sit back and see how the benefits of twerkin' could feel
But being first born we curse worst than yo past
That ho fast ass cuz it's purse first and ass last

Purse first, that's the slogan when you rollin' with me

So you lucky to get some love
What it is and what it was

Light up trees like it was Christmas

Keep them girls for the money
Show you the baller preview
Keep yo eyes open
Broads read niggas like they see through
Throw 'em a couple g's
They wanna be with you
The way I play my cards
Show 'em the ice like I'm a superstar
See where they comin' at
And keep 'em away from that
Platinum coated diamonds
Show the pump where I'm livin' at
Now is you with it
You ain't a playa you nigga
You a nigga with money tryin' to fake friend ya picture
Now how you gon' play the bower a tia for that money richer
And when you call ya broad that bitch don't even come up with ya
All up in another nigga's crib but she done fuckin' with ya

Switch 'em up and dish 'em up

Police in the streets like ""Nah fuck it""
Its me against the government, they don't know how to take me
They done seen that tape and they think I'm crazy
Shuttin' down my birthday bash
Well Officer Calvin Hulay you can kiss my ass
Crap in the trap too
You on that racist shit and I'm a black dude
Even took my license and said its suspended
But come to find out that that bitch pretended (Unhh!)
I dropped a certified platinum album in the 'Ville
So somebody please tell that coward who I is
Bitch!!

[Young Buck:]
It's like,
I'm the 1st one, but I ain't the only one
To holla Cashville motherfuckers..

Young Buck,Ride,/y/young+buck/ride_20531642.html,"It is what it is, Lets ride nigga, Yea!!
What you niggas know about, slippin they clips in ak's
I'm talkin bout hittin niggas blocks

[Verse:]
I'm wipin down my bullets with my bandana hidden behind tips
The beef bout to be handled nigga gimme bout 5 minutes
I'm prayin aint no kids out playin today
Cuz I aint tryna see no babies gettin hit with a stray
So if ya enemy is hidin home then turn off ya lights
Then throw this bitch in bar, we gettin out tonight
I wanna look him in his eyes before he die
Some niggas get away when the shells start to fly
We gonn' make sure anybody out there breathin gonn' be bleedin
Everybody out there leakin then we leavin
We get away, car parked in a dark alley
Just cut up thru the yard, hop a fence then we at it
We off to the next block, catch me if you can
Gunpowder on my shirt and some blood on my hands
Never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin me a man
This here for 50's enemies to make em understand that

[Chorus:]
Even tho we killed one and we aint done yet
We ridin on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set
Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do
This just a lil somethin you can let off ya glock to
Even tho we killed one and we aint done yet
We ridin on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set
Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do
This just a lil somethin you can let off ya chopper to

[Verse 2:]
Clip in the Smith & Wesson
And I done been shot but I aint learn my lesson
I bought me some band-aids and hand grenades
And I'd pull the pin and throw it where ya family stay
This the hood muthafucka not Sandro Pay
You hear the police sirens all god damn day
We huntin for our prey, if we see em we eat em
And fuck the D. A., they aint takin my freedom
So when you make this turn, ima let off this thang
Retaliating on them bitches like Hugh did Kane
Insane, I'm the black John Wayne
With a chrome for-Fo, put a hole in ya frame
Detectives found em with his watch and his chain
And some money in his pocket, a bullet in his brain
Never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin me a man
This here for Yayo enemies to make em understand what I'm sayin is

[Chorus ]
Even tho we killed one and we aint done yet
We ridin on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set
Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do
This just a lil somethin you let ya for-five off to
Even tho we killed one and we aint done yet
We ridin on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set
Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do
This just a lil somethin you let ya 12-gauge off to

[Verse 3:]
I'd be lyin if I say I wasn't nervous the first time
But thinkin how they shot my cousin, I just bust mine
Hard people glance, glock under my waist
This big fat ass officer aint gonn' win this chase
I'm paranoid but I got away clean
And I don't be havin all them nightmare dreams
They say I have no conscience, my heart just cold
Cuz I don't try to squash it, ya boy just roll
We hold niggas hostage, ya kid now hosed
The news to this game man we play how it goes
The feds know my name so I stay on the low
Every murder that go down they knockin at my door
Gotta know what you doin and how to shuffle it out
And once the homie go do it he gotta muzzle his mouth
I never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin me a man
This here for Banks enemies to make em understand what I'm sayin is

[Chorus ]
Even tho we killed one and we aint done yet
We ridin on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set
Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do
This just a lil somethin you let ya Tec 9 off to
Even tho we killed one and we aint done yet
We ridin on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set
Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do
This just a lil somethin you let ya. 40 Cal off to"

Heyyyy! I gotta slow down
I said we gotta slow down

Let me take you back to high school, ninety-fo'
When at least when a nigga had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, sellin rocks on the way
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of yay
Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ass
But she was too fast, and I was too slow
Cause she wanted a nigga who already had dough
She found her a man who was like twenty-fo'
But what she didn't know that he had plenty hoes
She was too young; so now he got a new one
Cause shorty went and bought her a new gun
See when she catch this nigga she gon' do somethin
Not fight, but shorty gon' shoot somethin
But she never got a chance, a change of plans
Shot herself in the back puttin the gun in her pants

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Live life young nigga, quit tryin to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
So slow your roll - slow it down my nigga
Slow your roll - slow down my nigga
Live life lil' mama, quit tryin to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
So slow your roll - c'mon gotta slow down
Slow your roll - think you gotta slow down

I got a graveyard tatted on my arm
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn
My momma only brother, he served in the Navy
He lost his life because the war made him crazy
My nephew Shannen, 15 years old
When I think how he died I get real cold
Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones
I was just home, with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket I need two of them s***s
It don't quit, just when you think I'm seein better days
My auntie just find that she got aids
And it's fucked up, cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dyin in the pen', damn

Got a gang of loved ones in the penile
Fighting for lives everyday but meanwhile
I see my life is sort of like theres
Cause other than moms and Boo-Boo nobody else cares
I know you think I'm tweekin'
But the only time I get to see my kids is on the visiting weekend
I ain't in no chains
But sometimes I get tested by the places I hang
And my game just banged on these niggas from the other side
Now I got reprecussions
Suckas is bustin'
Talk is cheap
And for some apparent reason the streets keep watchin' me
Well watch me
And watch ya back
Pop pop I got ya that

Bullet wounds and tattoos 'll show you my pain
Maybe I am insane
I kind of feel that way
A nigga rich thinkin' about who I'm goin' to kill today
I went from the projects
All the way to private jets
I'm just gettin' my feet wet
I ain't even eat yet
I seperated myself from all of the hate
Told Jimmy Iovine ""This is all I'm a take""
I'm playin' Chess not Checkers and I ain't made a move yet
When these rappers disrespect they playin' Russian Roulette
Now who you with?, cause its a matter of time
You got to watch your step you might cross that line
Its goin' down, I swear I got something for all of ya'll

Fuck around homie get your head knocked off
Tryin' to prove to your baby mama that your not soft
I ain't seen it all but I done seen enough
See when you live in the ghetto you dream too much
And when you make it out the ghetto you stay in touch
Never forget where you come from that's rule number one
But can't live life twice all you got is one chance
I can't live for you shit I'm only one man
Bloody murder, somebody 'gon die tonight
I'm gettin' high as a kite
Fuck if I'm wrong or right
I hear 'em callin' tellin' me don't let these niggas do it
Trigger fingers in the air let me hear G Unit

Get the bag, open the door up nigga then eject him
I'm from the city where they pop you first then holler check him
This what happen when you feed your dogs and then neglect them
Pussy niggas getting money, real niggas detect them
We just give them some bills and come through and collect them
Don't do nothing around these elders I'm talking respect them
Thank you for not calling the police, she said you welcome
Catch the bomb anywhere my hands like O'Dell Beckham

Fill it with cocaine so nobody won't starve

We gotta make decisions
We all black in here
Somebody's gonna be a victim
All this Gucci that's what made niggas fit the description
And then we put our hands up, that's the signal to kill a bitch
Just gave my partner life and he just keep on asking
If I can tell him how to go and get in touch with Kim Kardashian
I tell him keep on praying, he be listening then start laughing
Then he say well ok, go and tell that shit to Kanye
Young niggas trapping now right there where my aunt stay
And I can't tell 'em stop when ain't nothing on the entree
Took my last three thousand like Andre
And put her on the plane told her to act like Beyonce

Puff puff pass nigga roll that blunt

Coughin and chockin constantly
Taste like soup when you hit it, gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day

Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

when I want nothin less then the best of the trees

This Phantom cost a quarter mill I could do without 'em
I think I'm about to pop a pill get on that Patrone

These hos love a nigga so they playin' on my phone
She said I didn't speak when I seen her I did her wrong
I told her I was high the Kush had me in the zone
But call me when you home
And ain't got no clothes on
Mink on the floor, and Chinchilla on the seats
Theres wood on the door and theres room for a freak
See my clique kind of small cause I never did forget

Drink in my cup, heat tucked on my waistline

Diamonds lookin' like Michael Jackson's glitter glove

Is this president ah, attempting to change the narrative
Using what I would consider to be real caustic terms
In order to change the conversation
To impede the constitutional process
To circumvent [?] is far beneath the office of the President of the United States

[Verse 1]
Past the preacher I'm in the second row
Trying to get the word, they focused on this fashion show
My partner just got sentenced and tonight he had to go
Millionaire never been locked up in his life before
It's yellow tape around the corner store
Don't ever underestimate a nigga when his money low
It's dark outside, she gon' show up when it's sunny though
I had to realize that these hoes really come and go
Balenciaga ain't gonna solve none of my problems
I'm buying pounds before I buy some red bottoms
Bounty hunters kicked my door in they just handcuffed up my momma
Only thing can help me now is I get comma after comma
I put everybody else before myself
Imma step
I hit everybody here that I could help
Been left
First it was one set of footprints in the sand
God don't walk with me he carry me man

You debating on what a nigga got, get it too
What you waiting on, what's taking so long
What it do
When you loved by many and hated by the few
When you up here it's a very nice view

[Verse 2]
Tell me something that's gonna help me with this light bill
Motivate me nigga if you don't nigga then I will
Give me something I can probably feel like I feel
And pour me up something I can drink and change where I live
It's a body on the train tracks
Never seen a dead body so we came back
You ever seen a dead body with his brain splat
C'mon I'll show you it's over here where we hang at
School shootings this is not a fire drill
My lil nephew said if you can buy it he behind the wheel
Watch the money start a riot got lil shorty ready to kill
Do a thousand out fives and they cut her out the deal
In this hole in the wall, bullet holes in the wall
Taking shots with a booster she be fucking up the mall
Hold the block with the shooters we be busting at the law
Trying to get an Audemar, trying to do it with the raw

Campaigning in the couple like whoop
Keep a bad bitch with me everytime I come through

Hey

Ok let's say if I wasn't a fool and I let you get away

Hennessey and weed with the shots of Patrone
I'll have a nigga's dick hard all night long
The rain can't stop me I'm sittin' on chrome
The police watch me to catch me in the wrong
My hood got love for me and when its on
If a nigga get a word bet a nigga gettin' gone
You niggas livin' dead when you workin' for the Feds
You get a little bread then get popped in the head
A white t-shirt with your face on the front
Nobody at the church ever respect what you done
So i'm a give 'em hell
'Till they open up the cells
For the young black males
Twenty five in hell
I'm out on bail and I ain't goin' back
Just hope that my parole officer's knowin' that

[Chorus: Vocal Sample]
Livin' a little harder
What do I do with my life?
Livin' a little harder
What do I do with my life?
This ain't livin'
Nah nah baby this ain't livin'
Ah nah nah

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
The ghettos full of rules that you got to live by
The metal I use is a Glock .45
My best friend died and I didn't even cry
Been tryin' to find who killed him to set him on fire
The project buildings is gettin' torn down
They got us in one place so its a war now
Pay what you weigh don't nobody give credit no more
You don't know what to do with it what you sellin' it for?
Seen fake niggas live and some real niggas go
So I really will kill and i'm hard on a ho
Shootin' at my enemies killin' 'em all
I will not sleep I got to find who killed my dog
Lil Jimmy locked up so until he come home
Got a wall full of platinum, pocket full of stones
I'm out here on my own
Holdin' it down
And i'm not goin' back my P.O. know now
Come on

[Chorus: Vocal Sample]
Livin' a little harder
What do I do with my life?
Livin' a little harder
What do I do with my life?
This ain't livin'
This ain't livin'
Nah nah baby this ain't livin'
Ah nah nah
This ain't livin'
This ain't livin'
Nah nah baby this ain't livin'
Ah nah nah

{*glass shatters, man yells*}
You've just been cracked, another Smoov Jizzell production
Buck and Bun B y'all niggaz can't see this nigga
Ca$hville to Texas

[Bun B]
We snatchin niggaz out they Movada and bitches outta they Prada
Get a shot of this Don Dada, keep it hot as Nevada
Spot a hater with a lot of plex, make you come to terms with yo'self
No matter how you flex, even with a lot of checks
It's small change, don't bitch when we step up in y'all range
These broke niggaz gon' find a way, we tend to ball strange
I'm the king of the block, steady bringin the rock
So potent I promise these fiends feel the sting in they socks
But see the sun gon' come out tomorrow so when you try to ease away
with these cheese today, that you 'bout to borrow
with or without the sorrow, me and Buck is down to blast
Still smash real fast kill niggaz from Texas to Ca$hville
It's suicide, bustin as me is like
bustin at you in that, situation who would ride?
You if you stupid thug, so if you get shot dead
I hope that it's a Cupid slug, that show my crew some love

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Now when the thug's in the club and he come to spend some dubs
Show that nigga some love, show that nigga some love
And for the ones in the back, who be smokin the bud
Show them boys some love, show them boys some love

[Young Buck]
Don't be scared to get your mind blown, nigga where you from
If you ain't got nuttin to take home, you need to get you one
Ain't nobody got no job party 'til you see the sun
When the music stop, lights on, then you know it's done
We gon' finish blowin one, 'fore we hit the exit
Like whenever I'm with Bun, puttin it down in Texas
When there's thugs in the club, ain't nobody restless
Niggaz smashin they dubs, showin off they necklace
Test this, if you want to, it's somethin you wouldn't wan' do
Nigga's bitches chosin niggaz now we got attitude
Doin what I have to do whenever it jump off
See my niggaz they will catch you and show you who's boss
Throw a blow, and get tossed, shit it ain't my fault
Niggaz tried to teach lessons ended up gettin taught
Ca$hville to New York, ain't nuttin but real thugs
So, when you see Buck and Bun B, show us love

[Chorus]

[Smoov Jizzell]
I'm thankin Bun already told ya we ain't nuttin but some killers
We come with banana clips, we ain't monkeys we gorillas
We chasin the scrilla, I hope you get the picture
Bun B done do for the dirty and I'm the mayor of the muddy
Shit gon' get bloody and ugly if one of you bitches touch me
And pop loud, we ain't in Moscow, bitch why you rushin/Russian?
You a hoe-ass nigga and that's the end of the discussion
All that cussin and loud bluffing gon' make me get to bustin
On my waistline tuckin somethin to quiet all your yuppin
I'm a big dog y'all puffin one more peep and I'm muffin
When y'all niggaz gon' realize we some young'ns that's thuggin
Waitin for bustin just some animals not givin a fuck'n
We them niggaz that's clubbin, fightin security jumpin line in V.I.P.
while y'all bitch niggaz standin there doin nuttin
All my real niggaz throw up your sets and let 'em know
When you're thuggin in the club that's how it go - Ca$hville!

Young Buck,Thug Till Ya Death Day,/y/young+buck/thug+till+ya+death+day_20676433.html,"[Intro:]
As I ride through the city streets
Forty-five on my lap A-K on my backseat
Smokin a fat ass swisher sweet
Then I ask myself, Will I survive?

[Verse 1:]
How can I tell you Imma stop sellin bricks
That's that way man choose to pay his rent
Shit its hard to get a job gettin out the pen
Then they wonder why we right back in that bitch again

Try to peace talk, and sit down like men
But then theres always a friend that be like fuck them
So the guns bust, and the body must fall
Nothing can stop it not even Farakan balls

Its a shame tho, and what I came in the game fo
I really done slang dope, so really I'm thankful
To be in a position to make a thug listen
Aint no tellin who gon come up missin or go to prison

You can run from it, try to hide it from your peers
Let em hear bout it, before they go see what it is
I can give it to you, tell you bout what I done did
Even though Im gettin money yall this is how I live, fo real

[Chorus: x2]
Still on the block lookin for a better way
Its safe to say Im thuggin till my death day
Every gangsta in the world let us all pray
Then put in work homie, thug till ya death day

[Verse 2:]
Now everybody in the race for the first place
They gave D twenty years for his first case
We form gangs to protect our hood
If the police could lock us all up they would

But we dont trip tho, just pray to God we da picked folk
Relying on side hustles to get dope
Aint nobody rich, even if you workin with some millions
You need more money to support your cost of livin

See we dont cry in the hood no more
Aint really too much I aint seen before
Crackhead Fred said he'd kill for a nigga
When it came down to it, he did for a nigga
That don't get no realer cuz yall niggas ran
You was the only man with a gun in ya hand
Good thang that I dont trust a nigga with my life
Fill the clip with hollow tips we ridin tonight

[Chrous x2]

[Outro:]
Every neighborhood, every project, every block in the motherfuckin world
We gotta ride niggas, its us against the motherfuckin police
Aint no love, a man is only as good as his word
Death is something that comes for us all
What you scared fo? Nigga what you scared fo?
Gangsta, holla when you see me"

[Intro]
Man, niggas be gettin' tha wrong impression of these niggas down here in Cashville
They thank it's country musik mayne, mothafuckas got money mayne!
Niggas is killin', niggas is slangin' they shit..
Niggas is livin, they gettin' it how they live
I represented it nigga (Wha.. Fuck these niggas)

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
I'ma born villain, ghetto hero to lil' children
I'm still livin', still robbin' niggas like gimicks
White folks feel dat I belong in prison
We got 10 killings and still can't get in
I stay un-identified, but niggas betta listin
I'm on a mission, just me and my ammunition
When 2 clips take together, bust and dip 'em
I know my nigga D-Tay, yeah he gon' stick 'em (Wha, Wha?!)
Guerilla, under-aged killa like myself
Fearin' nothin', no head bussin' not even bein' dead
Murda Squad is here, you smell tha fury from tha gun smoke
Empty my weapon and then it's covered by a trench coat
And when tha smoke clears, guess wha? - I'm still here
Late in the dark, prepared fo' tha next year
Look wha The Game created, a 6 foot murda man, hair braided un-educated

[Chorus - Buck w/ D-Tay ad-libin']
See we thugged out, busy bobbin' wit tha snub nose out
'Cause dese niggas 'bout drama where I'm from - Cashville! (Wha, Wha?)
Come down here I betchu'll say dat's real, and niggas will kill
'Cause we thugged out, dat why niggas busy bobbin' wit tha snub nose out
'Cause dese niggas 'bout drama where I'm from - Cashville! (Wha, Wha?)
Come down here I betchu'll say dat's real, and niggas will kill

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
The average thug nigga somehow drug dealin'
Wether he slang packs or gats, it's all 'bout skrilla
We un-load straps, and shootcha down like Reggie Miller
While othas take time to get paid, I like it quicka
And do it sober no weed or sizzle licka
Know wha I mean? It's fuckin' teams of Mob bigga
Respect game and game don't respect you
Gon' be out here nigga, you got a nine? Get a Tec too!
Bitches will check you, or make ya thank a nigga ain't?
Plus you got bank too, a nigga waitin' fo' ya rank, off tha dank
Butchu don't feel like you loafin'
Crystal, you drank - and thank a nigga ain't scopin'
Yeah, you tell world you work hard fo' these tokens
Get a fuckin' strap and keep ya wallet wide open
My nigga look, life means nothin' when ya positive bound
Been listin when ya body goin' deep in tha ground

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
What does my phuture behold, will I have suttin' to fold
Tell tha world bout these murdas, and hope they go gold
I'm gettin' known, so wha happens needs to happen here qwick
6 tryin' and 6 dyin', I'm gettin tired of this shit
Load clips, cock it back, ain't no time fo' me to relax
Here they come, can't run - so I gotta shoot back
why sit and sell' crack, when Im grabin' tha gats
Infra-red where you lay ya head, snatch you and stacks
If you wrong, but a nigga gotta eat ya hurrd?
Fuck handcuffin' ya bitch, ya betta guard ya byrd
This shit hard to earn, so Im'a get it how I can
Hop in outta mini-van, knownin' this tha mini mayn
Don't let me see tha gat when I'm askin' tha Lord
Till I found myself broke, back to swingin' my sword
Soulja when I was hooked to my ambellical cord
If I'm wrong sell backwards dat's why I'm here fo'

Shoppin sprees overseas, you and me on a private flight
Got a chance to be my wife if ya ass act right
Gotta dance all night girl, you want that ice
Everythang's on me, yeah, I'm that type
Marble floors in these elevator doors
Sixteen bedrooms and all of 'em yours
Let's fuck all night, any position you like
Thick coats by the Coach, black Bentley Azure

No reception, low bars, it ain't on and I
Keep doin this cause you don't care
Material girl that'll always be there, ya ain't goin nowhere

Time and time I try to leave
But I just can't seem to leave yo' ass alone
Don't know why I can't let you go
And why I keep comin back for mo'

Got me up out the hood, but I'm so confused
And I don't know how much more of this
Disrespect I can take from youuuuu

And ya ain't goin nowhere, how I know because I told you so
And all that cryin shit stop when I'm down below
Shit, I'm on top when you hit that O
Now get that O, that's what the fuck you came here fo'
Now move that body all around like a professional
Damn, shorty's so flexible
We can do it on the highway, I'm talkin 'bout s** to go
Now how the fuck we get to Mexico?
Yeah I bought that house, but now you talkin 'bout leavin
You don't wanna do that girl it's pleasin season
Heard your girls told you I'm fuckin up and that you need to get even
But all you need is me, you don't need them
You know the game, maintain and do ya thang
And tell them bitches worry 'bout they own man
So when they start talkin like dat dere
Tell them bitches get the fuck out your ear, cause you ain't goin nowhere

You keep tellin me I make you sick
But on some real shit, quit bitch, you love this dick
And even if she did leave because of the way I act
It be's like that, fuck it she'll be right back
You and I both know, if you and I both go
Our separate ways one thing's for sho'
If you ever get the nerve to pack your shit and walk up out that do'
You ain't never comin back no mo'

Told her I'm like you you know

Armor out the inside, and vacuum up the spilldrough
The weed too high so I still grow
Why you think I got this high as life bill for
Why you think I got 3000 white pills for
They moving real slow, I'm tryna make a mill hoe
Why the fuck you think that I ain't left the ville for
Niggas might act like they don't but they still know

Where they hustle in the crack or so
Where you from nigga then they say what you asking for
Late night, dice game, smoking night jane

Nigga, G-Unit nigga!!
Dayum.. I neva knew this rap shit
Could have a nigga beefin' wit his own homebois, ya'know?
Shit fucked up, but this how it goes...

[Verse]
Came up (Yuh!), I did my thang
This is so real I ain't sayin' no names (Nah!)
Started wit' a dream like Martin Luther King
'Till tha Fed's came sayin' my whole fuckin' team (Huh!)
Switched my game up, started from tha bottom (Why?!)
My Daughter on tha way I don't need these problems (Aiight)
Find me a new job - I wanna rap
So I got myself a new squad, got out tha trap
Didn't have too many niggas ridin' wit' me then (Uh)
But now everybody wanna ride in my Benz (Uhh!!)
This one nigga dat I called a friend of mine
He was really right there when I didn't have a dime (Yeahh!)
But I stayed on tha grind, waited in tha line
Thinkin' dat we'd both git rich in due time (nigga!)
My blessin' came and people started to listin
It's G-Unit now so I put him in posission (Owh!)
To ride wit' a nigga, and make his own bread
Can't give him tha world but hayell, I did what I can
He got a lil' man dat he called his artist (Yeah!)
I took him right in like ""Damn, let's start dis."" (C'monn!)
Brought him round 50 to show him what he got
He looked at me quickly and said he was hot
We was on our way, straight to tha top
But my homeboi feel like his man need to drop (Uh ohh)
His frustration kicks in, now here we go
My homeboi feelin' like I owe a lil' mo'
Meanwhile this tha 1st week my album out (Okayye!)
Shit my own damn mama didn't have a house (Phureal!)
Stay focused tha way I post this
When tha lights on, you can see tha roaches (Uh huh)
Shit got bad, my homeboi really got mad
'Cause he started losin' everythang dat he had (Aahh!)
Nobody to blame but who else, Guess who?
He started sendin' threats sayin' what he gon' do (Whudd!!)
Now I can't live around this beef stuff (Nah)
This ain't New York, my city ain't big enough
So I'm lookin' fo' my homeboy wit' guns and shit (C'monn)
Askin' The Lord how did it come to this (Why?!)
There he goes, right there with his toy souljas
I'm all by myself, let's git this ova
Dogg down on the whole crowd, don't nobody move
Where my homeboi at, what he say he gon' do? (Huh!)
Outta nowhere, my homeboi show his face (Aye!)
But one of his souljas pull a gun from his waist (Dayum!!)
I started to shoot, but I looked in his eyes
And then I realized dat he didn't wanned die
So it's back to my homeboi, Wussup now?!
He like ""Damn Buck, you really actin' fucked up now""
I'm like ""Nawhh, niggas say you trynnah kill me.""
Glock still out nobody gittin' near me (Unh uh)
A car door opens, and who do I see?!
My homeboi artist who was down wit' me
He holla ""Put ya guns down, and put ya hands up"" (What?!)
I wadn't thinkin' I just fucked ya man up
Picked up my strap, hopped in my 'Lac truck (C'monn)
Told my homeboi ""Ya mayn's an act up"" (nigga!!)
Weeks went by, and we got back cool
First it's shame on 'em, then it's shame on you (You!)
'Cause these same ol' dues dat I let back round (Okayye)
Doin' all kinds'a shit behind my back now
Wanna sleep wit' tha enemy to make some noise? (Aiight!)
But this how it go in tha streets, when you war witcha homeboi

Rollin' in the latest cut
Dro in the masenger
I pull strings like a guitar cuz
And roll blunts that end up better than the cigar was
I ain't negotiating my deal I was like ""Pay me stunna""
Put a nigga out and watch me put out Jay-Z numbers
Made a hundred in '05 that was a crazy summer
Holla ""Free everyone"" out of an ap Hummer
Now my nigga out in L. A. Got to say we gettin' money, long as fate keep it comin'

Put the heater in his mouth now that's a hot tamale
Dope boy swag
With A. 44 Mag
Tied up in the bag
Got to get that cash.. On the low
I can take you to the proper work
In that blue Bentley with Buck is that Papa Smurf?
I'll pop ya first
If you step wrong
Bulletproof Teflon
Maybe that's a deaf song
Have them bullets cave in his chest bone
The 380 look good cause its dressed chrome
For this Ca$hville shit I'll kill your ass
Fuck a check nigga Hi want a mill in cash

Ridin' hard shinin' just like a light house
Get money money
A hood boss that's why they hate me
Pissed off cause my shimmy come in packs a week
Plus my price is cheap
So you know my push is deep
Get it in and get it gone that's my recipe
(Keep it movin')
All that talk shit is weak man
My goons murder through the motherfuckin' street man
And I'm ridin' for my South niggas
So watch your mouth or them Ks 'gon come out niggas
Hatin' on the kid
Cause them bitches on my dick
Every car that I whip
Keep them rims doin' flips
Got 'em sick
I got money and the power
Any competition, game over I will holla
So get your mind right and get your money up
And stop hatin' before you get your life fucked up

I'm about to see man
Ho ass nigga
Hatin' ass nigga I can see it in your eyes
Is it the way I walk the shit, I talk or what I drive?
I do this shit for real niggas rappin' tellin' lies
About how they do pimpin', jackin', and sellin' pies
I be stayin' away from hos who don't want to see me on my grind
Cupcake I know your fine
But once I fuck I ain't got time
I hit the strip club with six or seven dimes
I break a chicken down flip six or seven times
The candy painted Chevy lookin' like a sip of wine
Perigon Impala nineteen sixty nine
I bought a brand new pistol it bust fifty times
In case a nigga out here try to fuck with my shine
I hit the club tryin' to push a couple of lines
Pop a couple of pills, get some hips and thighs
I put this on my tattoos do not blow my high
Cause if we get into it somebody got to die"

Stuntin in the club, make 'em start a riot
Throw my hood up then go take it outside

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Why you hate me nigga? Yo baby momma love me
She see me in the club, and runs up and hug me
I show her no love, she keep on comin back
Tellin me she got yo club, and where yo money at
It must be my 'Lac, that's sittin on Pirellis
The way I count stacks, that's got these niggas jealous
See I'm hard on a hoe, I get down for mine
You need a hand-out bitch, don't waste ya time
If you don't work (you don't work), you don't eat (you don't eat)
We go to jail, go to church, go to sleep
I'm ridin' 'round wit Scrappy in the A wit my heat
Tryna figure out how to get to Peachtree
Come on nigga

[Verse 2: Lil' Murder]
Young nigga, but a certified playa
But youse a bitch nigga, youse a bonafide hater
They was glad I was broke, but now I'm livin major
Hustlin and servin niggas like a waiter for the paper
We ridin down the strip in sumthin so wet
When ya bitch see a nigga, wanna suck a nigga dick
Smokin' dro and drinkin' liquor till a nigga get sick
Every city, every state, it's the same ol' shit
Nigga money make the world go 'round so get ya hustle on
These niggas snitchin' so much, I'm like ""fuck a phone""
Mad cuz I'm on, they love to see me down
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
Nigga

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: All-Star]
Look, hatin' aint healthy, nigga so keep it movin'
These shots will wake ya whole hood up, I'm sleepin' through it
Chea, I'm used to it, I done made a gun fire
Pull the trigger one time, sound like a gun fight
You was glad I was broke, now ya mad cuz ya hoe
Love it when a nigga put it in the back of her throat
Buck, Hi-C, Murder, and Star, we aint never scared
I don't need my pistol in the club, I'll brawl there
I know hustlers that do deal white
Jump stupid, find out what these boots feel like
Yea, yall know me, All-Star I'm so street (yea)
What it is, what it aint, what it gon be

[Verse 4: Hi-C]
I don't bust my gun, like a halftime football game
I aimed straight and I took yall name
And ya whole click look all lame
You can catch me in the house with a pyrex and it cook all caine
Put that metal in ya mouth, you gon swear I was doctor walls
I'm in the club with my muthafuckin' glock in drawers
I had to let my nuts hang, so I dropped my balls
You aint hit him wit no bullets nigga shot the walls
You shoot to scare, I aim and kill
When I dump on you, they gon think yo brain aint real
I'm heavyweight in the game, you featherweight
When they hear a nigga take a loss, they wanna celebrate

I gotta dizzy bird on my side

Baby that's right, stay off the payroll
I have niggaz scrapin' the skin off your face
With the same shit that peel the potatoes
I thank the Lord for my blessings and I'm glad he gave us
The willpower and the reflexes of Larry Davis

You don't wanna see my block formin'
That's a hundred and one dawgs
And I don't mean the ones with the spots on 'em
We're respected highly
'Cause you ain't gotta practice gymnastics to catch a body

Me and money's like Whitney, next to Bobby
If I bring all my niggaz I need an extra lobby
As soon as you ain't around Jake
You get your ass whipped for chips
Now that's the real definition of poundcake

I got the crown snake
And you can tell when I'm shoppin'

I got a car I only drive on Thursdays
I'm a stunner, Banks blows more cake than birthdays

We ain't got shit down here but dope and guns for sale
You get your head cracked, then niggaz don't run and tell
It's like we sell crack, get caught, head back to jail
We on that 'Fuck the police' shit, we're livin' in hell

You better guard your grill homey and stand your ground
These bullets burn, they hit whoever's standin' around
I never learned even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some Band-Aids and bought a couple Glocks

Had to go on a rampage, and hit a couple blocks
Once they hear that 12 gauge, that's when the trouble stops
If it's beef then I'm ready to ride, just come to Cashville
You can find me on the South Side, motherfucker! 

Looka here, ain't nobody 'round here scared

You know Yayo and 50, Buck and Game, you know my fuckin' name
Whether the truck or train, my mind stuck on the grind
Cussin' without a line, a lot of suckers came

Yeah you talkin' shit, but we can all tell he ass
Jazz and black his eyes like the R. Kelly mass
You gotta blast me yo, 'cause the Louisville'll
Have your head lookin' like the top of a pistachio

The young gunner with the raspy flow
Got every boyfriend thinkin' they girlfriend's a nasty ho
My heart laugh and it's small, maybe it's 'cause
My grand pop dropped right after the ball

Banks hops out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel when you hot, they hawk you
I got the hood on my shoulder, chain big as a boulder

Don't make me put my hands on you nigga, I'ma show you what I'm bout
Keep yappin at the mouth and get knocked the fuck out
Knocked the fuck out, knocked the fuck out
Keep yappin at the mouth and get knocked the fuck out

[Master P]Need to stop yappin, quackin soundin like a duck
Quick to holla what's up when a thug pull up
I see you fake ass twisted niggaz straight to the side
And can't even look a real nigga straight in the eye
Screamin ""Bust a nigga head"" but real killers don't talk
You could tell a real gangster how he act and how we act
See, you and your click don't wanna face me nigga
I'll detroit indiana fuckin pace ya nigga
Cause I'm crazy like my dad, a wild coyote
Show you what Shaq shoulda did to Kobe
Slap him in his mouth, nigga fuck Jerry Buss
That fool still talkin, beat his bitch ass up
You a rookie under me so respect your elders
Get a country ass whoopin tryin to be rebelous
The New No Limit, we ain't scared to go to war
Have you spoof when you leave the house or ridin in your car

[Chorus:]
[Master P]You can't live in a glasshouse and try and throw stones

I'm a New No Limit soldier, got it tatted on my arm
See you puh puh poolay, fuck what you say
We get to stomping like soldiers in Peru Bay
Real thugs get it crunk in the club
You don't give a fuck then throw your hood up
I got a couple screws missing, they say I talk in my sleep
I'm addicted to money and weed but I love the freaks
You don't wanna run up on a nigga in the club
When I'm gone off that hypnotiq, henny and that buzz
See, I'm a fool nigga, break the rules nigga
I came to party, you wanna get stomped, that's on you nigga
See, I'm a beast boy, I'm from the streets boy
You could knuckle up but Drumma got that heat boy
I mean the feet boy, I'm Pistol Pete boy
Stop screamin motherfucker, you ain't me boy

[Chorus:]
[Young Buck + (Master P)](Where you at Buck?)
We got the weed spot poppin and the dice game crackin
Got some hustlers with some birds and some young niggaz jackin
This the hood baby, white t-shirts and the khakis
Stomp stompin in my G-Units still Cadillac'n
P, you know I been waiting to push a line with you dawg
P, uou know I been waiting to use this nine with you dawg
I'm on the grey goose, Huey Lewis Black Panther shit
The whole club pumping they fist but here we go
It's No Limit up in here, bitch you got damn right
(bitch you got damn right)
We gonna act like C-Murder just got out of jail tonight
Oh, we came to start a fight, break 'em off something rough
Take it back to the streets nigga, make 'em say ughh (Make 'em say ughh)
So me and Silkk The Shocker in a black Impala
Burnin rubber in the third ward, ridin wit a chopper
No matter what I been through, my bank account got it
Fuck them other niggaz cause we still bout it bout it

Young Mc,Back In The Day,/y/young+mc/back+in+the+day_20151981.html,"Back in the day,
Growing up in Hollis Queens New York,
I used to play in the day til the day got dark,
And everyone around me knew everybody else,
No matter what you do, you're never by yourself,
School and homework were neccessary evils,
Before you went out and daredeviled like Kenivel
Football and softball and b-ball we played,
Cause that's that we went about it back in the day

Verse 2:

Now back in the day,
Block partys going on in the summer,
The echo in the street was the beat of the drummer,
Guys and girls dancing, and kids ran around,
When I got a little older, grab the mic and throw down,
I always rocked the party, I never was afraid,
Cause if you made a record you was gonna get paid,
Baby D was in there, and so was Super Rhymes,
And every signle dj had a pair of good times,
Now?? Hooked me, and put me in the crew,
But 15 brothers made it something like a zoo,
When I got through, like the other crews around,
With Jam, Pete, Hollis Crew and Solo Sound,
But meanwhile, all the kids were getting into fashion,
Spend a couple dollars, hit the ave with a passion,
Trying to be in with the rest of New Yorkers,
Mock necks, knees, and a pair of british walkers,
The?? To the turn to the ave for the shopping,
And once you got started, yo, there was no stopping,
And when it got cold there were coats to get inta,
Sheep dogs and goosedowns that keep you warm in the winter,
Collecting dust in my house today is some of the gear that I used to wear
Around the way,
You gotta dress to impress is what I always say,
Cause that's the way you went about it back in the day

Verse 3:

Back in the day I watched wrestling with Superfly Snuka,
A quart of?? And a strawberry bazooka,
5 for a haircut, and they can make it thourough,
And 50 cents can get you anywhere in the borough,
Karate movies came on Saturdays at 3,
The films were kind of cheap but they were dope to me,
Movie scores for 3 bucks, and 5 in the city,
So 20 was plenty, with someone who was pretty,
You had to have heart, though,
And suckers were forbidden,
Yes we were kids then, but no we wasn't kidding,
I often reminisce about the real good times,
Yo, I know it's not Georgia, but it's still on my mind,
Back when we used to have the partys in the park,
And crack wasn't nothing but a broken sidewalk,
You helped a brother out so he could make his way,
Cause that's how you went about it back in the day"
Young Mc,Bust A Move,/y/young+mc/bust+a+move_20162432.html,"""Bust it
This here's a tale for all the fellas,
Try to do what those ladies tell us,
Get shot down cuz you're over zealous.
Play hard to get females get jealous.
Ok, smarty, go to a party.
Girls are scantilly clad and showin' body,
A chick walks by, ya wish ya could s** her,
But she's in another world like you was poindexter.
Next day's function, high class luncheon.
Food is served, and you're stone cold munchin'.
Music comes on, people start to dance,
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin',
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'.
Says she wanna dance cuz she likes to groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.
You're on a mission,
And you're wishin' someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination,
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
But ever dark tunnel has a light, I hope,
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope.
New movie's showin', so you're goin',
Could care less about the five you're blowin'.
Theatre gets dark just to start the show,
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row.
She's dressed in yellow, she says hello,
Come sit next to me ya fine fellow.
You run over there without a second to lose,
And what comes next, hey, bust a move.
In the city, ladies look pretty,
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.
Tell a funny joke just to get some play,
Then you try to make a move and she says no way.
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin',
They want a man who brings home the bacon.
Got no money and got no car,
Then you got no woman and there you are.
Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic.
They're lyin' on the beach, perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man
So, on the beach start strollin', real high rollin',
Everything you have is yours and not stolen.
A girl runs up with something to prove,
So don't just stand there, bust a move
Just bust a move
Break it down for me fellas
Your best friend, Harry, has a brother Larry...
In five days from now he's gonna marry.
He's hopin' you can make it there, if you can,
Cuz in the ceremony you'll be the best man.
You say neato, check your libido,
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.
The bride walks down, just to start the wedding...
And there's one more girl you won't be getting.
So you start thinkin', then ya start blinkin',
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feeling really fine cuz the girl is stacked.
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin',
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'.
Says she wanna dance to a different groove,
Now you know what to do, g, bust a move.
Just bust a move
Move it boy. """
Young Mc,Coast 2 Coast,/y/young+mc/coast+2+coast_20177967.html,"I met a girl named hip hop in seventy eight
Hollis Queens New York gave us our first date
Man she broke me off proper yo the girl was fast
And everybody kept telling me it would not last
Cause ain't no women in the world supposed to be that sweet
And ya just can't trust a hot chick from the street
I could tell she had been through lots of struggle and strife
But yet in still she'd been with me over half of my life
Born key Jeff Taylor took me into his home
And intrduced me to some tables and a microphone
Hip hop talked to me told me take your time
At the age of eleven I bust my first rhyme
Block partys in the day house partys at night
Just about one year before Rapper's Delight
Everybody in the crew called to make a request
Cause rap's on the radio and hip-hop was blessed
Didn't go to many clubs I wasn't old enough
And if it try to sneak it out my folks is scolding up
But I still do anything to get on stage
And once I got a club gig I lied about my age
Just a couple blocks away was the Hollis crew
Run and them used to rock at one ninety two
Up the street was a crew called Solo Sounds
Where Davey D and Mex used to throw it down
Man I wouldn't trade rap for anything in the world
Hip hop meant more to me than diamonds and pearls
And I still reminicse to this very day
And I remember those words hip hop would say

(Do you have love for the east coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
East coast played a role in making a hip hop
(Do you have love for the east coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
East coast played a role in making a hip hop

Now I gotta get busy time to make that move
High school over with gotta sho' improve
Got college on the coast and I'm makin' plans
So hip hip went and told me go west young man
It was a different kind of style but I liked the sound
Everybody in the house gauranteed to get down
I did the casa skateland word on wheels
And the crazy crazy world of the record deal
K-day was the station that played my song
I got love from the people it's a shame they gone
Julio and Tony G yo was keeping it real
And Baker Boys doin' they own up in Bakersville
I remember other brothers putting out the gin
Like six in the morning and the battle ran
There were boys in the hood and little Nenah Cherry
And oh I can't forget about ooh Rock Berry
Before the madness when I made my fame
Alot of people on the west coast knew my name
Before the big magizines even wanted to meet me
I checked the back pages of the L. A. Weekly
To see if they would write and recognize the sound
Cause in those days Young mc was underground
Lot of times I would rhyme and I'd get no pay
But I remember those words hip hop would say

(Do you have love for the west coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
West coast played a role in making a hip hop
(Do you have love for the west coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
West coast played a role in making a hip hop

Talk of an east coast west coast beef makes me panic
I love both sides so I'm straight skitzafrenic
Got my skills in the east got my deal in the west
So I just can't say what side is the best
Now you love where you live that's true indeed
Cause your family and friends give you what you need
Stand up for yo' hood and you do it with pride
But the media tells you hate the other side
Now it's hard to hate a man that I have not met
Or hate a whole damn coast like a????
Cause hip hop is wit ya no matter where you stay
So remember these words hip hop would say

(Do you have love for the east coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
East coast played a role in making a hip hop
(Do you have love for the west coast?)
Yeah that's right

(do you have love for the east coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
Both coasts played a role in making hip hop
(do you have love for the west coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
Both coasts played a role in making hip hop

Young Mc,Fuel To The Fire,/y/young+mc/fuel+to+the+fire_20196306.html,"Or could it be you cause you do your voodoo baby

but she gave me more drama than the OJ trial

and I knew I wasn't needed here anytime soon
I had to get your name number information
because certain body parts had inflimation
in fact from the front and the back you was hittin
and I said damn from the place I was sittin
to say I'm not sprung well Young would be a liar

Chorus:

and the flesh will fade because it's only skin deep

so creep with me as we roll through the night
and don't sleep with me until you know that it's right
that was thirsty girl until you quench my desire

Young Mc,Got More Rhymes,/y/young+mc/got+more+rhymes_20209707.html,"[ verse 1 ]
Now from planet to planet, and from star to star
It doesn't really matter, baby, just who you are
And from Earth to solar system, and to galaxy
It's real hard to get a ticket to hear Young mc
Because I rock like a professional, this ain't no lark
You either hear me at a party, or you see me in the park
I rocked the many places far away from my home
I guess that must be the reason why I'm so well known
I rocked from Iowa to Idaho, Canada to Mexico
I came into the place, you party people, just to let you know
My name is the Young mc, ladies want to come to me
And when they're in my arms, the ladies never ever front on me
Thinkin that you know the deal, boy, why don't you be for real
I love to rock the mic, and sometimes even rock the wheels of steel
Rock the place without a doubt, now I'm gonna turn it out
So listen very close, so I can tell you that it's all about
Rhymes

More rhymes
Party people, I'm the Young mc, and I got rhymes
Let me tell you something
Young mc got more rhymes

[ verse 2 ]
Now with a voice like this I rock so well
But I'm not Prince, Lionel Richie, or Patti Labelle
I'm not the Cars, the Pretenders, or the B-52's
My name is Young mc, and I'm the one you should choose
Cause when the music comes in, the beat starts thumpin
And I'm the only man to keep the girlies high jumpin
I'm the doctor on the mic, and yes, I'm so sure
That all you need is one visit, then you'll be cured
Cause in the game of rap I am the referee
When the others need help, they'll come to me
Like Judge Joe Wapner on the _People's Court_
My name is Young mc, rockin on the mic is my sport
And now you know, just from those 12 lines
That a fella like me never falls behind
Cause I'm the cream of the crop, and the leader of the pack
Once you give me the mic, you know there's no turnin back
Because I got more rhymes then the other guys do
They're just a monkey, I'm the whole damn zoo
I can't use a book, I use a hefty bag
Because they're just a string, I'm the American flag
I got more rhymes than water seen by a sailor
More than husbands of Elizabeth Taylor
More than Babe Ruth has hit home runs
Yo, my name is Young mc, so go out there and have some fun
With rhymes

More rhymes
I gotta tell you something
Young mc got rhymes
Party people, I got more rhymes

Bust it

[ verse 3 ]
Rhymes - what are these things that I talk about?
Hear them in the walkman everytime you wanna walk about
Never lost a battle in which I fought
And if rhyme was a crime, I'd never get caught
I had to go to college, because I am an intellectual
I only sleep with women, cause I am heterosexual
Rock the microphone anyplace, anytime
That's why I had to write a jam and call it Got More Rhymes
Now as a consequence of this
I'd like to make some sense of this
And tell the party people all the reasons that I sent you this
Rhyme that I continue to say
School starts in September, graduation in May
And when I graduate rhymes'll keep comin
Girls try to flock and jock, but stop bummin
Cause I'm the kinda guy that you never wanna toy with
And now you know that I'm talkin about the boy with
Rhymes

More rhymes
When you say Young mc, you are sayin rhymes
Party people, Young mc got more rhymes
Yeah"
Young Mc,I Come Off,/y/young+mc/i+come+off_20170419.html,"Aah na-na, na-na

Now I wrote this record for when I perform,
From the nights inside a university dorm,
I put pen to paper with a paper and pen,
For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men,
I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy,
Kreuger with a luger turnin' men into spaghetti,
I'm like Fats Domino, up on Blueberry Hill,
'cause my rhymes are funky fresh not run of the mill,
And like a king has palaces I give an analyis,
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis,
Of the mouth, of the lip, of the tounge, comin' to you complements of a
Brother named Young,
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless,
So be quiet and let an educater teach this,
It's due to my producer, so he's in a rage. And Mike you control the vinyl
I'll control the stage 'cause I come of,

Chorus

Four score and seven years ago
There were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know
Four score and seven years later
I dig a hole in those rappers like the moon with a crater
Because they battle me they're really taking a risk,
Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc,
And like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succesion,
I'm droppin' mcs in the rappin' proffesion
I'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker,
And I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snooka,
Like a shuttle goes up into outer space, people's hands go up when I enter
The place,
I don't mean to brag or boast just to tell ya I'm great, but I can rock the
Microphone like Dorothy Hammil can skate,
Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Luganis can dive, Don't have to be
Saturday night for Young mc to get live 'cause I come off,

Chorus

Yo I come off, My name is Young mc and baby I come off
Yo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go

Now one behold, Young mc struck gold,
Form the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old,
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb,
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum,
You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me,
They run and hide when they hear the name of Young mc,
Like a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be
So when I start I say Oli Oli Oxenfree,
Yo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one,
So pay attention 'cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes
Nobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersy, la or Philidelphia,
City to city, and town to town, place to place
Country to country, cause I get around
Even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
Cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the pa,
So when you get out come and see my show
And if you start static back in you go
'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam,
And when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn
Cause I come off

Chorus

I come off. Yo baby, I come off. Here we go"
Young Mc,Inside My Head,/y/young+mc/inside+my+head_20271932.html,"This song will discuss four main parts of the brain, the cerebrum, the
cerebellum, the limbic system and the brain stem and one individual's use or
misuse of these parts.

Verse 1:

Inside my head, or inside my brain,
is that part of me which keeps me sane,
which helps me discern between right and wrong,
and other things I'm gonna talk about in this song,
It's time for the people to know, so now I tell 'em,
what goes in my cerebrum and my cerebellum,
the though process that helps me get dressed,
get up and go to school, sit down and take a test,
it helps me determine if a girl is fine,
and the steps necessary to make her mine,
it tells me if something is cold or hot,
and I don't mess it up with crack, coke, or pot,
it helps my hearing, taste, touch and sight,
and smell so that I can tell that everything's alright,
it tells me when to get up and when to go to bed,
this is some of what goes on inside my head,
inside my head, I wonder what might happen,
if the day came and I stopped rappin',
would I still have friends or be all alone,
do they like me for me or for the microphone,
and also, when I go on a date,
to a fancy resteraunt, a hundred dollars a plate,
and people stare, is it because they recognize me,
or are they knee-jerk reacting to what they see,
I'm sorry, let me make it somewhat clear,
do they look with joy or do they look with fear,
do they think 'oh wow, Young MC is near',
or do they think, 'yo, get that nigga out of here',
I don't know, it's an unfortuante case,
that I can't read your mind when I see your face,
but on the other hand, you can't read mine,
so I guess that the status quo's just fine,
for instance, say I'm in a tall building,
looking out the window, what if I illed and,
jumped out, would it really matter to some,
and if they had my funeral, just who would come,
would they cry for me after I was gone,
well don't worry, that's not how I'm gonna move on,
cause I wanna go to heaven after I am dead,
but this is what I goes on inside my head

Chours 2: (spoken)

the cerebrum is the part of the brain which is responsible for thinking,
reasoning, problem solving, and initiating resposes to external stimuli. It
is comprised of four lobes: the frontal, which is concerned with speach and
voluntary muscle activity, the partietal, which is concerned with the
interpetation of sensory stimuli, the temporal, which is concerned with
auditory stimuli or hearing, and the occipital lobe, which is concerned with
the interpetation of visual stimuli. It is the development of the cerebrum
in humans which distinguishes us from other living creatures. Only whales
and dolphins have comparable cerveal development.

Verse 2:

Inside my head, pretty women reign supreme,
because they enter my live and dominate my dreams,
I see one walking down the avenue freely,
and I look her up and down hoping that she don't see me,
then I wonder, what if the girl just stopped,
threw me on the ground and she got on top,
and moved and grooved until our bodies were slick,
then I stop and say 'man, that's sick',
but I'm not alone in this train of thought,
a lot of people think it, but they don't get caught,
they just live their lives and keep it all inside,
another secret that the brain will hide,
right, I wonder what it's like to live life wild,
I wonder which women will have my child,
will I be a good parent, or will I be cold,
then I imagine I'm five years old,
I'm running down the street without a care in the world,
puberty's later, so I don't think about girls,
Mom and Dad will do whatever I say,
they think it's really cute to see their son play,
responsibility is like a four letter word,
they say they told me something, I'll say I never heard,
forget growing up, I'll be a kid instead,
because this is what goes on inside my head,

Chours 3: (spoken)

the cerebellum is located below the octipal lobe and behind the brain stem.
It takes impulses from the rest of the brain and helps translate them into
coordinated muscle movements. Any msucualr acticity, from brute strenght to
a steady had, requires a high degree of cerebellur input. The brain stem is
located just above the base of the skull, and is the continuious connection
between the brain and the spinal cord. The lowest part of the brain stem or
the medullah oblongata actually becomes the spinal cord at the medullah's
lowest point and is concerned with the waking and sleeping states.

Verse 3:

Inside my head, there are so many questions to answer,
and self-doubt grows in my mind like cancer,
but I make sure that my thoughts are pure,
and my self-confidence is like a cancer cure,
so someone tell me why I think I'm fat,
when none of my friends ever think like that,
and could it be I'm not as ugly as I feel,
because a lot of women think I've got sex appeal,
and is it true, that I'm just too commercial,
not black enough cause I'm not controversial,
is it true what religious fanatics tell,
if I don't go to your church then I'm going to hell,
and is it true, that I'm obliged to try,
to please everyone with music I supply,
and is it true, that it will make me strong,
if I sleep with a women cause she likes my song,
and is it true that I'm not a real black man,
if I fall in love with somebody who needs a tan,
and is it true that I have to try to be,
some type of superhero, cause I'm Young MC,
and is it true, that I have to watch myself,
because I think about sex more than anyone else,
and is it true, that every women is fake,
'cause she don't like me for me but for the money I make,
and is it true that I must be out of place,
since pop radio likes me, I'm ignoring my race,
and is it true what some people will complain,
that since I made this song I must be insane,
hell no, these are just negative thoughts,
and I just ignore them so I won't get caught,
I let my heart lead and my brain be led,
because this is what goes on inside my head,

Chours 4: (spoken)

The limbic system or the visceral brain is located in the area above the
brain stem and below the cerebrum. It is concerned with emotional tone,
habitual tendencies, sexual behaviour and desires, and is closely associated
with the cerebrum. This association provides an inhibition for the raw
emotional output of the limbic system. It is the artist's opinion that the
concept of self-control rests upon the cerebrum's ability to regulate the
uninhibited emotional impulses of the limbic system. And for me, the
struggle continuies"
Young Mc,Just Say No,/y/young+mc/just+say+no_20226688.html,"Attention party people its a apb
That is an all points bulleton from Young mc
Now rather your a senior citizen or just a tike
Just grab a seat and pay attention as I rock the mic

I wrote a couple of Rhymes and call them just say no
Dedicated to the people who are on the go
And when can help you out when you are on the brink
And when you listen this jam can make you think

If you were ever in a situation
With out enough time for comtimplation
All of your friends go in the same way
You feel kind of traped, you don't know what to say

Just say no

'cause better safe then sorry
This is for real, this aint no game or folly
Its your life and you only got one
So you better do it right or it will soon be done

You want to be popular, you want to be cool
You want to be the one that every body likes at school
You want to be every thing just for every one else
But you better thing of what you want to be for your self

Every day people livin in the same old mess
Hard to be original and not be like the rest
You got to go for what you know, you can't afford to guess
And heaven knows what would happen if you did say yes

So say no

Just say no

You hear me say no... No... No... No

Just say no

Kids od and cause a family greef
Over the marajana plant and the coco leaf
Over a bunch of pills to try to get their thrills
Over a drug you shoot becuase you think it's cute

Over something you smoke, man it aint no joke
Over something you drink oh boy why don't you think
Over something you snort like you were playing a sport
One day you'll go to far and you'll come up short

Some people out there don't seem to get my point
Tellin other crack kills while their smoking a joint
Well the point of this song is to tell you the facts
Some people die from smoking the tree like they die from crack

Not a drug I'm particular but drugs in general
Their not good for you like a vitamin or a mineral
They come in liquid, leaf, powder, pills, and rocks
To put you six feet under on your back in a box

So say no

Just say no

Did you hear me say no... No... No... No

Just say no"
Young Mc,Know How,/y/young+mc/know+how_20229473.html,"Verse 1
Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But so you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, cuz I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your tv, on your album, cassette and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?
I got know-how
Party people, I got know... How
I kick it just like this...
Verse 2
I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, cuz I'm that type of man
Cuz I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young mc, I like to rock mic well
Cuz when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader
Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it cuz I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?
I got know-how
Party people, I got know... How
Bust it!
Verse 3
Mc's I'll ruin, cuz I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavour's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice 'til the break of dawn
Cuz I'm tough like a bone, sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from a architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face, and then you hear my sound
Comin' atcha with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
Cuz I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got s** appeal
This is what I feel, and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?
I got know-how... And I'm chillin', never illin'

Young Mc,Madame Buttafly,/y/young+mc/madame+buttafly_21214355.html,"Chorus:

madame, madame, madame buttafly
I just cannot, cannot, cannot tell you why
you're so pleasing, pleasing, pleasing to my eye
cause you're butter, butter, butter and you're fly

now the first time ever I saw you face
it was love at first sight in a public place
see you moved through the room with such style and grace
and like a sweet piece of candy yes I wanted a taste
sex appeal in blue it was real and true
like Chaka Kahn said girl I feel for you
but what I had to do was just chill take my time
cause my main objective was to make you mine
divine and every synonym that's related
it's taken many years but I'm glad that we waited
debated on weither I should make the push
because this bird in a hen is worth ten in the bush
oh yes intellectual heterosexual 
have you coming back for more baby I bet you will
see what I mean when you look in my eyes
an I can tell you from the heart you're my madame buttafly

chorus

now madame let me tell you one thing for sure
when I first came across you I was immature
didn't see all the changes live would put me through
and I know you can realte cause you were young then too
I had a chance to flip but no I did not trip
stumbiling through meaningless relationships
baby I give you a tip and you should follow the trend
sometimes your best lovers comes from your best friends
do you remember those late night's on the phone
ain't nobody in the room but we're never alone
and I tell you some lady tried to tear me apart
the same time some punk tried to break your heart
and at that point it never really crossed my mind
that I wanted to be with you til the end of time
see I grew to love you that's precisly why
I can tell you from the heart you're my madame buttafly

chorus

now many days have passed sort of crazy fast
and I think that I have come out of my haze at last
put myself to task and underwent the test
to see if this was real or if I was just obsessed
but it's not obsession I've learned my lesson
and grew with you through a true progression
and sting wrote a song that occurred to me
that if you love somebody you should set them free
see you've been important to me in my life
and in the fairytale ending you would be my wife
but sometimes fairytales don't come true
and this won't if you don't feel the same way too
cause all the things you've done for me I can't measure
the days and nights memories that we treasure
the time we spend as friends brings me pleasure
so it makes no sense to get tense and bring pressure
so if you want a friend than it's fine with me
and baby if you want a lover you know where I'll be
but if I find another woman than I tell her why
I became a better man knowing madame buttafly

T Bone said man, can you beileve the women
I said naw as I got my 7-up with lemon

and this wasn't in my plans for the sad welfare
hopped in the 300 she was out like slick
damn why that lady gotta be so quick
so I headed back home with my feelings hurt
and was it bad cologne or mouth wash not workin'
then I hit the brake didn't know what to say
see the same 300 parked in my driveway
she said babe I'm sorry I hope you're not bitter
got a 9-1-1 call from my baby sitter
I'll make it up tommorrow when I take you shoppin'

Of disaster, cookin' up a potion

Now I could go slower, like the other guys do
But I ain't with it, that's what I'm tellin' you
I think it's kind of stupid, I think it's a disgrace
Instead of going slow they should be pickin' up the pace
Like this
Rock and roller
Coca Cola
Hot like soda
Rollin' like a boulder
Dancin', prancin', mic enhancin'
Just give me a chance, and girls, I'm romancin'
Understand it, underhanded
Leavin' you stranded, runnin' like a bandit
Yo, young money, in my hands you're putty
I'm pickin' up the pace and rockin' the mic
Yeah, buddy

[Chorus:]

Pick up the pace"
Young Mc,Principal's Office,/y/young+mc/principals+office_20297122.html,"Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing,
runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing,
and as I get to the office I can hardly speak,
cause it's the third late pass that I got this week,
so to my first class I run and don't walk,
all I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk,
and as I get to the room I hear the teacher say,
Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today,
I try to sit down so I can take some notes,
but I can't read what the kind next to me wrote,
and if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete,
as I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat,
so with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand,
and said, exscuse me but can I go to the bathroom, maam?
the teacher got upset, and she screamed out no,
it's off the principal's office you go,

Verse 2:
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria,
everybody rushes down to the cafeteria,
picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch,
and as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch,
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken,
the nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking,
I looked up at her with a smile on my face,
no joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place,
so I walked to school with ice on my lip,
the nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip,
my books are real heavey, I'm walking, I'm dragging,
ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it,
forget class, I'm a shoot some ball,
with the late pass I got no trouble at all,
but then the nurse walks up and says what do you know,
it's office to the prinicipal's office you go

recess

Verse 3:
passing notes is my favorite pass time,
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to,
to express my feelings,
give me a week B, and the girl' be dealing,
now one young lady was looking at me,
I said hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC,
but then the ball rang, and the teacher came in,
and that's when the game of passin notes would begin,
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine,
and I hoped that the two of us could spend some time,
she wrote me back and told me you're fine too,
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you,
so then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling,
words can't express the way that I was feeling,
then I though to myself, the sure way to get her,
is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter,
when I finished the note, it was ready to pass,
the teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class,
she read it word-by-word and line-by-line,
and everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine,
even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late,
for me to write another note 'cause there would be no date,
the teacher looked at me, and I said I know,
it's off to the principal's office I go,

yo, you think this is bad, wait til I get my report card"
Young Mc,Rollin',/y/young+mc/rollin_20306117.html,"Verse 1:

It's the bomb, 3-2-1 detanate & boom
Give me some room you better wait
For the kid to blow-up and take off like a rocket
Got something up my sleeve and something else in my pocket
Yeah, let me see you move out there
Through your hands in the air like you just don't care
Cause we rollin' here coming with the funk sound
And this ain't the government so, we won't shut down
First gear, make sure you got everything you need
Second gear, lean back as you pick up speed
Third gear, hit the highway you're starting to roll
And fourth gear, now you're looking for the cruise control
I got my home boys with me and we rollin' kinda tight
Get it washed in the day so it's shiny at night
And make you feel alright like when your pockets is swollen
So bust this as I does this and we rollin'

Chorus:

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
On the track and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
And there ain't no turnin' back
There's a party going on but it's hard to see
Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me
That's why we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
In the west and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
East coast past the test
There's a whole buncha people with a whole lotta soul
But, it don't get started till we start to roll

Verse 2:

Come one, come all we ain't looking for no static
You can roll low riff stick shift or automatic
It's an open ivitation to the whole nation
Yo the whole world all of civilization
Bob your head to the lyrics that I said
From an 18-wheeler down to a mo-ped
Even a kid can go or a bike or a trike
Can get with it as the people here me hit it on the mic
Now convoy came out twenty years ago
But I love that record bay don't you know
It doesn't matter who's up front or who's behind
Just as long as we rolling and we stay in line
So take your time as you get your boogie on
And let me bust my rhyme up until the break of dawn
Cause some try to this and look at this like it's stolen
Don't trip moneygrip, pink slip and we rollin'

Chorus:

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
On the track and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
And there ain't no turnin' back
There's a party going on but it's hard to see

That's why we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
In the west and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
East coast past the test
There's a whole buncha people with a whole lotta soul
But, it don't get started till we start to roll

Verse 3:

I got kicks, I got snares, I got tracks, I got beats,
I got more ryhmes than klans men got sheets
But I don't fight the quibble, bite or even nibble
Mess around and I have to break you down off the dribble
With a 1-2-3 take it to the bank
And before we get started put some gas in your tank
Cause we don't wanna make a pit-stop for a while
We gonna keep it going for a couple hundered miles
And when we do stop it's like a brotherhood thing
Ladies become queens the men become kings
So when you hit your neighborhood treat your neighbor good
Ain't no other flavor make you move but I bet this flavor could
So give me the microphone and let me finish up my mission
And tell your people you won't be home and that your on an expedition
Cause there's a bunch of hope in my heart that I'm holding
So join me set yourself free cause we rolling

Chorus:

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
On the track and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
And there ain't no turnin' back
There's a party going on but it's hard to see
Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me
That's why we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
In the west and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
East coast past the test
There's a whole buncha people with a whole lotta soul
But, it don't get started till we start to roll

Yeah we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
On the track and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
And there ain't no turnin' back
There's a party going on but it's hard to see
Because they didn't understand it till they rolled with me
That's why we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
In the west and we
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
East coast past the test
Yeah we roll and roll and roll with out no doubt
To the place for the nine sase baby and I'm out"
Young Mc,Stone Cold Buggin',/y/young+mc/stone+cold+buggin_21215149.html,"Now this rhyme right here has been dedicated,
To all rap fans that said that they hated,
The other MC's whose rhymes deviated,
'Cause this is real gold, it's not gold plated,
A few years ago these rhymes were created,
I was real proud and very elated,
It took a long time as I claculated,
But now I look back, I'm glad I waited,
At so many times I was so frustrated,
'Cause I couldn't finish up what I initiated,
I got mad and quite agitated,
And I remember rhymes that I had confiscated,
But one day, this girl, she perpetrated,
She was cute and quite educated,
We got married at once, an it was consummated,
But once it hit the books it was ill-fated,
She took me to court, to have it liligated,
A judge and a jury, that's how it operated,
The jury went away, and they deliberated,
Then she took all of my money, had my house renivated,
I felt so poor, and so humilated,
Because of a fight that I instigated,
But I got my money back, and I was jubilated,
'Cause the first court decision was never validated,
For weeks and weeks, I just celebrated,
Because the jury and judge recapitulated,
And all of my funds were never liquadated,
Yes I won, yes I dominated,
I saw another girl and my heart pulsated,
She just looked like that girl, I made it,
Would've have been part two of this rhyme that I've stated,
So I'll just go home and read my Sports Illustrated,"
Young Mc,That's The Way Love Goes,/y/young+mc/thats+the+way+love+goes_20843561.html,"(Yuh huh)
(Hey hey)

Okay, this is what I say
About when I was a young man
Back in the day
I'd see a young lady
Thinking she was fine
Then I'd try to step to her
Just to make her mine
Then, I proceed with a plan
Tellin' her how I could be her man

Lookin' in her eyes
While I tossed the bait
But she threw it right back in my face
Now I wanted this girl just to talk to me
But she wouldn't even take the time to walk to me
I got dissed
And that made me made
So I ran home just to tell my dad
I had a question, for my dear father
If girls treat you this bad, why bother?

He said you're learnin' somethin' everyone else knows
Just listen close son
'Cause that's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)

Now I remember
When I got older
The ladies got hotter
And my luck got colder
Girls tellin' me I won't go for that
Just because Young mc was not phat
Now by Phat, I don't mean overweight
I mean makin' crazy dollars
'Til they come in a crate
Ya see, I had myself a job
I worked as hard as I could
But to the young ladies
It was just no good

Wow, I guess you can't win for losin'
Havin' bad luck with the girls you're choosin'
I said to myself these dames are wack
But give me some time and I'm gonna get them back
But for now I manage my situation
I'm pickin' my women all across the nation
I'm havin' rough times with the girls I chose
But I'll have to deal, because yo
That's the way love goes
(Yuh hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
Break it down

[Bridge:]

Alright, I went out last night
Thinking I'd find a girl that would treat me right
I find myself chillin' at a discoteque
And the night went better than I could expect
One girl, down for the whole evenin'
For when I got there to when I was leaving
We went to her place and got a night cap
She said she was a model
I said, yo, I rap
We opened up a window to watch a full moon
But the night was much colder than the afternoon
She started to shiver
So I gave her my sweater
I said you alright?
She said, yeah much better
I held her close, she felt good in my arms
And I knew this girl would do me no harm
Thinkin' how the two of us could be as one
Then I fell asleep before my thought was done
Now I woke up, I was still in her place
In the mornin' sunlight I could see her face
Yo, I tried to get up, so I could start my day
But I nearly knocked over my breakfast tray
Now this girl went and made breakfast for me
When last night was the first time she saw me
You win some, you lose some, I suppose
Well I feel like a winner, yo
'Cause that's the way love goes

(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Ah yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(My my my my, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes

See ya!"
Young Mc,We Can Do This,/y/young+mc/we+can+do+this_20337401.html,"[ verse 1 ]
Aiyo, stop what you're doin, kid, here comes the tracks
From the heart to the head to the pen to the wax
And then to the store and the video channel
I'm not the Black Crows but I'm still 'hard to handle'
I don't wear sandals, I'd rather wear kicks
When I chill with the fellas and I watch the Knicks
See, I run things like Judge Wapner in the court
I'm like New York in the winter cause I take no shorts
Or no sports, but I know something too
Gimme the mic and 4 minutes and I show what I can do
Fu Man Chu was a famous oriental
And Katmandu made a funky instrumental
I don't get sentimental, even with a honey dip
My chorus line a rental cause I have a pink slip
And I won't flip as I make my way through this
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

[ chorus 4X ]
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this

[ verse 2 ]
I make papers like an ibm
Most of my friends clock the ends so I'm down with them
I don't need nobody tryin to sweat me or tryin to get me
Or tryin to soak me like a Tetley
Tea bag, to slap on a feedbag
Playin like Olive Oil but lookin more like the Sea Hag
So don't pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today
Here's the pun and then some, you can be on your way
See, I'm sick of all the beefin and the riffin
From the hype and the pipe and the cocaine sniffin
Walk around the way robotic
Thinkin you can get what you need to get from a narcotic
Girls ain't speakin, no, they're just freakin
Livin life fast like the last of the Mohicans
Think they know it all but they don't cause they clueless
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

[ chorus 4X ]

[ verse 3 ]
Yes, we can do this like Brutus, play it like a flutist
Or jump it like a nudist parachutist
I'm not new to this, but you already knew this
That's too many rhymes at one time, so yo, screw this
I be bonin like a skeleton, never wear Benetton
If I watch the base then I be watchin Terry Pendelton
Love to eat Jellitan to keep my body toner
And if [Name] wore some Nikes she woulda gone to Barcelona
So pick up the phone and call your friends
This is somethin that be bumpin from a Yugo to a Benz
I might make ends but I'm not in it for the money
You're not Lamont Sanford but you're still a 'big dummy'
I hang out with the honeys to pass the time
And I hang out with the homies to bust a rhyme
I draw the line at actin dumb and actin foolish
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this
(What, what, a say what?)

나는 잘 지내
끼니도 거르지 않았어
그저 시간이 멈춰있어
굳이 잊으려 하지도 않아 그래

네가 맞았어 죽을 것 같이 아팠지만
나름대로 잘 지내게 돼
허전함이 날 조금 괴롭히는 것만 빼면 말야
참 보고 싶어

길을 걸을 때
나를 감싸주던
따스했던 네 맘이 그리워
발을 맞추며 설레어하던
사랑했던 우리가 그리워
난 oh
그때가 그리워
참 보고 싶어

먹구름이 날 찾아와
어둡게 하고
괜찮던 맘을 괜시리 아프게 할 때면
너를 잊어야 할까 oh

길을 걸을 때
나를 감싸주던
따스했던 네 맘이 그리워
발을 맞추며 설레어하던
사랑했던 우리가 그리워
난 oh 그때가 그리워
참 보고 싶어

시들어 버린 꽃
찢겨져 버린 맘
부서져 버린 날
두고 떠나간다면

홀로 남겨진 나는
오늘도 애써 괜찮은 척 펑펑 울어야 해

길을 걸을 때
나를 감싸주던
따스했던 네 맘이 그리워
발을 맞추며 설레어하던
사랑했던 우리가 그리워

In an instant it burst open, and disappeared
When I think of you, my heart aches
I want to see you right now
But I can't fly

If I could turn into a comet
I would run through the sky and fly
No matter what tomorrow is like, these feelings are strong
So this comet will never break open

When I grumble about hating it when it rains
I even now remember what you would say
Stars will come out beautifully in the night sky, after the rain
When I think about that
I think that I can grow to love the rain too

If I could turn into a comet
I would she'd my overflowing light
Whenever I was sad, you would always look up to the night sky
And make it shine even more, so that I would smile

You're always alone, and fighting with something
But I can't be
At your side

If I could turn into a comet
I would run through the sky and fly
It will definitely reach you, in the light of this moment
Your moment shines, bringing the sky around
If I could turn into a comet
I would certainly be by your side, at any time"

We heard each other when we prayed in our own way
Wait up, wait for me
I've had enough of being young and free

Everybody has a mild crucifixion
I first saw you as my benediction
I am sorry you became my addiction
My game, my cold affliction

Did you see the fire brigade?
Steed heavy and filled with rage
Through the city, dissolve my fire
After dinner, I was burning with desire
They can never burn out my love for you

I heard you're used to makin' love on a Tuesday
He'd flip you over this way and that way
Everybody makes love in their own way
It's just a word, how'd you hurt yourself the other day?

Hold my hand and look if you see this
I'm not attractive but I know what it means
Edge of heaven is the edge of hell
That's what it felt like the bottom of a wishing well

Did you see the fire brigade?
Steed heavy and filled with rage
Through the city, dissolve my fire
After dinner, I was burning with desire

Did you see the fire brigade?
Nineteen, a girl of my age
Rings did wet her, the only one
I take away what I've become
They can never burn out my love for you"

Everybody hurts in ways
I can't relate

I can't relate to my predicament
Brother if your feeling low
Tell me one thing I should know of your situation
I could stand out in the hall
I could be your suicide policeman
Arrest your fall
When you fear to hit the ground

If you take another drag of that cigarette would it be so bad?
If your lungs are aching and your tongue's still shaking
I could be your suicide policeman"

This candle burns inside your mind
Trying to hold on to what is real
You well never know just how I feel

Trying to reach over, but the pain goes on
In the end I’ll see you, when our days are gone

I waited ‘til you came back home
You’ve been to Paris, but never Rome
Trying to forget what’s in the past
When I see your face it doesn’t last"

Reflects the way you feel inside
You run away, but you can’t hide"

Yadira Coradin,Amar De Tal Manera,/y/yadira+coradin/amar+de+tal+manera_20992253.html,"Cuanto cuesta cargar una cruz tan pesada,
Siendo inocente
Y vivir el rechazo aun de nuestra propia gente
Cuanto duele ser negado por nuestro amigo
De confianza
Y ser vendido por quien nos besa y nos abraza

Pero a pesar de todo permanecer callado y vertical
Sentir que el mundo espera una respuesta
Alzar la voz al cielo y pedir al padre
Perdón por los demás
Y expirar sin ofender ni hacer protesta

Amar de tal manera y dar la vida entera
Vivir en treinta y tres años
Siglos de amargura de esta humanidad
Amar de tal manera llevar la cruz a cuesta
Morir siendo inocente
Pagando con sangre nuestra culpabilidad

Amar de tal manera cumplir con una meta
Reconstruir al hombre sin cohibir su libertad
Cuanto duele venir a los tuyos y no ser recibido
Y solo por mostrar amor ser perseguido
Cuanto duele negarse así mismo
En pleno sufrimiento
Sentirse en la más cruda soledad
Y el más difícil momento"
Yadira Coradin,Auxíliate En Cristo,/y/yadira+coradin/auxliate+en+cristo_20992255.html,"Por el mundo iba caminando
Muchas veces riendo y otras llorando
Acongojado he vivido en malas experiencias
Mis mejillas se humedecen
A causa de mis lagrimas
De gemido se ha llenado mi corazón
Agobiado por este latente dolor

La vida esta llena de sufrimientos
Pero también de alegría
Si con Cristo aprendamos a vivir
Pues con gozo eterno debemos sonreíare
Auxíliate en Cristo, Refúgiate en Cristo
Abrígate en Cristo, Solo en Cristo

Amigo yo sé que la vida es dura
Que hay momentos que son de plena tortura
Perturbado y confuso al llegar la duda
Problemas y contiendas por doquier

Solo en Cristo debes socorrerte"

Pero su fin es realmente perdición
Hay caminos que cuestiona el intelecto
Porque en esencia están faltos de dirección
Hay caminos que son fáciles y cómodos
Para aquellos que se creen lo extraordinario
Hay caminos de muy limitado espacio
Para llevar el equipaje necesario

Yo soy el camino la verdad la vida
Y nadie viene al padre si no es por mí
Y el que este dispuesto a caminar conmigo
Que se niegue así mismo y me siga hasta el fin
Ancha es la puerta espacioso el camino
Que lleva a los hombres a un eterno sufrir
Angosta es la puerta estrecho el camino

Que aunque mucho cuesta, hace al hombre feliz
Hay caminos que llevan al ser humano
A sumergirse en un mar de confusión
Cuando tiene diferencias con su hermano
Y desconoce el gran misterio del perdón
Hay caminos que quebrantan nuestras almas
Porque carecen de cariño y comprensión
Pero entre todos los caminos, 
Solo hay uno que es divino
Y hoy nos dice soy la puerta y restauración"

Sin cesar en todo tiempo

Vamos pueblo hay que trabajar, 
La palabra debes llevar
Que tiemble el enemigo, Porque el pueblo de Dios
Se encuentra unido, 
Vamos pueblo hay que trabajar
La palabra debes llevar, Decir que Cristo salva
Y que El es medicina para el alma

Mi pueblo, hoy les demando la unión
Yo no vine a crear religiones, 
Yo no vine a señalar errores

Sin tener a Dios primero

Solo tienes que clamar, ayúdame

Calmar tu ansiedad, darte su amor
