One Piece,We Are!,/o/one+piece/we+are_21063565.html,"Wealth, fame, power.
Gold Roger the king of the pirates obtained this and everything else the
World had to offer. And his dying words drove countless souls to the seas.
“You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything I gathered
Together in one place. Now you just have to find it! ”
These words lured men to the grand line, pursuing dreams greater than they
Ever dared to imagine. This is the time known as the great pirate era.

Come on board and bring along,
All your hopes and dreams.
Together we will find everything
That we’re looking for.

One Piece

Compass left behind.
It’ll only slow us down.
Your heart will be your guide.
Raise the sails and take the helm.

That legendary place,
That the end of the map reveals
It’s only legendary,
Till someone proves it real.

Through it all,
Through all the troubled time,
Through the heartache
And through the pain.
Know that I
Will be there to stand by you,
Just like I know you’ll stand by me.

So come on board and bring along,
All your hopes and dreams.
Together we will find everything
That were looking for.
There is always room for you,
If you want to be my friend.

We are!
We are
On a cruise!

We are!"

I met a girl, I took her, end up to the balcony
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said okay, but she was worried what her friends will think

Can't contain it
She asked what should I do?

Than to be by your side
And let you grab so tight to me
As you whisper the words good night to me
Late at night

I love you, it's true
You mean everything to me
Words cannot explain how I feel
I must be dreaming when I'm awake

Your heart is fixing me
Without saying anything
My worries fall like rain
As these melodies run through your veins
Let me take you far - just hold onto me

And we'll take this world and you will see
That in the end, I'll be there for you

I love you, it's true
You mean everything to me
Words cannot explain how I feel
I must be dreaming when I'm awake

There's a sunshine floating
I see clearly now
So clearly now
There's so much more
That I hoped I'd ever find

I must be dreaming when I'm awake"

Shows much of what you were too
Slowly I realize 
I'll be fine without you
I gave you your chances
And you just put them aside
To find out too late
Of who I am inside

Show me yourself come show me who you are
These are the times we wish it never went this far
Hidden by your words oh god please let me see
How someone plays with feelings oh so carelessly
Give me your heart to come and be in one
Vulnerable I was please come and steal and run
Just as we laughed, kissed I looked deep in your eyes
To tell you how I felt, came one without reply

Echos is all I hear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running 
Let go is all I fear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
Let go

So your friends been telling me
You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friends been telling you
I'm not doing much better
Because I'm missing half of me

And being here without you
It's like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking round with just one shoe
I'm a half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm a half a heart without you

Forget all we said the night
No it doesn't even matter
Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for the lunch down by the river
We could really talk it through

And being here without
It's like I'm waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking round with just one shoe
I'm a half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm a half a heart without you

Half a heart without you
I'm a half a heart without you

Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is I got lost without you
And since then I've been waking up to

Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking round with just one shoe
I'm a half a heart without you

I'm half a man, at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm a half a heart without you

Without you, without you
Half a heart without you
Without you, without you
I'm half a heart without you"

I tried to beat you but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love

Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family, and
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed

I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm yours

Come on and open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours

So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicated
Cause our time is short
This is, this is, this is our fate, I'm yours!"

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enought to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

Oh the secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be

Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown
And I've lost my way back home
I think nobody knows no
I said nobody knows

Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn

Wide awake I'm waiting for you patiently
I want something more...

Light a flame and I will find you
Call for me I'll be beside you
You're the one I think about each day
Just tell me that you want me
Fall and I will run to catch you
Look to me and I'll provide you
With a light to guide you on your way
Just tell me that you want me

Tell me why can't you just tell me
How you feel are you that scared of hurting me?
I'm stronger than you know
Are we friends are something more than just another passing moment
I'm sure what you're looking for

Light a flame and I will find you
Call for me I'll be beside you
You're the one I think about each day

Fall and I will run to catch you
Look to me and I'll provide you
With a light to guide you on your way

When I met you in the rain
Remember what you told me
Are you feeling still the same
Did you tell the truth then
Or was it just another game
Tell me (x3)"

Standing with somebody
But he doesn't know what you like

All that I can see is you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything
Right now I can be your vice

Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off
Now we're taking it off tonight

How you light up every second of the day

You just shine like a beacon on the bay

And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this

And wake you up with all the words that I still haven’t said
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal

Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go

Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go
Where do broken hearts go

[Bridge: Harry Styles]
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid
Tell me now, tell me now 
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again

[Chorus:]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go

Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else
Tryna find you but I just don't know

(Louis Tomlinson)
Where do broken hearts go
Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go

Come on baby, cause I need you now

(Louis Tomlinson) 
Where do broken hearts go
Tell me cause I'm ten feet down

Where do broken hearts go
Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, cause I need you now

Where do broken hearts go
Where do broken hearts go
Where do broken hearts go
Where do broken hearts go"

Oscar Brand,A Clean Song,/o/oscar+brand/a+clean+song_20169458.html,"A clean song

There was a young sailor
Who looked through the glass,
And spied a fair mermaid
With scales on her island

Where seagulls
Fly over their nests
She combed the long hair
That hung over her shoulders

And caused her
To tickle and itch.
The sailor cried out
""There's a beautiful mermaid,""

A-sitting out
There on the rocks,
The crew came around
A-grabbing their glasses

And crowded four deep
To the rail,
All eager to share
In this fine piece of news.

Which the captain soon
Heard from the watch.
He tied down the wheel
And he reached for his crackers

And cheese which
He kept near the door.
In case he might someday
Encounter a mermaid.

He knew he must
Use all his wits
Crying ""Throw out a line.
We'll lasso her flippers. ""

And then we will
Certainly find
If mermaids are better
Before or be brave

My good fellows. ""
The captain then said.
""With fortune we'll break
Through her mermaiden head-

-ing to starboard
They tacked with dispatch.
And caught that fair mermaid
Just under her elbows

And hustled her
Down below decks,
And each took a turn
At her feminine setting

Her free at the end
Of the farce,
She splashed in the waves,
Falling flat on her after

A while one man
Noticed some scabs,
Soon they broke out with the pox
And the scratching

With fury,
Cursing with spleen,
This song may be dull
But it's certainly clean.

Oscar Brand,Bell Bottom Trousers,/o/oscar+brand/bell+bottom+trousers_20914192.html,"Singing Bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

There once was a waitress
Inthe Prince George Hotel
Her mistress was a lady
And her master was a swell
They knew she was a simple girl
And lately from the far
And so they watched her carefully
To heep her from all harm

Singing bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

First come the company
Of the Prince of Wales Huzzahs
They piled into the whorehouse
And they packed along the bars
Many a maid and mistree and a wife
Before them fell but they never made
The waitress from the Prince George Hotel

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

The Forty Second come marching into town
And with them come the compliment of
Rapists of renown
They busted every maidenhead that came
Within their spell but they never made
The waitress from the Prince George Hotel

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him Climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

One day there came a sailor an ordinary bloke
A bulgin at the trousers with a heart of solid oak
At sea without women for seven years or more
There wasn't any need to ask what he was looking for

Singing bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

He asked her for a cadlestick to light his way to bed
He asked her for a pillow to rest his weary head
And speaking very gently just as if he meant no harm
He asked her if she'd come to bed just so keep him warm

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

She lifted up the blanket and a moment there did lie
He was on her, he was in her in the twinkling of an eye
He was out again and in again and plowing up a storm
And the only word she said to him ""I hope you're keeping warm""

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

Then early in the morning the sailor he arose
Saying here's a two pound my dear for the damage I have caused
If you have a daughter, bounce her on your knee
If you have a son, send the bastard out to sea

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

Now she sits aside the dock a baby on her knee
Awaitimg for the sailing ships acomin home from sea
Awaiting for the jollytars and navy uniform
And all she wants to do my boys is keep the navy warm

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do"

Look at me reproachfully

The night is bitter without her
She calls, calls someone else

To taste the sweetness
Let me ask you with my eyes
And you answer with your love
And when we'll wake up
And this will wake up
I will remind you
That there is ONLY YOU for me


Chorus:]
ONLY YOU
You are the only one that breaks my heart
ONLY YOU
ONLY YOU
ONLY YOU
You are the only one that breaks my heart
ONLY YOU
ONLY YOU"

Lacrimile curgeau, erau atat de amare
Ma ruga sa n-o uit, simtea ca-i ultima vara
Iar eu ii spuneam asa iubire nu moare.
Nu stiam ca era ultima noapte
Cand puteam fi atat, atat de aproape
Imi amintesc doar vorbe desarte
Cand o priveam in ultima noapte.

Ultima privire mi-a ramas in amintire,
Ultima dezamagire nu o pot uita...

[Refren:]
Oriude ai fi, eu te voi gasi
Oriunde tu ai fi, eu te voi iubi
Oriunde-n noapte sau zi te voi gasi
In sinea mea cand voi iubi
Dulcea mea, amara mea... Te voi gasi

In fiece seara cand incerc sa adorm,
Plang si ascult piesa ei preferata,
Caci ma face s-o simt ata de aproape
Imi aminteste de noi se di ultima noapte
Ultimul sarut pe buzele reci
Il simt tremurand cu gura amara
Te sarut in vis nopti intregi
Ca pe o fantoma reala, din ultima vara

Ultima privire mi-a ramas in amintire
Ca un vis, ca o poveste disparuta in nori...

[Refren:]
Oriude ai fi, eu te voi gasi
Oriunde tu ai fi, eu te voi iubi
Oriunde-n noapte sau zi te voi gasi
In sinea mea cand voi iubi
Dulcea mea, amara mea... Te voi gasi

In noapte sau zi te voi gasi
Te voi iubi amara mea... Te voi gasi

Oriude ai fi, eu te voi gasi
Oriunde tu ai fi, eu te voi iubi

Te voi iubi in noapte, sub cerul plin de stele
Ca-n visuile mele, cand te voi gasi
Te voi strange-n brate, ca-n ultima noapte
Mereu voi fi aproape, cand te voi... Gasi...

[English translation:]

I've looked her in the eyes for the last time
Tears fell down, they were so bitter
She asked me not to forget, it felt like the last Summer
While I said something like: ""Love never dies"".
Didn't knew that it was the last night
When it was so, so near
I remember only this
When I saw her the last night
Last sight kept me remembering
Last disappointment that I won't forget.

Wherever you are I will find you
Wherever you are I will love you
Whenever, night or day I will find you
When will I love you to myself
My sweet one, my bitter one... I will find you...

Every evening when she tries to go to sleep
Cry and listen a piece of her preference
Because I make and I sense her so much closer
She reminds me of us and of our last night
The last kiss on cold lips
I sense her trembling with bitter mouth
I kiss you all night in a dream
That's the real ghost of the last Summer
Last sight kept me remembering
Like a dream, like a tale lost in clouds

Wherever you are I will find you
Wherever you are I will love you
Whenever, night or day I will find you
When will I love you to myself
My sweet one, my bitter one... I will find you...

At night or at day I will find you
I will love you my bitter one... I will find you...

Wherever you are I will find you
Wherever you are I will love you
Whenever, night or day I will find you
When will I love you to myself
My sweet one, my bitter one... I will find you...

I will love you at night under the starry sky
Like in a nice dream of mine I will find you
I will hug you tightly like the last night
I will always be near you
When I find... You."

As long as he needs me.

But when he's near me
I don't let on...

The love, I have to hide...
The hell! I've gone my pride
As long as he needs me.

He doesn't say the things he should.
He acts the way he thinks he should.
But all the same,
I'll play
This game
His way.

As long as he needs me...
I know where I must be.
I'll cling on steadfastly...
As long as he needs me.

As long as life is long...
I'll love him right or wrong,
And somehow, I'll be strong...
As long as he needs me.

If you are lonely
Then you will know...

When someone needs you,
You love them so.

I won't betray his trust...
Though people say I must.

As long as he needs me."

And I would never grow wings
Should there be a need to delay my certain sunset
Will there be a plan for me to try?

I must find a golden eagle
Resting somewhere on the ground
And ride him ever westward
Never see the sun go down

Sometimes the challenge presses hard upon my brow
And I know the time is now
But my wits are stiff and swollen
I pay my dues and limp a rough and rocky climb
As I try to buy some time
Before the dark has fallen

I am but a man
Can I stop encroaching shadows?
Would that I could keep the black away
I have a scheme to save the day

I will find a golden eagle
Resting somewhere on the ground
And ride him ever westward
Never see the sun go down
And I'll ride him for circles
A hundred million times
And then if I have finished
All the half-done chores that I'm now facing
I'll bring him on home"

And they all suppose what they want to suppose when they hear oom pah pah

Mr. Percy Snodgrass would often have the odd glass
But never when he thought anybody could see
Secretly he'd buy it, and drink it on the quiet
And dream he was an Earl with a girl on his knee

Oom pah pah, oom pah pah, everyone knows
What is the cause of his red shiny nose?
Could it be oom pah pah?

Pretty little Sally goes walking down the alley
Displays her pretty ankles to all of the men
They could see her garters, but not for free and gratis
An inch or two and then she knows when to say when
Oom pah pah, oom pah pah, that's how it goes
Oom pah pah, oom pah pah, everyone knows
Whether its hidden or whether it shows
It's the same oom pah pah

She was from the country, but now she's up a gumtree
She let a fellow beat her, and lead her along
What's the use of cryin', she made her bed to lie in
She's glad to bring a coin in, and join in this song
Oom pah pah, oom pah pah, that's how it goes
Oom pah pah, oom pah pah, everyone knows
She is no longer the same blushing rose
Ever since oom pah pah

Oliver,Reviewing The Situation,/o/oliver/reviewing+the+situation_20734306.html,"A man's got a heart, hasn't he?
Joking apart -- hasn't he?
And tho' I'd be the first one to say that I wasn't a saint...

I'm finding it hard to be really as black as they paint...

I'm reviewing the situation
Can a fellow be a villain all his life?
All the trials and tribulations!
Better settle down and get myself a wife.
And a wife would cook and sew for me,
And come for me, and go for me,
And go for me, and nag at me,
The fingers, she will wag at me.
The money whe will take from me.
A misery, she'll make for me...

... I think I'd better think it out again!

A wife you can keep, anyway
I'd rather sleep, anyway.
Left without anyone in the world,
And I'm starting from now
So ""how to win friends and to influence people""
--So how?

I'm reviewing the situation,
I must quickly look up ev'ryone I know.
Titled people -- with a station --
Who can help me make a real impressive show!
I will own a suite at Claridges,
And run a fleet of carriages,
And wave at all the duchesses
With friendliness, as much as is
Befitting of my new estate...

""Good morrow to you, magistrate!"" Oh gawd!

... I think I'd better think it out again.

So where shall I go -- somebody?
Who do I know? Nobody!
All my dearest companions
Have always been villains and thieves...
So at my time of life
I should start turning over new leaves... ?

I'm reviewing the situation.
If you want to eat -- you've got to earn a bob!
Is it such a humiliation
For a robber to perform an honest job?
So a job I'm getting, possibly,
I wonder who my boss'll be?
I wonder if he'll take to me... ?
What bonuses he'l make to me... ?
I'll start at eight and finish late,
At normal rate, and all... But wait!

... I think I'd better think it out again.

What happens when I'm seventy?
Must come a time... Seventy.
When you're old, and it's cold
And who cares if you live or you die,
Your one consolation's the money
You may have put by...

I'm reviewing the situation.
I'm a bad 'un and a bad 'un I shall stay!
You'll be seeing no transformation,
But it's wrong to be a rogue in ev'ry way.

I don't want nobody hurt for me,
Or made to do the dirt for me.
This rotten life is not for me.
It's getting far too hot for me.
Don't want no one to rob for me.
But who will find a job for me,
There is no in between for me
But who will change the scene for me?

... I think I'd better think it out again!

Mary's not the Mary of yesterday
She's gone to changin' her hair
And she laughs and she cries
And her life seems to be
Such a worried and jumbled affair

Well, I have talked to Mary
I've searched her eyes
And if you ask of Mary
I'll tell you why
It's Mary's time to run
Through the mad, through the sane,
Through the joy and the pain
'Til she finds her place in the sun

Young birds fly in early spring
They learn new songs to sing
And each song they know
Can help them to grow

Mary questions everything
She's ever known before
And want her as we may
She just won't listen anymore
But let her find a way
And soon'll come a glorious day
When everything's been sorted through
The streets will be reported
How people congregate to feel the love within her heart
And to listen to the music in her mind

Young birds fly in early spring
They learn new songs to sing
Young birds fly in early spring

They learn new songs to sing

Oscar Hammerstein,A Puzzlement,/o/oscar+hammerstein/a+puzzlement_20907430.html,"When I was a boy
World was better spot.
What was so was so, 
What was not was not.
Now I am a man; 
World have changed a lot.
Some things nearly so, 
Others nearly not.

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know.
Very often find confusion
In conclusion I concluded long ago
In my head are many facts T
Hat, as a student, I have studied to procure, 
In my head are many facts... 
Of which I wish I was more certain I was sure! 

[Spoken:] Is a puzzlement
What to tell growing son
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able, 
To respect his wives and love his concubines?
Shall I tell him everyone is like the other, 
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it-
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either! 

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew, 
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to.
Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmoveable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?... 
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?
Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me, 
Might they not protect me out of all I own?
Is a danger to be trusting one another, 
One will seldom want to do what other wishes; 
Bul unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth exceot fishes! 

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know.
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion he concluded long ago
And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know, 
Very quickly he will fight... 
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so! 
Oh-h-h-h-h-h Sometimes I think that people going mad! 
Ah-h-h-h-h-h! Sometimes I think that people not so bad! 
But no matter what I think I must go on living life.
As leader of my kingdom I must go forth, 
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Excetera, excetera, and so forth.
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way! 
Everyday I try to live another day. If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the
Way! 
Everyday I do my best for one-more day!

And the sky was streaked with white,
The soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill.

I remember this,
And I always will...
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill,
Looking on the same blue sea.
And I know Tom and I are a part of them all--
And they're all a part of Tom and me.

Hello young lovers, whoever you are,
I hope your troubles are few.
All my good wishes go with you tonight,
I've been in love like you.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,
Cling very close to each other tonight.
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels,
And to fly down the street in a trance.
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet,
And you meet--not really by chance.

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do,
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight,
I've had a love of my own.
I've had a love of my own, like yours-
I've had a love of my own.

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,
Be brave and faithful and true,

I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true
About how girls are put upon by men
I know I musn't fall into the pit
But when I'm with a feller
I ferget!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
I'm in a terrible fix
I always say 'come on, let's go'
Just when I oughta say 'nix'

When a person tries to kiss a girl
I know she oughta give his face a smack!
But as soon as someone kisses me
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!

I'm just a fool when lights are low
I cain't be prissy an' quaint
I ain't the type that can faint
How can I be what I ain't

Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty
And starts to talk purty
Whatcha gonna do?
Supposin that he says
Your lips are like cherries
Or roses or berries
Whatcha gonna do?

Supposin that he says
That yer sweeter than cream
And he's gotta have cream or die
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?
Spit in his eye?

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Cain't seem to say it at all
I hate to disserpoint a beau
When he is payin' a call!

Fer a while I act refined and cool
A settin on the velveteen setee
Then I think of that ol' golden rule
And do fer him what he would do fer me

I cain't resist a Romeo
In a sombero and chaps
Soon as I sit on their laps
Somethin' inside of me snaps
I cain't say no!

I'm just a girl who cain't say no
Kissin's my favorite food
With or without the mistletoe
I'm in a holiday mood!

Other girls are coy and hard to catch
But other girls ain't havin' any fun
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match
I have a funny feeling that I won

Though I can feel the undertoe
I never make a complaint

Whenever you want some heat
With every kind of comfort
Every house is all complete
You can walk to privies in the rain
And never wet your feet!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Yes sir!
They've gone about as fur as they can go

Everythin's up to date in Kansas City
They've gone about as fur as they can go
They've got a big theyater they call a burleeque
For fifty cents you can see a dandy show

Gals?

One of the gals was fat and pink and pretty
As round above as she was round below
I could swear that she was padded
From her shoulder to her heel
But latter in the second act
When she began to peel
She proved that everyhin' she had was absolutely real!
She went about as fur as she can go

Yes sir!
She went about as fur as she can go!"

Never gonna think that the man I lose
Is the only man among men!
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck
And I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do

Many a like lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone is bygone
Never have I asked an August sky
'Where has last July gone? '
Never have I wondered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!

Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly conjoled me
Somebody just as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me
Never have I wept into my tea
Over the deal someone doled me

Many a new day will dawn

Many a red sun will set
Many a blue moon will shine
Before I do!

Indeed I'm not your servant --
Although you give me less than servant's pay --
I'm a free and independent employe
[Pronounced ""employay""]... (sigh) employee.

Because I'm a woman
You think, like ev'ry woman
I have to be a slave or concubine.
You conceited, self-indulgent libertine!... (sigh)
Libertine! [pronounced ""liberteen""]

How I wished I called him that!
Right to his face! Libertine!
And while we're on the subject, sire,
There are certain goings on around this place
That I wish to tell you I do not admire:
I do not like polygamy
Or even moderate bigamy
I realize
That in your eyes
That clearly makes a prig o' me.

But I am from a civilized land called Wales!
Where men like you are locked in county jails!
In your pursuit of pleasure, you
Have mistresses who treasure you

They have no ken of other men
Beside whom they can measure you

A flock of sheep and you're the only ram
No wonder you're the wonder of Siam!

[Spoken] I'm rather glad I didn't say that...
Not with the women right there... And the children

[Singing] The children, the children,
I'll not forget the children,
No matter where I go I'll always see
Those little faces looking up at me...

At first, when I started to teach,
They were shy and remained out of reach,
But lately I've thought
One or two have been caught
By a word I have said
Or a sentence I've read
And I've heard an occasional question
That implied, at least, a suggestion
That the work I've been trying to do
Was beginning to show with a few...

That Prince Chululongkorn
Is very like his father.
He's stubborn-but inquistitive and smart...
I must leave this place before they break my heart
I must leave this place before they break my heart!

Goodness! I had no idea it was so late.

Shall It tell you what I think of you?
You're spoiled!
You're a conscientious worker
But your spoiled.
Giving credit where it's due
There is much I like in you
But it's also very true
That your spoiled!
Everybody's always bowing to the King
Everybody has to grovel to the King.
By your Buddha you are blessed
By your ladies you're caressed,
But the one who loves you best is the King.

All that bowing and kow-towing
To remind you of your royalty,
I find a most disgusting exhibition.
I wouldn't ask a Siamese cat
To demonstrate his loyalty
By taking this ridiculous position
How would you like it if you were a man
Playing the part of a toad.
Crawling around on your elbows and knees.
Eating the dust of the road!...

Toads! Toads! All of your people are toads!
Yes, Your Majesty;
No, Your Majesty.
Tell us how low to go, Your Majesty;
Make some more decrees, Your Majesty,
Don't let us up off out knees, Your Majesty.
Give us a kick, if you please Your Majesty
Give us a kick, if you would, Your Majesty
Oh, That was good, Your Majesty!"

Shall we fly
Shall we dance
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye
Or per chance, when the last little star has left the sky
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other

On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppen strutters
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The wheels are yellow, the upholstry's brown
The dashboard's genuine leather
With eisenglass curtains you can roll right down
In case there's a change in the weather

Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin that I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

Would you say the fringe was made of silk?
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell-for-leather
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along
The cows'll moo in the clover
The river will ripple out a whispered song
And whisper over and over
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever
And you'd never stop?
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

I can see the stars gettin' blurry
When we ride back home in the surrey
Ridin' slowly home on the surrey
With the fringe on top
I can feel the day gettin' older
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder
Till it falls kerplop

The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill
The moon is taking a header
And just when I'm thinking all the earth is still
A lark'll wake up in the meader

Hush, you bird. My baby's a sleepin'
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'
Whoa, you team and just keep a creepin'
At a slow clip clop
Don't you hurry little surrey

Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense

While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season

Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on deception of time all of Revelations
And recognize this mind on the reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mindstate

Them hooks like sellin dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serve ain't tastin right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it

Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe

And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While my close niggaz laugh at
The Southern slang, figure ways and mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrikan Bambaata, so you and your potnah
Gather your thoughts

Musical Interlude: Debra Killings

(Something's gotta change
Songs of laughter and happiness comes from teardrops to rain
When daring despair, fortune may lead in my day
And slight breezes of longing finally move my way
Like memories of yesterday...)

Verse Two: Big Boi

Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my potnahs they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speakin the truth not talkin that shit boi
I'm thinkin of checkin my traps and bustin my raps and throwin them craps
Seven-eleven is no convenience, you pumpin your gas, they're watchin yo' back
For the robbin crew, thinkin they robbin you, you must be cautious
To stand up on yo' game and pimpin these crows you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fuckin these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know of I wanna be playin but runnin up on me like you miss me
You catchin the wrong vibe, packin yo' shit and rollin yo' eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reachin out and touchin the wrong nigga
Don't expect me to be pimpin get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust
So keep that clean up out of your nose I said my piece and then I hush
As the candidate keeps flippin... niggaz dippin...

Musical Interlude

Verse Three: Andre, Big Boi

I really be love it we are gathered to life
So pissed to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on rangin
On fire like the Georgia mass choir we keep on sangin
Bringin our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be carin
I'm speakin about you playin with that phony stuff you sharin
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinkin you got it, but get it get it, but you ain't pimpin no bitches
Cause you flaw, in, fallin like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smokin good and sloppy head on highways
Friday's are tight but Saturday just makes it old
When tonight's are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old

Musical Interlude 2X
(""96 gonna be that year..."")

(Like memories of yesterday...)

*voice of Andre fades in*
See all them leaves must fall down, growin old

Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin old

And if I could, I will, I might, get blowed tonight

So I'ma get a call, from this broad
Run the game like she ain't ready
But still indeed, she on her knees, keepin thangs steady

So now she braggin, laggin behind
What questions she now be askin, so time is passin

So I suppose, it's goin down deep in yo' city

What can make a nigga wanna cut a beauty queen raw
Feeling every drip drop she can generate imitate seesaws
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp 
Simply 'cause he don't like love

OutKast,A Day In The Life Of Benjamin Andre,/o/outkast/a+day+in+the+life+of+benjamin+andre_20814967.html,"I met you in a club in Atlanta Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like yeah nigga right
But you gave me you number anyway
You were on the talcum powder

How's about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance

To get your pants was a mission impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasn't on the same page but in
The same book of life so I'd paged you when

I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool

Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be heaven or hell

The angelic nastiness you possessed
Made you by far the best therefore hard to tell
You'd dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in but I knew that you were wondering

Now are these niggaz in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?
Well, yes and no, yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow

Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled, “Ho”
Meanwhile the video starts playing bet college radio and a van
Packed full of niggaz with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear you know what I'm saying

But I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home

But when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news
That's life shit

Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got glock and a low jack

You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much ‘cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more follow me

Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind at the time, “Keep it real” was the phrase
Silly once said now but those were the days

When spring break and Dayton
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the south but that ain't a Kodak moment

On went myself and big boi
Well you knew him as Twan
That's right you were around before this shit begun
When Twan had a daughter and
Sort of was made to mature before the first tour

We hit the road like jack
Laughed and cried and drived it back with some Yak
Girls used to say, y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?
And I'd laughed and they just keep smiling

No, I'm from Atlanta baby, he from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down
Hey we got to go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes
She's playing tennis disturbing the tenants

15-love fit like glove
Description is like 15 doves
In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?

Enough about me how's about you?
How's the lil' kid? She was about 2 the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the 2nd album off on another note

Now, that note threw some niggaz in the hood off
But see I'd balled out and before I fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain is that fried egg I might need

New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread never primary concern

Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, ganstas, bitches, rastas
And macaroni niggaz imposter's

So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dredz with

Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching but I started liking this girl

Now you know her as Erykah on and on Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone why you
Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name

We're young in love, in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion had a son
By the name of Seven and he's five
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six

You do the arithmetic me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded me throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To one luxury transportation and a Marta card

Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard

You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims
You give it bump, you give it all your time
'Cause that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got

And that's as far as I got and where I wanted to go
Knowing the whole time that's all you could think about
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
You need a jump like you'll need in your rump to grow

And you change all the time so that rabbit that you
Thought about that whole summer
The next summer you didn't want that rabbit no more
You wanted something bigger and better
So the summer past and now the rabbit is old
Right, right, so now you want a Cadillac"

About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me makin better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we gon be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix, yeah
It was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now

But in my hood hood, they hollerin ghetto
Don't have no neighbors that hit the pipe but never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them niggaz dandy
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Trippin with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in mid-air and one is the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doin, I'm releasin anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm takin it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take her to the ho-jo, bitch
Just let you know, yeah

No more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac

I'd do it if I have to, bustin caps with this a heat and load it clip up
After clip
And after again, if I feel it
The glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See I be bustin caps like my amp be bustin speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi beats ghetto blastin
You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your gut with lead
>From my hollow clips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fuckin slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke

I'm strapped man & ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me & my nigga we roll together like Batman & Robin
We prayed together through hard times
And swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners
That we be bending in Volkswagens & Bonnevilles
Chevrolets and Coupe De Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain
Steering wheel for real you can go on chill out & still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch

Twice upon a time there was a boy who died twice
And lived happily ever after but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
& beauty parlors & baby bottles & bowling ball Impalas
& street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese & dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad need some hope
Like the words maybe, if, or probably more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin' gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught in appearance
It's Outkast Aquemini another Black experience Okay

The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles & the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat can't come near dat maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius & Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea
[Dre]
My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben. Welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out & tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since mc Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now & then
It's happenin' again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre y'all just gon' have to make amends

Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked to Goodie and the Dungen Crew
Lets say her name was suzy screw cuz she screwed alot
Makin a nigga hit that chonk, at ligitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin the hoe down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayetter, all the way don't to Decatur
Like jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a beamer 840
Its foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped 7 oclock its gonna cost me
Bit I still wanna cut her tho, maybe she had to work
Caught her at the mall, wearin a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck I wanted to s** the hoe up
She said ""lets hit the parkin lot so i can sick your duck""
I said ""cool I really wanted to cut you but this'll do,
I gotta pick up my daughter cuz my baby mamma beeped me too""
She said she understood then everythin was kosher
I gave her a lil will Cd and a fuckin poster
Its like that now
Its like that now
You better go get the hump up out your back now
Its about 4 5 cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now

Its like that now, its like that now

Now suzy skrew had a parna named sasha *(sasha)* thumper *(thumper)*
I remember her # like the summer
When her and suzy yea they thre a slumber --party
But you can not call it that cuz it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
3 in the mornin yawnin dancin under street lights
We chillin like a villian and a nigga feelin right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back starin at the stars above
*(awww man)* talkin bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said ""what you wanna be?"" she said ""alive"" *(hmm)*
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treatin her wrong
I kept on singin my song and hopin at a show
I would one day see her standin in the front row
But 2 weeks later she got found in the back of a school
W/a needle in her arm, baby 2 months due, Sasha Thumper
Its like that now
You better go get the hump up out your back now
Its about 4 5 cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now

Rainin cats and jackles all shackles disintegrate, to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue

All the weed smell like ammonia

Writin the raps and doin the beats to make this last recording

Oh hell there he go again talkin that shit
Bend corner's like I was a curve I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, nut I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out-you-scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box, and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Givin the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Then everybody let me hear ya say O-Yea-yer

Verse Two: Andre

Now, my oral demonstration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothin better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
Therefore, if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to be the hard regardless of the skintone
I really feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone
The alienators cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what a preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say...

Verse Three: Big Boi, Andre

Everyday I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinkin about the second album at the Dungeon shootin pool
Like E-S to the P-N, 'cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being fustrated
And now I'm sittin at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team
And like the daddy's wife you makin the coffee
You heard the A-T-L-iens
So back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speakin through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

Who want some? Don't come unprepared

Bet I be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain

In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini
Anything goes, be what you wanna be
Long as you know consequences
Are given for livin', the fence is
Too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm and Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for aids
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ah!

Should have held back, but you throwed a punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turn my back on my kids for them
Should have hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""

Moving like Floyd, coming straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pulling off a belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish 'fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border

OutKast,Babylon,/o/outkast/babylon_20103839.html,"I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocain powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bonified nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down
Cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard
While we rantin and ravin bout gats
Nigga they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at


Chorus:

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So i'm hopin, wishin, prayin
To keep my faith in you, in you


(yo, yo, yo in background)


I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused
'scuse me lord less for thinkin
But that's the way we was brought up
Sneakin to watch playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods
And laid with the squirrels
Durin P.E., we'd be
Exploring each others privates
Hunchin with all our clothes on
Until we felt excited then, aaaah
Oh now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere
If you know what i'm talkin bout
Now if two hearts done walk on out
And i see you on the next song
They call it horny
Because it's devilish
Now see we dead wrong


Chorus


People don't know the stress i'm dealing with day to day
Speakin about the feeling i'm possessing for Rene
Mopin around and wondering where she stay
Saw her last that she lay
Give it another day i say
But the lord he taketh away
Now give it back lawd
Cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas that owned the ligour store
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Livin up on this earth
Before a nigga like daddy was born
But they makin a scene
That my music and crime are a team
But i'm speakin the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean
My lyrics ain't clean

At home you get low down for me
Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah!

From alligator belts to patty melts I be that smoothest nigga

Man, my folkers up on that track, complimentin that wickedness
See one is for the money two is for my niggaz who jack
Niggaz ain't takin that shit no mo' they got big Benz and Cadillac
My gat is in my lap, so whatchu wanna be startin now?
I'm pissin up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave that cracker was foul

Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin yo ass so hey why don't you get yo' own
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin
Another nigga sorrow, I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin on like Goodie Mob cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hah better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth yo' life
I don't know about yours but if so you smokin pipes right

Verse Two: Andre, Big Boi

Deep in the dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like Cheers, but for years I used to burn em
Gettin deep in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum

Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on session cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that gettin a Benz is out of the question
The world is yellin Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
Gum and lint, to sum the shit, of I'm broke
Nothin but hope, so Big Boi, tell em what you toke

I'm travellin up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin of startin the ways to get that motherfucker krunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin and tokin them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggaz survive and the weak niggaz they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stop eatin that pig sty
Be activatin that Lo-Jack cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campalton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
Cause it's like this

Verse Three: Big Boi, Andre

I got these thoughts, similar to the ones that call in the wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin about a hundred miles
The world is fucked up how these niggaz be drivin drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the cards is not belong I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin spree, look at me, W-M-B
Backwards, takin you to the cha cha with these verses
Comin around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must be zest
You'll be needin a physical therapist, cause you can't fuck with this

While you sat down by the seashore thinkin about some seashells
I was around the corner from Clemson Hills thinkin about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packin my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem I'm just breakin the steerin column
I spot him, in the middle of the marta parkin lot
I'm hearin a voice in the back of my head yellin ""Andre stop!""
But do I stop, naw I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin down cause the folks wanna run up
Damn!!!

Tighter than fades I'm knowin my plays

Who that lookin over the shoulders of those writin dreams
Fiendin for the taste of menthol

Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode

Fresh in that tuxedo
Cumberbun with no suspenders
My torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your are-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this dick tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where i's...

To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perserverance and experience to get that cat!
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!

As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance
We look fine, right on time
As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play

[Sleepy:] Everybody's watching 'cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor
To the V. I. P. Where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me!! Throw your hands up if you feel me!!
'Cause we well designed and fine as wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny

So raise your hands to the sky 'cause we super fly

What if everything you ever knew or known was lost
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause your mind ain't free, constricting by the motherfuckin' boundaries
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro
Couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting life from bro
Brother, brohem

For show man, actin like a tadpole out of gonads, you now how catch the truth, hit the booth we makin more jams
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program, fuck the learning curve
We took our ramp to no man's land
Hello, is anybody home, is anybody givin dome
Serve me up I want some

Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jammin, shovin it up your monkey jam

Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jammin, shovin it up your monkey jam

[Verse 2:]
When I'm left alone I get to thinking to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until none's left
Like everything is alright clearly tight to death
I can see clearly now analyzing every step
Clearly you can feel me 'cause it's beating through your chest
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet
With no tint not yet, clearly I'm a vet
And not a vetinarian, but clearly pitbulls are the best
Like the O-you-T-K-S, cleary nigga you know the rest
And if you acting like you don't, cleary nigga you trying to test
Crystal clearly I confess, and I suggest, you clear the runway
'cause the ticket is a one-way, clearly back we won't be coming

Now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chucky Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer that soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?

Flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide!

Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm

I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was jo jo dancer
Come comet, come dasher, come prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'should we take that bullshit from them people? '
I'm makin 300 on my sat and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, officer friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years

Smokin that dang dang, makin mics swang
In my 2-8-0 z, nobody can see me
Cruisin down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him uncle sam
So bring dough to the goodie mo-b

Speakin of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass

Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga b-i-g b-o-i, that be me, ye

You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like... Yeah

So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit

Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the goodie mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, parkay.
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...

Like a bone lost deep inside

Not that type of guy

Oohwee you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
Remember kissin on Broadway you die

See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good

Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me (it meant so much to me)

Change it all you turned my spring to fall

Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped

The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room

Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take

Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds

And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin

Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle

Look out the window golly the sky is electric blue
Mamma Earth is dyin and cryin because of you
Rainin cats and jackles all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue
As to what the fuck is goin on
I'm on the telephone dialin the Dungeon
""Hello?"" This Dre bring the mp and the sp
Meet me at the center of the earth and travel carefully
Baby grab the baby cause baby it ain't much time
Mamma Earth is tossin and turnin and that's our sign
Omega nigga ifo's are landin in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head but if so you will catch on later
Play the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Rapin her heavenly body like a hoe, coochie so'
From niggaz constantly fuckin her never lovin her never showin
Appreciation bustin nuts in her face when they done

The sky is fallin nobody ballin they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs but the Hornets they won
Nigga we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing at the house
Cause I knew they'd try to ram me, but I'm stabbing
Makin a path on expressways, the best way I know how
Up in the sky, East-West, no clouds
Him comin now, fuck that money now, I ask my honey how
She feeling and is Jordan okay, yeah yeah she's chillin
We should be in the Dungeon shortly
Ain't nobody on they porch see
Approachin the final exit
I'm thinkin I see four horsies but I don't though
Nigga you won't know, until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia
But at the Dungeon I know they smokin
Writin the raps and doin the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distor-Tion *echoes*

Oh the first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met
And I knew that to you and into your life I had to get
Oh I felt light-headed at the touch of this strangers hand
An assault my defences systematically failed to withstand

Cause you came at a time
When the pursuit of one true love in which to fall
Was the be all and end all

[Chorus]
Love is only a feeling (drifting away)
When I'm in your arms I'll start believing (it's here to stay)
But love is only a feeling
Anyway

[Verse 2]
Oh the state of elation that this unison of hearts achieved
I had seen, I had touched, I had tasted and I truly believed
That the light of my life
Would tear a hole right through each cloud that scudded by
(Each cloud that scudded by)
Just to beam on you and I

[Chorus]
Love is only a feeling (drifting away)
When I'm in your arms I'll start believing (it's here to stay)
But love is only a feeling
Anyway, anyway

[Chorus with minor changes]
Love is only a feeling (drifting away)
And we gotta stop ourselves believing (it's here to stay)
Cause love is only a feeling

I call da crib they say ""Breeze you ain't know?""
I say ""What?"" ""Big Time got popped in his Benzo!""
I said ""Damn man I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em da money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in... naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who us a dime
It's the Great Hoe Round Up Yo' Money time
I got to HAVE MINE, then I'm OUTTA HERE
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry bout yo' potnah gettin caught like a lame
It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang""

(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Pointe police don't know a damn thang...)

Verse Two: Big Boi

Yeah, it won't be over
Check this out
Can you see what I be hearin talkin to spirits when I sleep
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Lookin up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit
Lookin to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Servin a warrant to a baby daddy, who do they come to quote?
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slippin
Leavin the keys off in the ignition, makin me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers tryin to stack for ninety-six
Buyin another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
Cause them niggaz at the corner sto' been lookin at me for too long
Starin like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin
Y'all don't know nothin bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dippin
It ain't over (why that, why that) till the bitch open her mouth up
And sang...

Verse Three: Big Gipp

Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talkin about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holdin bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you posed to get paid?
Niggaz walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumpin Lily, to lilypad dad
Lookin to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm droppin lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started to dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you? '

If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be havin' funds
The gold that I am wearin' is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and makin' my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never takin' care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen

Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissin' me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's livin' on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and Mayor, can I get a little backup

Please don't let them pussy muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up 'cuz they say we need dough

And pimpin' way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggaz try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rollin' thick like the Pillsbury Dough boy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka 'cuz you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene

You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through
I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning' to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws 'cuz I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant

Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be cappin' with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, yeah, like that, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L?

D. E. E. P., you wanna go D. E. E. P., I'll take ya D. E. E. P.

Check it out, uh
If in this life
I strive to please Him
In this day and night
I'm not always right
Even when I'm wrong
You should be afraid to anger Him
Cause you could be gone
Him don't need us
It's the other way round
Do you know what I'm talking about
When I say Him, clown?
You can't look at nobody
And say that's Him
Cause He's invisible
Yet visible, this is critical
Relying on our own abilities you lose
You need him
To help make your bumpy ride a cruise
Ask Magic about him
Or any strong believer
He's the quarterback
We the receivers
Catching blessings
Better than touchdowns
I seek him when
Niggas wanna buck me down
Him holds many holy titles
Him has many names
Him has many bibles
The devil can't deal with Him, uh
He tempted me but you see
I'm still with Him
Listen close
All brothers are men
Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him
If only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him
Rather have Him than money
I'm serious
He'll get you once you become curious
Lord, give me happy, long life
Real good s** with the wife
No traveling with bodyguards
It's just a real nigga godly entourage

Plus we tellers of the stories

My relationship with the God
Is kind of odd
The nigga the B-I-G won't part
Feeling the presence up in my heart
But never no chicken to the nigga
In on that style like that
Talking about the way the Lord
Be lifting these burdens up off my back
Better that I bust raps
The way that I cut that
Ho you couldn't
You trying too hard, you better find Him
I'm hoping you understood it
Could it be (What?)
The niggas around the way
Don't really be thinking about the consequences
Under the circumstances
Until you pinch them
Then a nigga be one to listen (Why?)
Cause you woke that ass up
Yoke that ass up
Proving the man in the sky
That holds that ass up
But it's over now
He cut off
Some niggas done broke you clean off
But got to get on your knees
And praise the only
Now your soul lost

Now, ok, now
The sun shines
The moon glows
The wind blows
The rain falls
But that aint all
My heart thumps on a rhythm y'all
And birds call
And two can fall madly in love
Oh, I think grow
They stop and stare in awe
Because we in his likeness
Hoping and praying that one-day
In the lab they might just
Stumble on some kind of way
To create human beings
So far
Human kind is the only thing I'm seeing

Focused on every word, and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine - Aquemini's

They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git somethin
Smoke out, 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sportin plats and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with Laface 'cause L. A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, gettin paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

Chorus:

[Big Gipp]
Alot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and dem spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm gettin paranoid and steady lookin for the time
It's eight in the mornin and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm diggin through the ash tray, hopin to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git somethin)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan Deville, steady bouncin,
Out the Pointe to Cambelton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the 'cover unit
Cause they known for jumpin out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm bustin out around the corner in my hog
Dippin from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'cause I have no time for bail. Fuck Clampett cops. Fuck Elgin Bail
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinkin that my city is the big lick for 96
94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, Outkast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo... My white owls are burnin kinda slow

Chorus:

[Dre]
Y'all tellin me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black runnin but crackers, so, why I got to register?
I thinkin of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta,
Y'all could not tell me nuthin, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start workin at the loadin dock
They layin my mama off of work, General Motors trippin
But I come home Bank like Hank, from lickin and dippin
Doin dumb shit, not knowin what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wastin my time in the school, I'd rather be shootin pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin hoes and wearin pimp fade
Instead of bein in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinkin about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I shoulda listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talkin yin-yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missin the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feelin broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-Ut-Kast
So get up off your ass

Well, except that on little time in Japan
I was just a kid
And that don't count right
Ahh thanks god. I knew you'd understand
WEll, I just feel likeI want to be honest with you
God, I just need a sweet bitch
You know I just need somebody not too...not too fast and not too slow
Cause I don't have it all my damn self
You know life aint easy
I just want some body by my side
to help smooth that thang out you know
At this point ,I'm not bein picky
She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass
Something well proportioned to her body
You know a nice lil' tail you know

Everyday on schedule
Ain't good use to cry over spilled lactose

Ain't nothing but
Four ways to keep four families paid
Oprah went from one line to
Telling y'all silly ass rock upstate

Yeah
So for one, girl
When I met you
I'ma say this
You's was fine
You traveled around the block
I let you drive the 'Lac one time
Maybe your hearts at stake

You act of fate

ZX-81, donkey kong, fucking high score
Push it to the limit, couldn't push it any more
Wanna be a fucking robot after smoking loads of draw

Bought a speak and spell, stuck it to my chest
And wraps a fucking ? onto my head and to my vest
Walking down the stret, my next door neighbours not impressed
I'm a robot and buying ten fags is my quest

Eggsie's gone too far, he thinks he's robocop
He's covered in tinfoil and he's got matching metal socks
We tried to sedate him but he fucking escaped
The man robot myth starts to escalate

He tries to sell himself standing in curries
But if the police turn up, he runs in a fucking hurry
He tries to plug himself in the mains with his nob
And when he's fully recharged he goes out on the rob

Half man, half machine
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

Half man, half machine
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

Being a robot in my digital domain
Enter my world, feel my pain
I'm not like other people you might see or you might know
I made love to a BBC micro
Touching on the disk drive, the monitor got hot
I knew from then, I was a motherfucking robot
Bill Gates from Microsoft, Stephen Hawking's voice
And fucking Lara Croft

I built a lab, secret in my loft
And built a special costume that would help me to jack off
I sat there in front of the screen
For many years, this had been my wet dream
Now I've reched it, I'm finally there
Like terminator being filmed in Aberdare
So alone, when people stop and stare
Like C3PO but with pubes and hair

Robot Love
Robot
Robotic Breakdancing
Robot

The doctors found a nut
They said he was an headcase
'cos he sticks silver and cans on his face

Sucking off antennas and trying to fuck the fridge
And burnt his pubic wig, with the high voltage

I am a robot
My prime directive is to's go to's the shops
And buy's ten fags
Do's you's compute?

He wants to buy ten fags, his destination is the shops
A tinfoil suit and a hat like Robocop
If your ask him then he'll do a bodypop
Like terminator, yeah he just won't stop

Put electical cable down through the eye of his cock
Plugged it in the wall and gave himself a big shock
The reason that he did it wasn't to give himself pain
Watching Terminator over again and again

Fuck man, get him, fucking restrain him man
get him fucking, fucking get him down man
inject him man, get him down
He's fucking nuts spa and he's losing it
Help me man, just get him fucking....

Half man, half machine
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

Half man, half machine

Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
I don't think y'all heard me!
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see
Cupid grabs the pistol (Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here!)
And he shoots straight for your heart
And when he won't miss you!
That's alright 'cause y'all won't believe in me anyways
But..

[Hook: Joi & ""Skreechy Peachy"" (Andre 3000)]
Ya won't believe in me, but you would fancy
Leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny!
(There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule reign supreme)

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th! (You got it!)
When Cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me!
There's no need to run!
So, Happy Valentine's Day (Hey!)
Every day the 14th!
I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what loves mean, well
Well, somebody tell me!
'Cuz they just don't believe in me!

Cupid will not be defeated!)

Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now I understand 'cause I use to be a bad boy in my day
I know you're trying to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Oooh ooh!

'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So, you're going to find out tonightttttttttt!

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I give up my heart, but
Never know because - shit, I never tell her!
Ask me about my feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'
And puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but
For the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Would I like for you to take me to Pluto?
I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse
Hans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, give me examples of why you're the shit!
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?

The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a dern country song
This whole country wrong

And cut your mic on
But you don't even write your songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python

I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda
You can call me a roller
Hold up

Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different - what's the real sense of it?
Uhhh Bling bling, I know
And did you know I'm the creator of the term
I just straightened the perm and let it sit too long, they just makin it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle

Now that I've got your undivided attention I'm gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourths of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees
Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird

(Verse 3: Big Boi)
(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre. to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts
Now could we make a a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin been jammin for you crab and rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new cast,
Just ain't the same gang of nerds slanndering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waitin

(Chorus)

(Verse 4:Snoop Dogg)
I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare, share take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they gotcha but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence - is that right?
But you love the dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin up, showin up, blowin up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

(Andre 3000)
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin and make new shit

(Snoop Dogg)
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame -
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang"

It goes on and on and on like that
Goin out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'Lac
Ah suki suki
All day and day any day every damn day
I be thinkin about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm servin hemp
I never even smoke that crumba crap but yo, I'm dope
But doper than a junky or a pooky 'cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claimin true
Two weeks born in College Park and the things I used to do
Around atl, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club niggaz, Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib, dank and dranks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make

But ain't no game when they be callin your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's bustin out the seems, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light(Hootie Hoo)
Communication device off when I writes
Should I answer the call, yes, I'm mackin 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, fallin down like niggaz in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talkin 'bout her period late, guess what I did
Click
Naw, it couldn't be me. Not me

Chorus(2X)

Big Boi:
Uh, well you know we gettin blizzard 'cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggaz can't cope with it

>From the streets of atl to the slums of College Park
So got on Martino, it's Outkast for the 94 era
You heard the player's call, we takin it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel
And you may go to hell

Dre:
Set sail with a nigga from atl, Southwest that is
It's that Southern ses in your chest that is
One mo' gen for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will make you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some bo-los, you can throw those

Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams

You livin for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol
I said ""oh hell naw!"" but yet it's that too
You can't discrimi-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope, saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it?  Whoo!
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision.. Is,
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then 1 day it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds it's way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life
And that's life and that's life

Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin uh..
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fine
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look s***, but even if she was so what
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your +Speakerboxxx+

I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes

The braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over
With this * off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed
Under the arm rest, under the leather
Thinkin' of startin ways

Never pay no * taxes
Takin a chunk up out my check
And makin my rhymes just look like practice
Buyin' clothing, range roving
With my folks
Don't speak about the dirty south
My crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow
Because they envy
They talkin bout they * my *
And that they could have been me
You lookin to be that butterfly
Without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right
Cause you gon make it
I swear my
Or collapse 1
Falling a victim to your greed boy
Your looking to be big willie
But ou're still a seed boy
The information in my skull
Be pokin' some of y'all on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence
They got * breakin' boulders
For quick money

Bridge

Struggle is just a part of my day
Many obstachave been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we're here in the 1st place
They can't believe because they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can it wait 4 nobody 2 come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let him do the rest
You've got your life, you've got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let him do the rest
You've got your life, you've got your health
So quit procrastinating

Who said good folks is not supposed to die

United states giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure 4 A. I. D. S., but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not 2 make no dough
To make a differencefo' this * up and blow

I pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleeding
From crawling, got these * thinkin they ballin'

And, you know, I feel as if, you know, the rappers and the musicians and whatnot get into acting,  you know, you know as, their disrespecting the craft and I feel as if, you know, their taking jobs from us, from us trained actors and I feel as if they should just leave it to the pros.

Man, shut your ass up. You tellin' me that if you made a song and it was jammin', we all supposed to listen to it? Man, equal oppertunity, man, let them do their thing. And, why you talkin' like that? Ain't you from Band Camp? Anyway, I heard that Idlewild movie comes out friday. I'm gonna be there on friday. I'll be fuckin' trying to get some work. Thank you, densail or somebody.. Haha

Did I just hear y'all say that new outkast movie comes out friday? Hell yeah, I'm gonna be there! And, who this fuck is anyway? Who's he supposed to be? He's about to get fuckin' jumped on.

A-town, late nights
I'm off in 112, posted up as usual downstairs
With a couple of clydesdales
Sippin zippindale
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale
Blaze up, hate to ball and bail
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up
And leave her man, make up
And cheat again, caked her
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend
Come on

Said I love my man, man man man
We got our ups and downs and I'll get lonely and, and and and
Wanna move move to someone who might understand, stand stand stand
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland...wonderland...wanderin'
Wonderin'...if she can home with guilt on her mind
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine
After they do better, better tell her, 'fo another fella
Better, get, sit sit, shit shit, spit spit, hit hit

So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin crickets and crows bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talkin like that man fuck them niggaz I'm goin off
And comin right back like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em, down from hitchikin and bitin niggaz
Until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin around my crew lookin Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught
Like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin, I hate thinkin that these the future mommas
Of our chillun, they fuckin a different nigga every time
They get the feelin to, I'm willin to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my senorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real Jazzy Belle...

Verse Two: Big Boi

See what if you was a playa real playa not no slouch
Havin the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smokin an ounce of weed yeah every single day was personal Freaknik
Freakin these hoes in Polo clothes life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, lookin into your watch I see
You weapon and it's depressin, they're diggin up in your thighs
Leavin deposits keep your closets open not your boots and drawers
Hopin to get you sprung like bell-bottoms, steadily callin me Antwan
Cause you thinkin that you my lady bitch don't play me cause you're chanky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, you runnin that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo' name
It's a shame, you crackin em up and fuckin a nigga like Tupac up
I'm leavin these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me see
I gotta be feedin my daughter, teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause you'll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and Dumber, yeah you know what I'm sayin?

Verse Three: Andre, Big Boi

One two, yessss, ummkay, check this out right here now
See me ain't no good, in the black on black 'Llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Strap stickin together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog eat dog world, kitty cats be scratchin on my
Furry coat to curl, up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl, cause most of the girls that we was likin
In high school, now they dykein *laughin*

Havin no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hangin around the crew lookin for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be, askin me all about mine

Verse 1:
Well here? S a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation? S ugly, like? In Living Color? S Wanda (word up!)
Well everybody play dumb, but there? S some that succumb
And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle that? S
In my path
Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk
You took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a
Designer bag
Now that? S ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer thing in
Life right?
Your dignity, your only sacrifice, slim as your chances of being
Somebody? S wife
They seeing ya but, booty naked every  night, ain? T  nothing
Right or wrong.

Verse 2:
Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda
Now she? S out of a job, she would slob on a knob
For a little les than a yard, a massage you could drill her like
A sarge
She would charge and rob
Pick trough yo? Pockets
She got the tricks watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the night stand fuckin? With this white man
She met in a little red Corvette paid for s**
Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that
Fashion
Fast and furiously, there was a knock on the sliding glass door
(bitch, it? S me!)
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped now I? M getting in your shit!!!!!!

Intergalactic tracks, I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for Scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen to what I'm tryin' to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talkin about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy, pass the boombastic
Daphne said, ""Don't do that""
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
So I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow

Shaggy, wake up, we've been had
Our Scooby snacks, they got the whole stash
He said, ""Who who, I don't have a clue""
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scooby-Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'mma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash, tryin' to get our stash back
Roundin' up suspects, collectin' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby-Doo when you need 'em
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

In the land of a million drums

Break it down, break it down baby, 'til the floor jumps off the ground
Oh break it down, lookin' over yonder 'til the walls come tumblin' down

Oh, break it down, break it down baby, ''cause I want y'all all to know

You know the story, she bit the hook line the follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow

And the ground just dry

And not through the peephole of mortality

Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to bust how you feel
Pack the steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe

Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin poor righteous teachers

Thought provoking spoken
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see
Visions from me
At twenty three making us free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome oh hum hum
Go get my gun load up for fun and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M. L. K. To cascade
I know it's through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides,
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now it's quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every niggaare sellin', but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
In fair times so writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took,
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

Verse 2:

They swan divin'
Fit they name be thrashing an album
Go-kart rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost, dog paddling, back stroking, what done happened?
Be rhymin' catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
Wrong ingredients,
Maybe too much herbs and spices,
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal, look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business giving niggers inches so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes,
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours,
Process momma moping like jerry
Meanwhile, fairies of the street tinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to obtain another level of con-science
Only to test, to poke and see
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
??? With a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But a missle will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
I wish I never did what I did now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the court showing paper thin
Got you niggers where they want you again,
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

[Chorus:]

Verse 4:

Everybody's a player, rubbin them kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, niggaare it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you s***?
Then why you fucking all them niggers letting them all up in your guts
But see that aids I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall

Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealin' with ain't nutty but the study goin' unvail

TO whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenumptual is void

Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An immpossible feat and I repeat

They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think that they gon get warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the north pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me; he's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's ok just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, ya'll crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you make it right

Slam yo' back to the curve bruh, like sanitation worker

Expect the worse but now I'm pacin

Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe

Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour

Wine me and dine me
Bring those platinum rings

""Word, best to feel me, boy
It's about to come off, it's about to come off
Whether you love it or you hate it
Ain't none of this drug game can stop my flow""

My malignant melody's a felony, at least that's what they tellin' me
Belle and three deep in hell and Tree
Sellin' my new T-A-P-E
For paper, D- King get real violent with terminators
Determined haters gettin' wiped out by exterminators
In German 'Gators, fully prepared for the perpetrators
They try to fade us- My style is layed down in perfect layers
If adgetated, then my melody moves wildly
Niggas that doubt me don't know nothin' about me
Without me, rap would be weak wit'out a beat,
But it got me, so it's unique and kinda sweet
Yet you slot me, so I take pride in your demise
Seek to stop me and I must rise with my a-llies
At the top, man- Hard to maintain but I got game
And it's plain to see without pain and forever reign
You losers' not me, so I recommend that you don't begin
'cause to stop me is takin' the strength of ten men

[King Midas

[King Midas]
See, when I see the microphone, I'm instantly turnin'
Into a fire-breathin' M. C., internally burnin'
Never learnin' to watch your manners'll get 'cha smacked in the mouth
Here's a present, I'm gon' have Santa come and blow up ya house
Just from a clout, I'm gon' have to bless the skill of a legend
Goin' in so many directions, you don't know where I'm headin'
Now, I ain't bettin' but I believe I'm one of the best
Kinda upsettin' how I battle when I'm put to the test
Nevertheless, ladies' obsessed, now I confess that I'm fresh
Could afford to ball for y'all a little bit and still have alot left
What about death? I ain't afraid but, shit, I don't wanna die
For myself- So when you try to slain me, bullets gon' fly
'til ain't nothin' left- It's self explanitory how I'ma ride
For my respect, I get wreck- Man, I can't go deny

Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the day when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out or even pull your fuking head
To make his whole crew believers you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like king shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be sayin Lakewood
You better be strapped 'cause them niggaz over there just ain't good
Just being a hustla, serving up all your customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggaz be wanting drinks and shit from the fuking sto', yo
But that's aight, tho', 'cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that jive

[Chorus:]
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime (2x)

Hey 'Dre, Let 'em know what's up

(Andre)
I've been slipping, slowly but surely
Niggaz I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggaz got to servin when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how can I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hangin wit the P. A. Niggaz, ain't no gankin us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, yo, niggaz gonna always know
Dope is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggaz don't comprehend that it be deeper that Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fuked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm flinging it from the south
Talk bad about the A town, I'll bust you in your fuking mouth

Of the night and somebody in yo room.
Yo heart starts beating so fast
You can hear it pumping.
The veins in yo temple pulsate as you stare at the intruder.
Then after a few minutes you realize he ain't moving.
So finally you let 'em hang and
Turn on the light and
The killer turns into
Yo coat throwed over the chair.

The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning and two or
Three motherfuckers cross the street.
Yo senses heighten, reflexes
Sharpen vision's enhanced adrenaline flows as they rush across the
Street you leave the print from the heater grip in yo palm then yo heart
Rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just
Goin' to the store.

Many of us mistake Phobia for true fear. Whereas fear is a gift from
God to be used for self-preservation. Phobia are obstacles strategically
Placed in society by opposers of positive existence. Through
Stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification they'll
Turn your fear switch to a permanent on. We can change this by changing
The small truth within' the lie. Death is a small price to pay for
Respect. Death is a small price to pay for respect. You know who it is.
You know what it is. Peace out.

Verse 1: Andre

In these troublin' times
A nigga like me be thinkin' of rhymes
That makes my quarters nickels
Plus my pennies and my dimes stack
Don't be lookin' for trouble it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes Sir guess the light is getting dim
At the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
I never thought thirty spokes
Could attract too much attention
I gotta protect my own therefore
I'm heated just like a kitchen
Full of pots and pan Glocks in hand
Shots rung out like ringin' the bells
And then that sucker nigga ran
Damn, I never thought that it
Would come to this conclusion
The folks that throwed us
On them boats should be the one's I'm losin'
But naw we don't see it that way
In '94 this is the real no time for play play
Betta believe the playas on the loot
Need to get they head screwed on tight
When it really get down to the nitty grit
Who gone fight pipe down
'cause ain't no better time
To crank it up than right now
We gots to see rump crum down here
And I don't hear nobody disagreein'
Orga-no-i-z-e-Mr. D. J. And me and Big Boi

Chorus

So don't spend yo whole life
Livin' it for the white
You got a 9 to 5 and now
You choose to live it right
You takin' yo ass to the Army
'cause you scared of Revolution
I'm writing everyday to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way that stress is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday
So play your fuckin' job
Educated and black I will resort to rob

Verse 2: Big Boi

See why in the muthafuck
Do niggas be acting up
Do they want me to grab my shit
And lettin' that pistol go ruck
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff
Havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout
That's not what it's about
See yes indeed I got that weed
Like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces
That nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out
And then I bounces
I got that lyrical flow to make
A hoe pull up her skirt
I drunk that herk & jerk boi
Thinkin' of future things to work on
I got my fuck on and
Then I took my clothes off
Washed my nuts up in the sink
And then I got more nuts off
Cough it's time to be out
See bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp
I'm dirtier than the shit
On the back of a shrimp
Now ain't that foul
The way a nigga can spit that style
My nigga I spit it I did it
Now suckas need to quit it
'Cause it's real

Chorus

Verse 3: Big Boi

Well it's that nigga that be
Wearing Nautica V-necks
And Polo sweats
I got some food up in yo thoughts
And that cess off in yo chest
See livin' up in the dungeon
Where we stayed in '93
See that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I
That be me
And when we rock it
Niggas be jocking just like?
You snitch I fucked yo bitch
See and my niggas G'd that hoe
On the South side of Camelton Road
No slippin' in this pimpin'
She was just a horny toad
See I'm a mystery like the
Killing of Michael Jordan's father
Was steadily packin' the hoes
When I worked at Foot Locker
I'm gettin' higher than learning
Smokin' 'em up and then burning
East Point is on the map
And now my clothes is hurtin'

Andre:

Now shit done got boring ass
Molin' when excess closed down
But niggaz kept sewin' shearin'
Stirrin' bein' the pharm assistant that missed
Of the folks but some people
Tend to joke about this
But it's really dead spirits
You can bet my lyrics
Now ya wonder why that we
Done stopped and got serious
Wantin' to know where I'm from
And where I need to be
Now that I know comfortable
Living give me meat
Can I get back ya wonder why we split back
Lure us into pitch black dark
But I sit back and spark
Another one to leave ya discombobulated
In that dust livin' in a world
Where in nobody do you trust
Then hush never became a major trade
But us in major trouble
'cause we made a too many mistakes
Off in the past
Thinkin' you could make it this world
And now we laugh 'cause it's all faults (Chorus starts here)
Either way ya go ya gotta pay the cost of the mic wind

Chorus repeat (last line is changed to:
I'm hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob nigga yeah

Takin' you a li'l higher knowwhati'msayin' when you learnin' when you
Burnin' up that smoke so you can choke on my quotes
And get my * down yo throat you just don't understand
Youknowwhati'msayin' Organized Noize for '95 bitch!"

And don't nobody wanna feel like that, no
Monkeys on my back crawl
And watch them all fall
Go fall, look out

Nobody wanted to dance
When I had a lot of time on my hands
Now I got a lot of hands on my time
And everybody wanna be a friend of mine
Whoa whoa, I wouldn't mind a friend

Cops in the street keep ya feet on the throttle
Selling what ya got in a Ford A-model
Yellin' ""Go, PJ go!""

You can be hit now, yeah (soon as you turn around)

You won't find God no, might meet Him first, aw
Oh God, look out

Nobody wanted to leave
House so packed that we couldn't even breathe
And ain't no better place to fall in love
Angel sent from Heaven above
Swing down and come change your life
You might make a baby, might meet your wife

""Deep down South there's a 'lil old place
Them Idlewild cats, man, they don't play
Don't make me send a telegram to Rooster, he'll shoot ya. ""

Cuff her soon, if she choose, she gon' walk away from you

And we gon' stay hustlin on that block until we caught
And we gon' stay showin off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin out the stores with heavy bags
Cause we poppin tags, pimpin we be poppin tags!

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
We arose, let's go
""So Fresh So Clean"" like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin tags
Leavin the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin bout hoes and dough again
Yup! -- Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin, about the dough I spend
But I was holdin in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin
Twinkies shinin, pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know Hov' be goin to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin tags

[Chorus:]

[Verse Two: Twista]
It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin and pickin up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes I remember havin rocks in the hall
On the glimmer with the glock by the ball
Servin up a jab and workin security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
To the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a console full of ammunition and funds
Mink Roc-a-Wear and some guns
Petty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax
And Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: Killer Mike]
Uh-huh, whattup? Tell you somethin bout me..
My throwback game is whiffle wicked
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin Nu*Wear fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin
Keepin coke in the kitchen
Keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Michelin S
I, travellin, handlin with a forty-five cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin hot through your motherfuckin iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that
Talk 'til the paper fat
I rock somethin, roll chief +Sacks+ like Daddy Fat!

[Chorus:]

[Verse Four: Big Boi]
Pop tires in reverse, you'll be needin a nurse
Leave you layin on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox thinkin a check but the mail's run short
No more md, dd, ld
That means Movie Date, Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please
My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin, bags in the trunk full of feo Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin mad cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a little bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin like a pitfall bull-pit
Dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin
A miracle happenin
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin and rhymin and smabbin
Pop that tag on some of this game
Holla-tic, swallow and keep the change

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to dna, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existance
We livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages

But Ephesians 6: 12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
And brothers that wax fat an dforget all about the struggle
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover

There is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
You'll get used to singin if only for one night
You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
Stop playin Go Fish, but not below this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting

For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga 'cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck gon' be the first nigga we attack
Don't want that but it comes though
Most of the time you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that
Slow dough we worked for everything we have
And gon' stick up for each other like we
Brothers from another mother
Kinda like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers and never the
Nut huggin' punk motherfuckers"

Everybody move to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us
We the type of people make the club get crunk

Verse 1:(Big Boi)
Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbing every city then we headed to that bat cave
A-T-L, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you sounding silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doing doughnuts round you suckas like then circles around titties
Damn we the committee gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said baby boy you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past your ass'll be a has what
That's one to live by or either that one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't comin with it
But I'm witcha you cause you probably goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin but examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully, it's sad and it's costly, but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit creek it's weak is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down
All yawl can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then...

Yeah, now dig this, even though
You'd need a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see that roses really smell like boo-boo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo

Caroline, see she's the reason for the word bitch
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash, crash
Into a ditch, just playing
She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said ""Shorty, would you call me?"" She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Tricking off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we doBetter come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way, no way, no wayn't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

Better come back down to Mars

Never know who the hater, niggaz cater to your ego
I'm sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco.. Vision
Caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico.. DeBarge

Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lawd
One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party women jump for joy
But all the wild niggaz scheamin they gon' jump the boy

Grow hydro, then bag it up yo

Slow take time grow eight, react nine blow

Then glide yo, flippin the page, I go
Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow

Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes

Had determination and graduated

Big boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches

Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening (hook)

Reminiscent of Charles a li'l disco-tech
Nestled in the ghettoes of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia a li'l spot where
Young men & young women go to experience
They first li'l taste of the nightlife
Me? Well I've never been there, well perhaps once
But I was so engulfed in the Old ""E""
I never made it to the door you speak of hard core
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems
And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set it Off,"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it
""Hey hey look baby they playin' our song""
And the crowd goes wild as if
Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M.
And three niggas just don' got hauled

I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on smooth like a hot comb
On nappy ass hair
I walked up on her & was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes [ya dig]
One moment you frequent the booty clubs &
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations [that is]
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped

Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of please we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love

Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

Verse One: Slick Rick

Outkast and Slick, the answer is in it
Hon you need to get your ass on the dancefloor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots
La-Di-Da-Di, mmmmm we like to party
Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, ""Somebody turned the lights off""
Immense rep, poppin out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please
Got the kid like ""watch your melon""

Remember the time I laid them down to Teenage Love now see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin and jivin was never the style

Spittin that King shit, you cling shit

New gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction cause I need it, hip-hop is that I be that
Like a junkie showin your monkey, cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it, fold you up like you was pleated

Won't somebody tell me

1 - I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel
Like there's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

[T-Boz]
What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all

[Chilli]
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me

Repeat 1

[Left Eye]
A-yo, if we could all agree
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And distress on my back with them cats
They be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow, didn't you know?
First you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's 'cuz I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon
As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension

Repeat 1"

Forty percent confusion (confusion)

You know it's that high guy, from east P. I.
Spittin the realness of reality, you mad at me

You want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?
I refuse to play so I'm gon' speak that southern good shit
That harder than yo' hood shit, lil' shit
That make y'all niggaz think about the trigger
Before you pull it, on liquor stores and banks
Them folks got more than enough bullets to put that ass
Off in the slang, don't claim no gang, we the niggaz
That did that ""ain't no thang but a chicken wang""
But still though, how you gonna play a nigga like dildo

Give me a drug so I can make seven babies
Pump my breasts up, can you suck the fat up

A black or a blue one

Up in the pulpit

Tell his mamma not to cry

Oooh, oooh! Somebody done told you you wrong!

[Verse 1:] Ok, I start out all alone
'Cause my baby mama left me
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned!
Now there's nobody at home
A moving vehicle took my family
Well it's some real shit and I'm lving it through this song!
I woke up very upset!
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me!
In the wind, she was my friend
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win!
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
[Hook:] Throw your neck out! Throw your back out! [4x]

[Verse 2:] Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Or that p-you-s-s uss! I said uss!
Smashed, pushed to the limit! Smash and turned it timid!
Throw a parrty? Not hardly!! I'm trying to stay up outta that womb!!
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked hell
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold!
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most part you fuss, fight, fart!
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
[Hook:]
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign!

[Verse 3:] K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
My daughter don't want me at her pta meetings
I think he's pissed!
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is coming back
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and cds
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
Baby please, you make me want to scream!

You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?

It's good o have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Yall already know what it is
God don't make no mistakes
God don't make no mistakes

[Verse 1]
Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
Point ain't always in a vibe for spitting I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kind of, sorta
'Cause when I saw her I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy
Then that southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practicing
Reciting rhymes to sharpern minds now lets deliver to the masses

[Chorus]
Been a good long road
Now it's time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my life I think it's time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's yo birthday even on your worst day
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite that means I can't be hurt

Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Even on the train
Should've ask two per men
I'll be back again
(Know we been though a lot I ain't perfect but I swear
To you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Should've asked two per men
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)

[Verse 3]
And now it's time to say goodbye they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
When your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!

[Bridge]
Before you can say you can't at all
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

Specially the big girl, big girls need love too no discrimination in this world.
So keep your hands off my cheeks, and let me study how you ride the beat
You big freak!
Skinny, slim women got the ghetto within them
You can fuck them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember
Hail out timber when you fall through the chop shop.

Now let me listen to the stories you tell and we can make moves like a person in jail.

Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list

Doing God's willing all things that are doable

Throw up the duece and let me slide on by
Cuz everybody wants to be a tough guy

Stopped at the atm, grabbed a thousand dollar bill

When I'm off in the '79 Seville or the Bonneville

Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about Outkast G

If you think it's all about pimpin hoes and slammin cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just don't understand
An outkast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an outkast?  I know I am

But the niggaz around the Ave. And the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the beans, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up
Chorus:
Now now now nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, oune in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)
See, niggaz in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doin it for years, so these niggaz ain't gone change
They comin around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearin furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a hoe if she got a G-strang
Cause the niggaz in the Pointe ain't changed, main
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

OutKast,What About Your Friends (Extended Remix),/o/outkast/what+about+your+friends+extended+remix_20676888.html,"What about your friends
What about
What about your friends
What about what about

Every now and then I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me (yeah)

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

[Chorus:]
What about your friends will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you

Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

[Chorus:]

Friends...
Let you down again....
Be low down...

Forget giggly boogly
I'm attack it like a seizure
I got rhymes at my leisure
Time when I need ta
With T to the L to the C
What I be sayin'
Gettin' loose on this track
But underground is where I'm stayin'
So hip hip hooray organizers comin' in
On a friend like the oj
But what about your friends to the end
Will they run on out like a jeeble
Or you'll find 'em stickin' close to your side
Like a big bunch of fiends
Six now the groupies drinkin' water
I get real funny so you'd better hide your daughter
Oh buddy oh pal oh chump friend of mine
Stayin' close like ketchup
A virgin that's right you call me Bruce Lee right
For the styles that me kick
And give me enough respect for this funky remix
One one thousand two one thousand three one thousand blitz
Now the rabbit felt blue so I gave the nigga Trix
Cuz I was his friend wasn't down for the beggin'
You called me a friend we're seven about to takin'
Take a tickin' keep on lickin' why you dippin' for the border
You said you'd be down for richer for poorer but
O-you-T-K-A-S-T ain't no change so tlc go head and sang baby

Yo is it me
L to the E-F-T-E-Y-E (a ha ha)
Or can it be I am a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

Brrrrr..... Ba ba ba
Back up
This ya wicked remix
Come down wicked sing
Rewind with em aya

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

People say I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah, yeah)
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me..."
OutKast,Wheelz Of Steel,/o/outkast/wheelz+of+steel_20103850.html,"Intro: Big Boi

Uhh
As I sit in my b boy stance
With flip flops and socks and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain check it out

Verse One: Big Boi Andre

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes walkin to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin but now I lay it to the flo'
Just like carbon 'cause I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
Activity, my soliloquoy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call

Chorus: Andre

Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...
Touched by the wheelz of steel...
Now show me how you feel...

Verse Two: Big Boi, Andre

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no aids, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies

Yo, we take no shit, like arms stuffed up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'

But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryin to take you other people for your rims at the curb
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go head, go head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat

Drop, like Tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout Shout let it all out, just for my peers
And pupils who feel like it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

Chorus

Verse Three: Andre

Okay, like this, yeah yeah
One time for my boy doing King shit
Two times for Legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times Outkast and it don't stop
One time for my 'cause doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the teeth eatin chicken wings
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop
Four times Outkast and it don't stop

Hey... Uh Huh... Well
Alright... How
Y'all Doing? Yes Mam
You're Mighty Fine

[Verse:]
I've been around the world, seen so many pretty girls
But I still get over whelmed when I look in your eyes
Been from main to Spain but everything seems the same
I only feel the change when I look in your eyes
I know your upper class; I know you got those abs
Every man wants to kiss you, and I do too
Sometimes I'm just a clown, and everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around when I look in your eyes
Tell me what's a man to do, to get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool, when I look in your eyes
Don't tell me no this time, if you do it will blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? It's an awful thang

[Instruments playin']

[Verse 2:]
I guess it's time to say good bye, but I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied when I look in your eyes
Oh please come home with me, oh don't you wanna marry me
I'm even gonna rub your feet when they stank outkast!
How can I let you down, I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded when I look in your eyes"

But the pimp is one of the coolest but I (pay no more)
Been known to rock the big blocks and colorful gay toys
With the flip-flops, and the silk socks and a Kangol to the tip top

Gotcha head spinnin like tread on a spool
Clean as a fool
With them gold shoes oooooh!
And I got that pool
Make you wanna holla!
Seen in my impala hear them flow-

But oh my God what are harder are the hard wood floors
It's not coincidental all the glass was kept clear
Who's worried his or her first shit it's freezing it here
The only heat is my piece to make it even at least
I'll go to work without even catching a crack in my crease
I guess the dubs out there do what they 'posed to do
I'll ride 15mph to make a believers out of you
I got a lawsuit, pending charge for wreckless blade spinnin

Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit a bomb
Numb be it view, or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gone win
Now won't that make us all fools
Like class clowns praying Private Ryan comes round
Sound travels at one thousand, one thirty, feet per second
Niggaz in the street they want it hurry
When niggaz start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick do you know what desire is? ""Huh?""
Apparently not that's why you get what you got
Now answer this do you know what fire is? ""Yeah""
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in it's sweaty palms
Thank I'm finna vom? Ya move like ya mean it she'll c**

White blood cell to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day play is no longer
The feelin gets stronger than Ammonia sticks inhale

All your hate emanates but you still hesitate
Cause you want inside of my head but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that I see the way you were, see the way you smirk I'm catching you
Where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck xxl you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast comin to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dre, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car why you frozen
Pop the tape in ignite the xplosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

With a one-two punch, B-Real and Andre dropped they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin clean-up so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams oh, yes it's curtains
No bullets burpin' oh just lyrically twerking
Making a statement, when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
Is kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer, got the public's ears
Fucked up can't hear, Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at?
Outkast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps, lo pro vogues on swole
With the carriage lamps diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace but then xplode like booty traps"

Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my Southwest ga warriors
To come in packs to feed takin what we need
To succeed you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body

If you scared, say you scared

Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a fuck what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
If you scared, say you scared

Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggaz on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it * repeats and fades *
If you scared, say you scared

February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic atliens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggaz you touch me
I blow up the micraphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me
Yeah

Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine, I go off like mines
Blowin suckers to smithereens, we was never folks
If we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin up shop, we already established
You lap doggin, we boss hoggin

Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve

Like a superimposed thought
On top of me
I've never been so frantically
See-through-head before

Like a fish caught in a line
Without even laying bait of any kind, wo-ohh...
Like a fragrance so sweet
Yet darkly inhabiting my body
Strange how two worlds collide
Oh, where could I hide?"

I ask for your name, your age too soon
You ask for location
I gave you my phone and called me home

We met in a coffee room
You're wearing a tank-top that's so cool
The way that you flashed your smile
The look in your eyes, it blew my mind

Picked you up in a classroom
We went to a movie in a mall
I hooked up your shoulders and gave me a kiss
That did it all

We went to your bedroom
You took off your clothes
My heart went boom!
The passion we shared, was unbelievable
How many times we did it, I can't recall"

Crossing the streets on a red light
You chose the path that leads
To my door

I’m not doing anything don't blame me
You hate the rain so tell me
What is wrong, what is wrong
With this cycle?

What you are is like the rain, I say
As spontaneous as the earth
You stir me
Being fool to fancy

I'm a person
Crossing the streets at random
I found a path that leads
To your door

You’re not doing anything so blame me
You hate the rain but tell me
What is wrong, what is wrong
With this cycle?

Almost rubbed-out, swelling
As I keep on
Diggin' my face
In these cold hands of mine

Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me in drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine
For all eternity
Now this angel has flown away from me
I thought I had the strength to set her free
I did what I did
Because I love her so
Will she ever find her way
Back home to me

I feel like catching forty-winks
Being up all night in this elbow-room
That puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now my lips are burning
And my eyes are hurting
From these fumes I make
Still I light another cigarette
Just to pass my time
Oh, heaven knows how embittered, I am

Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me in drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine

With all the beautiful people I know
Makin' love in a world of vivid colours
How often have I been there

Well it really doesn't matter
As long as we're together

You and me, together we will journey
To seek and see the colours of our fantasies
Come to life with the stroke of your soothing hands
All the questions of life
I will come to understand

Seasons come and seasons go
Stars will shine and lose their glow
But every time I try to look back, I know

You and me in love with each other
There will be no problems that will bother
Just the two of us painting a world of our own
Everything is perfect
Just like a splendid love song"

Not a care in the world not a problem what he says
There's a game he would play he wanted all of you to stay

There's a time in my life that is better than today

The adventures in wheat, so exciting

Cake for you! A simple happiness
Tea for you! With a big smile
The chorus of angels at the window is to you,
Just your ear playing tricks?
The voice saying ""I love you, I love you"""

Is all it take to realize my mistakes
The light has turned green
Gotta catch the plane of passion

Time to stop wondering
And redirect everything
Instead of counting sheep
In hope for far-fetch dreams

For it might be too late
Seven years is quite enough
Strike while the iron is hot
Before the flames die down
And everything's forgotten
Self promises broken
Oh no, no, no

One bright sunny day
We could be gone
And never get another chance
And the world is over
Let's be a song and dance team
And wipe the town off our feet
Hum the tune and say the words
Soon they'll sing along

I though about the times when I turned my back and stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all
When I was young I was the only game in town
I thought I had it down for sure
But time went by and I was lost in what I'd found
The reasons blurred the way unsure
I thought that I was living life the only way
But as I saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, I read the writing on the wall
I ain't no nice guy after all,
I ain't no nice guy after all
In all the years you spent between your birth and death
You know there's lots of times when you should have saved your breath
It comes as quite a shock when your trip leads to a wall
I ain't no nice guy after all,
I ain't no nice guy after all

Madness, yeah, bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where
You can run to baby, bloodbath in paradise - forever sleep in
Paradise.
California sun - but you're still in bed and the california rain
Is turning red. No sign of life or the keepers of doom in
Charlie and the keeper's scarlet room.
Can you hear them in the darkness, helter skelter - spiral
Madness, yah, bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where
You can run to baby, bloodbath in paradise - forever sleep in
Paradise.
They'll summon you, to wake from the dead as you lie
Bleeding, murdered in your bed. The sweetest dreams are all
In your mind but no one wakes when charlie creeps behind,
Yeah.
Execution halts your breath, helter skelter spiral death,
Bloodbath in paradise, but there's no where you break out baby,
Bloodbath in paradise - forever sleep in paradise."

To treat me like you do
When you layed your hands upon me
And told me who you are

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
But tell me how I feel
Tell me know how do I feel.

How does it feel
How should I feel
Tell me how does it feel
To treat me like you do

Those who came before me
Lived through thier vacations
From the past until completion
They will turn away no more

I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person to day

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me know how should I feel

Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to leave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold

How does it feel
How should I feel
Tell me how does it feel
To treat me like you do"

Temptation by the score
I used to get so high
And still I wanted more
You think my time is wasted
In search of who I am
I tried to so hard to kill

I spent a thousand years one night in my room
I've lived so many lives and that is my doom

Always thought I'd be here on my own
Sometimes when I'm down
You come and save me again
And again
And again
And again

I'll never understand it
It makes no sense at all
Just look at what I've done
It's time to count the score

And it's leaving never to return
It could be heaven maybe forever
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn

It goes--forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow

I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavour
Forever is a long long time

There's no secrets and no corruption
In the centre of infinity
There's no limits in non-existence
And no beginning to my destiny

It goes--forever and ever

There goes

Freedom is just Mens' invention,
And a soldier is just a slave.
Self inflicted. So addicted,
Our habits are hard to break.

I'm alive.
Watching better turn to worse.

One more time.
Try to civilize the Universe.

Without the righteous,
Without the faithful,
We would never accept the obscene.

Our worst confession, and priest's obsession
Is the demon the light to be seen.
Burn the witch and hang his head as,
There's only one choice to be made.
With thought restricted,
And heart afflicted,
The truth be so hard to take.

I'm alive.
Watching better turn to worse.

Give the good man to the blind.

From every disease confined.

If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same?

Sometimes, it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
Like a dagger you stick me in the heart and taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep would you shelter me in your warm and darkened grave?

If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Would it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?
No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me?
No I'll never feel the same (oh)

I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry...
Be gone?

I couldn't give a damn or two about a fool like you

Are you just too cool? No, you're just perfectly cold
And what goes around still comes around
I think it's all summed up and down in a fool like you
That's true

Today is just another day
You hold your ticket into nowhere
It's up to you if you'll stay
And turn your day into a nightmare

[Verse 2]
You think you know it, you think you know it all
But you don't even have a clue
And control is still in view for a fool like you
That's true
Is there a reason for the way that you are
Or does it just come naturally?
To have an idiosyncrasy and be a fool like you
That's true

[Chorus]
You're hearing what you want to hear
Misunderstanding all you see
An attitude in all of us
Is it really you and me

He's hiding, residing deep within the crowd
A hand out, he'll pull you down
You've been found guilty, committed every crime
But still they say you must go free

What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

Yeah, stop children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat
Ten thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound

Constantly stumbling over reason where do these words go

Stepping up to freak the day
Devour every modern day

With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuble thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the days
The clock ticks life away
It's So Unreal

Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on
But didn't evn know
I wasted it all just to watch you go..
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...

One thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how i tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even reckognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...

I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I could go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know...(2x)

In the great magnetic field
Where he travelled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody helps him

Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can

And told just what to do

And hell comes flowing through. Yeah!

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way
Must they live in constant shadow of atomic fear
Can they win the fight for people or will they disappear? Yeah!

Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave

Am I here or leaving me?

There's a want I ask all the time
Possesion of my right mind
You're not deaf but I still have to shout
Watch out there's a lot of thieves about

All along the way
I stand beside myself
And look at all my world
No need to tell me

I see dead men playing
I hear cries from many
I hear tears and then some
I hear hop I'm hoping

I'm caught with all the shutters down
Who's looking through my window?
I had to close the saddest eyes

You've got to be a winner
You've got to be cool

I see me inside you
I hear fear and then some

I see hope I'm hoping

I'd like to stay

And throw it away

Time will kill all the pain,
Fate will cure the decay of all this blind ambition,
The greed brings us together

Stand strong,
Stay true,
Be brave,
It all comes down to you

Try to just let it go,
Know that just is too slow,
But it comes in the end

Rise, the guilty will fall,
Stay, they can't take it all; they want the unimportant,
It's love they leave behind

Stand up,
Aim true,
Keep heart,
The future looks to you

Every second you throw away,
Every minute of every day,
Don't get caught in a memory,
'Cause life won't wait for you,
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

I'm watching the change,
Who will carry the flame?
It all feels very strange

Dreams that men can be good,
Faith to live as we should and know we're all connected,
We give ourselves the power

Stand strong,
Stay true,
Be brave,
It all comes down to you

Every day that you wait, you're falling faster,
No slide of hand,
No twist of fate,
No ever after

When it's gone, it's gone,
I'll fight 'til the bitter end,
Life won't wait for you,
No, life won't wait for you, my friend

Uncovering things that were sacred manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth

Beware the contradiction

Cause in the world of fiction
My jekyll doesn't hide
A killer's smile with
A psycho star dream
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem
Unholy soldier
Disciple of sin

You're preaching revolution
Don't you mean genocide?
Behind this resolution
My jekyll doesn't hide
Waiting to die for the every first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the every first time
I don't give a damn, cause I think it's my time, my time

Of murder and lies

Something in my vision, something deep inside
Where did I wander, where d'ya think I wandered to
I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through.
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars
And said I'd show them how.
Over and over always tried to get away
Living in a daydream only place I had to stay
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide
People around me talking to the walls inside
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars
And said I'd show them how.
Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to ride with me -  I'm free.
Over and under in between the ups and downs
My mind's carpet magic ride goes round and round.
Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds
Watching my body disappear into the crowd.
Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me
You don't need a ticket to ride with me -  I'm free."

So you tried it
Recalling memories of charm school pantomine turned so bad
Dainty socialite she changed her point of view
Now she's bad can't hide it
I think she really like all the things that she learned.

I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture

Well he's tellin' us this,
He's tellin' us that,
Changin' it everyday
Say's it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and casey's at bat
Playin' it play by play
It's time to change the batter

And we don't need the ladies
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad

Ozzy Osbourne,Running Out Of Time,/o/ozzy+osbourne/running+out+of+time_20104011.html,"Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell

Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell

All the thing I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know what's going on inside

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Trouble always seems find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masqerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I try to find a light to guide me home

Momma please just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
Cause your the only one that really knows

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my Wretched ways behind

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of fate and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

[spoken:]
Underneath my masquerade
A simple who's still afraid"
Ozzy Osbourne,S.A.T.O.,/o/ozzy+osbourne/sato_10198311.html,"Now I'll find peace of mind
Finally found a way of thinking
Tried the rest found the best
Stormy day won't see me sinking
I can't conceal it like I know I did before
I got to tell you now the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore.
Dare to look face the test on the eve
When you set sailing
What you've learned what you've earned
Ship of joy will stop you failing.
I can't conceal it like I know I did before
I got to tell you now the ship is ready
Waiting on the shore.
Wind is high so am I
As the shore sinks in the distance.
Dreams unfold seek the gold.
Gold that's brighter than sunlight.
Sail away see the day
Dawning on a new horizon
Gold's insight shining bright
Brighter than the sun that's rising.
3000 sails on high are straining in the wind
A raging sea below is this voyage coming to an end."
Ozzy Osbourne,S.I.N.,/o/ozzy+osbourne/sin_20923087.html,"A psycho driver twisted in my head
Silence broken, but there's nothing said
I got a nightmare from a fantasy
Will the voices ever set me free

Chorus:
I can hear 'em, I can hear 'em
Someone wake me when it's over
I can see 'em, I can see 'em
I can see 'em over and over again

I saw it happening like deja-vu
They tried to tell me but they couldn't get through
In my head I hear the voices scream
I need someone to tell me what it means

Chorus

Whoa--who turned off the lights?
Whoa--a shadow in the night
Whoa--it wasn't meant to be
I can't take this alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
No, no I can't make it alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight

Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass
I wonder if tonight will be my last
I need an angel who can rescue me
To save me from my mental symphony

Chorus

Whoa--who turned out the lights?
Whoa--shadows in the night
Whoa--it wasn't meant to be
I can't take this alone
Don't leave me on my own tonight
No, no I can't make it alone

The execution of your mind
You really had to turn

The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And now there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell

Everything around you
What's it coming to
God knows as your dog knows
Bog blast all of you

Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you"

Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right

Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark one step away from you
Just A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
All right

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for that people who hate
Underestimate me now

Steal away--the night
You gotta steal it
C'mon baby

Now I've met your honesty
You are here and I am free
Broken chains have fallen all around
Point my finger at the fools
Broken chains and broken rules
Let it be rebellion rules tonite

Chorus:
Steal away, you gotta steal away
Steal away--the night

Solo

Can it be a dream come true
Now that I am here with you
Tearful eyes of joy is something new
Runaway with me tonight
Dream the dream and light the light
Happiness is what you give to me
Oooooh yeah!!

Steal away, steal away
You gotta steal away--the night

If that turned around I'd grieve
The special dirty things
That we used to talk about
I mean that loving you is strange
And adored by me throughout
Oh no it's you again
Someday soon you'll find that someone
Waiting for the chance to beat you
Drooling on the set to feel you
Blessing you with every kiss

Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness
Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness
Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill

Such the patient one who needs me
The spoiled one who wins
So shocking where's your sense
Don't you know I hate you so
Unsatisfied you little girl

Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness
Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness
Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill

Rolling dice and seeming queer
Bastard love a sick affair,
Lets see what new disease you'll fetch,
I mean that fucking you is strange
And adored by me thoughout
Oh no it's you again
Blessing you with every kiss

So precious you know this hate of mine exploded
I'm so deranged you know
I will never be the same

Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness
Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill
Tying yourself to me, stitch up my emptiness
Cause you're the death of me
So precious loving the thrill

So precious loving the thrill

Cause you're the death of me

Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows
Away tomorrows

Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone; you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the master keeper

'Cause you feel life's unreal
And you're living a lie
Such a shame, who's to blame
And you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask
Is there life after birth
What you sow can mean hell on this earth
Hell on this earth

Now you live inside that bottle
The reaper's travelling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The reaper's you and the reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors
But there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head
But you lie there and moan
Where to hide, suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about

Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows"

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long time
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was around when jesus christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around st. petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Oh, pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted who killed the kennedys?
After all it was you and me
Let me introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reached bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners are saints
Heads is tails
Just call me lucifer
I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

What's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?

Babies crying other peoples tears,
And in thier eyes
They have reflected wasted years

You ask me who I really am
I still say I don't know

The poision seeds are sewn

Save me, all my life I've been a liar
Save me, all my life I've been a liar

Will carry you to your funreal pyre

It's what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the night
And here I'll stay
Waiting for darkness

Promise me rebirth
And then you tear me from the womb
Give me my freedom
And then you lock me in a tomb

I'm waiting for darkness
You gotta believe, you gotta believe it's truep I'm waiting for darkness
I just can't conceive why darkness is overdue

Who knows the answers
Is it friend or is it foe
Don't ask me questions
There are things you should not know"

As lambs to slaughter
We shared forbidden fruit
And things I brought her

Here I come with my mystical plan again
I know you think I can
But I'm just a man and I don't walk on water

I don't walk on water

I followed willingly
A sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized
But still I'm waiting
My dromedary dreams
As wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing scenes
She set in motion

Here I go with my whimsical ways again
Although you think I can
I'm just a man and I don't walk on water

And the long is getting shorter
And the far is now nearer

I am just a mirror
Standing in front of me
Am I blind?
Can my eyes really see?

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning

They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool,
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules,
A working class hero is something to be,

When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years,
Then they expect you to pick a career,
When you can't really function you're so full of fear,
A working class hero is something to be,

Keep you doped with religion and sex and tv,
And you think you're so clever and you're classless and free,
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see,
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

There's room at the top they are telling you still,
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill,
If you want to be like the fool on the hill,
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.

You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole

Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision

Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes! I think it's too late."

See what he could give me

'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do. """
Ozzy Osbourne,Hole In The Sky,/b/black+sabbath/hole+in+the+sky_20019447.html,"I'm looking through a hole in the sky
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine

I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky, gateway to Heaven Window in time, through it I fly

I'm seeing the stars that disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for miles I don't believe there's any future in cars

Hole in the sky, gateway to Heaven
Window in time, through it I fly

I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
But now we're living on the profits of crime"

Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all it's sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits

Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in the grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day"
Ozzy Osbourne,Iron Man,/b/black+sabbath/iron+man_20019426.html,"I am Iron Man!
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!"

Your soul is ill, but you will not find a cure, yeah!

It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, 'till it's ready, taking it slow

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again"

What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell

Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disquise

I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should

Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live

Give, give, give!

Got no religion

Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear

Ozzy Osbourne,Speak For Yourself,/g/gary+moore/speak+for+yourself_20291289.html,"(Gary Moore/Neil Carter)
Look around across the nation.
Another league of morons marching,
Banners in hand.
Looking for another scapegoat,
Try to take away the things they don't understand.

Somewhere in the darkness,
There's a voice that's crying to be heard.
You feel it deep inside you,
A voice that just won't be denied.

Speak for yourself.
Someone will hear you,
Someone will listen.
Speak for yourself.
Who knows, you might change your world.

They try to take away your freedom.
They try to tell you what you can
Or what you can't hear.
Don't let this moral suffocation
Make you turn out just like them,
Is that what they fear?

Somewhere in the darkest night,
A voice that's crying to be heard.
You hear it deep inside you now,
A voice that just won't be denied.

Speak for yourself.
Someone will hear you,
Hear what you're saying.
Speak for yourself.
Who knows, you might change your world.

They never listen to a word you say.
They always turn their backs and walk away.
Well, take a look at yourself now, baby.
Take a look at yourself.
Take a look at the things you should have done.
It's up to you.

Speak for yourself.
Someone will hear you,
Someone will listen.
Speak for yourself,
Someone will hear you,
Out in the darkness.

Speak for yourself.
Someone will hear you,
Someone will listen.
Speak for yourself.
Who knows, you might change your world.
You might change your world.
Speak for yourself."

It's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems

You're like a dagger
And stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me
In your warm and darkened grave?

Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?
No, I just can't take the pain

No, I'll never feel the same, Oh

My shine wore off as time wore on
I thought that I was living out the perfect life
But in the lonely hours when the truth begins to bite
I thought about the times when I turned my back & stalled
I ain't no nice guy after all

When I was young I was the only game in town
I thought I had it down for sure,
But time went by and I was lost in what I found
The reasons blurred, the way unsure
I thought that I was living life the only way
But as I saw that life was more than day to day
I turned around, I read the writing on the wall

I ain't no nice guy after all

You play with my world
Like it's your little toy

You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run
When the fast bullets fly
And you turn and run
When the fast bullets fly

You're the masters of war

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
World war can be won
You want me to believe

But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
And I see through my water
That runs down my drain

You then fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
When the death count gets higher

You hide in your mansion
While the young people blood
Flows out of their bodies
And buried in the mud

You're the masters of war
You're the masters of war

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Would buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?

I think you will find
When death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon

And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
I'll stand over your grave

I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly

I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause

Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly

I've seen the western world go down in the east

And told just what to do

And love comes flowing through

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

Spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive

So go about your business
Cos life aint your mistress

Come on, come on my brothers and sisters
Cos you can only be what you are
Cos you've got the heart of a star
But the light never hits ya

So be all you can
And just hold up your hands
Someday you'll understand why life never kissed ya
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters

I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters"

As your life is thin
So entertain your goals

The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new

Sleepless on your floor

A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams, she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause we don't believe
That they're gonna get away from the summer
But you and I will never die
The world's still spinning around we don't know why
Why-why-why-why-i-i
(Guitar solo)
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky

That they're gonna get away from the summer
But you and I will never die

How many lives are living strange?

We were getting high"

On the dropout buses

That my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And if you hear me tap on your window
Better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

My pulse pumps out a beat to the ghost dancer
My eyes are dead and my throat's like a black hole
And if there's a god would he give another chancer
An hour to sing for his soul

Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on your window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
There's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows"

I've got a lovely new flak jacket, a lovely khaki suit.
When we go on night patrol, we hold each other's hand,
For we are the British Army, and we're here to take your land.

To search for weapons he will go near and far.
Up around by Kappa, you'd never find him there.
The only gun he'll get there is an Armalite in his ear!

But now they've handed him his redundancy.
Folks along the border won't be seeing him any more,
That provo sniper will be missing him for sure!

He says a child is just as good as the rest.
Now they've gone and posted him way down to Crossmaglen,
He wished to blazes, he was back in jail again!

An upstanding member, as all the world can see.

He said, ""I'll take a run there, if I have nothing on.""

We dream our dreams alone
With no resistance
Fading like the stars we wish to be

But my God woke up
On the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now

Cos little by little
We gave you everything
You ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life
Have slowly fallen off
Little by little
You have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why
You're really here

True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come
And now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we give to you

You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my God woke up
On the wrong side of his bed

Walk on

And when you look in the mirror and your tying all your buttons and bows
And as you face your disease you can squeeze into the emperor's clothes

You found your gun in a paperbag
You get your history from the union jack
And all your brothers and sisters have gone and they wont come back

Failed the life in the city
All the fonies that roam at night

Too messed up to step out of the shadows
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow
Rescued from this deep dark hollow
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails
Time is nigh for you leather girls
Maybe we should end this race
Vanish while we cannot leave no trace

If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me, but now I'm blind
See one-arm film stars on alien beaches
Potted gold and tattooed faces
Harrison murals on the corner, tupperware boxes full of hops
Diazepam dreams there catching streams
Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green

To do what we've done

Let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away.

Slide away - and give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now?

Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - and I know just what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
I'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning when you don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done"

Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kind of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whisper in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Outta control but I'm tied up tight
Come in, come out tonight

Coming up in the early morning
I feel love and the shock of the lightning
I'll follow into the blinding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

Love is a time machine
Up on the silver screen
It's all in my mind
Love is a litany
A magical mystery
And all in good time
And all in good time
And all in good time

I've got my feet on the street but I can't stop flying
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying
I'm outta control but I'm tied up tight
Come in, come out tonight

There's a hole in the ground into which I'm falling
So God speed to the sound of the pounding
I'm all in to the blinding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

Love is a time machine
Up on the silver screen
It's all in my mind
Love is a litany
A magical mystery
And all in good time
And all in good time

Rise up from your soul
They hang over the streets at night
Brought on by the cold

We live with the numbers
Mining a dream for the same old song
What hope for the turning
If everything you know is wrong

So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side

If you carry the lantern
I'll carry you home
You search for the disappeared
I'll bury the cold

Yours is a messiah
Mine is a dream and it won't be long
No hope for the journey
If no-one ever sees the dawn

So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Will you be by my side?
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side

So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind

Will you be by my side?

To be number one - and loved by everyone

Getting drugged up with my trendy friends
They really dig me, man, and I dig them
And the money that I spend, it is like my fame, and it's quickly gone

No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool
No more reporters at my beck and call
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk
And I can't afford a taxi so I have to walk

Didn't I have a nice time
Wasn't it sucha nice time
Didn't I have a nice time

I realize I should have stuck to my guns
You stood me out just like a bastard son
And I lost myself, but I know that it was wrong
And it cost me a lot

No more drinking cause now the club shuts down
And I'm out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns
I get really scared without my bodyguard
And I'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard

I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you

What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?"

A green and yellow basket
I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground
A-Tisket A-Tasket
She took my yellow basket 
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I shall die
(Was it red?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it brown?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it blue)
No, no, no, no
Just a little yellow basket"

A fine romance, my friend, this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes (to-mah-toes, dear)
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed po-tah-toes (potatoes)

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't even wrestle
You've never mussed the crease in my blue serge pants
You never take a chance, this is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take Jello
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins to express emotion

A fine romance, my dear Duchess
Two old fogies, we really need crutches
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France! (Fronce)
I haven't got a chonce (chance), this is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong, aged-in-the-wood woman
You never give those orchids I send a glance
They're just like cactus plants, (oh boy)
This is a fine romance!"

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere"

I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

I'll dispose of my rose-colored chattels and prepare for my share of adventures and battles,
Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?

Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel, they're making me feel I'm home.
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.

Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands,
It's autumn in New York,
It's good to live again."

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis"

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine"

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more"

Listen, There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved loved another guy
We were at a party, Ohh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my-my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathin hard and french kissin

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was God Uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom

Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man

I asked my man why didnt you tell me that you were gay
when you knew, knew I build my world around you
I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change
As tears came to my eyes, hesays I'm sorry I hurt you so
I got to pack Bill is waiting for me and I got to go

I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

I don't feel ashame and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a Queen that thought he was a King
He told before he left he said
I know you're hurt and oh I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much,
could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Bill used to come over to my house, I used to fix him my food
I used to loan Bill my money, all the time he was in there tryin' to get

Oscar Peterson,Birth Of The Blues,/o/oscar+peterson/birth+of+the+blues_21270063.html,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!"

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own"

And to reach the highest peak,
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek.

In a river or a creek,
But I don't enjoy it half as much

The charm about you
Will carry me thro' to Heaven

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you."

A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So, tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you

The perking of the coffee right nearby

That's my favorite melody

I get me out of bed and sing this song

An optical illusion, too?
Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright cause I only
Have eyes for you. 

The moon may be high,
But I can't see a thing in the sky,
Cause I only have eyes for you.
I don't know if we're in a garden,
Or on a crowded avenue.
You are here, so am I. 
Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view, 
And I only have eyes for you."

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind

There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, its a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me its really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise

The gold in your hair

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving

If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned

There is nothing I couldn't do"
Oscar Peterson,If I Were A Bell,/o/oscar+peterson/if+i+were+a+bell_21266163.html,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!""."

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening

In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this

Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""

At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night"
Oscar Peterson,Indiana,/o/oscar+peterson/indiana_21268691.html,"I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

[Chorus]
Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

Seem to be having their way,

It's a lovely day.
The turn in the weather 
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned,
It's a lovely day and everythings ok.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way,
Now you've got to remain.
Just as you were going,
Leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke,
And oh what a break for me.
I can see the sun up high,
Though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.
Let the rain pitter patter,
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are grey.
Long as I can be with you,
It's a lovely day."

I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring"

Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?

Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone

From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too"

Oscar Peterson,On The Sunny Side Of The Street,/o/oscar+peterson/on+the+sunny+side+of+the+street_21266149.html,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street"

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that`s when my heart departed

Low, was the moon when we said, ""Adios""

Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Oscar Peterson,Polka Dots And Moonbeams,/o/oscar+peterson/polka+dots+and+moonbeams_21265643.html,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream"

Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along

In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do?

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Used to dance cheek to cheek
I don't mind Sunday night at all
Cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday go fast
And another week is past

But Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue"

Stop wasting time
Put on your dancing shoes
Watch your spirits climb

Shall we dance, or keep on moping?
Shall we dance and walk on air?
Shall we give in to despair?
Or shall we dance with never a care?
Life is short, we're growing older
Don't you be an also-ran
You'd better dance, little lady
Dance, little man
Dance whenever you can"

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way."

Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal

Can't we sail away on a little dream

Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain."

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you"

Though by tomorrow you're gone
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love

That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two

There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

In a maze of words

From a world away

Traditions back
Across the centuries
In a century where no one can explain
You tell me God is dancing in the rain
I can hear the echo
In a maze of words
A lonely voice behind a door

From a world away
A lonely voice behind a door
As I stare ahead
A dream ahead
Across the ocean
Cross an ocean where there's nothing to explain
You tell me God is laughing in the rain

In a maze of words
A lonely voice behind a door
Can you hear me calling
From a world away

With the window open
I have dreamed of you
When the evening enters
Like a dark perfume
I am shadow-breathing
As if emptiness could fill me

In the quiet heat
Holding back the rain
I am outside waiting
And I say your name
To the storm inside me
That will still remain
When the sky is empty
And the world goes on without you

The moment leaves
Almost as it came
The feeling stays

In every way that you were beautiful
In every way that I refused to see
I find a reason to forgive you now
And leave you
Inside me

In the holding on
And the letting go
Is the way you lose
And the way you grow
When the feeling enters
Like a wounded ghost
Let the night be gentle
When I say how much I miss you

The moment leaves
Almost as it came
The feeling stays

In every way that you were beautiful
In every way that I refused to see
I find a reason to forgive you now
And keep you
Inside me"

Burning like a fever inside you
The heat of your skin and the taste of your lips
A shadow, a storm, a darkening sky, the reason you live, the secret you
Hide
And God said the reason had hung from the tree, but I feel the reason
Hanging on me
I am free of my innocence, falling too far
I am helpless to change, I am hopelessly lost, I am all that you are
I've fallen from all I know to keep you here, I need you here
I wonder how far to go without you here
Only ever really one story
A boy and a girl and the end of the world, a secret, a kiss, a hole in
The sky

As I ran
Through the fog down a cobblestone street
In a city of crossroads
That never lead home
Where secrets unravel
And fates intertwine
Someone was calling my name in the night
As I ran
From a voice that was echoing mine
The farther you run
The more you recall
The loss of your innocence
After the fall
The farther you run
The more you recall
After the fall
In a city of magic
That spins out of time
Where God has no image
And Man finds no grace
Something inside me was seeking itself

Where time erases the days
Leading back to you

There’s a fire in the breeze
The crimson of the autumn leaves
Falling on the meadow
In the whisper of the trees
A spirit that is ill at ease
Calling from the shadow
Of dreams
Where you can see yourself

Take me now, hold me here
Where you hurt too much
I can see you clearly now
In the changing light of love

There’s a certain time of day
When everything is beautiful
Even what you’re missing
And a feeling that will stay
Sweeter than the promises
Of someone you are kissing
Goodbye
Watching them go away

Take me now, hold me here
Where you hurt too much
I can see you clearly now
In the changing light of love


In the voice of a forgotten boy

From a song that you used to sing
In a time before your heart was broken open

To wait for release

And falls to his knees

We stand in the square

The priest has gone home
And we are left standing
Together alone

Come take my soul
Come take me over
I want to be whole
Come take my body
Come take my soul
Come rhythm
Come silence

And the fear has no name

It'll be okay

Shining in a window

Knowing she would probably
Leave him tomorrow
Weak and alone with himself

It'll be okay

It's all the same to him

Before she stayed
And went away

Looking for a door he could open
Hoping that he wouldn't break until he broken

To weather every bitter turn
Or promise of rain
But nothing goes and nothing stays
Without the pain you lose the way
You came to be
You came to me

Lost in the feeling you are here with me

The only stars I see have died
Already they shine
A weird unsteady after-light

Where the hollow light of day never reaches in

He will fall asleep like a baby
And the unforgiving arms of the cradle
Rock as hard as the face of the city pavement
Hide your eyes
Hide your eyes
He can see the face of a lover
In the lonely face of the angel above him
Carved into the stone that is changing around him
He can feel her breathing inside him
And the unforgiving visions deny him
Life can only be what a man can make it
Hide your eyes
Hide your eyes
Sunday morning
Yellow sky
The sun is floating diamond high
Hours passing
A baby cries
In the arms of someone you imagine
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby
He can feel his skin like a prison
Like a dying cage he struggles to live inside
He tries to call out but nobody hears him
At the ragged edge of the silence
In the calm that only comes with the violent sleep
Inside the heart and the hope of redemption
Hide your eyes
Hide your eyes
In the heart of someone you imagine
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby
Close your eyes
This is your lullaby
(Down, down, down
Would the fall never come to an end?
Wonder how many miles I've fallen
Must be somewhere near the centre of the earth

Down, down, down
Would the fall never come to an end?)"

Lighther than your thoughts
Take me while you can
Never knowing who or what you are until you're
Living with the unfamiliar

Where your secret dreams remind you

Everything you need to guide you

This is all you have to go on
Take me as I am
Someone you could know
Even as we speak
You could change your mind
Take me while you can
Even if you shine a light into a mirror
You won't see me any clearer

And so I speak aloud, but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions, I've arrived
To Offset

[Chorus: Offset]
I was 17 years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, I wasn't rich, and had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

[Verse 1: Offset]
Kalia, you my first, first daughter
I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry
Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up, my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up, pray to God that he bless us
I'ma keep grindin' for my kids, never gon' let up
I'ma put the money up for y'all, I can't be selfish
Had a baby as a kid, mama kicked me out
Had to go and hit a lick, tryna put food in your mouth
Then I got caught for the shit, in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down, ain't let me stay at the house

[Chorus: Offset]
I was 17 years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, I wasn't rich, and had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm a father of four, gotta get that cash, gold
Keep my past closed, 'member I ain't had no dough
Spend a big bag on clothes, Gucci from the head to toes
Not two, not three, all four, that's all they know
Kulture, remind me of my grandma, feel like she is closer
Gotta thank your mama, she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world, I can't even post her
Ups and downs in this fame, roller coaster
If I don't ball, then everything 'round me fall
I'm prayin' to God to watch my kids, that's my all...

[Chorus: Offset]
I was 17 years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays

Got out of jail again, and again, and again

I can never fold on none of my niggas
I'm the one they talk about be demented
I got niggas serving bricks out the fender
The Karma keep coming back when I was getting it
A lot of you niggas be changing when you get famous
Talking that shit but you really not gangster
These niggas claiming that they 'bout it 'bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texacos
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow
Had to understand I had to sacrifice
I was living life I had to pay the price
Lost everything I had like Solomon
Got it back, it's like I hit the lottery
For my fans I gotta say apologies
They holding me down and they ride for me

A hundred thousand for a Plain Jane
When you locked up, got to maintain
Caught a Fed case with the cocaine
Start telling names, playing blame games
That ain't the shit that I call a hunna
I was the boss and you was the runner
I cooked the dope while she count the commas
If she run with the money I kill her mama
Do you really fuck with me? Sometimes I wonder
What was you at when that drought was coming
You be bumping your gums but ain't saying nothing
Got your bitch in the condo, we have a slumber
I might pull up with a hundred bricks in a Hummer
I can not tell 'cause the code that I honor
I know one nigga who came from the jungle
He told me, ""get money, don't want nothing from you""

And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em (Damn)
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them (Woah)

Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now

On this train meant to derail

And I can't fall apart this time
No I won't fall apart

If we make
We'll leave this all behind
And if we make
Success will look to find us
And everything will be okay
If we make it
If we make it

These three long years I gave my all
I climbed so high, yet learned to crawl
But this time is the last time
That my knees will hit the ground

Take the risks for my fam, for some damn food (Risks)
Take my bitch out to France, out to Cancún (France)
My wrist like a damn, you can splash, pool (Splash)
Money root of all evil, but the cash rule

[Chorus]
(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent (Survive)
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick (Broke)
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent (Down)
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse (Cleanse)
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence (12)
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten (Ten)
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, I'm black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich (Woo, woo, woo)
Hold it down

[Verse 2]
Know some savages, they tryna clean up and they won't let 'em (Clean up)
Streets done made my heart so cold, need a whole sweater (Cold)
I was kickin' in the back of doors but I know better (Hey)
You expose what you know, then you go get it (Hey)
Sow what you reap, sleepin' on my feet
Trust fund for my daughter, son, daddy plant a seed
No bond when you do a crime, slavery repeat
Slick minded, they think we runnin' a treasury (Who)
Lost my homie, it keep on hauntin' me in my sleep
Lost my grandmama, whole family incomplete
Stabbed in my back a million times, this shit deep
I was in hittin' licks doin' crime for my seat
Now I got 25 cars, it's a fleet
Take notes, make a bando turn Ferrari, I can teach
Struggled with the pain, but I still turned out a beast
I got out the chains, now the world belong to me (Hey)

I drive V12, so that shit won't be easy
I get them knocked off and than we'll be even
I call my drippin' like everyday easy
I get that new Louis shit every season
She top me off, she get racks and I leave her
I don't sneak diss I just leave it to Beaver
I get that money man
Smoking sativa a four in a liter
Why everybody playing follow the leader?
I buy new cars I don't drive I just keep em'
The dealer tell me that it's better to lease em'
I told him I come from the trenches it's deeper
This ain't no cap I do this for my people
I keep my heater I ride with some demons
New Hellcat geeked up I'm riding a cheetah
My bitch she said I'm a liar and cheater
Section 8 Apartment the bed Tempurpedic
Lil' bro caught a case, all the lawyers can beat it
They wanna compete with me thinking we equal
I hit your bitch gave her back you can keep her
I'm hot as fuck I think I blew the meter
I knew what's up I won't ever repeat it
He got a problem we solve it delete it
I'll never stop unless they give me the needle

Newspapers floating my way
I close my eyes... Don't want to read the headlines
Because I've started to lose faith
All the colors turn to grey
And it seems to me that hope can't save the day

Cause everything is where it shouldnt
All the things we said we wouldnt... We did
Can you believe the mess were in it's overwhelming
But you tell me everything will work out fine
Cause it's just another line
Until I see the words fall flat from your lips

Cause everything is exactly where it shouldnt
And everything is exactly where it shouldn't be
Everything is exactly where it shouldnt
Is exactly where it shouldn't be

Wrong side of the world today
Its where you sleep so far away
So close your eyes
And hope the next time you will wake you'll see mine
Then nothing else would seem to matter
Even if this whole world shattered... I know...
Id have you here with me to pick up the pieces
And put them right back into place
Fragmatic in your grace
And it seems just like the first time... The last time

But everything is where it shouldnt
To leave my bed I couldn't
Not today... Not until I see the sun light here again

Everything is exactly where it shouldnt
Everything is exactly where it shouldn't be
Everything is exactly where it shouldn't
Is exactly where it shouldn't be

Everything is exactly where it shouldnt
Everything is exactly where it shouldn't be
Everything is exactly where it shouldnt
Is exactly where it shouldn't be

And you're not here to dry these tears
And keep it all together
And I'm writing you this letter
About foggy stormy weather
Cause it's freezing... It's cold here
And I need this more than ever
So please... Please... Stay with me

Until the sun comes up again
Till it's warmer than it's ever been
Until the sun comes up again"

With the dookie roll, a little Bousie on
I'm eating sushi rolls, doing the tootsie rolls
Thinking about future goals
Hit it what you've been on

I'm pulling out in that Maybach
And I copped that from the thrift shop

I'm maneuvering out to Budapest
Got my baby mama duckin' the audit the IRS
Been callin', tryna get into my wallet
But they ain't getting all up in it
Put my feet up on the ottoman
I oughta be relaxin', 'cause I'm all about that action boss

I'm a motherfuckin' icon, boots made of python

I took a picture for four
I never play with my nose
My wrist is a 'fridgerator 'cause its cold

And it's a long long way
But you're to blind to see

Frame of silence
Of an innocence divine
Is a dangerous creation
When you fail the test of time

And all the photographs
Of ghosts of long ago
Still they hurt you so
Won't let you go
And you still don't know

And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
An it's a long long way
But you're to blind to see

When you look around yourself now
Do you recognize the girl
The one who broke a thousand hearts
Terrified the world

And all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain
And if the face has changed
The grace remains
And you're still the same

And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
An it's a long long way
But you're to blind to see...."

We've tried to resist but it's so hard to say no
We're pretending to see what the future will hold
We appear to be in control of our fate
Just like soldiers believe they're in control of a war
But it's moving so fast we cannot see what we've done
We're losing our eyes just to say that we've won

My mind's made up, my heart is broke
My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked
I can't understand how we could ever believe
The things we asked for but never received

We never understood the times we asked
The way we wasted all that passed
This neglect is final it's a stage we must
Endure to ever hope to see the first
My mind's made up about the things we did
We never saw we believed we couldn't say what we missed

My mind's made up, my heart is broke
My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked
I can't understand how we could ever believe

By making noises which we cannot control
The things we hoped that we'd never forgo

No sympathy, no charity, no false pleas of humility.
No money back, no guarantee, no great escape for you and me.

She waits for darkened forms
She's seen you there
And time and time again
You hear her call your name
She calls for you

And I can't see me with another girl
As everything slows down across the world

The lights are gong out
One by one
Across the world
The lights are going out
One by one
Across the world"

Forget the talking
Forget the actions
And quiet voices and all that happened
In just one of hour
You could knock me down

The twos are one now
And ones are fuller
No longer giving
No longer taking
These ways are tried
They never seem to fail

And when you're asking
You sound like telling
Despite the questions
You're not receiving
I can't explain
Why you disappear

Your mind is made up
The time is taken
You reach decisions
We can't avoid them
There's no success
No matter what we do

The twos are one now
And ones are fuller
No longer giving
No longer taking

It's increasingly unlike the rest
For as we get older we've become less aware
Security lies at the heart of our lives
Attaching ourselves to ourselves
We're extinguished but we're still alive

Misunderstood but our intention is good
We were not questioned on our replies
It does you no good
Though you think that it should
And it would given half a chance
If there's compassion in your hearts
Now that you've seen enough
We've given of our best
For god's sake you know
Please please please please please please please please can we go home
Is this the time or place to say goodbye
Regardless I'll find my final cue
We'll sneak out the back door and close it"

The mystery of wonderland

The next she treats him like a king

She sees it on the video
She wait s until the kids have grown
And then she thinks she'll start again

And it's a long way back

She promised almost everything
They ran away to paradise

Is confident we’ll get there someday
Pushing all the papers to a wealthy man
Might I say, a beautiful tie you wear
And how do you find such lovely polka dots
And stripes these days?

Break all my thoughts hit the floor
Like I'm makin' the score
I'm the king of the world, I'm a popular man
Count by zero's to ten
If you can't, well, I can
Don't let any one wake me

I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud

I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit into piece, apart of me

Curtain calls in sanctuary
Actors in the cloth, they freak me out
Mockin' my purpose in the magazines
And famous how they make you feel grand
They’re always there to hold your hand
In times of trouble, they’re best of friends

Break all my thoughts hit the floor

They don't care what you think
All they care, what you do
Long as you're off beat
Take a look at yourself

Storm tries to come and wreck my world
No, I won't let it
Stumbled escape, through anchored drapes
No way to bedding

And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreamin' out loud, dreamin' out loud

Address to places like Abbey Road

We're young enough to say

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We are god of stories but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

He'd talk about love, yeah he was something like a teacher

And it feels like sabotage when I’m pulling triggers back
On myself you know it is all I know, is all I know

This crippled bears gonna sing, gonna bring you
All the years is quick turn around, look your shadows could
Could not beautiful lies for you is what they do

Stir my bones from a thousand miles apart

And I need the sun

Last night I dreamt I was returning

But I fear you won't be like I left you

When our world was small enough for dreams

Change is a strange thing
It cannot be denied
It can help you find yourself
Or make you lose your pride
Move with it slowly
As on the road we go
Please do not hold on to me
We all must go alone

When we laughed and sang the whole night long
And I will greet you as I find you
With the sharing of a brand new song
Last night I dreamt I was returning
And my heart called out to you
To please accept me as you'll find me

With a broken heart
Mend the heart of another
I saw a boy

Lifting out to help his brother

Without no home
Giving shelter to another
I know of people
Without hope
Giving strength to each other

People sin to be free
People kill to be free

Ofra Haza,Frei,/o/ofra+haza/frei_20562709.html,"Komm' mir ganz nah
Die Zeit ist da

Was früher war
Betrifft uns zwei nicht mehr.
Ich liebe dich und du liebst mich

Die Fessel bricht und fliegen ist nicht schwer -
Und wenn du willst
Tu was du fühlst.
Fang mit mir ein neues Leben an
Ein neuer Tagt
Der uns gehört

Noch unzerstört von Sorgen und von Streit -
Vor uns liegt heut' die Ewigkeit
Nimm mich bei der Hand
Es ist
Soweit.

Frei
Frei
Frei werden wir jetzt sein

Frei wie Wind und Wolken
Uns'ren Träumen folgen -
Niemand hält uns auf
Wir fliegen frei
Frei
Frei in den
Sonnenschein

Wie ein Pfeil ins Blaue nur nach vorne schauend

Und uns alle trägt die Zärtlichkeit.

Denn wir sind frei
Und auf uns zwei da paßt der Himmel auf.
Nie mehr zurück
Der Augenblick aus purem Glück

Er trägt uns hoch hinauf.
Vor uns liegt die Ewigkeit - nehmt euch bei der Hand
Es ist soweit:
Frei
Frei
Frei werden wir jetzt sein
...

Die Zeit ist da
Was früher war
Das zählt jetzt gar nicht mehr.
So hoch wie nur ein Vogel fliegt
So unbesiegt hoch über Land und
Meer

So fliegen wir weit fort von hier - nehmt euch bei der Hand
Es ist
Soweit:

Frei
Frei
Frei werden wir jetzt sein
...
Denn wir sind jetzt frei
Frei
Frei
Frei - unendlich frei
Frei

Frei!"

You tear me apart

When you flow through me
Surround me and light the dark
Brand me and leave your mark
My aching heart
Is breaking again

We've turned the page,
And the summer's gone
Turning to fall
Memories paint the pictures like dreams
I hear you call
Was it only a dream
When you made love to me
And you filled my soul
Made me whole
And watched me cry
My aching heart

And floating somewhere
You're there between pain and tears
Between my love and fear
Where no-one hears
And I've got nothing
No strength left to watch you fall
Nothing left at all"

I travelled far but now I'm here
To sing for you my tears

And watches while I cry

Tell me who am I
Tell me who am I
Oh, el-Shaday

Many years and tears ago
My people were scattered
Taking with them broken souls
From homes, where time once mattered
My lovely Land, my lonely Land
Alone two thousand years
And now returned our Holy Land
But fields are filled with tears

With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land
In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes
In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear my calling
In the temple of love: Hear my name
And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away
With the sunlight died and night above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another it's all the same
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside
With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
I shine like thunder cry like rain
And the temple grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before
This black wind calls my name to you no more
In the black sky thunder sweeping under ground and over water
Sounds of weeping will not save
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and only air remains
In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear the calling
And the temple of love is falling down
In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear my calling
In the temple of love: Hear my name
In the black sky thunder sweeping under ground and over water
Sounds of weeping will not save
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and only air remains
The only haven you can trust
And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning

With the fire from the fireworks up above

And we crash on the coastline,
But only our love will last till the end

Bodies are weak and they turn into dust

But Love is is like lightning,
It strikes only one time

To be part of the picture

Throw your arms around each other
And love one another
For it's only one life that we've got

To join in together When the days turn to dust
So the let the prison walls crumble,
And the borders all tumble
There's a place for us all here
And ain't it enough

I'm trying to find my way back to New Orleans 
Broke down and fallen on hard times, 
I need just one kind favor to get back on my feet
Lost my ticket for a Greyhound bus when it left me in the dust and gone away
Man at the station told me boy get lost, 
Start pulling your own weight.

I'm walking forty days and night, under the Texas sun, 
Won't someone help me please
Pardon me sir, you've got a dime? 
I'm trying to find my way back to New Orleans 
I did my time in Baton Rouge, Birmingham and Huston too, 
But all I've ever seen was weary faces just like mine, 
Waiting in endless lines just trying to find a seat.

Lost my ticket for a Greyhound bus when it left me in the dust and gone away
Now all I'm asking, is for you to help their cause, 
Because they are going a long way
They're walking forty days and nights, under the Texas sun, 
Won't someone help them please
Spare just a dollar or a dime, 
They are trying to find their way back to New Orleans.

They're walking forty days and nights, 
And only just begun to read our destiny
Still got a long hill left to climb,
Come on let's find our way back to New Orleans.
Come on let's find our way 
Come on and find our way, 
Come on let's find our way."

A young man about 21 no different
Then you or I
He's catchin' catfish and gettin' drunk
But Uncle Sam called, he called him up
Sent him out to Vietnam
That young man
Got his life turned upside down
Turned his smile into a frown
Robbed that king of his crown
For an ideal he didn't even know about

He was gamblin' at the wagon
When that Army man showed up
And he flashed that pen and paper
And Ol' Flukie he signed up
There's gonna be a big time in the
Jungle
Gonna be a firefight
Gonna be a rumble
Send me out to Vietnam
I'll fight ten men
I got nothin' left in the states for me
I wanna see the world you see
I know that Uncle Sam needs me
To fight for an ideal I know nothin'
About

Oh the drop point was dusty and the
Drill sergeant was loud
And he could not see the corpses for the
Ragin' dust cloud
Grab your duffle bags, head to the
Checkpoint
Welcome to Vietnam boys you're in
For a hell of a fight
Take it from the ones who know
The army moves slow
Hurry up and wait don't sleep late
And learn to hate your brother
Before you hate your foes

On patrol out in the rice fields, them
Choppers flew low
Glancing for the hand signal to tell you
Where to go
Then the bombs started fallin'
And they pounded his brain
And he thought about Eutaw and who
Was to blame
For sendin' him to Vietnam"

A bootlegger's boy,
In the Cherokee Hills,
I applied my trade,
In Mountain City,
I had me a time,
Just making money,
On Moonshine.

So I hauled my load,
Into Knoxville Town,
I met me a gal,
And we knocked around,
But them Knoxville girls,
Can't leave me alone,
In my suits so fine,
And my bottle of corn.

I'm going back to Mountain City,
Where I can make another run,
Load my trunk with Moonshine whisky,
I am a brave Bootlegger's son.

Yeah I sold that corn,
To the Circuit Judge,
On the Public Square,
To Mayor Trent,
But I met with trouble,
On the tracks one night,
With a drunken man,
I commenced to fight.

Yeah I fought five rounds,
Then I put him away,
With a wicked jab,
From a razor blade,
And the women screamed,
As the bottles broke,
On stoney ground,
Where the blood did flow.

I'm going back to Mountain City,
Gonna make those revenues run,
I killed a man in a feud of whisky,
I am a cruel Bootlegger's son.

Now I roam the night,
Just to hide my shame,
I lost all my money,
Can't find a friend,
Gonna drag my bones,
To the mountainside,
If corn don't kill me,
I might never die.

I'm going back to Mountain City,
Or else they'll hang me this I know,
I killed a man in a feud of whisky,
I am a cruel Bootlegger's boy.

I'm going back to Mountain City,
To the Cherokee Hills I started from,
Going home broke ain't it a pity,
I am a cruel Bootlegger's son."

Well I come from the valley, I'm a rebel boy.
Born on the banks of the Shenandoah.
In '61, I went to the war,
To win one for Virginia!
Ya my brother went first and they called me to.
I was green as clover in the morning dew.
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune.
Carry me back to Virginia!

(Bridge 1)
Fire in the cannon, water in the well,
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell.
I learned right quick how to march like hell and affix that bayonet.

[Chorus:]
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.

[Verse 2:]
With a sword and a saddle,
Powder in the gun.
We thought for a minute our fight was done.
So they lined us up to the metals arm,
And hammered us into the quicksand.
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire,
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron.
Til the men took cover where the horses piled,
Then we shivered and then hold against them.

(Bridge 2)
But the war raged on like flames of hell,
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell,
Dressed in rags and we ate like rats
When they cut off our legs we cried!

[Chorus:]
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3:]
And they died in the valley,
Died in the swamp,
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped.
Died in the ditches,
Died in the fields,
In the belly of a wagon for a womans to heal
Died in the war,
Starved in the camps.
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man.
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend
And to bury the tome of a-dixieland!

(Bridge 3)
Down in Alabama,
Down in Caroline,
Way down in Gerogie, on the Tennesee line.
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee,
Now we want to go home to Virginia.
Say we want to go home to Virginia!

[Chorus:]
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
I wanna be buried in Virginia!"

Feeling down

Well you took all I had Genevieve and you left me a mess
But if you try to steal my heart again you'll have to cut it out of my chest
Genevieve I've got no regrets
Except maybe for everything I had to do to forget
You're the reason I'm in pain
But my hearts still calling your name

Genevieve

Well she tore my clothes
She swelled my head
So goodbye booze i'm goin to bed
I had a good time, but we couldn't agree
So you see what booze has done for me

Oh goodbye booze
Forever more
My boozin' days will soon be o'er
I had a good time, but we couldn't agree
So you see what booze has done for me

Well she slammed my head
She broke my heart
So goodbye booze it's time we part
I had a good time
But we couldn't agree
So you see what booze has done for me

So goodbye booze
Forever more
My boozin' days will soon be o'er
I had a good time
But we couldn't agree
So you see what booze has done for me

Well she whipsered low, how sweet it sounds
Won't don't you take another ride on the merry go round
Oh I had a good time, but we couldn't agree
So you see what booze has done for me

To our Blue Ridge Mountain home
And across that crooked river
To the valley down below

I was swimmin' in that water
When they came up to the shore
Sayin' sorry son this won't be
Dry land here anymore

Chorus:
Yes and my home town
Is a half mile down
It's a half mile o' water
All around, all around
My home town is a half mile down

First they started their surveyin'
And makin' up their plans
To flood that peaceful valley
Just to build Watauga dam
Oh they brought in their bulldozers
And pushed our homes away
And they handed me a shovel
And sixty cents a day

Chorus:
Singin' my home town
Is a half mile down
It's a half mile o' water
All around, all around
My home town is a half mile down

So they stripped out all the timber
And they leveled all the land
And they drilled and dynamited
'Til they blew the mountains in
I tore down my old homeplace
And I dug up Daddy's grave
And I relocated Momma to 14 miles away

Now I look down on the water
That rose up on that day
By the banks of the old Watauga
Where I once used to play

Yes I look out on that water
Where they made their big mistake
And covered up our hometown
'Neath the godforsaken lake

Chorus:
Singin' my home town
Is a half mile down
It's a half mile of water
All around, all around
My home town
Is a half mile down
It's a half mile of water
All around, all around
My home town is a half mile down"

When you've broken the heart of many a poor boy
But you'll never break this heart of mine

Can't you see that lonesome ship that sails
That sails from shore to shore
If I was on that lonesome ship
I'd sail away no more

Well I wish I was a pretty little bird
I wish I was a pretty little bee
I wish I was so far away
No more you'd see of me

Stepping out in the great unknown
With a highway halo

Shaky face

Traveling minstrel
Let her dusty wings unfold
Forgive her bad luck soul
Put her in a purple robe
And a highway halo

Passing trains
Sound like silver
Broken chains
Shine like gold
Fortune's just a painted stone
Going where them hobos roam
Crowned king of a jungle throne
With a highway halo

Going where it suits my soul
Can't you hear my big wheels roll
You can light up the darkest road
With a beam of eternal glow
With a highway

Wash up at the sink, glance in the mirror
Who is that man who ain't been here in three long weeks or maybe more?

All this gettin' off the road has got me ragged to the bone and coming home
There ain't no homecoming party

Pop a yellow pill, the kind for sleepin' through
The sound of wakin' children when the daylight starts to show
And it's silent up the carpet stairs and peek into the nursery
Where the little ones are dreamin' sweet and low
I can hear 'em cryin', ""Daddy where you been?
And did you bring me back a present from a distant sunny shore?""

All this gettin' off the road has got me ragged to the bone and coming home
There ain't no homecoming party

Oh it's 10,000 places and 20,000 faces
And half a million miles I'm bound to row
And I'm weary and wasted, and all that I can taste is
One lonesome tear on the tip of my tongue
She must've left the light on I'll just slip into the bed and let it burn
And when our bodies touch I'l pull away and not disturb her
Even though I long for love so much it hurts
And maybe we won't argue in the mornin'
We'll be makin' love and just let that old calendar turn

All this gettin' off the road has got me ragged to the bone and coming home

What's the wisest plan
When it comes to mixing in with things
That you just don't understand, hmm

Let it alone, let it alone
If it don't concern you, let it alone
Don't go around putting on airs
And meddling in other folks' affairs
If you don't know, say so
Mind your own business and let it alone

Them man and woman, say
You think that it's a crime for them
To carry on that way
Well, you think that you could stop that row
But just as you draw nigh
The lady with the poker

Strikes the gentleman across the eye

Let it alone, let it alone
If it don't concern you, let it alone
They know their business, all right, all right
They practice that way every night
If you go buttin' in, they'll break your chin
So mind your own business and let it alone

Well, you say that love's against you
And on your weary way
Well, lying in the gutter
A drunken man, we'll say
He's lying in the gutter
And you can tell that he's all in
But on his necktie plainly gleams
A great big diamond pin

Let it alone, let it alone
He's not your pal, so let it alone
The man is drunk, it may be true
But the diamond don't belong to you
So shut your eyes and eat some sighs
Turn around and beat it and leave it alone"

Playing nights at the golden horse shoe
And Indian raids

And camouflaged airplanes
And a country boy who don't belong

And it's 109 degrees
Singing carry my back to Virginia
Lord I'm down here on my knees
In the market square while the bells were ringing
Loud to fill the air
Levi gazed his eyes out, through the rocket glare
Beyond the desert and the ocean
To the furthest fields at home
And when the bullets pierced his body
He was already gone

Well sometimes an empty cup
Just overflows

And all that summer was fire and rain
Virgil Lee started nursin' the pain
'Til every one of them songs he would play
Was twisted, falling down

Like a old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut old hickory

Laid him out in his overalls
'Cause when you get too big for your breeches well that's all
Hung his fiddle and his flat top guitar
Up in the high school gym
Nobody remembers his name
And I can't say anyone's to blame
One of these times you gotta hear him play
He was the greatest that's ever been

You can fool all the jokers with diamonds
You can playboy ramblin' roots
You can lie like a penny on the CNO line
But the good Lord knows the truth

Just like a old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut
Old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut old hickory
Oh and that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut old hickory"

Along come a great big flood
Washed everything away

We stepped into the kissing booth
When I puckered my lips
To steal me a kiss
She went and stole my gold tooth

Otep,Adrenochrome Dreams,/o/otep/adrenochrome+dreams_20440803.html,"I had this dream...
Where I woke up
To a grand commotion.
And uhm... I just jumped from the blankets
And whipped the door from its lock,
And rush blindly into the blackness of the hallway.
But there, on all sides
Lying next to each other
Were rows and rows of executioners...

Some were shirtless and __
And throbbing with anticipation.
Sweat delicatley sneaking through their body hair
All were hooded
Some like seventeenth century guillotine henchemen
Others had crudely made hoods
Like scarecrows or ripped ski masks
With slobber from their clenching jaws
And some had burlap masks that looked like they were made of human skin.

Each one held a weapon.
Large mallets
Crudely fashioned axes
And large clubs
Pipes

But I wasn't compelled to retreat.

No.

I was forced to move between them.
Past their swinging weapons
The clubs
The bats
The slicing tools
The shovels
The large and small axes
Boards with nails, staples and razorblades embedded in them
Taking the beating,
Falling down,
Getting up,
Again and again and again and again
Driven to make it out...

At any cost.

And next,
I stumbled into a... This strange marshy world
Where I was oddly drowning in squirrels and other large, starving rodents.
From above, out on the treetops,
Several dolls fell from the branches
And they were hanging
With nooses made of human hair
They started biting and sucking and trying to feed from me...
Trying to enter my belly and some pushed large needles into my veins and...
And as I looked back, some had nails through their hands, torsos and throats.

I was froze.
Dead eyes...
Carbonized...
As I kicked them away
I could see all around me...
Of piles and piles of dead sea life.
Large fish, smelly crustaceans, __

And their soulless empty bodies whispered
A secret language I couldn't decipher but somehow understood.

And their cries were
""Feed me... feed me...""

They wanted me to devour those around them
Chew them up into pieces
And smear them inside their mouths.
And as I turned around
I could see the shape of a woman
Perfect...
Perfectly erotic
Squatting over a pile of these dead things...
And as I ran to her and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!""

And she had no face
And she turned to glass
And suddently cracked
And then exploded into 1000 pieces at my feet.

And just as I took a quick breath,
This world was shoved and desimated
But an intruding tidal wave
Of microorganisms, exploding atoms...

And suddenly moon rose...
Frightened, aching, and alone...
And that's what I remember most...

... The ache.

I can't escape
The ache......."

Otep,Apex Predator,/o/otep/apex+predator_21055588.html,"She's pounding on the door
She's crawling on the floor
Oh, she's so coy...

She's scratching on the walls
She's clawing at the gauze
She's so coy...

She's gnawing on the ropes
She's pulling at the hooks
She's so coy...

Oh, you know she wants it
The way that she taunts me
Damn, she's so coy...

It's the Apex Predator
With a sermon for the listener
Seduce & Destroy...

Your head upon a stick
Would look really sick
But they would call me crazy
For the way I spoke to it

I'd ask about it's day
Did it miss me while I was away?

Tight lipped from the stitches
It wouldn't have much to say

The rest would be kept in a
Tight little dress

Propped up in the corner
A perfect little pet

Locked in a box
So I can keep stock
A trophy to show me
That all is not lost

The writing on the wall
A psalm in napalm
Abandon all hope
But try to stay calm

Bleach to clean the curses
I exist, I'm not the first
Tell my mother I love her
I didn't suffer

Photos & fantasies
Virtuoso of crimes scenes
The Apex Predator...

But why does she look so much like me?

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
I gotta satisfy the thirst

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Death is such a flirt

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
You get what you deserve

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Survival of the worst...

It's the Apex Predator...

I'm the boss...

She's got a broken arm
I've got a broken heart
Boy, she's so coy...

She made a little fire
With a fork & electrical wire
Damn, she's so coy...

Blowtorch nightlight
Switchblade knife fights
Fuck! She's so coy...

Thunder in the distance
Gun shots or missiles?
My smile is artificial
The lock clicks, my eyes fix

The writing on the wall
A psalm in napalm
Abandon all hope
But try to stay calm

Bleach to clean the curses
I exist, I'm not the first
Tell my mother I love her
I didn't suffer

No regrets, no apologies
A self-fulfilling prophecy
The Apex Predator...

All I could smell was her hair...

But where's the fun in that

But where's the fun in that

But why does she look so much like me?

Like worms on a hook
That were plucked from the
Heart of the bodies of gods
For the wretched & lost...

Like worms on a hook
That were plucked from the
Heart of the bodies of gods
That men had forgot...

Like worms on a hook
That were plucked from the
Heart of the bodies of gods
That were rotting to dust!

Otep,Baby's Breath,/o/otep/babys+breath_20910500.html,"The soft sound of snow crunching underfoot gives me comfort. Her building is at the end of the block. She lives on the north side. Bottom floor. Middle apartment. I see her. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 steps. Wrong key. Lock clicks. She drops her coat and scarf in the entry and kicks off those... vixen shoes. She shuffles to the kitchen and pours a glass of scotch. (I am inside) She lights a cigarette and blows the smoke over the match. (She doesn't notice)

The gray smog rises from her lips like a cremation furnace. The simple elegance of this quiet moment is almost irresistible. (But, I wait)

She slugs back the scotch, finishes her smoke and ashes it in the sink. She unties her hair and enters the hallway, past the childless bedroom with the empty crib, past the altar coated in wax like a wedding cake, and the tiny packages of meat, dead flowers, and baby's breath.

She enters the bathroom, where she undresses. She sits on the edge of the bath. Her naked body folded in half, heavy tits hanging like mushy stalactites over her lap. (Oh, precious) She closes her eyes and holds her head as if it might float away.

For a moment, my thoughts drift again, this time to the hammer I am holding. The handle is smooth as bone, the forged steel head is heavy, and I feel powerful. She reaches for the faucet and I snap back to the moment. Bubbles brim the edge of the tub. Her fingers check the water temperature and I am ready.

I move behind her. She doesn't hear. I swing the hammer. She doesn't see. I crack her skull. She's in the tub. Facedown. I am drowning her, mashing her head to the bottom, knifing the claw of the hammer into her spine and ribs over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and... 

Her body stops pretending to care and surrenders as it is supposed to. Just to be sure, I press hard, keeping her head beneath the bloody water a few moments more. Her neck snaps, her nose breaks, and her face collapses against the bottom of the tub. I see my reflection in the mirror and soapy foam has formed a half smile over the black nylon mask I am wearing.

I lean to her. The water glistens like glass. I hover over the surface, soft breath causing tiny quakes, and whisper, ""I have done to you what nature has done to me.""

She doesn't reply.

I stand and turn off the light. The room is dark and empty. Just like I am now."

Cuz the earth and space gave birth to this paleface

My brain cells swell - the intellects extreme

Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
To the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence

As I -- skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land

Its authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
Damaging challengers -- resurrection, disorder

A monument of crisis - I strikes this - your dead
Line my nest with your soul -- cleansed in bloodshed

Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control

Battle ready
Souls violate parole

Commanding the mic -- striking up a verb-fest
Mass destruction is my function - time to put it to the test

In combat --- attacking since way back
In the days I drew praise for the way that I slayed facts

Formulating flows in revolutionary science
Its the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance

Freaking techniques -- this creature of speech
We feel the fury of devastation cuz we tasted defeat

I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
Royalty divides my soul -- in this role I'm revered

As the pinnacle -- lyrical master -- queen of disaster
I ruin brain fluid -- the unknown is what I'm after

Shaking up the world -- just like the 2nd coming of christ
-- when I write -- thrice divine with this goddess sight

Words will flow -- wounds will grow
Ewe know -- bones will be exposed from the force that I unload

Its the soul eater!! -- mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod

Gather the flock -- alarm your block
Tell them the shepherds have come and got the keys to unlock

A holy war -- thru your veins it courses
More lyrical artillery than the armed forces

Supernatural -- styles be volatile
Its the mind manipulator -- the war child

Come!
Shadow soldiers!

We came to defy - living life as a lie
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly

To watch you die! -- agonizing cries are heard in stereo
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios

In the line of fire -- watching empires fall
Into attack position -- eliminate all!!!

Otep,Bible Belt,/o/otep/bible+belt_20910502.html,"There are nights, so vacant and hushed, I can feel the texture of my tattered soul moving within me. Black tar, dripping, sticky and thick. A soft, slow secretion of indifference slopping through the hollow suit I use as a body.

They say these are the words of a damaged mind.

But not I.
To me, this is insurgency.

I used to dream of being inside the womb. Fetal universe, black holes and emptiness. Orbiting the massive planet of my mother's booming heart. Tiny yolk body, tethered like an astronaut, adrift in the tranquil spume of desolate bliss. Tiny fingers inching from chubby stems, reaching for that great thumping whoosh of blood and power that wobbles like a snarling god above me. My fibrous head, translucent as a bell jar, would search with great staring eyes deep into the godless dark for a light, for a sign, for anything other than indifference. But the universe would never oblige.

Look upon me: a daughter of a child and a monster.

Frozen without cold, feeling nothing, unsure, uninspired, veins full of air, soul fading into the umbra.

Who are they to say what is moral when they are broken?
Who are they to say anything about us?

All this, all this,
And I want to sledgehammer
And leave nothing but dust

To dust
To dust
To dust

Let's lick my wound

So they say I took his head
So they say he was a scourge

The best thing
They ever did
In this life
Was let me live

Digging swiftly out of hell
Madness helps me save myself
Crooked spoons on every wall
Genocide lines the halls
Ten guage needles and a prayer
Smearing sin everywhere

Bodies falling from thin air

Choosing to lose my mind

Shining in your eyes

Swallowed, tasted, enjoyed, digested, and then shat back on the blankets.... Did she tell you? Did she speak of this? Her terror for once enjoying herself? Did she describe the beautiful screams, the scratching, the touching, the pulling, the sucking? Did she tell you i buried my fingers in her deep enough to cause pregnancy? Did she explain the rhythm, mmm the pulse, the gathering climax? Did she pretend not to care but you could see it in her eyes? Did she giggle a little about being canniblized? Did she tell you that?

But then I was shaking stares, I’ll recite the scared lines to ignite a heroic flare of bite marks down your neck and thighs and we’ll share all of our secrets in a single breath. 
Fall in love and never relent.

And you’ll know we were always meant to be.

If I gotta go down, it'll be swinging
You will see you can't break me
I'm not gonna take it anymore

Keep your knuckles bloody
No more tears
No more fears
Strike the anchors
Use your anger
Defy the master
Break the rules

Keep your pride locked up inside
It belongs to you
They think they're stronger, bigger, better
But they're just jealous cowards
Fuck what they say
Fuck what they think
About us

Keep your voices raised
Keep your knuckles bloody
Keep your voices raised
Keep your knuckles bloody
Cowards

And now that you see me
Now that you see me
Now that you see me
Now that you see me
You are terrified
You are terrified

Where my secrets come to meet
In catacombs of shadow

Better living through chemistry.

Money fixes everything.

Teach them young...

To love & hate, 
To fight & obey...

I won't die like I've done many times before
I'm gonna run

Like guerrilla cinema

Belts and, and wooden spoons
Flies in the afterbirth
Shadows across my mind

Smiling but dead, smiling but dead
Smiling but dead, smiling but dead
Smiling but dead, smiling but dead

Crawling on linoleum kitchens
TV streaming death
And corporate consciousness into my brain
Cracked porcelain sinks
Covered with insects and dirty dishes

The early morning anxiety of, of grade school
Dark stockings to hide the bruises
The secret friends, festive holidays
And everyone in their, in their Sunday best
Pretending to like each other

Generations and generations
Of loneliness, sad mistakes
Stealing away in the dead of night
To escape stiff jawed henchmen
In, in the hungry trucks of an angry slumlord
Miles and miles away

Patience and understanding
Waking on the side of the road
Hissing radiator, hoses cracked like, like burned skin
And days so hot
A nuclear holocaust would've felt like
A cyclonian blizzard

I remember the first time
I felt it alive inside me, turning
But the dead weight moving
Within the folds of its winged embrace

Opening and sliding those black feathers
Inches at a time
Its beak, its, its feet
Pushing and pushing and, and pushing
And digging into the membrane

And I remember going numb
And listening to it hum
I'm feeling it move in its mysteries
Exploring me with power

I remember this
And I know I never had a chance
There was never any escaping it

One more prey dies today.
On sheets of flesh and doom
Shivering in endless shade like criminals...
The stain still remains
And I promise you, it never goes away.

When the young blood eats the light.

Burned and bright, has arrived [?]
Lost in flight, on golden molted wings.

And it sounds like... Armageddon
Sounds like... Armageddon
Sounds like... C** and drink with me....
C** and drink with me

And I remember him fucking me,
And I remember liking it,
I didn't know any better...

And I remember the smell, and the pain, and the shame...
And I remember being afraid and thinking everyday,
Every single day.. That it was my fault...

Oh, but what happened to that little girl?
Who used to dream of one day ruling the world,
Who used to draw pretty pictures in my room---beneath the moon
Destroying to create
Softly praying to ""God""

What do I do now?
What do I do now?

As I secretely masturbate...
But then I'd hear his hooves coming down the floor
With a Bible in his hand...

Softly opening my door and he'd say...

Daughter! The day of your attonement is due!
Well there's 3 million sinners out there...
And that includes you!

No daddy, don't... No daddy, don't...
Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
No, I don't want to be free! No, I don't want to be free!
So take your dick out of me!
Please take your dick out of me! Please take your dick out of me! Please take
Your dick out of me!

I'm bleeding, it's not fair...

You see, there's this little place I like to go...
I like to run and hide--deep inside,
Where all the nightmares are real, and all the monsters come alive,
Oh, but the things I've seen in soft, soft visions and terrifying prophecies,
Like serpents on the take and gods coming in all sizes and shapes
Nothing seems fulfilling anymore..

Well your temples are swollen in deceit and the body of your missionary,

He's rotting... Rotting in defeat mama?

Mama!
Are the aliens coming to take us away? (mama?)
Is armageddon gonna happen again today?

Look what he did to me! Why did you do it to me?!
How could you do it to me! Why did you do it to me?!

I will not cry... I will not cry...
I--Prefer--To--Die! Than live--this life--of lies!

Kill what you can ---- challenge everything
Vengeance is mine...

Hey, I'm sorry baby...
Please come back inside... We can laugh a little... And live and die,
No wait. See, I got this hot pot of jonestown tea
And it's been brewing for you and me,
Oh, it only takes one sip,
Come on baby,
Surrender your lips,
I can take you someplace nice...
I can take you... Someplace nice!

Breed my disease, be my disease...
Breed my disease, be my disease...
And vengeance will be mine
It's closer than you think...

So I entered his room at 32 past noon
With my little ritual knife...
I cut out his tounge
Liberated his wife
She loved me for it other world woman,

Well, that's what she called me (Destroyer),
The one who sets you free, (c** and drink with me)

We all die like cartoons, surrender your children,

To part that haze and slice your soul in pieces
To sing you a lullaby as I tie you to the slab

To shave your head with a dulling razor
As you watch the splattered mirror above you
To break your ribs individually with a rock hammer
To shatter your shin bones with a shovel

To burn your fingers and toes
To a necrotic black flickering nitrogen
To crack your teeth with a splintered club
To pierce with your limbs with a nail gun

To silence your cry, to let them in your eyes
To sharpen my favorite slicing device
And take your arms at the elbow
To keep you alive for a few moments longer

To smell your fear
To cover your body with kisses and kerosene
To watch you burn as my human sacrifice
To hear you scream in agony

The popping of your flesh cracking as it cooks
To feel your child smile, the one you betrayed
The one you took for nothing, for selfishness
In a perfect world I would get my wish"

In my hand
Stabbed
In the center of chaos
To write out the light
That lives within me
That sought to break
The darkness
Eating me alive... 

For hours I would sit
Dreaming, drawing
Writing, believing

My arm in a sling
One eye swollen shut... 

Whispering
There would be a way out
There must be
A way out... 

Focused
On the paper
On the floor
That held me
Heavy as a stone
In the corner
Of that tiny room
Floating on a river
Of Imagination... 

Isolated
On my knees
Seeded in the soil
With girls
Younger than I
Holding their backs
Arching puffed bellies
Stuffed full with their
Infected children... 

Celestial incest... 
Terrestrial insects... 

We slept in boxes
That doubled as coffins
Because
Some were smart enough
To die... 

But not I
Stubborn little cyclops...

To fight..."

Packed her bags and called the cab
Analyzing every part of the master plan

Perfumed her breast

To abandon the nest

Looking for the liar

In his leather chair

He tries to hide
Pretends hes on a call
And averts his eyes

Offers her a seat and says
""don't be shy""

When all I do is suffer
No color!
Why can't I see any color at all
Why can't I see any color at all
Why can't I see any color at all
No color!

[Verse 2]
I remember black clouds blooming
As I shouldered the blame
The gun metal grey on that trembling day
Remember thunder
Remember fear
Remember still
I remember biting my lip to stifle a laugh
I tried to say your name
But all that came out was a whisper
“Hell is empty the devil’s here”
Now you disintegrate
Levitate into memory
Elevate was it hate that got you to see
My mistake it was fate that brought you to me
Now I'm losing

[Chorus]
Why can't I see any color at all
When I dream about those days
How did I let these images drain away
When all I do is suffer
No color!
Why can't I see any color at all
Why can't I see any color at all
Why can't I see any color at all
No color!

[Bridge]
I think I thought but I forgot
I think I think too much
I have a problem for every answer
Striking at the ocean with a broken hammer
I think I think too much
I think I think too much

[Chorus]
Why can't I see any color at all
When I dream about those days
How did I let these images drain away
When all I do is suffer

Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me

Run with me
Run with me

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not goin' very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl, we're almost home
Ya, c'mon!

We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside the evenin'

This will remind you the razors are ready

Room after room I hunt the darkened world for you
Casket black, dried and cracked, ashes among the dunes
But I've gone blind in time to lose you to the dark

To sacrifice our wounded minds
These awkward trances seek insanity

Misery

What heals me kills me

I'm a natural assasin
A massacre in action
I've never known remorse
Or felt any compassion
This is my drug of choice
The reason demons rejoice
My rage remains a beast untamed

Glutton

Regret without redemption
A wounded animal
Afraid of my reflection
I am an epidemic

The willing weak deserve defeat
The penance will be savage

Bi-polar
Self-abortion
Mind fuck
Can't escape
These chains
Of shame

Swollen in the mud
Barely
Standing still
Hungry for the hunt
And the thrill
Of the kill

I've always been a shadow
Content with my disease
You'll never see it coming
'Cause you never notice me

To exterminate the plague soiling my brain
I put the pen to the pad until the madness drains
Cuz words are colossal aggressive not docile
Infectious like a brothel no need to get hostile
Calling all apostles united we stand
They bleeding out they nostrils I'm wicked with hands
Throwing vicious combinations witness devastation
I just fucked your soul annihilation

Feel the sensation tickle & grow
Spreading over your mind & taking control
A noble savage on a rampage war is all that i know
Feeding hungry heads defeating all your heros

Art saves make the pain a weapon you can use

From the moment I wake it rains grenades
So I scribble on the page & reality fades
I walk the Scottish moors with pagans on forest floors
Test the sacraments & conjure up thunderstorms
I hunt with Cernunnos & dance with satyrs
Conquer Rome in a day & battle armored invaders

Infested with ticks this existence is shit
All these traitors in the trees while the napalms drips
Words burn their lips like old roach clips
Holy as I infected by this

Art saves make the pain a weapon you can use

Serv asat

I liberate the devils in my head
Through the paragraphs crafted by my pen

These demons drip on the page
My blind, multi-eyed children of rage

I could'a took a bat to the back of his head
Or dropped a napalm bomb on the bed as she slept

But i split & wrote it down instead
At least now you know who you're fucking with
I'm sick but I'm free
You're weak & I'm built for the siege

Alone
Shivering in the dark
Place your head between my thighs

And talk to god
Eating it's heart
But you will not feast on me today
This is how the world died
Who will slay this thing
I forgive you
Who will play the butcher and
End my suffering
I forgive you
I fucked the minds of the masses with the fingers of liberty
This is not a threat
This is not
A threat

Prisoners here

No one is going to change things

I will not one day wake with a different disguise

Lose weight

Cold, Shivering, choking on the green gas that seeps from your nostrils

Born in a brothel as you wheeze and cough a congestive rythme until you speak and the vapors slither out and fill the room and i fall further into your heavy diatribes of doom

Full clip, one in the chamber, saftey off, an ink pen with a poison tip, a shotgun, a syringe loaded with pure fucking heroine, beside me an open window whispers it's invitation to enter it's mouth
Begs to... eat me so I can plummet to the rock bottom of it's empty belly
Or I could back out of here, slowly
Without notice into the opening day
Blind my eyes from the sun and ride this fucking rediculous adventure to the end
And keep fighting and keep laughing and and watch my flesh die
Still doing whatever the FUCK i want however the FUCK i want on my FUCKING terms
So be it

Ill remain and earn it
A great life, a good death
Every FUCKING day

Crying out in the wilderness

Mindless quarry
Less than livestock

Wet worms of hate

Hidden beasts run wild
Until the prey subsides
The hunger will remain

Two pigs wearing suits brought the news
That I'm wanted by the bank
They say the rent is due
Ceaser's on to you
So you better remember your place

Then they outsourced my job and gave a raise to my boss
Bailed out the banks, but billed me for the loss
They say we must submit and be one with the machines
'Cause the kingdom of fear needs compliance to succeed

So waterboard the kids for fun, it's all the rage
And play born-again American, reistance is the game
Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

""The revolution will be monetized and streamed live via renegade wi-fi""

The clinic said I'm sick, toxic and impure
But there isn't any cure for the poor or uninsured
So we live our digital lives on multiple screens
And we forget that the blood of the workers grease the machines
In the psalm of the fiends, love discriminates
While the fat cats feed the rats their dose of daily cake

So waterboard the kids for fun, it's all the rage
And play born-again American, resistance is the game

Smash the control machine

Smash the control machine
Happy little slaves for minimum wage
Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Haters, betrayers, liars and thieves

She sold her soul for designer clothes
For the perfect lips and the perfect nose
The winner in the end always owns the most
Reality TV told her so

Money changer, greedy banker, this is the people's house
My minister has a sinister plan to save my soul with a credit card scam
Exploitation is contagious for the selfish and self-inflated
Start a war, use the poor, watch our profits soar and soar

We've become a nation of wolves, ruled by sheep
Owned by swine, overfed and put to sleep
And while the media elite decrees what to think
I am wide awake, on the edge and on the brink

So when Atlas shrugs, and the fountainhead bleeds
And when Wall Street apostles preach a gospel of greed
I'll renounce the fame of this glutinous age
And be a born-again American, resistance is to blame

Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Haters, betrayers, liars and thieves
Smash the control machine
A nation of wolves, ruled by sheep

Preaching werewolf prayers on our nightly flight
Gestating all we ate in the pale moonlight,

Bringing kingdoms under siege with the words that I control,
Got an arsenal, ganja blunts & such
Only love can set me free from this Patriarchal clutch,
Speaking testaments in our secret dialogue
While the drones begin to feast on the faces of the hog,
Take a walk in the wilderness of your mind
Before your soul decides to die & leaves infinity behind

Lost in ecstasy!

I'm collecting intellects & exhaling solar systems,
I decree mutiny....
It's revolution us against the Patriarchy,
The assembler of souls full of knowledge untold
While I'm spinning webs of wisdom, prophecies unfold,
Into attack mode to decipher the code
Of Babylon's terror spawn - tyranny reloads,
Into the mental stasis - apathy erases
The urgency of rage & it's frightening little places,
Prepare for warfare
The afterbirth of knowledge is America's nightmare

What have I become!!!???

Something's taking over me...

Avenge me... Avenge me.

Paint your face with the blood of the weak
Self sacrifice everyone you meet
Screaming demons in my veins
Voices of the dead nurturing my pain

To watch you burn
Killed your leaders
To help you learn

My lip drip
Secrets of the flesh

They fold into a blade
And beg: ""make me wet""

I can't help myself
SWEET TOOTH

Seduced by my obsession
I'll build my own religion
So i can taste the secret places
That set you on fire

(you are my favourite
Most dangerous
Fascination)

(v.2)

Tempt me devil
Teach me what you think i need

Her fingers are Caesar
Slowly conquering me

We move like Buddhas
Twisted in a silent scream

Our souls explode
& merge with the Shiva frequency

The meat is sweet
But is it love? or is it lies?

To burn in the heat
Of the fire in her eyes

My lips drip
A soft song of love & flesh

That folds into a blade
And beg: ""make me wet""

I can't help myself
SWEET TOOTH

Seduced by my obsession
I'll build my own religion
So i can taste the secret places
That set you on fire

(v.3)

Tempt me
Teach me
Feed me
Heal me

I feel like being bad

The tyrant of my desire
A blushing rosebud begging to be plucked

I feel like being...

Inside of you, baby
It was an atomic testing site

Explosive, corrosive
But oh, what a delight

They say the body's a temple
& desires a sacrifice

Devils speak, angels weep
For my SACRED APPETITES

Seduced by my obsession
I'll build my own religion
So i can taste the secret places
That set you on fire

Explosive, corrosive
But oh, what a delight

Devils speak, angels weep
For my sweet tooth's sacrifice

...take my temperature baby
This is what you taste like

When our souls collide
I can conquer eveything
That defeats me in life

Feed me
Eat me
Drink me

Promise i'll never be bored
And i'll be yours tonight

This is what you taste like
This is what you taste like
This is what you taste like"

Too far fetched? Beyond your imagination?

I'll rise to the occasion launching an invasion
Words be abrasive -- Joints eye be lacing
Sacrificin mics to ignite the celebration
Xen & Otep -- a volatile combination
It's just amazing, poetically we blazing
Styles be liquid and flow like irrigation

-- So make the preparation...
Defeat is bittersweet, It's all you'll be tasting
Sounding battle stations - My war face in place
It's the renaissance - Time to switch up and change
The path the paragraphs infiltrate your brain
Total annihilation - Your existence has been erased
[Chorus:]

T. Are. I. C.
Rising from the ashes to lead the wretched masses

Back to the sufi shack - Defyin all the fascists
I'm david to goliath or delilah to your samson
Words burn with passion -- Mentally enhancin
The satellites in flight - How long before it crashes
Kickin ass like cassius -- Spreadin rhymes like rashes
Falling like avalanches - Crumbled and crushed
My wild womyn get to sinning -- Know the power of us
I'm callin your bluff -- Is it freedom or death?
We're gettin it on in Babylon - Chokin on gods breath
The infinite connects true soldiers alive
The tribe will survive when armageddon arrives

[Chorus:]

Take no prisoners
The revolution is coming
Cowards beware... Fuck!
The revolution is coming
-- My war serpents rattle when it's time to battle [Mental Midgets]

I got a fist full of shit for you flies to feast
You lost control of your soul 'cause your minds deceased
I'm blastin -- The worlds in ashes -- From the invasion
Unfulfilled satisfactions & chemical reactions
--- every word's annihilation!!
My fate there's no escape -- Life itself is the assassin

Come on!!

Gnawed on by rats
Given a lobotomy
Half-drowned in ice baths...

Of choking smoke

To bring their ivory faces
Buried deep within their wings...

Tender sheep
Boys and girls
I made a lamp out of him
And now
He is the light of the world...

The nun who shot smack from
The stolen tithing cash
I burned her to ash but her
Teeth made a fine pearly necklace...

The senator who buried
His mistress on the back nine
His skull is a goblet for my favorite wine...

You see I need these beautiful moments
When I am unyoking my opponents
Limb from limb
In the knotted irons of combat...

It's as close to true intimacy
As I can ever hope to reach...

Naked monsters
In the dark
Ripped to shreds & torn apart...

The sheets will be our evidence
Of the blasphemies we invent...

Otep,Thots,/o/otep/thots_10197961.html,"Nothings changed
The Senates still corrupt
And the Emporer remains insane

And everyday
Is a new strain of slaughter

Supply lines are less protected
Evil on all sides

I can smell the death on your flesh
Creeping in

Trapped within the twisting fingers of fear
And all I see is you
And all I see is you

That face
Those eyes

Burning like leprosy

I can see you there
Poisoning the air

Prostituting Nationalism

And I want to attack
To rip out your heart and lay your flat on your back

And vomit a world of agony and truth
Into your throbbing illness of memory

And hate guides our way
And hate guides our way

I long for the icy slap of a belt across my back
For the acceptance of death and blind cave war

The giving sleep of depression
The sweet elucidation of savage, meaningless aggression

Chiseled in the meaty forearms of Mother Jupiter
And his slave disciples

In the harem tents - outside
Just beyond the edges - eye ride

A cycloptic mare in the fires of imagination

Feeding my disease
Feeding my disease
A river of plagues

I need something to remind me I'm still sinning
That pain in important
That words matter
That healing in possible

That I am not alone... In this

Guard the houses
Triple the watch
Maidens, dig up your sorcery
Sirens, sharpen your rocks

You will eat my pain again

Whatever you need
Whatever you need
Whatever you need

Stars litter the sky
The moon is shining high

This soft, September night
Two lovers creep out of sight

A maiden dressed in white
With copper hair

Restless for adventure
She don't care

That the wolf is in disguise
She's been ensnared

He got the devil in his eyes
& stylish flair

He shoves her to the ground
Her soul begins to drown

A sky full of eyes where the stars should be
A sky full of eyes watching silently

You're a woman now
You've become a woman now

The weight of the cradle has broken the bough
You've become a woman now

Mama woke me up at dawn
She helped me get my best dress on

She braided flowers in my hair
So sweet was the summer air

I'm to meet my groom down by the sea
A perfect stranger to correct me

The judges arrive in pairs of 3
Don't be scared, just relax & breathe

Good girls hold real still
Surrender your free will

They cracked the crown
To pluck the pearl

Here, on the jagged edge
Of the world

You're a woman now
You've become a woman now

The weight of the cradle has broken the bough
You've become a woman now

Standing on the welfare line
My daughter clinging to my side

I see the faith in her eyes
I whisper, baby we will be just fine

I'll get a good job
& we'll find a new place

I'll work real hard
& we'll make our escape

I promise you i will get us through
Together we will bloom

You're a woman now
You've become a woman now

The weight of the cradle has broken the bough
You've become a woman now

You're a woman now
You're a woman now
You're a woman now"

I was born to raise hell, so swells of fire comfort me
What y'all know about dat?- not a goddamn thing!
I was raised in poverty
No safe space - inside the house or on the streets
but still I made my dream come true
Not like you motherfuckers who settled for monotony
I don't listen to hemorrhoids
I don't listen to that shit you speak
but if you got something to say
you know where to find me
either fucking my sidechick or strategizing mutinies

And who's gonna do the fightin'? Not him.
It'll be his cultural bitch boys versus the poor

Yeah, y'all thought y'all could stop me?
Well take your best shot - gimme all you got
I was built for this
I was built for the siege
We got militarized cops
murderin' unarmed black kids at traffic stops
They lettin' white kids off after rapin' a girl
behind a dumpster, his rich daddy got him off
And what happened to you brother
Have you forgotten who grew you inside their womb?
What if that was your mother?
Your sister, your daughter?
Your wife, your girlfriend?
What if that was your brother?
Would you just let him off scot-free
knowing that he could walk the streets and find another?
If so, then you're just as guilty as he
Because then you're an enabler
You normalize this behavior
Silence equals complicity
And if you're feelin' offended, then these rhymes were meant for you
If you're feelin' empowered, then we got work to do

The rain had stopped and all was silent
Except for the dripping in the trees
His heavy breath, his heartbeat... 

His eyes focused and found me
I spoke like a god
Gently I said, ""I have a webcam
""And I like to video myself
""Binding... 
""Torturing... 
""Murdering""... 

He began to scream with the stitches held tight
He rattled the cage and pulled at the lock
With all his might... 

So I electrocuted the bars and
He fell asleep from the charge and
I prepared to make him
A star... 

He has a webcam
So I helped him understand... 

When he woke
I asked him to sing me a song
He obliged but was often off key
So I removed his lower jaw... 

Now his tongue juts out like a slimy slug
But he' so eager to please
Tapping the melody on the bars of this large cage
With un-clipped nails he plays... 

And once I've had my fun
Bringing dark justice to this
Pathetic goblin
I will
Burn... 
Probe... 
Break... 
And Drain... 

And he will be scorched in a bath of pain... 

I will drop him into the misty bayou
Where he will be a feast for
Serpents &
Insects &
Beasts &
All the putrid life of the murky bog... 

And as he sinks, and as he screams
Into the lens of his webcam
I will play a farewell
An ode to the demons
Waiting for him
In Hell... 

He has a webcam
So I helped him
Understand
How
They
Felt..."

Crumbs for the crows slow empire of worms we sing the

& i'll let you go
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?

Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth
& I must scream

Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth.....

(v.2)

And somewhere
In a normal neighborhood
In a normal house

A normal family
Is falling apart

And down the hall
The little ones hide

Frozen as fossils
As their mother cries

Listening
Now that the others have gone silent

The walls blister
As sister rises in defiance

Here
In the depths of the labyrinth
She will make her mark

She travels the cavern
Searching for the Minotaur

& she finds him
Asleep in the heat
Of his triumphs

A sparkle of flame
Flickers in her eye

She nudges him softly
And says ""Daddy, wanna give me a try?""

And he rumbles & roar
""You must lick honey from a thorn
If you are to survive this night""
And she says, "" no, i'd rather pick a fight.""

And he reaches out and she's on the attack
And he's face down and she straddles his back

And as the moonlight fades from his eyes
She sighs
""come on, what's the matter?""

Don't you love me?
Don't YOU love me?

DON'T YOU LOVE ME?

Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth
& I must scream

Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth AND I MUST SCREAM!

What we are
You too will become

Liberated children
Of a bloody-hungry god

Sedition!

They used to HANG women like me
Strange fruit on the poplar tree!

They used to OWN women like me
Necessary accessories!

They used to BURN women like me
To quell the fires of liberty

In the blessed fertile crescent
THEY STILL STONE WOMEN LIKE ME!

And one day you will say
Just look at her now!

...and as everything fades to black
...and as the jackals laugh in the aftermath

I'm not yours anymore"
Otep,Wurd Becomes Flesh,/o/otep/wurd+becomes+flesh_21186505.html,"Can you hear them out there? Can you hear them out there? The war drums, the battle cries, calling you to dance, calling you to die. Oh, can you hear them OUT THERE!!!? Securing the new religion with mindless, violent acts. Are you sure you want this? Well do you believe in the revolution? Are you ready? Let me see, let me see it. Children, now it's time for a story. And it's about this girl I know and how she used to trust people like priests and police and politicians, and parents and cowardly fucking presidents and people of power...and all she got in return was pain, but all she got in return was pain. Oh all she got in return...was...PAIN! And his reply, oh with the devil in his eye was shhh...(hahaha.) Just be quiet now...(hahaha.)
See it was, uh, a night of lies, it was a sick quick compromise, it was...it was the devil in his eyes, it was innocence, slithering down her thighs, it was...it was his fucking fist in (*punching sound* no...NOOO...NO! don't, stop) her fucking side and why, WHY! why??? Cause there was a baby (no) barely three months alive, but I survived (haha). Too stubborn to succumb to the dripping jaws of the dominant paradigm. Cause it began as all tragedies do...with a bruise and a blister, a lie and a whisper. It's spirit so deep, it's just out of reach, these hooks and...splinterrrRRRRRsss

Hey. Is there anyone here that would like to confess they're sins to me tonight? (I just want to...) Place your face between my thighs and talk to god. Well tell me, tell me terrible things, that's fine. Tell me your most beautiful fantasy. Tell me, tell me...tell...me...tell me why the soul must rot. Tell me why you lack a single fucking original thought. TELL MEEEE!!!! Through these jungles of fire and past these mountains of peer power. Well this world, this world is a fucking holocaust and it's...eating me. Religion has failed us. Our leaders have failed us. All we have left...is art. And the living fires into the eternal infernal. So bring out your dead. Here comes the warhead. Plagues, pestilence, disease, the fall...of the great American suicide

Hey, wait, what do we have here? Is it complete and total mutiny of the senses...(yeah, yeah, yeah). A secret society performing social experiments and spiritual archaeology. Hiding beneath the cloak of heavy truth, the brutality of reality is that there is not one absent moment that I can stop being me. i will tell you a story, 5 lifetimes old, i will tell you a secret, i will let you see with my words, i will let you burn and observe for where i go you can only follow so come with me... i can show you faces, take you to these far away places, bring back all those hidden memories, all those terrifying moments of emptiness, rumaging through piles of life, searching for my identity just come with me...no no!!!! i dont want to go, i dont want to feel, i dont want to think, i dont want to rememeber any fucking thing!!!! just come with me ok ok ok but this is the last fucking time...

And I heard it...and it was like, it was like 3:37 or something and...someone in the alley was murdering an animal for its skin. (*Screaming*) And it's so cold, it's so cold out there, I can still remember it...SCREEEEEEAMMMMM!It was like they were skinning a newborn...baby. (It sounds like...) Oh...and it sounds like...Armageddon. (*whispers*)

This is a song called cutter. Same sound its the same sting, its the same collapse of everything, its the same slice, same blade, same lie, same old vein i hurt to heal now i know its real i hurt to heal so i can feel i hurt to heal but i dont understand i just want to be better then i am

The wind will not comfort me, Not the silence of the night, Not the shade of the blossoming moon Or the wisdom of the infant stars Or my beloved insecurities Or these loving scars. Swollen, completely broken, And mostly, well, still frozen In the insanity of needing you To chase the wolves away. Beside me, in the fire, Asleep, soft and perishable, For as long... As the moment... Lasts"

My girl has been hanging out with this other girl
Let me talk about...

Verse 1:
Where is my girlfriend, I've been calling
She aint picked up(picked up)
Somethings's fishy, she wont hit me
Now I'm sitting here like what the... (what the what the)
This is so unusual, she never did it like this before
She usually calls me back within an hour
I bet she's out with what's her name
The girl that doesn't have a man
Assumptions in my mind got me confused girl

Hook:
Sometimes she can't keep her pretty hands off me
But when she's with her girlfriend she don't even speak
She can spot a pretty girl faster than I can
Tells me that she loves me but I'm tryna understand
I think my girl is bi yi yi yi yi yi yi(3x's)
Should I say goodbye, should I give it a try
I think my girl is.

Verse 2:
Secret conversations in my face they talking low(they talkin low)
Matching tatoos to the bathroom
At the same time there it goes(ooo)
This is so unsual, never been thru this before
Affection aint the same when she around('round her)
I wonder if I'm trippin, visions of them kissin
Now I wanna know the truth cuz

It was almost like you were laying there
And the shirt that you wore of mine
Took it off and threw it across the chair
Now its kinda hard to get you off my mind
When I keep seeing you everywhere
For example like that lipstick on that glass of wine, damn
Sitting right over there

And I cant play it off like we're friends like I used to
No, I cant pretend like I used to
So now I'm laying in my bed thinking bout you
And what do I do

Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you
Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
I feel so weak, so hard to breath
But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
I'm coming down with the case of you

Trying not to think about you only got me missing you more
And loneliness ain't no cure
Though it was over about now
But no, not yet
Pulled the covers up to my head
Now im feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry
With just the thought of you on my mind
Its kinda crazy, what a mess im in
I cant believe this is happening

And I cant play it off like we're friends like I used to
No, I cant pretend like I used to
So now I'm laying in my bed thinking bout you

Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do
I'm coming down with the case of you

Now this ain't no common cold
What I feel is original
And I know there is a remedy
When you bring your body back to me

Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you
Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes
I feel so weak, so hard to breath

It started out like any other day but it was any thing but
Something bout the way the moon was shining something seemed so different ooh
Got in the car but didn't have no reason swear I was driving but something else was leading me
Lost all track of time (damn) the next thing you won't believe

At 9 o'clock I saw her
By 10 I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock it happened I gotta blame

Midnight
I was caught up it's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
Blame it on midnight
If she found out about it would it be a good excuse
Midnight
It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick her clothes drop she's on top and I don't even wanna stop no
It made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight

I'm still here I know I'm in trouble but imma finish what I started
My heart is telling me to leave here but my body's saying stay longer
We going strong while my cell phone blowing up

Lost all track of time (damn) the s** is just to good to leave

Scream, scream, permanent on the team, like a Bantu, or a duke,
Or a Just For Me! No lie, relax, lay down, you need a t-shirt.
You can sleep in the bed with me, at the foot of the bed, with your feet first.
And, I will twirk you, you the only good smoking,
Puffing better than purple, girl. I hope you fertile, girl.
So we can have a baby boy or a baby girl. To Chuck E.

You Know Sometimes You Get In Situations
And When you Make That Move
You Gotta Be Committed
She Know What I Mean

[Verse 1:]
We Were Better Off Friends
But The Magic Of The Night Had Us Holdin Each Otha Tight
We Should've Kept It Right There
But The Movie Got Boring And you Wore Those Jeans I Like
I Glanced At Your Pretty Feet
Your s*** Hands Rubbin On My Chest, Should I Kiss you
I Heard A Voice Say Yes
Next
We Were Undressin Not Realizein We shouldn't Be Doin This

[Chorus:]
What Are We Doin
What Have We Done
What Have We Ruined
How Did This Happen
Were We Just Blacked Out
What Are We Doin
What Are We Doin
What Have We Done
Baby I'm Trippin
Cause After We Cut All The Feeling Was Gone
Girl What Did We Do

[Verse 2:]
They Say Some Things Are Better Off As Just A Fantasy
What Came Over Me
I Did Not Lose Control
It Must've Been Those Jeans
It Was The Way She Fit In Those Jeans
I can't Even Remember If It Was Good Or Not
All I Know Is That Our Temperature Was Boiling Hot
Can't Believe I Just Made Love To My Dear Friend
I Pray That This Isn't Damaging In The End

[Hook:]
Lack Of Communication, Got Us Both In The Situation
Now There's No Way Out, No Way Out
Cause We can't Turn Back Time, No

We're Staring At The Ceiling With The Cover Tuck Pulled Up To Our Necks
Like O
Should've Never Let you Come Here Alone No No
I Know I Just Enjoy Seeing you Naked
Now I can't Look, Now I can't Look
We Did This, It's A Price We Have To Pay
Now There's Nothin To Say

[Verse 3: Rap]
She Was A Friend Of Mine
Fine, Slim Waistline
I Never Thought She'd Be Feelin Me, Never Seen The Sign
My Homie Said I'll Eventually Hit It A While Back
I Told Him Naw, She Fam, It Aint Like That
I Found Myself Starin At That Azz A Couple Times
Threw With Out A Sight In Mind
Been Knowin Her Since I Was Nine
But A Moment Alone In A Soft Bed Changed Everything
Never Thought That We Would Come To This Extreme

Fading sun, what have I done
Come so close to what I need most
Nothing Left here

Left behind all intertwined
Lost control, moved out of the role now
Nothing's left here

Leave it be
It was meant for me
Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
For a fair judgement deserved

Opeth,A Fleeting Glance,/o/opeth/a+fleeting+glance_21395685.html,"Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me, ""how long? How long?""

Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had build up inside me
Then came clean, ""or am I wrong""
I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth when it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine, ""i walk the line""

A fleeting glance again tells me everything
Took a chance in vain, drown to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness as the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness, paved the way and then gave in

I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years so more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we are all born to die
Gave me purpose, freed me, ""how simple it can be""

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another ""me"" waiting behind

But it's fading away from my mind
There's another ""me"" waiting behind"
Opeth,Advent,/o/opeth/advent_20191168.html,"It was all true
A parlour strode, and the night sets forever
I stray in the quiet cold
And you gird me when I dare to listen
Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow
Lips try to form ""because""
Trying to adapt to the wilderness
Where even foes close their eyes and leave
We are inside the glade
Every now and then I wipe the dust aside
To remember...
How I drape my face with my bare hands
The same that brought me here
But you were beyond all help
The folded message that wept my name
Shadows skulk at my coming
We survey the slopes
In search for the words to write the missing page
The tainted dogma
Time grows short
As the piper plays his time
We are almost there
You are beyond all help
Dancing into the void
We are almost there"

Far beyond a sleeping wish
Lunar tongue on a lasting bliss

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Lend yourself...

Clouds of dust in a waning light
You have given up on plight
Time is now, my dearest friend
Hidden years and a heart to mend

And should we meet again
The loss of everything
Three wishes to a friend
Three hundred sorrows gather
But if we lend ourselves
Amidst rock and poison grime
There may well be a time
A kingdom past its prime

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Your silver voice in my throat
Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, the years have left us cursed
A simple test in an iron cage
Old tradition in a modern age
Strong and true are the weak at heart
I am you, you am I

Då vissnar allt som lever
Tre tankar om en vän
Tre hundra sorgepjäser

Bland sot och krossad sten

Beyond the embrace of Christ.
Like the secret face within the tapestry.
Like a bird of prey over the crest.
And she was swathed in sorrow, as if born within it's mask.
Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled.
Emptiness followed by her wake.
I could clasp her in undying love.
Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine.
She faced me in awe. 'twas a token of ebony colour.
Embodied in faint vapour.
Wandering through April's fire.
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you.
I will endure, hide away.
I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure.
It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before.
The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came
The forest folded it's branches around me.
Something passed by, and I went into a dream.
She laughing and weeping at once: ""take me away"".
I don't know how or why, I'll never know WHEN."

Och vinkar till sig sina barn

Can't sleep to the scraping of his voice
Nature's way struck grief in me
And I became a ghost in sickness

Willingly guided into heresy
Beneath the surface, stark emptiness
And you'd pity my conviction
Whereas I thought of myself as a leader

You'd cling to your pleasant hope
It is twisted fascination
While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair
And I'm praising death

Lost love of the heart
In a holocaust scene memory

Decrepit body wearing transparent skin
Inside, the smoke of failure

Wept for solace and submit to faith
In his shadow I'm choking
Yet flourishing

Master

A delusion made me stronger
Yet I'm draped in pale withering flesh
I sacrificed more than I had
And left my woes beneath the mire"

Lost and astray
In what's vanished from your eyes

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

Come into this night
Your plight alone
Carry your weight
You are flawed as all of us
Come into this night
Your only home
It's never too late
To repent, suffer the loss

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

To undo your deeds
And atone with your lonely soul
Once you're into this night
All minds are stable
Forget all your needs
Lose the grip of all control"

I call your name
A lamentation I sigh
Again and again
Spiritual eclipse
The gateways are closed for me to seek
The night...
A veil of stars, watching
My shadow is born from light
The light of the eye, in darkness
Over troubled waters memories soar
Endlessly, searching night and day
The moonlight caresses a lonely hill
With the calmness of a whisper
I wear a naked soul
A blank face in the streaming water
It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust
Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
Together we gazed, awaited
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun
Sunbirds leave their dark recesses
Shadows glid the archways
Do not turn your face towards me
Confronting me with my lonliness
You are in a forest unknown
The secret orchard
And your voice is vast and achromatic
But still so precious
Lullaby of the crescent moon took you
Mesmerized, it's kaleidoscopic face
Granted you a hollow stare
Another soul within the divine herd
I have kept it
The amaranth symbol
Hiddin inside the golden shrine
Until we rejoice in the meadow
Of the end
When we both walk the shadows
It will set ablaze and vanish
Black rose immortal
It is getting dark again
Dusk shuffle across the fields
The evening trees moan as if they knew
At night I always dream of you"
Opeth,Blackwater Park,/o/opeth/blackwater+park_20154992.html,"Confessor
Of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the everlost
Lepers coiled neath the trees
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Dying men in bewildered soliloquys
Perversions bloom round the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic

Under the waning moon
Wielding his instruments
It is the year of death
Touching us with ease
Stealth sovereign reaper
Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease

I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
Still far from the knell
This doesn't concern me yet

Point fingers at the details
Taunting their bereavement
Mod round the dead
Caight in unbridled suspense
Probing vomits for more
We have all lost it now

Born the travesty of man
Catching the flakes of dismay
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
Parched with thirst for the wicked
You're plucked to the mass

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater park"
Opeth,Bleak,/o/opeth/bleak_20155810.html,"Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding from the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight

Break of morning, coldness lingers on
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun

Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards bereavement faster yet
Clearing thoughts, my mind is set

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me leave you
As all the days are gone

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine
Night falls again
Taking what's left of me

Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need"

To wash me clean

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

Cold wind blows
And the Gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Opeth,Burden,/o/opeth/burden_20740953.html,"I, once upon a time
Carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye
A broken rhyme I'd underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

A sorrow in me

Saw a movement in their eyes
Said I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you"

Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause
And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls
Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding of the warmth
Lured out from inside
Depending on the life blood
Silently
Whispering
Move in me and set me free

Discard your disarray and your rusted crown
And face the wretched image of you and I
No trust in what you say, you are a dead poison seed
Stronger when you are away, you have nothing that I need
The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh
Nothing now remains, now you will leave me be

Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken body lies in wait
Your prize won you the stark night
And you made peace with your fate
Blind eyes sensitive only to white light
Reacting just a bit too late

Preying on insecurity, a design of your schemes
A true believer of purity must tend to what it means
Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie
You forsake everything you feel in favor of despair
Immune and blind to everything that is real in your secret lair
And cast away the captive heart that was thine

And you will go and leave me be

Winter in your soul, building a wasteland
And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet
Sneering, and everyone you would shun
Collecting flowers to your wreath
Lifeline, a river cuts deep in your cold hand
It is changing when you try to breathe


Leave it all behind you, there is comfort in giving up
A seed in a barren soil might curl up into a coil
Flourish into something new
Give back what you thought was ""you""
And give way to all that is new

Leave it all behind you..."

All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery

The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will ever see them fall
And hunts and wars"

Walking in closed rooms,
Using cold words.
Captured by the night.

Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts, scream your sadness.
And they all turned away, unable to face more of this death.
Credence in my word.
Written in dust, tainted by memories.
I confess my hope, recognize my loneliness.
Your laughter weeps the truth.
Push me into the corners.
Confirming the epitaph of my soul
And displaying the once unknown karma."

She holds her head up high in the rain
A mother is screaming for help
And she turns around to stare
At a scene from her memory

She is hiding a wish in her heart
That flows through her blood always
And it's culled from a dream
That someone is waiting to say her name
And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity

Äter svält och död på löpet

Och dottern ringer sällan nu
Hur beskriver man ett liv utan mål?
Maskinens toner överröstas
När döden ger sin intervju
Vi tillber flödet i en metropol

Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide
Over the hill there are men returning
Trying to find some peace of mind

Sleep my child

Under the fog there are shadows moving
Don't be afraid, hold my hand
Into the dark there are eyelids closing
Buried alive in the shifting sands

Sleep my child

Speak to me now and the world will crumble
Open a door and the moon will fall
All of your life, all your memories
Go to your dreams, forget it all

Sleep my child"

Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea

Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grisp
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time

Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep

From love to death
In a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret
Pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane
Gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes
Is the shade of the night

Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep

The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory's nothing but the scars on me

All over now
Forgotton why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for the new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity

It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed

All over now
Forgotton why I needed this
Standing down
Disappear into the obscure
Resting days
Waiting for the new disease
Biding time
Locked inside insanity

Devil guides the way
Tells me what to say
Pours himself inside
Snuffs the final light

Deliverance
Thrown back at me
Laughing at me

Deliverance
Thrown back at me
Deliverance
Laughing at me"

Before merging with the grey.

Demon, Demon of the fall.
Demon, Demon of the fall.
Demon, Demon of the fall.

Gasping for another breath.

Seductive faint mist forging
Through the cracks in the wall.
I shant resist.
In tears for all of eternity.
She turned around and faced me for the first time.

Run away, run away, run away.

There is a failure
Are you a believer?
That someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, ""Thank you""

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here"

And when the rains came
Made it true and pure, to dissolve the hurt

Are we nursing destruction?
Pursuing a dream we once had
Was it our intention
To follow this road 'til the end
Even if the end is a world of sorrow?

There is a bond between us
Even if it's frayed it is unbreakable
So I come for you always
And I welcome pain

Failure had passed the stepping stone
She had sworn her vows to another

Words would falter to atone
This is when no-one will bother

And conceded pain is crumbling mirth
A harlot of God upon the earth
Found where she sacrificed her ways
That hollow love in her face
The contentment that would fill the crack

Still I plotted to have her back
My soul released a fluttering sigh
This day fell, the darkness nigh
I took her by the hand to say

I returned for you in great dismay
All faith forever has been led stray
Come with me far away to stay

Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime
She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme
But baffled herself with the final line
My promise is made but my heart is thine"

And turning stones to find evidence
But it hides in the recesses of our hearts

A written decree of our loss
And we carried no faith in the cross
And the cold years are coming
For the victims of a longing

Out through the doors of starvation
And into the rains of damnation
Where the bitter winds are singing
For the victims of a longing

We carried along through squalor
With an inborn need to dominate and possess
It gives birth to an anger inside
And we can't control this
The blood of departure in our tracks
Dripping from our emptying vessels
Your hand reached out to hold mine
But you're grasping melting ice

Asleep in the rain
A child once again
And the ghost in my head
Has forgiven me

Lifted his curse upon me"

I will ask how and why
And when guilt has it's way
One lesser reason to stay
And I will see her cry

Into the fire of our youth comes the devil again

In the corner
Told me that you had died
And I would die when my heart was empty
Become a ghost in perpetual void
And neglect all reasons why"

Lost between the lines
Do you feel the need

Left a home in the pouring rain
In a sea of guilt and shame
Will we sustain"

My spirit sighs in peace
Gazing unto the stars

I am so alone, so cold
My hart is to scarred to glow
I wish the sunrise to come
Take my soul (away)
From this cold, lonly shell
I am free

From the eternal sea I rose
Veiled in darkness on either shore
Lost my pride, lost it's glow
For me the sun rose no more

The forest of October
Sleeps silent when I depart

Hides my last trace

Like the sights of magic
Wrapped in aeons
My mind is one with my soul
I fall alone
While leaves fall from the weeping trees"

Lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow
Contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head

Ghost of perdition
Stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship
Called inside the fog
Pouring venom brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell
Foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said:
""You have to live before you die young""

Holding her down
Channeling darkness
Hemlock for the Gods
Fading resistance
Draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light

Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher

Darkness by her side
Spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter
Waits to pull us under
Rose up to it's call
In his arms she'd fall
Mother light received
And a faithful servant's free

In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
And like marked pages in a diary
Everthing seemed clean that is unstained
The incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what is clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Ghost of perdition
A saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores

To see a beloved son
In despair of what's to come

If one cut the source of the flow
And everything would change
Would conviction fall
In the shadow of the righteous
The phantasm of your mind
Might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten mortals
Where the victim is the prey"

Stilted for the beholder
Depravity from the core
Handcarved death in stoneladen aisles

I hide the scars from my past
Yet they sense my (mute) dirge
This is when it all falls apart
White hands grasping for straws

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew

Thought I could not leave this place
On this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn
To what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay
No-one would know
What would they care if I did stay
No-one should know

On this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn
To what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay
No-one would know
What would they care if I did stay

Still brooding, soothing calm
That rigid, twisted face
Blank godhead, tear my name
Lost virtue, frantic lust

Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised manmade nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down

Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen

Searching my way to perplexion
In crumbling faith I saw her
Bearing her pain in the wilderness
The gleam of her eyes
In that moment she knew"

Turn the locks on brother and kin
Murder lust on affinity

So, so much younger than today
It seemed easier to lead your life
There was no time to surrender
And no reason to perceive
The burden of pain

And it never (really) went away

Was a kingdom
A secret outline showed the way
To treasures of clay
And beads made of glass"

His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams

No more
Cold pace

And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish - hunter
A thousand lies
Cast from the throne of secrecy

Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust - believer
Your body a vehicle to

Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king - dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow

A burden so great
Weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes - waiting
Spiraling judgment, provoked in the rains

This futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgment
Heir apparent"

Come here inside
And tell me how
How in my final days

The signal for us to end our lives
To wipe beneath the watches
And you wait forever

Your weakness
Storing trace on your eyes
So I left you alone
We all left you alone

They'll lock all your reason why

Awaiting the face of the moon to ascend
You follow the siren in your head

Till skatter av plast

A memory that could hold me back

There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

Gone through days without talking
There is a comfort in silence
So used to losing all ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left

Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up what really happened
Force the darkness unto me"

The road is long and winding still
And these bonds will start to fray
But another day

A flaking wish inside
Veiled comes the daylight through the glass
In the never-ending rain
This is no friend of mine
Stalking the comfort within

The mother of lies

And you're going out to war
When the beast is coming home
And the sun is seen no more

Blazing, the white light

Passing the lake I know so well
I am near, yet so far away

Arrival...
I saw her standing in the darkness
Awaiting me like the light awaits the day
Standing silent smiling at my presence
A black candle holds the only light

Darkness encloses
And the candle seems to expire
In her cold, cold hand
And as a forlorn soul

It will fade away

Touching her flesh in this night
My blood froze forever

Emraced before the dawn
A kiss brought total eclipse

And she spoke
Once and forever
I am so cold
In mist enrobed in twilight
She was standing..."

Som värnar om din ro

There's a certain detail seen here

Trees bend their boughs toward the earth.
And nighttime birds float as black faces.
It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.
Unknown and scarred by life...
The luring eyes, you had never seen.
You have nothing more to find.
You have nothing more to loose.
The cold season drifts over the land.
They huddle in the brown corners.
Some would settle for less.
The castles were all empty, asleep.
Long awaiting their king.
Beckoning round the bend.
Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there.
Draped within a fate I could not change,
And always welcoming Winter's epilogue."

In a metropolitan holiness

I am outside waiting
Outside waiting
I am outside waiting
Outside waiting

Am I the last one of my kind
Who's afraid of dying?
But I would perish to save a child
And give all I can for love
It seems I might have reconciled
Even if my destiny's lying
For the ones I hold dear I hold close
And force my way through the ether"
Opeth,Patterns In The Ivy II,/o/opeth/patterns+in+the+ivy+ii_20562009.html,"Without you I cannot confide in anything
The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring
Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night
Biding time, leaving the line and out of sight

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in it's own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end - manifestation

It runs in me, your poison seething in my veins
This skin is old and stained by late September rains
A final word from me would be the first for you
The rest is long but I'll go on inside and through

One moonlit shadow on the wall
Disrupted in it's own creation
Veiled in the darkness of this fall
Is this the end - manifestation

I, wrote down a name (and read it twice),
I, wallow in shame.

I, said that I love (eternal schemes),
I, cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I, promised to stay (and dwell my grief)
I, went far away.

I see blood spilled 'neath my feet,
Lead me through wastelands of deceit,
Rest your head now, don't you cry,
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reasons why."
Opeth,Prologue,/o/opeth/prologue_20296395.html,"There it was.
The final destiny.
A sunrise that never came,
Still the night lamp that never faded away.

Rising and telling everyone
About the beauty of it's prologue."

If they could see me now they'd break down and cry

Look down your senses
Await the gritting beyond
And in the morning... 

Born as a failure
And died as a stranger

When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn

Outside the window I see people passing by
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry

""Bring me back again"""

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, and this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all-seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the sky

Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire"

Past meadow grounds
And further away from my home
Baying behind me
I hear the hounds
Flock's chasing to find me alone

A trail of sickness
Leading to me
If I am haunted
Then you will see

Searching the darkness
And emptiness
I'm hiding away from the sun
Will never rest
Will never be at ease
All my matter's expired so I run

There falls another
Vapor hands released the blade
Insane regrets at the drop
Instruments of death before me

Lose all to save a little
At your peril it's justified
And dismiss your demons
As death becomes a jest
You are the laughing stock
Of the absinthe minded
Confessions stuck in your mouth
And long gone fevers reappear
Nocturnally helpless
And weak in the light
Depending on a prayer
Pacing deserted roads to find
A seed of hope

They are the trees
Rotten pulp inside and never well
Roots sucking, thieving from my source
Tired boughs reaching for the light

It is all false pretension
Harlequin forest
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
As they die alone
With no one by their side
Are they forgiven?

Stark determination
Poisoning the soul
Unfettered beast inside
Claiming sovereign control

And now the woods are burning
Tearing life crops asunder
Useless blackened remains
Still pyre smoldering"

Made me a slave to the secrets of your silence
But you told me to stay
And you told me you're mine

And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise

In light of all things to come, why do you despair?
Because when you have no one, no one would care
So don't care

And all things will come undone
There is nothing to share
I'll be waiting for no one
And no one is there to care

Can't see, can't feel
You run, I long
I wait, he comes
Takes you away

In the embers of summer
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire on the other side

There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives"

Voices fell like marble
No longer by my side

Red line round her neck
Met the earth in silence

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath

White faced, haggard grin
This serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath

Saw her fading, blank stare into me
Clenched fist from her, the beautiful pain

Darkness reared it's head
Tearing within the reeling haze
Took control, claiming my flesh
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum
Each and every one would die at my hand
Choking in warm ponds of blood
At last, weak and torn, I went down
Drained from strength, flickering breath

Came with the moon
The wayward in concious state
Flanked and barred in destiny's end
Underneath with hope in laches
Swathed in filth, any would betoken
Starlit shadows on the wall
Finally there to collect me
From the bowels of sin"

Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end
The dawning of a seething design
Kept a secret from the light
And felt the weight on my shoulders increase

A bleeding heart led by desperation
Like a bird on a wire
A broken promise of dedication
Never ever again"

Come lay with me, Love me
I would surely stay

Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I will always be
The soldier of Fortune

Many times I've been a traveler, I looked for something new
In days of old when the nights were cold
I wandered without you
Those days I thought my eyes could see you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I will always be

And what can I do
Nothing completes me and my thought are on you
You just left when I begged you to stay
I’ve not stopped crying since you went away
You went away… you went away

Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of

I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Carry me home [x4]

There's a dream that tells me I'm haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold

I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page

Would it mend the wounds I bear, the wound of love?
Could it reappear like a familiar tale?

Shows the footprints round this grave
Dried up roses scattered on the mound
Honouring the one engraved

Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing ""You""

Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait

Black procession through the narrow aisles
Another's gone for all to see
Near the site for one who lost his trials
Sleeping neath the ground is me

Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry

Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing ""You""

Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait(x2)"

No sound, and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face, no body, no words to speak

There is a wickedness in me
I can't seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray

There's eternal night in my gaze
I'm cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I'm liquefied in a strange brew

An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it is cold and stark

I blend with the crows of robot minds
Never a leader, I am always behind

A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears

Alla dessa stämningar är var för sig förklarliga. Någon sa här om dagen att vi lever i det stora uppbrottets tid…”

So far I have gone to see you again.
Hiding your face in the palm of your hands.
Finding solace in the words I do despise.
You snatch at every sound.
And even though you believe that I am shackled within death,
Memories are tainted with paleness.
Crestfallen still.
Those eyes... Empty like a barren well.
It was the only task I would undertake.
To reap the harvest that was mine.
The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,
And left me helpless in your embrace.
The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,
Now slowly smoldering to dust.
The celestial touch, from grey to black.
A fathomless void enclosing.
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.
I can not endure. And so I rose from my sleep.
The moon turned away it's face.
Overture of the long, black night begins...
Something you said: ""Eerie circles upon the waters"".
Until now we have shared the same aura.
My ashes within your hands.
My breath in the sepulchral mound.
You know that your night is my day.
The final spark that blew life into me,
The demon of the fall."

Through the vast enchanted forest

The surrounding skies are one
Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning
Rain is pouring down my (now) shivering shoulders
In the rain my tears are forever lost

The darkened oaks are my only shelter
Red leaves are blown by the wind
An ebony raven now catches my eyes
Sitting in calmness
Before spreading it's black wings
Reaching for the skies

In this forest
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon
My spirit is hidden
In the form of wisdom
Carved on a black stone

The only ways to follow

Open your soul
Redeem, I am immortal

Blinded by a light
My soul is held up high in glory
I engulf the skies
The apostle in triumph

Through the eternal flame I travel
As the rain keeps falling..."
Opeth,The Baying Of The Hounds,/o/opeth/the+baying+of+the+hounds_20482361.html,"I hear the baying of the hounds
In the distance. I hear them devouring
Pest-ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self-loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyse
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into it's pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country
The cities lay dead beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death-burden
So you take comfort in him
And you are receptive to stark wishes
No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware and in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire
With past desires
Beneath the mire
Drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
""The tainted lips of a stranger
Resting upon hers""

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone
I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror
Finding  the  outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet
Endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour
Awaiting a reverie to unfold
And now they are calling me
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds
Calling me back to my home"

Inside you, telling you now

Take the road at devil's speed

Demon fades from the hole

Led the blind
Searched to find
A pathway to the sun
Saw the signs
Intertwined
Forgave me all my sins

Drowned Visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again
And guide me into

There is a failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criteria demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder

Puzzled by shrewd innocence
Runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves
Nails bleeding from the struggle
It is the end for the weak at heart
Always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all
Reeling inside
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
Stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away

Like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
Waking up to your sound again
And lapse into the ways of misery"

Opened mirage soothes your sense
Locked on the pinnacle
The best secret within

Heart burning for a stranger
Ascending to the meek
Flock round the liars in awe
Caked in the soil beneath
Fear me when we meet
Turn away in admiration
My firm grip round the nucleus of joy
Enough of this
You will leave me now
You will see it now
Perish at my hands
Close to you
Tangled up in hair
Fresh stigma look
Shall I take you with me
And it is cold
Ruby eyes in the fog
It is me
And you are just like them all
Stained by the names of fathers
I'm greeting my downward fall
Leaving the throes to others"

A knife is sharpened
His children run but he'll advance

Alas, how fragile life can be
Love is strong when death foresees
Yet the story won’t end here
No, oh no, oh no

Ulterior motive
The grinning face of leadership
A selfish wish to control
A nation in his grip

While in the gutter
Starvation invites us to join

Barricades of wealthy youth
Protesting their inborn truth"

Of infamy

The hands of Satan
Assembling his flock

The pale horse rider
Searching the earth

Choking hand tapping
The veins in your throat

His orders in your mouth

I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in it's splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at it's peak
Love me to my death

Lost are days of Spring
You sighed and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered with virgin snow
Rigid features

Deafening shrieks pierced the night

A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone"

And all you became,
The night is calling, you pray forth.

A barren waste is your land,
Crops they were sown to die.

This skin is a mirror,
The eyes hollow with ignorance,
Health runs from your lips,
Sucked in and safe in a world of sleep.

All those years caring for a liar.
A benefit road is winding higher.
You're a moth too close to the fire.

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all.

Fleeing your sorrows
Pushing your spirit away

Sick of the weakness of the psyche
Whispered from the heart of evil
Luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a savior

And cries out
For the restless will also die

A selection culled from the damned
Drawing the life under one.
A friend died in your room
And sought the birth of a follower

Oh, Brother!
You're a killer
And you target yourself
I wish you'd never come back
For us to see
The beckoning end

And the pride of a mother
Brought flaws in a mother's son,
And the love from a father
Was used by a father's son

Overheard us talking
In a smoke of lost hope
The language of our parting
So clear and so true

Overheard us talking"

Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays

Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler

Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise

Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain nothing is the same

Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no-one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me

There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come

She is waterdrops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtous shell with kindred innocense

I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance all that was lost
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear of me
You'd never leave me to
A fate with you"
Opeth,The Night And The Silent Water,/o/opeth/the+night+and+the+silent+water_20482359.html,"And so you left us
Jaded and gaunt, some September
Wilted with the seasons
But hidden inside the delusion
I saw you eyes, somewhere
Devoid of death
The aura poises amidst (the storm)
In solid tears I linger
A parlour glade, moonlit sorrow
Lonely resting pools
Relics of the moon-dogged lake
Whisper: ""All your words are missgiven""
Am I like them?
Those who mourn and turn away
Those who would give anything
To see you again
If only for another second
Your face was, like the photograph
Painted white
We did not speak very often about it
What does it matter now?
Cloak of autumn shroud
I gaze, dim ricochet of stars
I reckon it is time for me to leave
You sleep in the light
Yet the night and the silent water
Still so dark"

Gives away your disguise
Grants me the peace to leave
And finally leave you be"

The wildest dreams

In the coldness of night

Shrouded in crystals
Through a frosty dusk
Souls of the fullmoon awaits
Their shadows ablaze

We are all bending
Our tired leaves over your empty shell
In the sign of true esteem
Are you beloved lord
Sighing deep under these waterfalls?

The birds of the sun
Seperates these dark clouds
While the winds of winter sleeps gently around
I am sworn to the oath
To breathe...

At the waters I dwell
The waves are still whispering
Ancient lullabies
I die...
While our mystic brothers still seek

Under your command I will obey
In my vision
You are the embodiment of pure freedom
But through my eyes you are made of stone"

Before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy
A million words astray

Ah....

I can't remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness
Is a veil that keeps my calm

[Chorus]
Ah....

[Verse]
By the way, I'm doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, I don't need sympathy
I have a place to lay, I have more than you can see


I walk the streets alone at night
It helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light
And leave all woes behind

I watch them from afar
Feeding, breeding, scheming
Tell me I am wrong

Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the poison in me
A tide of spite wound be found

Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed

Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Searing skin on a funeral pyre

Blinding light and the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Should I speak and they'll call me a liar
I'll retreat to my funeral pyre

My sanctuary, a thousand centuries

I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting

Once it came you lied
Embracing us over autumn's proud treetops
I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
You voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again
Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes I am standing without a soul

We walked into the night
Am I to bid you farewell?
Why can't you see that I try
When every tear is shed
Is for you?"

There's innocence torn from it's maker
Stillborn the trust in you
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him what to do (would you)

Leave your mark upon the head of someone
Who'll cry for his state, we know it's too late
I turn round to see what was meant to be
Faint movement release to rid the disease

There's innocence torn from it's maker
Stillborn the trust in you

The lake from which you flow

With eyes of fire
Once unlit but now alive
This enery, sparkling
Like a morning star

The morning star

Riding the fires of
The northern gold
I've searched the eye
I laugh under the weeping moon

I am the watcher in the skies
Nor the emeralds know my mark
Glisten to mark their presence
Set the enigma ablaze
Searching...
Finding...

Burn the winter landmarks
That said I was there
Burn the spirit of cold
That travel through my soul"
Opeth,Universal Truth,/o/opeth/universal+truth_1717179.html,"Sweat on the brow runs over faces made of snow
There comes a time in life when death may come too slow

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You have waited far too long
But Spring is set in bloom
You have conquered love inside
Yet sorrow is your doom

The debts are long since paid, inheritance is set
Still agitation reels inside, lest you forget
Lest you forget

At sunrise Friday morning
A haven for your sins
The written dedication
Etched into your skin

Time won't heal the wounds you bare
Between old pride and desperate prayers

Time won't heal any wounds you bare
A set few years of your life are stolen
Light cast on the obvious
Behold the white when it's faded golden

A stranger's truth holds no water here
But soon we may have learned
Dead sympathy, a aversion proceeds

A voice lives in your chest
That comforts wary thoughts
Yet the brook is still too wide
To bridge the gap you've sought

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You trade your vices every day religiously
A pack of vultures wait for everyone to see

You gave away too much, a harness on your kin
For any transgressions never mirrored mortal sin
Mortal sin

You're still alone

The day in zenith now
You made it through the night
Voice of perdition
Came and went far out of sight"

Då har ondskan nått sitt mål till slut
Då har all kärlek sinat ut

She knows I'm the one who sought her
But when we fall, we'll fall so hard
She holds a secret and won't show me how
How to break the riddle in her eyes

This is treason of the mind and soul
Death is no reason why you would go

Inside the ghost of love is laughing
It mocks the footsteps where I go
It tells me nothing has been lost
It whispers: ""you've seen darkness before""
In time the hurting will subside
And longing is overthrown
What's left is a void that grows inside
And the echo of a failure

This is treason of the mind and soul
Death is no reason why you would go

Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside?
Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides?
Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?


Have we given up?
Is it over?
Have you given up?
Is winter hiding in your heart?"

Found you there in the blink of an eye

Turned away into a thousand dreams
Found out what they mean

Lost you there in a moment of truth
(I) trust you
Gave away the one and only heart
(A) gift to tear apart

Stain me, save me
Take me to my home
Hold me, show me
Take me to my home

Weaker now, drawing fluid from me
(You) kill me
I'm not afraid of what you have just done

Opeth,When,/o/opeth/when_20339080.html,"Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog.
The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before.
This day wept on my shoulders.
Still the same as yesterday.
This path seems endless, body is numb.
The soul has lost it's flame.
Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home.
So there I was.
Within the sobriety of the immortals.
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through.
The garden sighs, flowers die.
The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on.
She could not see me through the windows.
In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips.
Graven face, she said my name.
Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour.
The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise.
And I cried, I knew she had lied.
Her obsession had died, it had died.
When can I take you from this place?
When is the word but a sigh?
When is death our lone beholder?
When do we walk the final steps?
When can we scream instead of whisper?
When is the new beginning,
The end of this sad madrigal."
Opeth,White Cluster,/o/opeth/white+cluster_20340504.html,"Still it came passing by
And fooled me with another day
The pieces weaved together rose the sun
The knocking message called for my life

Soil to skin, my next of kin
Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Damp air grasped, stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss

This is forgiveness, so I know
I slither for you, and I'm dying
Once I repent I seal the lid
I find trust in hate
They wear white for me

I forge myself into your dreams
Seemingly jaded and lost
And here I am your life

Hangman clutching at his tools

The noose is tied
I will come for you
Plunging into anywhere but here
Murmur through the crowd

As the primal touch brought me back
Cloak captured sighs of relief
And the last thing I did see is still here
Beckoning right behind me"

You no longer want to hide

You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife

[Chorus]
And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh

When there's trouble admitting
That you have been wrong all along
When the words you have written down
Reads ""Everything is gone""

Marred with the sorrows of your strife

And take much more than you need
When you can't keep a secret to yourself
And points to the source of the deed

[Outro]
You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife
And you can never find your satisfaction
When you can't outgrow your false distractions
You know your soul is weighed on the silver scale
Of deceit and lies"
Opeth,Windowpane,/o/opeth/windowpane_20345134.html,"Blank face in the windowpane
Made clear in seconds of light
Disappears and returns again
Counting hours, searching the night

Might be waiting for someone
Might be there for us to see
Might be in need of talking
Might be staring directly at me

Inside plays a lullaby
Slurred voice over children cries
On the inside

Haunting loneliness in the eye
Skin covering a secret scar
His hand is waving a goodbye
There's no response or action returned

There is deep prejudice in me
Outshines all reason inside
Given dreams all ridden with pain
And projected unto the last"
Opeth,Wreath,/o/opeth/wreath_20347764.html,"Falling inside again
This nightmare always the same
Still never enough
Halting at the brink of discovery
Moving into the darkness
Leaking inside to cover up
Dragging me down and under
Entangled and undone at once
Old memories
I'm not in need but wish to know
What are the tragedies
The history behind the walls
Pacing futhur down
Familiar children's laughter
Dissonant and out of time
And their eyes are dead
Watching myself in a pool of water
Wearing the mask of a ghost
Smeared all across my skin
Rotton earth and insects
Endless night
Always preserving the calm
Movement behind
Bleeding animals in a field of fire
There is no absolution
Death is but a fairytale
They are mere visions
They are afraid of me
Clear insight
A smoke is rising nearby
Dust covering my coat
Blend together to spell my name
Pale, covered me with sweat
There are no words left
Sole provider of death
Distorted faith in myself
Human harvest burning
Blackest pages turning
Twisted perception come true
Captured in dreams connected
Staring right back
Spiritual decay - Still seeking
Frozen in time
Mourn this departure - All watching
Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning
Calling me back
Closure to bleak matters - I'm leaving
End of a search
Coming of morning - Returning"

Odrisena ve' je cima, nista nova, nista nova...

Pala je u more stina I prozebli grdelini
Uz gradele, kraj komina nima ko da te zamini
I dok jugo stalno jaca, oko kuce reste draca...
Sve se sprema da podivja, a mi kano stara bova
Plutamo bez pravog cilja: nista nova, nista nova...

Uzalud privrcen foje ca ce rec mi na sva justa
Svi govore: bit ce boje, barbirija vec je pusta
Vaja vrime niz skaline vonj mizerje I morbine...
I briskulu dikod baci klapa ca jos ni gotova
Da ostari po bonaci, nista nova, nista nova...

Finili su pusti kanti I promukla vec je klapa
I po dobru svak te panti starec s nama sve do scapa
Naresle su nove plime, popucale surgadine...

Night is draggin' her feet
I wait alone in the heat
I know, know that you'll have your way
Till you have to go home
No's a word I can't say

Cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you start depending
Will a little more love bring a happy ending
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms
In the web of your lies

But it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you start depending
Will a little more love bring a happy ending
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?"

Reaching out I touch another's skin
Breathing out as he's breathing in
Deep inside I feel my soul aflame
Can my life ever be the same
I should have told him
That I'd do anything if I could hold him
For just another day, for just another day
His love is something I will not forget
When I am far away, when I am far away
I feel the rainfall of another planet
Another planet
Close together in the afterglow
I remember how his loving flowed
Turned the key into another world
Made a woman of a simple girl
Daylight comes as we both know it must
Soon my fantasy will turn to dust
But I would give him anything he asked
If my first love could be my last
I should have told him
That I'd do anything if I could hold him
For just another day, for just another day
His love is something I will not regret

Lying there I wonder if your love for me is real
Or just another fantasy

Then I try to think about the way things used to be
Misty memories, hazy like a dream
All we did together, all the things we planned to do
There was only me and you

And in the morning I touch you and I find you're still there
I want to tell you that I love you, please never leave me
In the morning light I turn to look at you
And hope that you still care

When I look back on our life, the pieces fall in place
Words that went unsaid, pictures of your face
All those things we shared, yet stay together day by day
'Cause our love was never far away

And in the morning I touch you and I find you're still there
I want to tell you that I love you, please never leave me

In the still of night
The sound that I heard was your voice
And the words, oh I knew
You called me angel eyes
Child of the morning
You and I will soon be together
My darling
Angel eyes, I'll be beside you
Through the night you called me your angel eyes
Closing my eyes I could still visualize
All those golden days
In letters you write you promise we'll share them again
Oh darling nevertheless still I have to confess
That last night I cried
When a voice in the rain softly called out again
I'll be home
Don't cry my angel eyes

Come with me my darling
To the place we love to go
When the frost’s upon the window
There’s a tingle in your toes
To the fields of virgin white
For angels in the snow
Lying on the frozen ground
Arms go up and legs go down
How it looks so perfect I don’t know
With the snowflakes all around
It feels like heaven’s reaching down
To tell us here on earth we’re not alone
As the rooftops glisten
And your cheeks turn to rose
We will lie in wonder
Making angels in the snow
With the snowflakes all around
It feels like heaven’s reaching down
Telling us that we are not alone
The silver moon is shining
On the winter world below
How she’ll smile to see us
Waving our hellos
And as each season passes
I will watch as your wings grow
I’ll always think of you this way
My angel in the snow"

Come adore on bended knee

I was born in the country, I was raised with the sun
The flowers were my pillow when the days work was done
Down in the valley shone the bright neon signs
The call of the city life kept going through my mind
Oh yeah, the days of my childhood would soon be left behind

It was a saturday morning when the snow lay on the ground
Pa said the time had come when I could move to town
So I kissed goodbye to mama, held on tight to papas hand
I saw a tear in mamas eye but I did not understand
Cause I was just a country girl being brought up on the land

Goodbye mama, let me see your smile
Wipe away that teardrop from your eye
I wont forget that I'm a country girl
I got to go, but I hate to say goodbye
So long, papa, I'll be seeing you
But I'll be coming home again someday
No, I wont forget that I'm a country girl
A country girl, you know I'll always stay

I was born in the country, I was raised with the sun
The flowers were my pillow when the days work was done
Down in the valley shone the bright neon signs
Yet I know where I belong, I got my peace of mind
Oh yeah, I was born a country girl and that just suits me fine

Goodbye mama, let me see your smile
Wipe away that teardrop from your eye
I wont forget that I'm a country girl
I got to go, but I hate to say goodbye
So long, papa, I'll be seeing you

There's a space inside for someone
But I know it isn't me

Who are searching
And the girls
Who hope they're found

If you look for me

Wash my tears away
Come on, darkness
Cover up the day

To keep from breaking down
No mercy in this town

Every day is just another test
Seems I'm always second best
But you learn along the way
That's the price you have to pay

I try to stay defiant
Be tough and self-reliant
Though I get tired to the bone
Love is just a wish you keep inside
How's it gonna help me to survive?
Looks like I'm in this fight alone

And I'm livin' in desperate times
Being alive's my only crime
Don't care what I have to do
I'll find some way to make it through
Oh, and I'm livin' in desperate times
And it's too late to change my mind
Till these desperate times are done, gonna run
Watch me run

Innocents get taken in
By the promise of an easy win
You start out so naive
So eager to believe
But the glitter of the city lights
Only covers up a lonely night
Of strangers slamming doors
You're hungry and ignored

I've faced the competition
I've made the hard decisions
Will it be worth it in the end?
Taking any chance that comes along
Getting hard to tell what's right or wrong
I only wish I had a friend

Love is faithful and sees you through
Everything love is, I learned from you

And love is wise, forgives the fool
Well, love decides, it's not up to us to choose
And if hope falters, love knows what to do
And everything love is, I learned from you

And you opened up the door
And you warmed me in the light
Now if you want me, I am yours
All the days of my life

And love will lead us if we'll go
And love will leave us if we don't
Love is one heart shared by two
Everything love is, I learned from you

And you opened up the door
And you warmed me in the light, yeah
Now if you want me, I am yours
All the days of my life

And love will lead us if we go
And love will leave us if we don't

Love can't be love
If it's just for the moment
Only to pass the night away
As we both get nearer
Deeper love is so much clearer
Long as we do it face to face
And I have known
All the lost lonely people
My world has found a place in your smile
If you're searching
For a different love than mine
You'll never stop me loving you
More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face
You make a man
Like a child with your power
Help me to find my way inside
Let me drink your potion
Let me drown in your emotion
Lover to lover, face to face
In time we learn
From the lost lonely people
That love can last as long as time
There was never born another one for me
And you'll never stop me loving you
More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face
I'll be with you when the world is lies
And the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be
More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face
I'll be with you when the world is lies
And the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be
More of your love
More of the warmer ride...

You wrote my name in the sand
We walk together hoping forever
Please don't let go of my hand

Cause i'm falling, i'm falling
I'm falling in love with you

Fall into spring time, like in between time
You're here and then you're gone away

I do not love you isabella
I never have I never will
I saunter through this ceremony
Confidence high, enthusiasm nil
My reasoning need not detain you
But woman it's not all bad news
Very few find peace and succor
In the spouse or life that they choose

He will crush you
Has no pity
Wave on wave on wave of grief

I shall love him
Understand him
That he loves me in my belief

I do not need you isabella
If I did we'd not be here
We'd be in some lovers' haven
Our way ahead and dreams so clear
I welcome you into my family
Into it's dark internal wars
Let me enter into battle
I have the will, I have the cause

Noone leaves him
But they're damaged
And stripped of every vestige of good
Is he man or is he devil?
I see but dread the likelihood

I shall not stay poor isabella
So never heed my marriage vow
Believe in time you won't regret this
Though it may disturb you now
Abandon all attempts to love me
Don't fool yourself that's what you feel
When you at last decide to hate me
At least your emotion will be real

Wolfish, savage
Tuned to madness
Love is stifled, joy denied

I do hate him
I am wretched
A cold contaminated bride

Isabella! Isabella!

I do not love you isabella
I never have I never will
I saunter through this ceremony
Confidence high, enthusiasm nil
My reasoning need not detain you
But woman it's not all bad news
Very few find peace and succor

Here's your lunch money
You better hurry for the old school bus
Did you clean your teeth this morning
I know you hate it when I start to fuss
Here's the letter for your teacher
Your dinner's in the freezer
Five minutes in the microwave
Don't wait for me this evening
I'm probably working late
Your dad is coming over
With his new lover
And I don't wanna be around
So I'm gonna do some shopping
I'll buy you those stockings
I'll be back in half an hour
Oh it's my anticipation
There'd be a confrontation
I know how much it breaks your heart
Let's be pleased for him--he's trying
To make a brand new start
It's not Heaven but it's all we've got
You have to understand it
I wanted Ozzie and Harriet
With a picket fence around it
But that was all an illusion
Now we're living in reality
But we're gonna have a happy ending--you and me
We'll spend the weekend playing
I hope it won't be raining
When we go to the game with Dan
I know you think he's boring
But this time don't ignore him
Won't you give him half a chance
No he's not as fun as dad
But there's good as well as bad
In hanging on to yesterday
I'm not trying to replace him
Guess I'm really trying to say
It's not Heaven but it's all we've got
You have to understand it
I wanted Ozzie and Harriet
With a picket fence around it
But that was all an illusion
Now we're living in reality
But we're gonna have a happy ending--you and me
Together I know we'll survive
Rebuild our lives together
One day at a time
It's not Heaven but it's all we've got
It's not the way I planned it
I wanted Ozzie and Harriet
With a picket fence around it
But that was all an illusion
Now we're living in reality
But there's gonna be a happy ending
Wait and see
Yes there's gonna be a happy ending
For you and me

Lonely, lonely man she's set you free now
Moved aside and left a space for me now
Wasted, wasted love walled up inside you
Open up and pour it out on me

Whisper low when you come to me
Hold me tenderly
Safe and warm in my arms tonight
That's how it's gonna be
I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I don't have to tell you I'll never leave
Thought that heaven was close to me
But love you hold the key

Empty, empty years you left behind you
Tears and memories all cried away
Silently a love has grown between us
Now I know that I am free to say

Whisper low when you come to me
Hold me tenderly
Safe and warm in my arms tonight
That's how it's gonna be
I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I don't have to tell you I'll never leave
Thought that heaven was close to me
But love you hold the key
Love you hold the key"

She's found another, he says, it's the end
To think they once tore down the wall for a door
But now they don't speak anymore

So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand
Drinking her memory away when he can
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore
But now they don't cry anymore

How does it all come to happen
That's not what loving is for
And if I thought it was, I'd leave here in the morning
I'd sooner sleep on the floor

Oh, when will we learn really what loving is
It's not what you get in return but what you give

If I could hold you now
Just for a moment if I could make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now

I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
Lying in your loving arms again

If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through a lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
Lying in your loving arms again

I wanna be lying in your loving arms again"

The little prince of all that you survey
Each night, each day
I am the good old days,
And you my child, tomorrow
If I have any future
It is within your eyes
Each time you smile

Took us all the way to New Orleans

I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me through everything I've done
And every night he kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Nothin' left is all he left me, yeah

Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jeaslousy and hate

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth 

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn 
Fall on your knees 
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born 
O night divine, O night, O night divine 

Truly he taught us to love one another 
His law is love and His gospel is peace 
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother 
And in His name all oppression shall cease 

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise me 
Let all within us praise His holy name 
Christ is the Lord 
Then ever, we will praise thee

O night divine! O night, O night divine"

Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?"

Legs are required for jumpin, dancin
Strollin along down that

Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin free, wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?

Betcha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimmin
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask em my questions and get some answers

And somebody else's songs when yours are through

And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am just missing you again

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean

If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17

See them play in the moonlight
Watch them dance in the sun
They're the children of freedom--everyone
As they care for each other
With no question or cause
They deserve to be treasured as a source of love

In their minds there are answers
And in time we will know
What the truth is about all we don't know
They have no room for hatred
Though they've suffered much pain
From the race we call human--who are afraid of love

If I can only help to right a wrong
With my dolphin song
Then i'll have done what I set out to do
If I can only make one man aware
One person care
Then i'll have done what I promised you

Let us hope it's not too late
And that we can amend
All the pain we have suffered on a friend
We were born with our freedom
Oh we were born with the truth
Then why do we abuse it
We could choose--to love, to love"

And I feel that this house is not home
And now we're not here,It's lonely
The stairs seem to beckon me to stay
But dreams are better treasured
Than slowly eaten away
Christmas time,when snow filled your garden with while
Then the moon's cold patterns on windows at night
Now you'll make a new home
With people as hopefull as we
Over their dreams and their secrets
But don't ever,please don't ever

If I had to melt you with promises, would they stand or fall?

And if I close my eyes to the wild silent ruin
Then I'm just like everyone else
And I cry for their beauty; I cry for their pain
And I cry that my child may not see them again
Will I leave her a legacy she's being denied
Oh I pray that we will when I kiss her goodbye

When I can't explain it myself
And if I close my eyes to the wild silent ruin

It may be parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be
Here is what christmas time means to me

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
Its christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be christmas day

Strings of streetlights, even stop-lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, hear the kids bunch
This is santas big scene
And above all this bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
Its christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be christmas day
Soon it will be christmas day"

With a silvery rain
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone
Never moan, they're happy to be working
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields
With a silvery rain
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul
Before there's nothing left to fly at all
Take to the sky, higher than high
Before the silvery rain begins to fall
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields
With a silvery rain
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul
Before there's nothing left to fly at all
Take to the sky, higher than high
Before the silvery rain begins to fall

Find something better to do

Would make me feel fine
But it's not much comfort
When I'm crying on mine

Running out of patience with me

And we struggle for acceptance from birth to death
But the Lord's too busy tryin' to keep the world on it's feet

Ever has need of a gun

Time is a traveler
Tenterfield saddler turn your head
Ride again Jackaroo
Think I see kangaroo up ahead

The grandson of George
Has been all around the world
And lives no special place
Changed his last name
And he married a girl with an interesting face

He'd almost forgotten them both
Because in the life that he leads
There's nowhere for George
And his library or the son with his gun to belong
Except in this song

Time is a traveler
Tenterfield saddler turn your head
Ride again Jackaroo
Think I see kangaroo up ahead

Time is a meddler
Tenterfield saddler make your bed
Fly away cockatoo
Down on the ground emu up ahead

Time is a tale teller
Tenterfield saddler turn your head
Ride again Jackaroo
Think I see kangaroo up ahead"

No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and tired
What more could I ask, there's nothing that we desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent danger, go to sleep
 Chorus:
Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe, and to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe, yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent danger, go to sleep

Still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never
Gave enough to me

And so many years gone
Love that was so wrong
And I can't forget the way
It used to be
And how you changed the touch
Of love for me

[CHORUS:]
You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me
For you

And we'll have no ending
If we can hold on
And I think I've gone this far
Because of you
Could be no other love but ours
Will do

(repeat chorus)

No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I saved the best of me for you"

The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they Lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

They looked up
And saw a star
Shining bright in the east
Beyond them far

And to the earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night

Born is the king of Israel"

With her trees in the forest
And roots underground

Our father above us
Whose sigh is the wind
Paint us a rainbow 
Without any end

As the river runs freely
The mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers
And see with my eyes

In the hearts of the children
A pure love still grows
Like a bright star in Heaven
That lights our way home

Like the flower that shattered the stone
A sparrow finds freedom
Beholding the sun
In the infinite beauty

We're all joined in one
I reach out before me
And look to the sky
Did I hear someone whisper

Did something pass by
As the river runs freely
The mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers

And see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children
A pure love still grows
Like a bright star in Heaven

That lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone

A yearning to be stilled

Don't get disheartened
There's someone who
Is waiting there for you

Too lonely to come out of hiding

They make love so easy
They don't love at all
You want me to come running
When your worlds falling in
You want me till you got me
Then you're gone again

And your passion comes so easy
Then you ease away from me

Cause the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried
It was the first time you ever really loved
Its the last time you ever tried

Your defenses become you, now you become them
Its one night on the weekend
Then you're gone again
Well Im tears and Im passion and there's a woman in me
Stop all your runnin and I'll set you free

And I stand before you naked, and my soul is on my sleeve

And the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried
It was the first time you ever really loved
And it's the last time you ever tried

The natives are friendly and the lobster's free
Sipping cognac like a french king
Plenty of room, I own the whole thing

Breakfast in new york, dinner in parie
Hangin' out with lynn and suzie
Have a massage and a ja'causezi
Climb into bed and see what's on tv

When mother earth was young and dinosaurs walked to and fro
His skull contained but half a brain but he didn't mind at all
He's a hot shot caveman, yah do dah [?]
Who loved to fight and brawl

He walked the misty plate in time to find whatever he could find
Then at last he saw her there, covered with hair
A cavegirl looking right his way, half naked, half well who can say
Such a thing he'd never seen before, Well then need I tell you more
The caveman fell in love, love, love
And so he wielded his club

Oooh oooh what could he do?
You can't blame a fellow for trying his luck,
He's just a simple caveman who wanted to---
Well when the cavegirl came around she had some things to relate
About the methods he used to communicate
And she said--

(Female spoken)
I never expected a caveman to exhibit much finesse,
But a fifty pound club ain't exactly a caress
So if you want to call me, you better learn to talk
Until you learn some manners buddy,
Take a walk!"

Gray is for betrayal
What you did to me
White is for the blinding light
That I know I'll never see, know I'll never see

Found you in the gutter
You needed tenderness
I gave you everything I had
I gave you all my trust
Handed out so neatly
Caught me in your trap
When I needed you the most
You stab me in the back, stab me in the back

Better luck, better luck, better luck next time
If you do it once there'll never be a second time
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time
Find somebody else, you're never gonna be mine
How do you find the nerve
To lie right to me face
How do you find the nerve

Black is for the nighttime
Preys upon the day
Red is for the blood that flows like rivers in our veins
I try and find excuses
For what you did to me
Can't forget that burning rage
When I wake up thinking of your face
For the blinding swiftness of revenge
That I know I'll never see, know I'll never see

Better luck, better luck, better luck next time
If you do it once there'll never be a second time
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time
Find somebody else, you're never gonna be mine

Over time it's getting harder
Who do I have to go and kill
To get my face on a dollar bill.

Every single time I look
Someone else has beat me to it
Some poor bastard bites the dust
I really don't know who to trust.
But there's one thing I can't deny
I'd rather it was me they fried
Have a drink from an empty cup
Light a match and burn me up.

[Verse 2:]
I'm exhausted, I'm committed,
I'm outsmarted, I'm out witted.
My head's filled with dynamite
It's coming out of my ears at night.

I think I am being watched
Electric eyes that never turn off.
Radar beams insinuating
Evil thoughts while I'm masturbating.
And even my old trinitron,
It's comin through when nothing's on.
Have a drink from an empty cup,
Light a match and burn me up.

You criticize with plenty of vigor
You rationalize everything that you do
With catchy phrases and heavy quotations
And everybody is crazy but you

You're just a middle class, socialist brat
From a suburban family and you never really had to work
And you tell me that we've got to get back

Seems I'm falling down a lot, in between the scenes

Getting harder all the time, harder now to see

Testaments and growing pains. Tranquilizers for the soul.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained - evolution's cruelest joke

Commando girls won't you come out and fight?

Accountant girls so clean
Late at night they hit the streets
Soldiers with a dream.

When they go out they arm themselves

They're tough as nails and armed to the teeth
With automatic M-16s

Iconoclastic girls that know the plan
To finnish the job like no one else can
To fight so the city's safe for you and me

Oh!
Commando girls won't you come out tonight?
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!

They prowl the streets in disciplined packs
Looking for acts of violence
Sweet little poison pussycats
They travel smooth and silent

And when they spot their guilty prey
They waste no time on busts
They stand their ground and open fire
Unload their might of justice

Oh!
Take no prisoners and leave no clues
Read all about it in the morning news
Nobody out there knows what really happened!

Oh!
Command girls won't you come out tonight?
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!

[guitar solo]

When my little girl comes home at night
Exhausted from her fighting
When she unzips her camouflage tights
She always looks so inviting!

Slippery skin all covered with sweat
Shivering in the moonlight.
Smell the gunpowder and sweet hot breath
We're gonna have fun tonight!

Oh!
Under the covers it's hard to know
She risked her life just minutes ago
A stiff salute to their courage and their passion!

Commando girls...

[repeat this verse 3x]
Giddy up Giddy up Get 'em all right
Round em up round em up round em up tight
Ready now ready now ready for the fight
Shoot em up shoot em up shoot em in the night

Commando girls won't you come out tonight?
Commando girls won't you come out and fight?
Commando girls you'll never never catch them crying!

Never catch them crying!
Never catch them crying!
Commando girls...
Commando girls...
Commando girls...
Commando girls...
Commando girls..."

There's someone creeping on my roof
There's someone tapping my phone

They want to probe my intuition
They want to find out what I know
Why don't they leave me alone
Why don't they leave me alone

Mountains of glass reflect the sky
Everybody feels real good in cool city
Each day brings a new surprise
Johnny came two-thousand miles to the cool city
He came to see what makes things tick
He cut his hair and bought new clothes in the cool city
Finally found his life's ambition

How to do nothing perfectly
To do it with style so gracefully
'Cause life is so delicious in Cool City

Outside no one's on the street
Don't stop or you'll miss a beat

Someone's standing in a doorway -- cool city
You open the door and check him out so casually
The music's blasting all night long in cool city
They recognize his face, so it's all right
This one knew the right address
He even knew someone in a band
While the others wait all night standing there in
Cool city

So hard to make the right friends
You might have to sell some skin
The nights go on forever

The blacks they all hate the whites
The whites think they're tough, but they're not, cool city
The boys go out with each other
The girls who will be in movies

If you're high, you're in the right place, cool city
Animals seek out their own kind
Shake some hands and take a lunch in cool city
Someone's going to try and tempt you
Listen to all the brilliant plans in the cool city
It's all free now, but you'll pay later with your soul
Pray to the the objects on the wall
That you'll stay young and never grow old
So come on, the water's fine
Have a drink, snort a line
'Cause the nights get very chilly here in cool city"

Is it living? (Is it dead?)
Is it dead or alive?

Hiding in the cupboards, like little mice
Hiding in the frigerator, that isn't nice
It's not an animal, it don't have legs
No one else can see it

It moves so fast, corner of my eye
Look again it's gone, it's hiding
Won't somebody help me, doesn't anybody care?
It waits so patiently, for me to lose my guard

On the old front porch

To ride down the bannister like some darn fool
Oh don't go... Don't go!!
Don't go in the basement!

Playing rummy on the roof

But don't go in the basement!

Where the cockroaches dance
You can wallow in romance

To ride the elevator filled with ducks

Oh don't go, don't go!

And we've shared each other's sins
We all know what it's like to give up the fight
We've all been ashamed at one time or another
We all have dreams and nightmares too

When it all comes down we'll look out for each other

When the catcher comes to take my soul
He's gonna have to fight me first

And every soul is tender to the touch

Burning truth was on her face
Even thought it was late at night
Saw her once There's no mistake

Now that we've found this precious place. .. .
How do we keep from going crazy now?
My life was leading to this day
Watching the whole thing slip away
It's just a fool's paradise
It's just a fool's paradise
It's just a fool's paradise anyhow

Dirty stains / On brand new linen
Fresh tracks / On virgin snow
Caught a saint / While he was sinning
People scream / What do they know
Turn it off and find religion
Tune it out and find a cause
Get it up and tell the world
Don't stop, Don't ever pause

Here in this place from all our dreams
It doesn't seem to make us better now
If it will get us through the night
With all our conscience still intact
It's just a fool's paradise. .. (etc.)

Two heads / Are better than one. ..
Two hearts / Bleed so much more

Why run / When you can crawl

Tear it up--and throw it away"

In the stillness of disgrace

For breakfast
I used to fly high up in the sky
I used to chew up rocks and
Spit out gravel
I had a heart as cold as ice)

You took away my hope
You took away my fantasy

They get excited, why don't they just relax
All we got to do is kick back, back, back

And be happy, happy
Happy though the whole world is ready to blow
I'm happy that I made it through another day
When I pick up the phone I still remember what to say
I'm happy that my brain still lives inside my head
Most of all I think I'm happy
Happy that I ain't dead

I know a guy with plenty of loot
You'd never catch him in a two dollar suit
He's got gold chains, plenty of rings
He told me money, it don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing
If you ain't happy, happy
Happy though the whole world is upside down
Be happy that you made it through another day
When you pick up the phone you still remember what to say
Be happy that your brain still lives inside your head
Most of all I think I'm happy.....

I'm happy
I'm happy though the whole thing is ready to blow
Be happy that the sun has rised up again
That somewhere in this world I still got a friend
Be happy that the big one, it hasn't dropped yet
Be happy that you still got something
Something, something to forget
I'm happy

(I'm happy, so happy)"

I though I heard somebody cry)
I went to see what I could find
Like flowers in the dead of night
Like shadows in the moonlight--
I though I heard somebody cry
A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts

Chorus
It isn't true
I am not the ghost
Without a soul. .. Come
Listen to my heart
You feel the beat. .. Stop
Listen to the sound
Of moving feet. .. Walk
Through the halls at night
When I'm asleep
I don't believe. .. I don't believe

The shoe is on the other foot--The glove is on the fist
The first is like a cannonball--But it feels like a kiss
I got a bed that's real soft--In a room that's always sad
I thought I heard a window sigh--
I though I heard somebody cry

Chorus

A choir with a single voice--a picnic on a cliff
Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts
I sip the running water--Like rivers from your eyes
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be lost
I thought I heard somebody cry--I thought I'd go and see
I thought I heard somebody cry--Somebody might be me"

You gotta help. ..

Oingo Boingo,Helpless,/o/oingo+boingo/helpless_20102772.html,"Countless long nights
While I stare at the wall
I ask myself over again...

How did I end up
In this little hell?
How - did it ever begin?

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helpless to turn back the clock
That ticks on
With it's cruel shiny face
It laughs while it watches
My every disgrace - I was
Born a sap - all the
Nurses laughed when they
Saw me the first time
They giggled and they said
""This poor little monster'd be
Better off dead. ""

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly trapped in a body
I'm sure -
Should have never been mine.
I bet that my real one's
Doing just fine - and I
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here - I
Should be quite rich
With a big shiny car
A house with twelve rooms
I deserve to go far.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly falling in love
But does love
Really last through the night?
To love - To honor -
To kick and to bite! And I
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here
It's all a mistake
I was destined for greatness
A leader, a prophet -
They're just too blind to notice.

Where did this whole silly story begin?
It seems that my mind has gone -
Blank.
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.
Perhaps it is best if I'm frank!

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess -

Helplessly lost like that
Poor chap who came
For an innocent dance.
He left with his brain smeared
All over his pants! Cause he
Didn't belong here, he
Didn't belong here
He never should've left
That warm cage in a zoo!
His face was so ugly
What else could I do?
Can you - really blame me, I
Had to smash it.
He left me no choice,
He was just like the others.
I just had to kill him.
With my poor, dear, old
Mother.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly fucked in the ass
By a legion of forty ex-cons
That's what it feels like
When you walk all over me.
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here
Your eyes burn right through me.
They fill me with fear.
I could've been at home
Watching football, and drinking beer.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess, so Helpless."

I guess we really want to be just like them...
Just want to be just like them...

I've been expecting it in each and every way

Must have took a wrong turn - when I got out'a bed

Shakin' all the wrong hands - makin' the wrong talk

I'd love to listen to you while you're screaming in your sleep
I'd love to soothe you with my voice and take your hand in mine

Hey, what's all the fuss about?
Hey, what's all the fuss about?

Hey, what's all the fuss about?
Hey, what's all the fuss about?

They say lightning, they say lightning
Lightning never strikes twice in a row

Generations, generations
First they fight and then they forget
What they were fighting about in the first place

Here it comes, the big explosion
Haven't I seen that once before
Or is it just some deja vu
Just some long forgotten dream
Just some silly memory
History does not repeat, it never, never does

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge)
I should know
I've been hit three times (or was it four?)
I'm a walking testimony
Come here, look at these holes
I'm a walking testimony
Just look at these holes, look at these holes!

Generations, generations
Fathers never teach their sons
And grandpa never talked to them and so on

Memories are inconvenient
When there's lessons to be learned
That just might rock the boat too much
Cause anxiety and such
We cannot walk without our crutches
We cannot walk, we cannot walk, we never, never could

(Repeat Chorus and Bridge)

There's a cry there's a cry. .. Cry off in the distance
Of a long, long, long breakdown. ..

There's a light in the tower, there to guide us through
The long night
Through the long night when we're dreaming
Under blankets of deception
In the darkness, undercover we may bump into each other
In the darkness, undercover, looking for a new direction
We may wander, we may wander in geometric patterns
In a long, long, long, long, breakdown. ..

Underwater, underwater, I will meet you underwater
I will find you, I will find you, in the deep & quiet water
In the ocean, in the ocean, we will bask in all it's glory
In the peaceful quiet water, I will tell you all a story

I've never been here, but somehow I think I have

I've never been lost like this
I've never been lost like this
But I wouldn't be happy anywhere else
Nobody to tell us what to do - all by ourselves.

Don't know how I got here and I don't know why I stay
The poets all around are laughing in their graves
Must be something that I said.
This place is not like anything I've seen before
The spirits move around, the houses have no doors
But I'm getting used to it
[Chorus:]

Isn't this a fine hello I wish I hadn't seen you go
It's always a bitter pill The broken mirror's broken still
The letters never made the post, A thousand more I never wrote
And here on dark unfriendly streets, I find the comfort that I seek
And I'm happy, and I've been happy...

She was a simple girl without much to say
So one day she just upped and left her dreary home
And she left all her friends behind to wander all alone
And at first she was afraid, she was so far away
From her home but slowly she got to like it anyway
Oh Mary won't you please come...

Well in time she found that
The mountain that she had been taught
Her whole life, that she must avoid
And though at first it hurt, and no one could comfort her
She finally came to appreciate it
And she like it, she like it - oh wasn't she surprised
And though still alone, she grew so much inside
Oh Mary won't you please come...

And after a time, she became so sublime
She could look in peoples eyes and read their minds
Though her hands would sometimes bleed and occasionally
She would long for her past and the memories they bring
She decided to return to her old home town
And her heart was burning with all the things she found
Oh Mary won't you please come...

So, Mary came back and at first no one recognized her face
And her friends were all a little bit afraid
When they heard what she had to say
They all slowly backed away
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her
They said Mary won't you please come back to us now
There is still time to repent for all your sins
And Mary started to cry when she realized
That she'd never come home again in her life

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come home..."

When the night comes I cannot sit still you see

Got a gallery of figures standing all in a row
And every single figure has a soul of it's own

In so many pieces

So many threads in the wind - drift away - drift away

There's a time and a place
For understanding
And a time when action speaks louder than words
And I don't seem to get no indications
And I don't know how to get through to you
And when time like the pyramids
Has worn away
All the mountains and the valleys
Of the words that we say

We have got to make sure that something remains
If we lose each other we've got no one to blame
So never look back
Never look back
Don't turn your back on me

Tell me your secrets, tell me your name, tell me your secrets

Does it please you to employ little girls or little boys
Nasty habits, nasty habits
Do you like to romp and play by yourself when they're away
Nasty affair what do I care
Do you peek at magazines filled with doggies and leather queens
Nasty habits, nasty habits
Tell me your secrets that no one should hear
Whisper them softly into my ear I won't tell, I won't tell

People act so proper when they're going 'bout their business
Cup of coffee, lfriendly conversation
'Til they get home,
'Til they get home

Turn the phone off, lock the door and shut the curtains
Make sure that the neighbors are without suspicion
No one will know
No one will know
Nasty habits I must condone
No one knows what I do when I'm all alone
Nasty habits I'm so ashamed

Nasty habits here to stay now they'll never go away

It's a new generation
It's a hallucination
It's a mystic vibration
It's just intimidation
It's the will of the people
It's the church with the steeple
It's the sacred devotion
To an unhealthy notion

People raise your voices, don't get into that trap
If your friends and your neighbors push
Why don't you push them back
Don't you think the time has come
To stand up and be heard
Ain't no use to try and wait
For the magic word

It's a new generation
It's an infatuation
It's a beautiful body
Both erotic and deadly
It's the fear of the future
It's just surgeons and sutures
It's a spandex obsession
It's a lasting impression

Do you feel the power
Do you feel the power
Baptized in electronic water
Prodigal sons and beautiful daughters
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks
And the righteous bath
Death to the freaks
Do you feel the power
Do you feel the power
From the man whose voice sounds reassuring
Completely firm and so alluring, Like's he's lived a thousand times before
And seen the world from shore to shore
With the calmness and tranquility that oozes credibility
With the wisdom and the confidence that seem to scream out common sense
And it makes you feel just like a babe
Daddy holding you tight and safe
Hush babe everything's all right, Daddy's gonna stay with you tonight
Now he's got you by the balls, he can sell you anything at all
From morality to diamond rings to genocide to magazines
From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy

It's a new generation
It's a divine inspiration
Always ready to follow
Ever willing to swallow
All the doctor's prescriptions
All the mystic inscriptions
It's the spandex obsession
It's a lasting impression
It's the calm meditation
Of a tranquilized nation
It's a hallucination
It's a new generation"

And when he stole the care
Nobody dreamed that he would
Try to take it so far
He didn't mean to hit the poor man
Who had to go and die
It made the judge cry

Only a lad
He really couldn't help it
Only a lad
He didn't want to do it
Only a lad
He's underprivileged and abused
Perhaps a little bit confused

It's not his fault that he can't believe
It's not his fault that he can't behave
Society made him go astray
Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away
Perhaps he'll go away
He'll go away

You get away with murder
And you think it's funny
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die
Hey there Johnny boy

And you're getting very tired
Lay your head on my lap and I'll sing you this lullaby

That everyone around you
Has felt the pain you feel today
You're out of control yeah--and you want someone to tell you
When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream
You're out of control . . .

There's a cloud-rollin' overhead and it seems to rain on no one else
There's a black sun--casting a black shadow,
And I know you feel so all alone
You're out of control--and you want the world to love you
Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know
That you live and breathe and suffer
And your back is in the corner and you've got nowhere to go

Nothin' for nothin'--everything's right at your fingertips--for a price
Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise
I say--don't throw it away, you've got too many things to say
If you throw your life, if you throw away your life . . .
THe world will never be the same

When we hunt, we all function with one mind
Our collective predications are as sharp as the
Razor in my pocket, and as dull as the ice
Melting slowly in my glass
My only love is the love of oblivion, in a dark room
With as couple of pedestrian wolves
So artfully backlit by a solitary candle
I take my pleasure in soft red clouds of desire
So funky in this unwashed bed for one with the soft red dreams of oblivion

[Chorus:]

I'm so excited 'cause soon I'll hit the streets
I am the crown prince of pavement, I'm so excited
Under the sheltering skin
Stretched out so pale and thin
There is an ocean of bright red liquid love
And that, my friend, is my favorite color
Raised by pedestrian wolves out in the forest
And I take my pleasure on a soft red cloud
And I take my pleasure in the monkey's bed
And the wolves still howl and the light still glowing red
And I take my pleasure in a blue steel cage
And I take my pleasure through the monkey's eye
And the wolves all howl while the world around me dies

In an alley, I'm so excited. I hope they're rough, I hope their skin is tough

This has happened before
It's just pictures of you
In darkness

Pictures of you
I'd been sleeping for hours,
When you came to my house
You'd been lost in a crowd, said you had to get out
You were covered with tears and you said you were sad
So you wanted to play
Yes, you wanted to play
Well you touched me and smiled, as you let yourself go
Oh, but something was wrong, 'cause your touch was so cold
Like you'd been in the ground and you asked if you could
Stay
And I said no!
It's just pictures of you
In darkness

(Pictures of you)
In that lovely white dress, oh your skin was so white
With the moon in your eyes, on that cold winter night
When your lips were so soft, that I though they would
Melt,
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt
And I said yes
And I said yes
It's just pictures of you with a knife in your hand
With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand
It's just pictures of you, standing high on a cliff
With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips
And your eyes were so wild, when you started to laugh
Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream
Why do pictures of you
Come to me when I dream
In darkness

Pictures of you
Pictures of you

Baby said, what a cute little piggy you are
When he took one look at her rocket tits
He smiled real wide and said ""Baby, you're it""

Piggy said baby won't you come with me
My little place is three steps away
Piggy gonna take us both to paradise
He said ""Come on little baby, won't you please be nice""

So Piggy and Baby sauntered into his crib
Said, ""here it is baby, this is where I live""
Won't you take a load off, can I fix you a drink
Baby turned real slowly and said, ""Piggy you stink""

Piggy said baby, do you have a smoke?
Baby said no, she was tryin to quit
Piggy was speechless for a couple of beats
When his jaw dropped open and he said... ""shit""

Now Piggy and Baby had some swingin times
And though piggy was stupid,
Baby sure didn't mind
Baby said, ""lets go straight to the stars""
And Piggy said
""huh? .... whatever""

Baby and Piggy took a walk in the park
It seems that Piggy was in kind of a fix
He owed seven bills to a couple of sharks
Who were gettin kind of itchy in their finger-tips

So they figured it was best to clear out for a while
Piggy had lots of friends, or so he would boast
And his little piggy habit was kind of out of control
So they packed up his Lincoln, and head for the coast

Baby started smokin again on the way
Piggy's little habit was making him sweat
So they stopped off in Vegas for a couple of days
To scam some cash up and make a few bets

They went and shacked up in a place on the strip
Piggy made some calls and Baby got sick
Baby turned to Piggy with a desparate plea
""C'mon Piggy, you know what we need""

But the problem, you see, was that they were broke as shit
So Piggy asked Baby if she'd turn a few tricks
She argued at first, but she finally agreed
With a couple of shiners, she hit the street

Now Piggy felt good, and piggy felt mean
And Piggy was high on his self esteem
So he pulled out his piece, in front of a cop
But the cop said ""Fuck you"" and Piggy got popped"

So close, so close
'Til the bullet gave his kiss
The world cried out loud, the rest is history
And no one knows what's on his mind
Except him and his monkey--come on . . .

You've got a right to know
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see

There's a man at the desk who is talking real soft
To a half dozen guys but not a word is lost
The men depart they all know what to do
With a rifle aiming through a clearing in a bush
So close, so close, but no one thinks to look

You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to know
You've got a right to believe that there's something more to see

On a phone connection on the other side of town
Sits a man with a pencil who doesn't make a sound
He nods his head, the rest is history
But no one knows what's on his mind
Except him and his monkey--come on, come on

And I've always been a sucker for mystery
And I've always been...

Well the mystery that intrigues me the most
Is the one that makes men give up hope
The pride and the search for even little things
That might give a meaning, or even a hint
Cause how can a free man not have hope
When he hasn't even reached the end of his rope

I don't want to say good bye
I want to give it one more try
I don't want to close the gate
I still think that it's not too late
I know when I reach the end
I want to start all over again

And I've always been a sucker for mystery..."
Oingo Boingo,Sweat,/o/oingo+boingo/sweat_20102801.html,"Sweat!
Sweat!
Sweat!
Born for trouble, poised for action
Ready to spring at a moment's notice
Nerves like a trigger, waiting to be pulled
Covered with sweat, it ain't nice

Sweat!
Help me please I'm burning up
I got this fire in my heart
Won't let me sleep, can't concentrate
Even when it's cold I'm dripping sweat
It ain't nice

Sweat!
Rivers running down my back
Makes me slippery, like a fish
If I don't stop, I might drown
Falling down, down, down, down, not dead yet
Covered with
Sweat

Chorus
The cool boys bit the dust
They couldn't take the pressure
The cool girls got knocked up
They only wanted to have fun
(Where did they go?)
They fell in low and suffered
(Where did they go?)
They picked up guns and hammers
(Where did they go?)
Without friction there's no heat
Without heat there's no fire
Without fire there's no desire
You're making me hot, hot, hot, hot!

Sweat! Sweat!
Take my baby, Saturday night
It's hundred and ten, it's alright
Close the door to my little room
Starting to sweat, fun starts soon

Sweat!
Principal caught me after school
Gave me hell, called me a fool
Pointed his finger, at my face
Started to sweat all over the place
Flowed like rivers, onto the floor
I can take it, give me some more

Sweat!
War breaks out throughout the land
Dodging bullets in the sand
Enemy's getting much to close
Sun beats down on the back of my neck
Fingers twitchin', covered with sweat
Covered with sweat

I bump my head
Look at the stars falling on the ground
Saw someone crawling underneath my bed
Looked in the mirror caught my reflection, said oh...

Just take your medicine
Just take your medicine
And don't complain if it don't taste good
Just take your medicine
Just take your medicine
If it don't do the trick then I know what will

Open the paper
Eat ham and eggs
Java in a cup
Middle of the front page
I saw a man with a gun
Pointing at his head
Eyes in the camera
I can almost hear him say, oh...

Just take your medicine
Just take your medicine
And don't complain if it don't taste good
Just take your medicine
Just take your medicine
If it don't kill ya first then I know what will

I met an angel
Come from above
I buy her everything
Could this be love?
She gives me sweet dreams and nightmares too
Early in the morning she whispers in my ear, oh...

Oingo Boingo,The Cat Is Dead,/o/oingo+boingo/the+cat+is+dead_20102848.html,"Deedle Dee, three tots are we.
And we're as clever as can be.
We live with Grandma Ida and our dear old Grandpa Ned
And little Baby Mike (the brat)
And don't forget the siamese cat
And in the attic from Detroit is big, fat Uncle Fred

Oh Grandpa wishes he were rich,
And Grandma just complains (the bitch)
And Uncle Fred gets drunk while Mike just cries all night and day
The cat thinks that he owns the place
He bites and scratches on the face
It'd be so nice if they just went away, away
Ooh daddle, daddle daddle daddle daddle daddle day

[Chorus:]
The cat is dead, the cat is dead
I went to pat him on the head
He didn't purr, he didn't meow he didn't blink or snip.
He seemed to have a funny smile that made me laugh
But all the while, the tail that used o flip and flap
Got awful cold and stiff.
We chopped him into tiny bits,
And seasoned him with apple bits
And with some dust, we made a crust and put him in a pie.
Into the oven he did sit, until the crust was nice and crisp
I'll love that little kitty till I die.
Dee die, dee di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di.

The cat is dead, the cat is dead.
And Mikey too, and Uncle Fred
Expiring oh so suddenly while sipping down some tea.
The tea was hot, the tea was hot
With stricknine and a little spice to
Cover up the funny taste of our conspiracy.
When Grandpa saw what we had done,
He went straight for his hunting gun
But we were quick we sole the clip
The rest is history
To make sure Grandma wouldn't flea
We gave her a lobotomy
And now's she's just as happy as can be
Dee dee, dee deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle dee

It's never too late to reverse a thing that's gone too far

(1st Chorus)
And I think the whole world's laughing at us
But I don't care, that's not the point
There's so much more
There's so much more than meets the eye
Oh, when you're around I'm blind

Now it's the last time to leave the shadows far behind
And it's the last time to clear the cobwebs from our mind
And it's the last time to bury all our memories
And it's the last time before everything just fades away

And I wish that you were here with me
And I wish that somehow things would change
You'd lose your fear of me
And I feel that things might be okay
Oh, wouldn't that be strange

Now it's the last time to reconsider what we've done
And it's the last time to start all over from day one

Whether wrong or right
And we have no fear
No we have no fear
Waiting for the sign
We will give our lives
We will give our lives

And I feel so isolated
It's so lonely here at night
I could almost feel you near me
I imagine that you're with me

On the winning side
We don't ask too many questions on the winning side
And I've got this strange sensation on the winning side
I don't recognize the faces of the winning side
And we all live here in cages . . .

Someone cried last night
And it made a sound
With my eyes closed tight
I hear everything [The Winning Side lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]
I can hear your voice
When I kiss the ground
When I kiss the ground

And I'd like to know you better
And I'd like to know your name
I could really show you something
If you give me half a chance
''cause I'm on the winning side

(Winning side)

In the sleepless night
When the blindness comes
Washing over me
Like a giant wave
On a sandless beach
Washing over me
I am proud to be . . .

And I'd like to take you somewhere
That you've never been before
And I feel so isolated
And I feel so all alone
Here on the winning side

Second only to his car that drives as fast as light
On a highway bad jet fighters come from all directions
Shooting verbal missiles, find their target right on sight, right on sight

In the office things get rough as action is diminished
Staring at a paper he is lost inside his head
Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition
All around, the bodies of the wounded and the dead, and the dead

'Cause he's tough as nails
He's tough as nails
He's tough as nails
He's tough as nails

He's such a live wire
He's such a live wire
He's such a live wire
He's such a live wire

Now it's time for football and a bout with heavy drinking
Holding so much liquor makes him feel like a man
As he drifts out on the sea on a ship that's slowly sinking
Quietly salutes himself and the courage he once had, he once had

(Repeat Chorus)

Walking round and round in circles
Waking up in a cold sweat
Falling down a stairway and the tv dinner's not done yet
Smash a window, crash a car
And buy a pair of leather shoes
Take a sweetheart to a movie
Cash a check and pay some dues

Would I have the courage to go in without you

The things I couldn't see

If we listen to the voices that were silent for so long
If you thought they went away, well you couldn't be more wrong
If I tell you there is something that we've lost but can retrieve
If I tell you there is hope, if we try to believe
You remember there's a dream that we long since put aside
With the toys that we discarded
And the tears we never cried
We could have had it once again, if we try baby try"

If I close my eyes tight and think real hard
I can float lighter than a feather
If I try even harder who knows what I might find
Why maybe a pearl of wisdom
I would trade these pearls for a parcel of flesh
In flesh we were all invented

Can we fly today, can we look here for some fresh kill
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky
Looking for a big surprise
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture....
In another world, in another time
I can picture us a happy family
With our happy kids all flying all around
And leaving far behind the rat-race
Is it time to play? Said the tortoise to the rabbit
Can we fly today, are we creatures all of habit
In concentric circles we'll carve up the sky
Waiting for a big surprise
Fly like a vulture, fly like a vulture...

Maybe talk to the fishies, maybe have some fun
Maybe shake my pale fist at the angry stars
While I dance a jig under the eyes of Mars

Won't you tell your brothers and your sisters tonight,
That you tasted the water and the water was right
Won't you taste the sugar, won't you dance the dance
Won't you wake up please, come on out of your trance

Do you want to be just like someone on T.V.?

Oh boredom is so terrible, it's like a dread disease
Nothing could be worse
Than when there's nothing on T.V.
I'd rather be a cowboy than to stare blank at the walls
I've been reborn so many times
I can't remember them all
(And I say)

CHORUS

Just like someone on T.V.!

I think I'll be a teddy boy, I think I'll be a hunk
I think I'll be a tough guy and I think I'll be a punk
I might just be a fashion star
All dressed in frilly rags
Or perhaps I'll cross the other side
And walk around in
Drag!

CHORUS

Just like somebody on T.V.!

Do you like to be just like a rock
In the middle of the sea
Do you want to suffer by yourself
In a pool of blissful misery
Do you want to feel like a saint in artists' clothes
With a rosary in your hand
Do you wanna be crazy like Van Gogh like a
Stranger in a
Strange, strange land

Would you rather push the buttons
And be feared by all humanity
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum
Do you wanna be stupid, just like me

CHORUS

Just like somebody on T.V.!
Who do you want to be . . . . . . ."

Underneath a blade of grass

Maybe--it's just a bad dream and I'll wake up soon
But I don't think I'll be so lucky
Maybe--it's just one of those strange days when nothing seems right
No nothing seems right at all
Went up to a pay phone on a bathroom wall
But I can't remember who I want to call
Operator can you help me

Have you seen my garden
It is most peculiar
Have you seen my garden
Nothing there that grows
Looks anything at all like plants
I hear their voices. ..
Let's take the whole day off. ..

Everyone says we've come such a long, long way
We're civilized, isn't that nice?
We've gotten so smart
We know how to blow the whole world apart
But when it comes to the simple things
(like living together) .. . Ha!

Verse
Why'd we have to come all this way
Is anything any easier to understand
Why'd we have to come all this way
Are we any smarter than primitive men
We still fall in love though we know better
Anything at all just to stay together
Stop wasting all my time

Chorus
Why did we come all this way
Why did we come all this way
Why did we come all this way
Why did we come all this way

Verse
Why'd we have to come all this way
We could have quit while we were way ahead
Why'd we have to come all this way
We could have just stayed home instead
The road was long and the journey was hard
We never even dreamed that we'd come so far

I know what you're thinking about...all the time..

I work so hard trying to make a few bucks 
I pass the hours in a dream 
The sweat keeps rolling off the tip of my nose 
There's only one thing keeps me on my feet 

And I may be greasing the wheels of a noisy factory
And I may be hunched over metal machines
Watching the gears as they move
Just reminds me of bodies in motion
The sweat and the sound

Makes me think of...
Wild sex in the working class
After five it's a gas
Wild sex in the working class
Counting minutes gonna get home fast

Thinking of your warm skin
While I touch cold steel
The days go by to the pounding beat
My back is aching so bad
But I'm grinning inside
Thinking of you keeps me on my feet

And I may be greasing the wheels of a noisy factory
And I may be hunched over metal machines
Watching the gears as they move
Just reminds me of bodies in motion

Makes me think of...

You heard it on the airwaves
That she joined the sla
Oh the stories, tape recordings
Just when things seemed at their worst
Then the good Lord heard you calling
And he gave back Patty Hearst

You got your baby back
Poor girl is out of the sack
Silly young thing, was just a fling
Like any teenager would do
But daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes
And maybe a new cadilliac
You got your baby back

When she started to flee, you gave food for free
But you knew that you would'nt go broke
The day in the bank, the sporting, the prank [?]
Was just a fraternity joke

You got your babe, that's no lie
Thanks to the old fbi
Time to relate and sit by a pool
And maybe she'll go back to school

And Daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes
Amd maybe a new cadilliac
You got your baby back

Why Patty baby
I knew deep down in my heart that you'd be coming back to your papa
And honey, I did'nt believe a thing they said in all those silly little old
Newspapers,
Especially the ones I didn't own.
But don't worry darling, We'll be keeping your supper warm

Follow where love will lead us
Making sweet memories

The others guild and fear

They're left crying in the dark
So they grow to be afraid
And feel they can't go on
Pass along those fears
To generations yet unborn
Hear me calling you
Can't you hear me calling you?
Hear me calling out to you, yeah

Careful how you treat each other

When you whispered softly in my ear
And we heard the language of our passion loud and clear
When love was spoken here
When did we lose sight of all the promise in our arms
When did we let go of everything that made us strong
Remember when ""I'm sorry,"" was enough to pull us through

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

It wasn't accidental

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental

This all feels right time, right place
Cos every time I see you face to face
Our future calls
Not saying you bend the truth
Just doing my best to get to you
Made you my destiny

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental"

Put it all, put it all, put it all over me
And grant me on my wishes at one time
Now give me that fantasy!

You're all tied up
And it's different every time,
But you always feel the same, the same
Don't change, don't you ever change

Be that fantasy that I visualize
And you're telling me to do the same,
And we'll just dress our love up in the skies
And I'll show what that means!!

Put up your hands, show your desire
If you want this, don't hold back.
Asked you to stand like one of the choir
Lift up your voice, build it up higher
In this moment, don't look back.

Cause tonight, the stars are in your eyes
Tonight, our arms are opened wide

I don't want to be anywhere else
And if I have to give all of myself
I don't want to be anywhere else but here with you

Lost in the sounds, a song in your head
Jumping around, nothing compares to this moment
And nothing ever will

Cause tonight, the stars are in your eyes
Tonight, our arms are opened wide

I don't want to be anywhere else
And if I have to give all of myself
I don't want to be anywhere else but here with you

A million eyes stare into space
Not you and I, we're face to face
I don't want to be anywhere else but here

Turn the whole world upside down - let's pour it out
Let's all reach for higher ground while we're looking down

Strike up the band, let's start a fire
Put up your hands, show your desire
If you want this, don't hold back

I don't want to be anywhere else

Saw I was grieving for some other time 
Stood on my breath and moved close to say 
Oh won't you love me let's walk out to play 

Ooh we caught the moon from the sky 
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes 
And if the words don't tell me you love me 
And if the night won't hold us as one 
Now there is nothing left that can numb me 
Do you love me or do I run 

Why don't you ask me to stay? 
Ask me to stay 

Looked so surprised when she said to me 
Can you move the mountain then we can both see 
She fell in my arms then I melted away 
She said why won't you ask me ask me to stay? 
She picked up the pillow and lay down her head 
We were loving like good friends again 
Why don't you touch me, like we use to know 
Move over and love me or let me go 

And if the words don't tell me you love me 
And if the night won't hold us as one 

And if the words don't tell me you love me 
And if the night won't hold us as one 
Now there is nothing left that can numb me

Puts her armor on
When she steps outside

Is in black and white
And the color's gone

And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart
And I don't know why
And I'm picking up the pieces when we fall to the feet
We confide in other demons, though she'll never be free
We could hide it in the shadows, though it's hard to believe
And I don't know why

They're all stopping and staring
I'd go anywhere
Oh, why can't you just see that?
I'm crazy about you
I can't live without you
You don't see it, 
But you're beautiful to me

Closed our eyes
Enjoy the view

We don't wanna hear
The real world passing by
Saying that we're crazy

We spend all our time lying side by side
Going nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy doing nothing
We spend all our time running our lives
Getting nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy, doing nothing.

No magazines or dvd'd we both got
Better things to do
I'll hold your hand
Or shall we dance together
It's so hard to choose

Every time we hear
The whole world rushing by
I know that we're not crazy

We spend all our time lying side by side
Going nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy doing nothing
We spend all our time running our lives
Going nowhere, it's really something
Getting busy, doing nothing.

Should be working hard
Instead of lying here naked
Phone rings but I wont take it
Cos you only get one life... Only get one life"

I can’t stop my hands from shaking cos I’m cold and alone tonight.
I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet.
We tried.

We tried.

Woman: I understand why we split before a month.

Verse 2
Been thinking about the ball we dreamt.
Feeling like the sofa was sinking.
I was warm in the hope of your eyes.

Pre Chorus 2
So if my words break through the wall to meet you at your door, all I could
Say is:
“Girl, I mean them all.”

Chorus 2
Dear Darlin’, please excuse my writing.
I can’t stop my hands from shaking cos I’m cold and alone tonight.
I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet. We tried.

Oh I concur. These arms are yours to hold.

But it was just a sketch of you in black and white
What kind of crazy spell did you leave me on
It takes some kiss and tell and then you were gone

So put another record on. Kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song. Playing on repeat
Cos every time we come this close my heart
Skip skips a beat

[Chorus:]
So come on spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
Cos when you hold me like this
You know my heart skip skips a beat
I know I should but I can't leave you alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skip skips a beat

Oh x5

[Verse 2:]
So hung up. We can't let go
If you really have to leave
One more time just move me slow

So put another record on. Play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Cos all you ever need to know is what you do to me
And every time you hold me close
My heart skip skips a beat

Chorus
Oh x5

Rizzle Kicks. Yeah. At the start of the night
Was like (what) Lets have a team talk.
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd
Agreed for. Vibes keep going up and down like
A see-saw. Should of just taken her to the
Cinema to see Saw. Cool, she let me stick with
Her I figured her figure's a sure shot winner.
Plus I've got to lead from the back I'm a skipper

You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip,
Skip, skip a beat
So come on spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
Cos when you hold me like this
You know my heart skip skips a beat
I know I should but I can't leave you alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skip skips a beat"

Still miss my kisses or maybe you don't

I don't care anymore

You want it like we had it before

I broke the chains before they choked me out

Really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

Hey yo, I know you never heard this before
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war
And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed
Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store
Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears
I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do
Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views
No, I was a first class rookie,
Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie
Man of mystery, you know the history
Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here

I broke the chains before they choked me out

I've been beaten and broken but I healed though
So many ups and downs, roughed up and clowned
We all got problems, but we deal though
I'm tryin' to do better now, find my inner peace
Learn my art form, and find my inner Chi
When my backs on the wall, I don't freeze up
Nah, I find my inner strength and I re-up
Here we go, I know I've never been the smartest or wisest
But I realize what it takes
Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises
But gotta make it to the next day
It's a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run
Like you're runnin' outta air and your breath won't come
And you (uh) wheezin', gotta keep it movin'
Find that extra (uhn) and push your way through it

I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em
I've had opponents but I knocked them out
I climbed the highest mountains
I swum the coldest seas
There ain't a thing I've faced that's been too much for me

(but we say)
Nobody's gonna see me comin'
Nobody's gonna hear a sound
No matter how hard they tryin'
Nobody's gonna bring me down

Nobody's gonna see me comin'
Nobody's gonna hear a sound

And you've been thinking
Playing tricks on your mind
Made your words sound unkind
You were cold, oh so cold
I can see from your tears you think it's over
Got the whole weight of our love
On your shoulders

You know as well as I do
That our prospects are good
If you think I'm leaving
Then you've misunderstood

Just smile and I'll be yours again
Baby just sing a little word in my ear again
Don't worry 'bout the things that you said
Don't mean anything
One smile that's when I'll be yours again, I'll be yours again

When you told me to go
You lost all self control, I was hurting
Now you're filled with regret
Cos you can't take it back
Feel all alone,
When you should of known

No need to complicate things to work this out

This foolish heart of mine... Gets frustrated
Can't read between the lines
And the signal that I'm waiting for
Is always locked behind the door
And It makes me want you more

And I will surrender
Wear my heart upon your sleeve
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever
So let your love shine down on me

If I could have my way... I'd take you baby
Out every night and day
You're the battery to my heart
And without you I can't start
Don't you leave me in the dark

And I will surrender
Wear my heart upon your sleeve
Just put your trust in me and I will be there forever

It's your moves, baby
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (yeah)

Oh my, come and teach me how to dance

Dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub, G and a thug
Watch how I be in the club
Lookin', starin', darin', comparin'
In my book, they say sharin' is carin'
So give me a taste (haha)
And make your hips just dip to the bass
And watch me run the line
See what I come to find?

And it's starting to show, 
But lets turn nothing into something
I can't do it alone.

We were caught in a bubble, no one could burst.
Had whole conversations without any words.
We got right to the top
And couldn't believe the view.

It's a long way down.
Nobody cares when it feels like flying a long way down, yeah.

Ain't got no rhyme or reason
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season

Baby girl with the broken smile
Would you mind if I stayed a while?
And if you're cold, I could light your fire
If that's what you want, if that's what you want
I admit that I done some wrong
But those wrongs helped me write this song
And through it all, I figured out where I belong
Right by your side, right by your side

They say that hearts don't lie
The head might try but it won't be right
You tell me what you feel inside
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Listen honey, to every word I say
I know that you don't trust me

Baby girl, let your hair hang down
And if we're lost, baby let's get found
And when the world's flipping upside down
Let's make it right, let's make it right

They say that hearts don't lie
The head might try but it won't be right
You tell me what you feel inside
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Listen honey, to every word I say
I know that you don't trust me

Just want to rescue her from it all

No secrets that hide
And we leave the past behind

When we're leaving
We won't look back any more
Why don't we just go, go, go

Is it too much to handle

Wasting time that I just don't have

When I'm in economy class

And I could be on my knees
Going from bad to worse
And all a my hopes and dreams 
Come crashing down to earth
No matter how bad it seems...

Every single morning it's a sunny day

So they can hear me screaming from miles away
Gotta tell the world how I feel about you
Tell the World

Need the highest roof I can find 
I'm headed for the top
Dodging all the rocks
Till I hit the clear blue sky

Every day I keep it to myself
I'm doing damage to my mental health
If I don't let it go think I might explode
If I don't get help

What a wonderful feeling
She got me up s high feel like I'm touching
The ceiling
I can touch the sky me and the birds are chilling
Yeah you got that lottery love - one in a million
One of a kind, many men spend their whole lifetime
Searching for the special someone but it

Or if you're somewhere listening to Bob Marley
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me

Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi breeze

Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me

No point regretting that it went so fast

But when I look behind
I'm so glad that you were minei remember taking you home on that 86
Standing in your doorway where we used to kiss
Then your Dad came out and chased me down the street
If you remember just how scared I used to be

Who knows my name and looks so hot
I always get an extra shot and smile for free

And this is for the girl, so sugar sweet
At the bus stop waiting for the 23
She's so shy, I wish she'd notice me

This one's for the girls x2

This one's for the girl in the pub sitting next to me
She spends too much on the fruit machine
She drinks me under the table every time

And what about the one from around the way?
She's not all that, but that's okay
She talks to tree's but still, she blows my mind

Woah woah woah ohh
There's nothing better
Woah woah woah ohh

This one's for the girls
I can't stop thinking about you
This one's for the girls
Life would really suck without you

This one's for the girls, girls, girls
All around the world
I love to love to love, love to love those girls

And this one's for the girl at the club in the trilby hat
Standing up on the bar shaking this and that
Even though she's got that big exam at 8

And here's to all those office girls
From the secretaries to the CEO
Baby when you coming home?
Coz I can't wait

Woah woah woah ohh
There's nothing better
Woah woah woah ohh

This one's for the girls
I can't stop thinking about you
This one's for the girls
Life would really suck without you

This one's for the girls, girls, girls
All around the world
I love to love to love, love to love those girls

I love to love those girls

Huh, listen
I love those Scottish girls
I can't resist the Irish girls, and
The Welsh and English girls
Haha, and don't forget the Essex girls

No matter where I go
No matter what I do
The only thing I know
It's all about the girls

This one's for the girls
I can't stop thinking about you
This one's for the girls
Life would really suck without you

This one's for the girls, girls, girls

Pen and paper I'm gonna right this down
Saying things you never thought
That were on my mind,
Let the truth pour out
Cause I'm tired of the games
I won't lie, no I'm not ok,
You were wrong, you're to blame,
Now the world knows your name.

Chorus:
So here you go,
You're finally getting a song about you on the radio
Are you happy now that you broke me down?
Now I curse the day that I met you
I hope you know this song is about you,
This was no mistake, yes I meant to
I hope you know this song is about you, about you!

This song is about you, yeah!
Seem I'm feeling better now,
I like the way our heads lifting off my chest,
Should have done months ago
If I knew back then it would feel like this,
Cause you done all the games
I won't lie, no I'm not ok
You were wrong, you're the blame
Now the world knows your name.

Chorus:
So here you go,
You're finally getting a song about you on the radio
Are you happy now that you broke me down?
Now I curse the day that I met you
I hope you know this song is about you,
This was no mistake, yes I meant to
I hope you know this song is about you, about you.

When you hear this play,
I hope you feel the same way that I felt that day
That you let me, yeah you left me,
This is my confessional
Pen and paper I'm gonna right this down.

Chorus:
So here you go,
You're finally getting a song about you on the radio
Are you happy now that you broke me down,

It all could go away This silence is deafening
This ocean is without an end

Something I know, we were meant to be

But life always goes so fast

And I remember it all so clear
You signed your name on my heart
Saying you were here

Years and years, yet to come
I take every second of every minute
As long as you're in it, I know I'm winning

I don't wanna be your fool

Throw me down when you are through
Cause I've learned more from what's missing

I know I made some bad decisions
But my last one was you...

Orleans,Grown Up Children,/o/orleans/grown+up+children_1744911.html,"When I was a kid, I played guitar for hours on end
Down in the basement where the radio and records were my friends
My folks didn't like it much, I was breakin' all the rules
'Cause drummin' on the desk and hummin' to myself wasn't their idea of school

They kept talkin' about grown up children
Playin', singin'
Never doing what they're told
Grown up children
Actin' like they'll never grow old

Though I was underage, I joined the band at the local bar
Pretty soon we hit the road as the warm-up for some fading star
And they said, ""now keep the set short, don't play that so loud""
So we plugged our guitars in and turned them up to ten
And jumped right into the crowd

'Cause we were just grown up children
Playin', singin'
Never doing what they're told
Grown up children
Actin' like they'll never grow old

It's good work if you can get it
'Cause you don't have to act your age
In real life, I'm known as a family man
But tonight, I'm a kid on the stage

One of those grown up children
Playin', singin'
Never doing what they're told

Of America rising from the sea
In the new world, their new home
Had a view of the Statue of Liberty

Keep the dream alive
Watch over me

My mother grew up on a farm
In northern Idaho
Her father told her of his dream
That a working man could make the wheat fields grow
When the chores were done at night
She studied by the candlelight
To learn about her country's history
From around the world, her people came
Drawn by the light of justice and liberty

Keep your light held high
Keep the dream alive
Watch over me

I live in California now
With a family of my own
I tell my children of my dream
To reach out and discover worlds unknown
Someday we're going to take a trip
Descendants of the immigrants
Fly through the sky from sea to shining sea
To stand where so many dreamed their dreams
Beside the Statue of Liberty

Running from pain

Thinking I can see how dreams become reality

Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Oh i didn't worry, i was a fool
Playing the field
And running around having fun, man
I know everybody make a mistake sometime

But when i got home
My baby, she was gone
And i found her letter lying
Right there on the kitchen floor
It read, ""i tried to wait
For you to come, honey
But like a fool
You were running around doing me wrong""
I'm sorry, i know, baby
Everybody make a mistake sometime
I know i made one

And oh, so if you are running around
With somebody else
Tryin' to satisfy
Man, you can't satisfy you selfish self
So man, you gotta take heed

Go to sleep at night
With a cold wind of breeze

I ain't got no friends
I got cold enemies

The lamb was sure to go
He followed her to school one day
And that was against the rules
He made the children laugh and play
You've seen that lamb
Oh that lamb in school
Oh Mary
Listen let me tell you something
Ever since I was four years old
I hated a silly rule
Ever since they ran Mary's lamb
Oh all the way home from school
You should have seen Mary cry
When she waved to her lamb goodbye
The teacher said Mary come inside
Come on and dry, oh, dry your eyes
Oh, oh, oh Mary
Wait a minute
Mary don't you be so blue
And bring that lamb back to school
And Mary don't you be no fool
You see the lamb daily thru
When you go, oh, home today
You and your lamb can play
You can even do the twist
And then it goes
Something like this
Oh, oh, oh Mary
Oh, oh, oh Mary
Come on Mary
Don't you be such a moaner
Don't moan no more
Hey, hey, hey Mary, hey, hey
Come on Mary, oh

Something is wrong with me

I know when she's a little worried
I feel that same old misery
We've been through so much together
We stand as one and that's what makes it better

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me

Just what she means to me you out there just can’t understand it
People can say my woman, she's no good
But she's my woman and I know I’m her only man
And if he's got a problem, I got to help him solve ‘em

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me"

Little bitty little bitty little bitty children that try to listen
To hear for the sleigh bells that are already in the snow
I want to tell you one more time what I am thinking about
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas there
With there, for every Christmas card that I'll write you over
I wont to do it over
May your days, may your days be so merry, merry and bright
Oh darling, I wished I'll love them
One more thing
And may all, all of your Christmases, and may all,
And may all of your Christmases merry
May, may your days be merry, merry, so merry and bright
Only if I am busted, I would wish I'll love a party
And may all of your Christmases be so white
I must say of a white, dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm dreaming, dreaming of a white, white Christmas
Baby, baby, all I'm dreaming, dreaming of a Christmas
Yea, I love you, white Christmas"
