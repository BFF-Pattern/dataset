Phineas (Talking):
Ladies and Gentlemen my sister, Candace Flynn!

Candace (Singing):
And in the end the most important thing
Is that we never forget
The end of a shoelace is called the...

Candace (Talking):
Wait a minute! It doesn't matter.
I can't beleive I was almost sucked into this!

Phineas And Ferb,Ain't Got Rhythm,/p/phineas+and+ferb/aint+got+rhythm_20746896.html,"So you're saying that you don't have rhythm
But listen at what you're doing right there
With that stamp and a book you've got a real nice hook
Sounds to me like you've got rhythm to spare

I have no idea what your talking about
I've got as much rhythm as that chair
What happened to me was a tragedy
But I don't have to be a millionaire
Look I got a sweet deal going on here
I've got all the books that I can read
All these sweet old ladies and this carpet from the 80's
What more could a librarian need?
Besides I ain't got rhythm
No I ain't got rhythm
Said I ain't got rhythm
I ain't got rhythm

You're kidding me right, you're, you're kidding me
Don't you see what you were doing right then
That's a wicked groove you were starting to move
Mr., you got rhythm times 10

I think perhaps that your not listening
I find it tedious to repeat
It's no big crime
I just can't keep time
I'm telling you I lost the beat
I don't need my face on t-shirts
Or hit a power-chord guitar
They were screaming my name
I guess it's a shame
But I don't need to be a rock star
Besides I ain't got rhythm
No I ain't got rhythm
Said I ain't got rhythm
I ain't got rhythm

I ain't got rhythm
Sounds like rhythm to me
No I ain't got rhythm
Seems like they all agree
Said I ain't got rhythm
I aint got rhythm
But your laying down some funky syncopation
I ain't got rhythm
But you got that beat
No I ain't got rhythm
Look at them, their stomping their feet
Said I ain't got rhythm

I ain't got rhythm
It's time for you to rock a brand new generation
Gonna rock a brand new generation

Cause I ain't got rhythm
Would you just go join the band
Hey! Look at me!
Hey I got rhythm!"

Lawrence and Phineas: I know she's from another galaxy, 
Lawrence: I don't know just what she's a-doing with me! 
She treats my love like a science experiment...

Does she love me for who I am?
Or does she want to put my brain in a can?
She can have it 'cause I never want to be apart...

Charlene-2: His wife is thrown in right beside him
Under key and lock.
So to avoid a situation
With such limited appeal... 
Doofenshmirtz-2: Me and Mrs. Doofenshmirtz, 
We struck a little deal.

Charlene-2: We told everyone around us
We had split.
Doofenshmirtz-2: Yes, we were through! 
So, if they came to haul me off, 
They wouldn't get her, too.
Charlene-2: There's that and then there's also tax
Advantages, of course.
Doofenshmirtz-2 and Charlene-2: All the convoluted reasons
We pretend to be divorced.

We get double the amount
Of discount coupons in the mail.
We have twice the junk to offer
In our annual yard sale.
We each have our separate bathrooms, 
Bedrooms, living rooms, and dens, 
We see each other all the time
But through a telescopic lens.

Charlene-2: We don't agree on restaurants
Or where to holiday.
Doofenshmirtz-2: But now for those activities
We go our separate ways.
Doofenshmirtz-2 and Charlene-2: We spend so little time together, 
Conversation's never forced.
All the convoluted reasons
We pretend to be divorced."

But if I'm pressed
I'd say you look a little young to drive a forklift
Phineas: Yes, yes I am
Eng.: It's good to see a younger guy like you

Who's creative and ambitious
A little bigger than his britches
And who got a fresh, exciting point of view
Yes, it's true

To do the things that you do
Even with all the moxie you've got
Yes, you seem a little green

No I don't! 
When people ask me what I mean, I say
D-D-D-Do I stutter! 

Dr. Doofenshmirtz: But I'm no longer a hater
Cause I got an Inator
And a over-complicated scheme
I get a couple of checks
Every month from my Ex
So I can finance my coming regime!

I won't let it affect
My aspirations to cause mass hysteria

That it's my destiny
To be the ruler of the Tri-State Area!"

My backyard beach... My backyard beach,
Nothing's out of reach in the backyard beach,

Drink out of a coconut,

You got skiing... Para sailing,
Surfing and a flailing put our contacts in saline or the rest you can't see,

And, they're draggin' me down.
Got these chains on me,

Got these chains on me,

We've got a lot to do, before the dawn

Shake your jingle bell in my direction

Sometimes I feel like a big snowman
That's fallen under a plow.
But tonight I'm on top of the world
We're gonna bring it around somehow.

And we've had our fun,
But this isn't the end of our story.

So for nostalgia's sake,
Let's just take a break.
Sit back and take inventory.

We've done so many wondrous things
And there's still so much to do,
But I make the most of every day
Whenever I'm with you.

Because...

It's not about the summer sun
Or even all the things we've done.
It's not about the change in the weather.
It's just about the time we spend
With our family and with our friends.
It's just about the time spent together.

It's just about the time,
Not the weather,
It's just about the time
Spent together...

It started real simple with a cool rollercoaster,
An awesome beach party, then we raced stock cars.
We were one-hit wonders with a big hit song,
And in a special two-parter, we sent Candace to Mars.
We built tree house robots, hunted bigfoot and a mummy,
Got the band back together and our parents, too.
When my brothers got busted, it was only a dream!
But who had that dream, was it Perry or you?
Actually, I think my dream wasinside of Perry's dream.
My mind is blown.

There's been 104 days of summer vacation,
We've had a lot of fun, and sung a lot of songs,
So now it's time for a big celebration
'Cause it's been a great summer
And we thank you for comin' along!

Thank you for comin' along!
Thank you for comin' along!

I'm six foot two, and I fight a little platypus!
Ya think I'd be victorious just every now and then.
I've had a whole lot of schemes and a lot of inators!
But I failed...
Over and over and
Over and over
And over and over again!
Aw, but it was fun, though.

We spent a day fighting pharmaceutical zombies,
Would've solved cold-fusion but did fashion instead.
We met Klimpaloon and Meap and the Lake Nose Monster
But we're still baffled by the Giant Floating Baby Head.
We played Hockey Z-9 and Football X-7,
We went 'round the world and to thevery edge of space.
We met our doppelgängers in the second dimension.
Isabella kissed me but I got my mind erased...
Wait, what?
You just wait 10 years.

There's been a hundred and four days of summer vacation
We've had a lot of fun, and sung a lot of songs,
So we think it's time for a big celebration
And it's been a great summer,
So we thank you for comin' along!

Thank you for comin' along!
Thank you for comin' along!
Thank you for comin' along!
Thank you for comin' along!

Anyone want some pie?
Yes. Yes we do.

It's just about the time
We spent together,
It's just about the time
We spent together...

With you.

Phineas And Ferb,Danny's Story,/p/phineas+and+ferb/dannys+story_20750303.html,"When I was a boy down in South Illinois
I heard a man playing blues what a wonderful noise.
He had an old guitar but not a dollar to his name.
Making music so sad but he was happy just the same.
He gave me a wink and said son let me share the news.
If you want a happy life you've got to learn to sing the blues.
I asked my daddy for a guitar I begged and I plead.
I said I wanted to play the blues and he just nodded his head.
Daddy said when he was my age boogy-woogy was the thing.
Just take the blues a round trip and add a little swing.
Music has the power that without it he'd have sworn that he'd have never had met my mom and I wouldn't have been born.
So what's this?
This is psychedelia
It's where the guitar solo came from
No I mean what with all the colors
I have no idea

I kept learning all the powers my guitar had
I made it go walka-walka till it was so good it was bad.
Just make a face and stomp that bass you can make that rhythm pump.
So this is the blues just in a way that makes you want to shake your rump.
I can make you clap your hands. I can make you do a dance.
If you want to shake your booty my friend you've got to give the funk a chance.

Metal!
Pound your fist in the air!
Metal!
Wave your head full of hair!
It's crunchy and it's nasty full of bad attitude.
Your parents will think you're crazy!
Your neighbors will think you're rude!
Believe it or not it's all the blues again!
You just add a little fuss and turn your amp up to ten!

To spend it with a platypus
We're always so ecstatic
'Cause he's semi aquatic
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus
Brings smiles to the both of us
Life's never fuddie duddy
With our webfooted buddy
When we're brushing our teeth, It's better
Tying our shoes, It's better
Combing our hair, It's better
Like we're a cheese sandwich and he's the cheddar
Blinking our eyes, It's better
Breathing in and out, It's better
Sitting in a chair, It's better
And taking a bath is just a little bit wetter

When you start it with a monotreme
He's duckbilled and he's beaver tailed and hairy

Let me spell out for you mom,

And a beach in the backyard,
Drove cattle through the city,
And messed up the boulevard,
They took me back in time when we went to that museum,
They built 50 feet tree house robots,

Going on a snipe hunt

Is a lovely shade of teal
From his duck-billed nose
To his web-bed toes
And his nerves were made of steel.

Carl: What does this have to do with Christmas?

Monogram: Well, I'm just describing him so that people have a mental
Picture. It matches the original song.

The night before Christmas
Was a crisis at the Pole
Cause old Doofenshmirtz
He had done his worst
And a sleigh that day, he stole

Doof too it on a joyride
Just as far as he was able
But Doof, that goof, lost control
Ran into the reindeer stable

Now all the reindeer
Were on crutches or in traction
So old Agent P
He knew that he must spring right into action

Look at that platypus
Look at that platypus
Look at that platypus go
Look at that platypus
Look at that platypus
Flying o'er the snow

Carl: O'er sir?
Monogram: It's a contraction. It means over.
Carl: It's a bit archaic.
Monogram: It's traditional Carl, get o'er it.

So the reindeer were out of commission
And Santa's sleigh was trashed
I'd explain it more
But we've been there before
It doesn't need to be rehashed

Santa Claus was freaking out
Thought he'd have to scrap his run
He was torn inside
For without a ride
He knew Christmas Day was done

But then o'er the horizon
Came a light bright as a star
Cutting through the night
Was the two headlights
Of Perry's hovercar

Perry the platypus
Had a mission at the Pole
If he could lend a hand in the frozen land
He'd help Santa reach his goal

There must have been some magic in that platypus-themed hovercar
For when Santa saw the gas gauge
He knew it could take him far

Carl: Really sir?
Monogram: They want this album yesterday, alright?

Perry the platypus
Took Santa on his way
And he came through
Like we knew he'd do
And saved our Christmas Day"

Upon him posthumously

Your legs are crossed when seated
Your toes are pointed so
Your pinkies raised while drinking
But that's not all you need to know

You mustn't curse or spit or tattle, never gossip
A lady never scratches, sweats, or burps
She knows which knife and fork and spoon to use and when
And if soup is served it's impolite to slurp

It's always ""please and thank you, sir or madam""

I hate flowers in the Spring!
I even hate the sunshine

Christmas never was that bad, you see!

You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice;
Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
O! You better watch out!
You better not cry
Better not pout

Phineas And Ferb,Serious Fun,/p/phineas+and+ferb/serious+fun_21119313.html,"Lyrics for Serious Fun by Phineas
(Doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo...)

Get out your tool case,
Put on your game face.
Get out your brushes - gonna paint this town.
Let's just get rockin',
No time for talkin'.
Just fourteen hours 'till the sun goes down.

We've got one last day of summer,
One more day before school has begun.
One last day in the sun,
Let's have some serious fun!

(Doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo...)

Every day of summer,
We've given a hundred percent.
But today, we'll give a hundred and one.
Baljeet: But that is not mathematically possible...
Phineas: You know what we mean!
Baljeet: Yes, I understand: hyperbole.

(Doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo...)

We set a precedent
For entertainment -
We're doin' somethin' and it's gonna be big.
Put on your glad rags and pack a lunch bag.
No, somethin' smaller - not that sucklin' pig.

We've got one last day of summer,
One more day before school has begun.
We've got one last day in the sun,
Let's have some serious fun!
(Let's have some serious fun...)
Let's have some serious fun!
(Let's have some serious fun...)
Let's have some serious fun!
(Let's have some serious fun...)

You wasted all my time learning how to rhyme, now let me hang it from a treble clef!

Somebody give me a grade!

And make it an A!

Oh, I am so upset!

I won't be told how to vent!
I won't cry or sigh, I'm here to testify,
Up with the establishment!

My parents understand me, for conformity inside of me with which I can help the system out!
I ain't gonna waste my summer taking beatings from my drummer,
Put a mic in front of me and I'll shout!

Give me a grade!

You know I'm gonna rock the curve!
Somebody give me a grade!

The only letter I deserve!

The nights are shorter
The sun is shining
Ferb: It's noticeably warmer

Phineas: Summer, every single moment is worth it's weight in gold
Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin
It's summer, man, where do we begin?

Summer is ponds and pools and garden hoses, tryin' to beat the heat
Summer, bicycles and roller skates and even just bare feet
It's also... Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane...
Oh, wait. Maybe we're going too fast.

Summer, it's crickets and cicadas and a glass of lemonade
Summer, it's sitting with your brother in the backyard under the shade of a
Big tree
That's what it means to me

The days are longer
Phineas and 2nd Dimension Phineas: The nights are shorter

You know I'll say
Tell me what you wanna do today
All we need is a place to start
If we have heart, we'll make it
'Cause we're not messin' around (we're not messin' around)
Yes we can dream it, do it, build it, make it
I know we can really take it
To the limit before the sun goes down

All right, I'm taking a verse.

Phineas
Be my guest.

Candace
I traveled halfway 'round the world
And almost turned and ran away
But you helped me get my courage back
So now I've got to say
That though I've often thought of you
As just a nuisance and a bother
Today I can't imagine
Having better little brothers
And you gotta believe in something
So today I believed in you
And you came through, we made it
I've never been so proud (never been so proud)
I know at first it seemed implausible
But we accomplished the impossible
Now there's something that I've got to say out loud
Time is what you make of it, so take a chance

Phineas
That's it! 

Candace
Life is full of music so you ought to dance

She's got it!

Will change your point of view

Down the stairs the children run.
Someone has eaten the cookies.
And look what's left under the tree.

As far as the eye can see.
What's on the rooftop
I wonder what there was
There's reindeer flyin' around the world
Because Santa's comin'!
I think we all should pause
To say that we're grateful
For everything he does.
Thank you Santa Claus!

They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally ran aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away... Slipped away"

The boot falls to the floor
As darkness falls the waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is warm.
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields
A cold rain is falling
Near the golden dawn.
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds and I go down

In the haze and the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die."

You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.
And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone.
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everythings done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone."

Engine taken from a 707
Sounds like a sure way to get into heaven

In his pocket, 5 pounds of lead
To keep Bo Diddley from getting dead
Another thing helped Bo keeping alive
Was a snub-nosed, Smith And Wesson, Colt 45

And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and
Something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks
And no one tries
And no one flies around the sun
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Comes streamin in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky."

In the twinkling of an eye:
Eighty years, with luck, or even less.
So all aboard for the American tour,
And maybe you'll make it to the top.
And mind how you go.
I can tell you, because I know.
You may find it hard to get off.
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son.
And he died like a mole in a fox hole.
And everyone is still in the run.
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.
In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down.
All around me,
Golden sunflakes settle on the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.

In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever"

And the way you kiss will always be
A very special thing to me...

If I mention your name
Turn around on a chain
Then the sky opens for you
When we grew very tall
When I saw you so small
Then I wanted to stay with you
Inside me I feel alone and unreal
And the way you kiss will always be
A very special thing to me..."
Pink Floyd,Learning To Fly,/p/pink+floyd/learning+to+fly_20108699.html,"Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
Flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, my senses reel
Fatal attraction that's holding me fast
Now, can't escape this irresistible grasp
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted; just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty, and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition: grounded - determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted; just an earth-bound misfit, I
[Bridge:]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation - a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I"

Something will be done.
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time - time
Time to be - be - be aware
Carter's father saw him there
And knew the Rhull revealed to him
The glowing soul of Heremond the Wake.

Oh, my, something in my eye - eye
Something in the sky - sky
Waiting there for me
The outer hatch rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

Never ever will they

I was caught in the cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralyzed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night

To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
Because there'll be no safety in numbers
When the Right One walks out of the door

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While ivy grows over the door

So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can't win"

With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time.

Or you'll find that you're joining in
The turning away""
It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting it's shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
And mesmerised as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be
No more turning away?"

Dry as a funeral drum,

And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?

The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

Sheep

Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away

There may be dogs about

Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger' s not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors, into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The lord is my shepherd. I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives he releases my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, he hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication,
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we' ll make the bugger' S eyes water.

Bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home and do as you' re told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old.

And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me

For pretending the rest are not real

Babbling and snapping

Backwards and home bound
The pidgeon the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
Owning a home with no silver spoon
I'm drinking champaigne like a big tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I'll gather my far flung thoughts together
Speeding away on a wind to a new day
If your alone I'll come home
And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to things they say
Digging for gold in the hoe in my hand
Hoping they'll take a look at the way things stand
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone

Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate

A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough
His blood has frozen & curdled with fright
His knees have trembled & given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river rolls
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder that words,
Of promises broken"

All agreed with hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial knifes
But now
She stands upon southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings
To her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation knuckles
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again
And still the dark stain spreads between
His shoulder blades
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut"

A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,
Pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find

His eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested
Tropic, swan lee had a bow by his side

The land in silence stands

Swan lee kept time, half on land, half on water,
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.
He followed his ears to the great water fall,
Swan lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!

The land in silence stands....

Confronted swan lee as his song he sang,
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards
It was all written down by long silas lang.

So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break

She might take it back, she could take it back some day

Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It's easy to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried
All this temptation, it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide

And if I open my heart to you

Would you take the children away

You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream
A place to stay
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what's more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no-one kills the children anymore
And no-one kills the children anymore

Going round and round my brain

And even now part of me flies over
Dresden at angels one five.
Though they'll never fathom it behind my
Sarcasm desperate memories lie.

Sweetheart, sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.
'Cause that's the only time that I can really speak to you.
And there is something that I've locked away
A memory that is too painful
To withstand the light of day.

When we came back from the war the banners and
Flags hung on everyone's door.
We danced and we sang in the street and
The church bells rang.
But burning in my heart
The memory smolders on
Of the gunner's dying words on the intercom."

Whe I saw the lady smile.
I would take her out for a while,
For a while. Light tears wept like a child.
How her golden hair was blowing wild.
Then she spread her wings to fly,
For to fly. Soaring high above the breezes,
Going always where she pleases.
She will make it to the island in the sun.
I will follw in her shadow
As I watch her from my window.
One day I will catch her eye. She is calling from the deep,
Summoning my soul to endless sleep.
She is bound to drag me down,
Drag me down."

Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists

There must have been a door there in the wall

Incontrovertible, there's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging

In your home town
Waiting for someone or something
To show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today

And then the one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

(Solo)

And you run and you run
To catch up with the sun
But it's sinking

Racing around
To come up behind you again

The sun is the same
In a relative way
But you're older

Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time

Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines

Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way

The time is gone
The song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home
Home again
I like to be here
When I can

When I come home
Cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones
Beside the fire

Far away
Across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell..."

That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come
The wire that holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way
And suddenly it's day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Hmmmmmmmmm
Could be the human race is run
Like the moment when your brakes lock
And you slide toward the big truck
And stretch the frozen moments with your fear
And you'll never hear their voices
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore
And as the windshield melts
My tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend

The feelings of the few

Moved from side to side

Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

And I covered them up with the latest cut,
And my pants and socks all point in a box,
They don't make long of my nylon socks,
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole,
And all the lot is what I got,
It's what I wear, it's what you see,

Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows

Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers v And fire the ovens

Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear it's darkness with an empty smile

My nervous system all awry
I'm wearing the inside out

Look at him now
He's paler somehow
But he's coming round
He's starting to choke
It's been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name

For the day
When all the clouds
Have blown away

Can speak your name

When he asked that his men be withdrawn.
And the Generals gave thanks
As the other ranks held back
The enemy tanks for a while.
And the Anzio bridgehead
Was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives.

And kind old King George
Sent Mother a note
When he heard that father was gone.
It was, I recall,
In the form of a scroll,
With gold leaf and all.
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away.
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed
With his own rubber stamp.

It was dark all around.
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free.
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C.
They were all left behind,
Most of them dead,
The rest of them dying.
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me."

You gotta be trusted, you gotta tell lies,
Gotta be able to narrow your eyes.

You gotta believe they've gotta believe you,
Gotta appear to be easy to see through,
Gotta be sure you look good on tv,
Gotta resemble a human being.

You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder,
Gonna get harder as you get older,
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand,
Gotta forget that your gonna get cancer.

And when you lose control,
You'll reap the harvest you have sown,
And as the fear grows,
The bad blood slows and turns to stone.
And it's to late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around,
So have a good drown as you go down alone,
Dragged down by the stone.

You gotta be sure, you gotta be quick,
Gotta divide the tame from the sick,
Gotta keep all of us docile and fit,
You gotta keep everyone buying this shit.

They gotta get you started early,
Processed by the time you're thirty,
You work like fuck till your sixty-five,
Then your time's your own until you die.

Gotta admit to a lot of confusion,
Pain in the head is the child of collusion,
Gotta resist this creeping malaise,
Gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze.

But you, you just keep on pretending,
You can tell a sucker from a friend,
But you still raise the knife,
To stranger, lover, friend and foe alike.

Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was sent out to play on his own?
Who was raised on a diet of shame?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personnel?
Who was fitted with bridle and bit?
Who was given a seat in the stand?
Who was forcing his way to the rails?
Who was offered a place on the board?
Who was only a stranger at home?
Who was ground down in the end?
Who was found dead on the phone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?

Dragged down by the stone!"

With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time
Do you remember me? how we used to be?
Do you thing we should be closer?
She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand
He said, ""i was just a child then now i'm only a man""
Do you remember me? how we used to be?
Do you thing we should be closer?
By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay
And strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags
Do you remember me? how we used to be?

"Peter, Paul & Mary",'twas The Night Before Christmas,/p/peter+paul+mary/twas+the+night+before+christmas_20107603.html,"'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there

The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
Mom in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew with a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer

With a little old driver so lively and quick
Well I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name

""On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the rooftop the coursers they flew
With a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too.

And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing, the pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just op'ning his pack

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow

The stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when laughed (ho, ho, ho, ho) like a bowl full of jelly (ho, ho, ho, ho)

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk
And laying a finger to the side of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight

Goodnight."""

The shutters show some cracks
There's a heavy limb on the apple tree
That's got to be cut back
There's some water in the cellar
A little sagging in the floor
But this house has weathered many storms
It will weather many more

'Cause I scraped away the peeling paint
And found the wood was good and strong
And I found a firm foundation
Had been there all along
There's nothing here that a little work
And time can't heal
'Cause everything underneath is real

Nerves are frayed and ragged
Patience is wearing thin
Words were said in fits of rage
That never should have been
We bruised each other badly
Lost respect along the way
But there's too much here worth saving
To throw it all away

Can't we lay aside our fear and pride
And find the good within
All that we have shared before
Can be restored again
There's nothing here that a little work
And time can't heal

In the shadow of the great world war

Came into this world
On a rolling farm in Maryland
When Wilson was the President
And summer blew her good-bye through the trees

A child of changing times
Growing up between the wars
The Fords rolled off the line
And bars all closed their doors
And I imagine you back then
With snap brim hat and farmer's tan
Where horses drew their wagons through the fields

Chorus:
Now the fields are all four lanes
And the moon's not just a name
Are you more amazed at how things change
Or how they stay the same
And do you sit here on this porch and wonder
How the time flies by
Or does it seem to barely creep along
With 75 Septembers come and gone

Were the fields all gold and fawn
Was the spring house dark and cool
Did the rooster crow at dawn
When they got you up for school
And would you tell me once again
The tales of grandad's hired men
And how they drove the old road to town

The winds mix the dust of every land,
And so will woman and man.

We'll have different faces and different names

And take a tip from La Belle France: ""Viva la difference!""

"Peter, Paul & Mary",Bob Dylan's Dream,/p/peter+paul+mary/bob+dylans+dream_20107639.html,"While riding on a train goin' west,
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.

With half damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Laughin' and singin' 'til the early hours of the morn.

By the old wooden stove where our hats were hung,
Our words were told and our songs were sung;
Where we longed for nothin' and were satisfied
Talkin' and a jokin' about the world outside.

With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
We never thought we could get very old;
We thought we could sit forever in fun
Though our chances really were a million to one.

As easy as it was to tell black from white,
It wasn't all that easy to tell wrong from right;
Our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the road we traveled would ever shatter and split.

How many a year has passed and gone,
And many a gamble has been lost and won;
And many a road taken by many a first friend,
And each one of them I've never seen again.

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
That we could sit simply in that room once again;
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

While riding on a train goin' west,
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had."

"Peter, Paul & Mary",But A Moment,/p/peter+paul+mary/but+a+moment_20107768.html,"Memory moves us past each other
Time is a ribbon without end
Love is the lesson we keep learning
Death but a moment we must spend

Last week as I made our lunch
We talked of yesterdays
I remember more than you
That happens lots these days
But how we laughed, I almost cried
And the afternoon flew by
As we sat on the patio sipping our drinks
And the sunlight began to die

Memory moves us past each other
Time is a ribbon without an end
Love is the lesson we keep learning
Death but a moment we must spend

And we try to give each other comfort
We try to hold off that dark night
Each of us careful of the other
Keeping our own fear out of sight

Ah, you know I've always loved you
And I know you've loved me too
So it's hard to watch you crumble
And forget all that you knew

Yesterday while I was driving
Sunlight streaming through the trees
Suddenly my heartache parted
And suddenly I felt at ease
You will love me all your life
And I will love you all of mine
That's the gift we give each other
That's the gift divine

Memory moves us past each other
Though time is a ribbon without an end
Love's still the lesson we keep learning
And death but a moment we must spend"

I wanna take us away from all this to a distant shore.

I'd leave the car by the curb with the motor on
The tape deck playin' our favorite love song
And you'd say ""What in the world?""
And smile just like a little girl
And I'd say ""I can't tell you now but it won't be long.""

Chorus:
I know it sounds funny, but it's true...
I get so busy I forget I'm in love with you
And every now and then we need to get away to get close again.

Up in the air in a window seat
Your head on my shoulder and a blanket around our feet
We could leave the kids at home
And if you get worried we could telephone
We need a weekend of fun for under two hundred dollars complete.

(Chorus)

There we would be in a sunny land
We'd lie on the beach and you could wiggle your toes in the sand
A tropical drink late at night
And a midnight dip if the temperature's right
The best things turn out better if they never were planned.

When all the doors were shuttered tight,
Outside standing, a lonely boy-child,
Cold and shivering in the night.

On the street every window
Save but one was gleaming bright;
And to this window walked the boy-child
Peeking in saw candlelight.

Through other windows he had looked at turkeys,
Ducks, and geese, and cherry pies;
But through this window saw a gray-haired lady
Table bare and tears in her eyes.

Into his coat reached the boy-child
Knowing well there was little there
He took from his pocket his own Christmas dinner
A bit of cheese and some bread to share.

His outstretched hands held the food and they trembled
As the door it opened wide
Said he ""Would you share with me Christmas dinner?""
Said she gently, ""Come inside.""

The gray-haired lady brought forth to the table
Glasses two, last drops of wine.
Said she ""Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas,
And especially yours and mine! ""

And it came to pass on that Christmas evening
Whene all the doors were shuttered tight
That in that town the happiest Christmas
Was shared by candlelight."

Second is his heart won't make it through

Won't be long after he's dead

As an old Jamaican woman swept
And not by chance their eyes met

""God's gifts are only good y'know
And there ain't no Love the Lord can't grow

His sister's 5, his brother's 3
He goes to school and he knows how to read
He takes the bus home by himself
Puts his lunch pail back upon the shelf
And he hugs his Momma till she melts
To the floor

They're more than a home, they're a family
'Cause blood and bones are still souls y'see
And someone's baby's just another Danny
And in the guest room in the back
Lives this old Jamaican black
'Cause when you give a gift
God gives it back again.

In blinding light of day
We're given breath and it takes our breath away

How cruel to unformed fancy,
The way in which we come
Overwhelmed by feelings
And sudden loss of love
And what price dark confining
The heart is to forgive
When all at once we're called upon to live

Then by giant hands we're taken
From the shelter of the womb
That dreaded first horizon
The endless empty room
Where communion is lost forever
When a heart first beats alone
Still it remembers no matter how it's grown

We grow, but grow apart
We live, but more alone
The more to be, the more to see
To cry aloud that we are free
To hide the ancient fear of being alone

And now we live in darkness
Embracing spiteful holds
Refusing any answers
For no man can be told
That delivery is delayed
Until at last we're made aware
And first reach for love
To find t'was always there
Always there."

We died in your valleys and we died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes
Both sides of the river, we died just the same

I ask the Lord to help me please find the way.

When the new day's a dawning, I bow my head in prayer.
I pray to the Lord, ""Won't you lead me there?""
Won't you guide me safely to the Golden Stair?
Won't you let this body your burden share?
I pray to the Lord, ""Won't you lead me please, lead me there?""

When the judgment comes to find the world in shame
When the trumpet blows won't you call my name?
When the thunder rolls and the heavens rain
When the sun turns black, never shine again
When the trumpet blows, won't you call me please, call my name!"
"Peter, Paul & Mary",Early Morning Rain,/p/peter+paul+mary/early+morning+rain_20808714.html,"In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand

I’m a long way from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early morning rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
But I’m out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows

Well, the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She’s rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engine roar
See the silver wing on high
She’s away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she’ll fly

Where the morning rain don’t fall
And the sun always shines
She’ll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

This old airport's got me down
It’s no earthly good to me
'Cause I’m stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be

You can’t jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I’d best be on my way
In the early morning rain

So I’d best be on my way
In the early morning rain"
"Peter, Paul & Mary",El Salvador,/p/peter+paul+mary/el+salvador_20107719.html,"There's a sunny little country south of Mexico
Where the winds are gentle and the waters flow
But breezes aren't the only things that blow
In El Salvador

If you took the little lady for a moonlight drive
Odds are still good you'd come back alive
But everyone is innocent until they arrive
In El Salvador

If the rebels take a bus on the grand highway
The government destroys a village miles away
The man on the radio says 'now we'll play South of the Border'
And in the morning the natives say,
We're happy you have lived another day
Last night a thousand more passed away
In El Salvador

There's a television crew here from abc
Filming Rio Lempe and the refugees
Calling murdered children the 'tragedy'
Of El Salvador

Before the government cameras 20 feet away
Another man is asking for continued aid
Food and medicine and hand grenades
For El Salvador

There's a thump, a rumble, and the buildings sway
A soldier fires the acid spray
The public address system starts to play South of the Border
You run for cover and hide your eyes
You hear the screams from paradise
They've fallen further than you realize
In El Salvador

Just like Poland is 'protected' by her Russian friends
The junta is 'assisted' by Americans
And if 60 million dollars seems too much to spend
In El Salvador

They say for half a billion they could do it right
Bomb all day, burn all night
Until there's not a living thing upright
In El Salvador

They'll continue training troops in the usa
And watch the nuns that got away
And teach the military bands to play South of the Border
And kill the people to set them free
Who put this price on their liberty?
Don't you think it's time to leave
El Salvador?"

Every petal opens when the day has just begun
Even in the city where they grow up through the street
Every blossom needs the sunshine to makes it's life complete.
Some are torn out by the roots and cast aside
And some might be arranged for a bride
A flower's just a seed when it's young
And every flower's reaching for the sun.

Some are bent by fears they cannot see
And some are touched by love and set free

And every flower's reaching, every flower's reaching

And they swear an oath of vengeance to the martyrs they have lost
But they pray for peace on Sundays with a rosary in each hand

We have cousins on the old sod and we don't forget our kin
From Boston we send more guns and we tell them they can win
Then we turn back to our green beer and to MacNamara's Band
It's true friends with false perceptions that have cursed poor Ireland
True friends with false perceptions that have cursed poor Ireland

They weave tales of wit and magic and their songs are strong and free
But they fail to hear each other, prisoners of history
Orange flags wave for the British to greet the army's clicking heel
And Irish curse their Irish brother for the altar where they kneel
And now provoked to greater anger by the distant royal hand
It's old hatreds and young victims that have cursed poor Ireland
Old hatreds and young victims that have cursed poor Ireland

So we're left with retribution it's the cycle of the damned
And the hope becomes more distant as the flames of hate are fanned
Who will listen to the children for they're taught to take their stand
They say love and true forgiveness can still heal fair Ireland
They say love and true forgiveness can still heal fair Ireland

Only love and real forgiveness can still heal fair Ireland"

Lay through fields of innocence near bubbling springs of joy

I'd pray the Lord my soul to keep
The road was never very steep
On the way to my Father's house.

The way to my Father's house when I turned seventeen
Wandered through inviting hills beside a tumbling stream
Sometimes in prayer upon my knees,
I would feel a distant breeze
The road was winding now through trees
On the way to my Father's house.

The way to my Father's House at the age of twenty-nine
Led over a mountain that I would seldom climb
Except in times of great despair when I'd be looking everywhere
And then one morning He was there,
On the way to my Father's house
And glory, what a refreshing story
I was so blind before he opened my eyes restoring me to

The way to my Father's  house at the age of thirty-one
Was a ride on a rainbow my new life had begun
And every evening I could look through the pages of his book
And recognize the paths I took on the way, on the way...

I go to my Father's house in these troubled days
The Spirit is moving in mysterious ways
Reminded when old doubts appear
That perfect Love casts out all fear
In thanks I tend the garden here, on the way,
On the way
On the way to my Father's house"

I met a fair young maiden there, her beauty filled my mind.
Her rosy cheek, her ruby lips, they gave my heart no rest.
The name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west.

I courted lovely Flora, she promised ne'er to go.
But soon a tale was told to me that filled my heart with woe.
They said she meets another man who holds my love in jest.
And yet I trusted Flora, the lily of the west.

'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of low degree,
He spoke unto my Flora there and kissed her 'neath a tree.
The answers that she gave to him like arrows pierced my breast.
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west.

I stepped up to my rival, my dagger in my hand.
I seized him by the collar and I ordered him to stand.
All in my desperation I stabbed him in his breast.
I'd killed a man for Flora, the lily of the west.

And then I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea.
They placed me in a pris'ner's dock and then commenced on me.
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the lily of the west."

"Peter, Paul & Mary",For The Love Of It All,/p/peter+paul+mary/for+the+love+of+it+all_20107770.html,"In the beginning, as life became form,
The oceans heaved, the mountains were cleaved,
The firmament stormed.
At the center of being, immensely small
Was the master of now, don't ask me how
The Love of it all

And the seasons were many.
Creation was new.
And there on a tree (deceptively free)
A forbidden fruit
Upon leaving the garden, after the fall,
One thing was clear; we chose not to hear
The Love of it all

But for the Love of it all
I would go anywhere.
To the ends of the earth,
What is it worth if Love would be there?
Walking the thin line between fear and the call
One learns to bend and finally depend
On the Love of it all

""Irresistible targets""
I heard someone say.
They were speaking of angels
Who are so courageous day after day
Gunned down on a highway (as we often recall)
I hear a scream; I have a dream
The Love of it all

Still the world is in labor,
She groans in travail.
She cries with the eagle, the dolphin,
She sighs in the song of the whale.
While the heart of her people
Prays at the wall.
A spirit inside is preparing a bride
For the Love of it all

For the Love of it all,
Like the stars and the sun,
We are hearts on the rise,
Separate eyes with the vision of one.
No valley too deep, no mountain too tall,
We can turn back the night with merely the light
From the Love of it all.

And so we are marching to 'to give peace a chance'
Brother and sister as one in this mystery dance.
Long ago on a hilltop where now the curious crawl
A man on a cross paid the ultimate cost
For the Love of it all

For the Love of it all
We are gathered by grace
We have followed our hearts
To take up our parts
In this time and place.
Hands for the harvest,
Hear the centuries call:
It is still not too late to come celebrate
The Love of it all

The Love of it all"

And he scorned his poor entreatings when loudly he did sue

What will happen in the dry?

If we don't stop there'll come a time when women
With barren wombs will bitterly rejoice
With breasts that dry and never fill with promise
Gladly they'll not suckle one more life

The impotence of people raised on fear,
A fear that blinds the sense of common oneness
Common love and life or death are here

Will no one be my guide, not let me fall

Inside your heart where love is

With their tools and ladders
And their room addition
My kid yells over, ""Are ya having a baby?""
They wink and smile, they say, ""Someday maybe.""
But through their doors go kids and mommies
Funny how you don't see the daddies go in
My little girl wonders
'Bout this house with no men,
I take hold of her hand
And I begin

He's alone now, he tries smiling
He roams around his well stocked kitchen
He knows that fate will soon be coming

Martin sits and waits with his windows open
His house is empty, his heart is broken
We bring him toys and watercolors
He loves to hear my little baby's stories
She's the gift I share
She's his companion
She's the string on the kite
She guides him into the wind
My little girl wonders who will care for him

That came in through the pretty window picture.

I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""

Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""

I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

And while my dad was sleeping
We would walk down to Your house without speaking."

Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run

Tramplin' down the prairie rose, leaving hooftracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hand
I heard from passing renegades, Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are comin'
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running

Go lightly from the ledge babe, go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want babe; I'd only let you down.
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someome to close his eyes for you,
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

[Chorus:]

Go melt back in the night babe,
'cause everything inside is made of stone
There's nothin' in here moving, and anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly and to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more.

But it ain't me babe, no, no, no
It ain't me babe, no, no, no
It ain't me babe, it ain't me you're looking for.

It ain't me babe, no, no, no
It ain't me babe, it ain't me you're looking for... Babe"

He put her all back together and I was in awe
As rabbits and doves and bandannas appeared
And he pulled a quarter right out of my ear
And I turned to my dad, I said, ""How’d he do it?""
And dad, he just smiled, he said, ""There’s nothing to it""

It’s magic and you don’t want to know
Just how it’s done, it would ruin the show
You’ve just got to believe
‘Cause believing is what makes it happen
Oh it’s nothing but magic, magic

Now I fell in love the first time in eight grade
And I started shaving the very next day
Just walking her home made me light on my feet
And I promised her things you just wouldn’t believe
And when I asked my dad why girls had that effect
He said, ""Go ask your mom, I ain’t figured it yet""

It’s magic and you don’t want to know
Just how it’s done, it would ruin the show
You’ve just got to believe
‘Cause believing is what makes it happen

Well, the years have been hard, the years have been kind
These last years have taken both parents of mine
Some things you can’t change with a wave of your hand
There are so many things I still don’t understand
But in a hospital gown standing next to my wife
I’m watching this miracle come into life

And it’s magic and you don’t want to know
Just how it’s done, it would ruin the show
You’ve just got to believe
‘Cause believing is what makes it happen

Oh it’s nothing but magic and you don’t want to know

On a volé leurs femmes Et tout le cher passé

Au nez des années mortes J'irai par les chemins

Je mendierai ma vie Sur la terre et sur l'onde
Du vieux au nouveau monde Et je dirai aux gens
Profitez de la vie Eloignez la misère

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky.

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.

One day she left without a word. She took away the sun.
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done.
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true.

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.

Fetched him a bowl full of meat
A drink and a pan of cold biscuits,

He bowed his head in the moonlight,
He said a beautiful grace.

Offered to set him free

Still hear him draggin' his chain.

Sacrifice of old is ending.

[Chorus:]

Moments of the soft persuasion
Chiming bells, the first occasion
Tell the rest a smile awaken
Till the last reminder shaken
From whatever rude and sorrow;
Now, the time is now-tomorrow."

Dans mes rêves j'entends une voix
Qui me dit ""ne pleure pas""
Quel dommage mes yeux sont des source claires
Dans mes rêves j'entends une voix
Qui me dit ""ne souffre pas!""
Quel dommage mon âme n'est pas de pierre
Mais les voix de mes fantômes ne connaissent pas la douleur de l'homme
Pourtant les cloches m'annoncent toujours mon vrai destin

La la la......
La la la......

Dans notre maison fragile et grise
Nous partageons le rêve d'la vie
Et la lune souriait sur l'innocence
Dans un monde plein de neant
Même les promesses sont du vent
Et le soleil parfois se perd dans les nuages
Ne me quitte pas encore
Ne me laisse pas partir
Pourtant les cloches m'annoncent toujours mon vrai destin

To hear the birds whistle the nightingales sing
I met a fair maiden who sweetly did sing
I'm going to be married next Monday morning.

How old are you my fair young maid,
Here in this valley this valley so green
How old are you my fair young maid,
I'm goin' to be sixteen next Monday mornin'.

Well sixteen years old, that's too young for to marry
So take my advice, five years longer to tarry
For marriage brings troubles and sorrows begin
So put off your wedding for Monday mornin'.

You talk like a mad man, a man with no skill
Two years I've been waiting against my own will
Now I'm determined to have my own way
And I'm going to be married next Monday mornin'

And next Monday mornin' the bells they will ring
And my true love will buy me a gay gold ring
Also he'll buy me a new pretty gown
To wear at my wedding next Monday mornin'

Next Monday night when I go to my bed
And I turn round to the man that I've wed
Around his middle my two arms I will fling,
And I wish to my soul it was Monday mornin'."

That I have ever found I've ever found.

You're not a Farrah, or a Jaclyn, or a Raquel pussy cat
Twenty generations of girls have tried to look like that
But class like yours ain't on the screen
And it's finally made me think
You can lead this horse to Hollywood
But you cannot make me drink (can't make him drink).

I love you honey, you're the one for me
And it comes naturally ...
I don't want an image, I don't' want a movie star
I just want you baby the way you are.

You don't fill out the old bikini like a playboy bunny doll
In fact in that department you've got little there at all.
But in modern times we've gone beyond
The Tarzans and the Janes
While some just use their bodies
Others use their brains, darling, remember brains?

(Chorus)

Bogart called them ""baby"", Sinatra called them ""dames""

Music speaks louder than words
It's the only thing that the whole world listens to.
Music speaks louder than words,
When you sing, people understand.

Sometimes the love that you feel inside
Gets lost between your heart and your mind
And the words don't really say the things you wanted them to.
But then you feel in someone's song
What you'd been trying to say all along
And somehow with the magic of music the message comes through.

[Chorus:]

The longer I live the more I find that people seldom take the time
To really get to know a stranger and make him a friend.
But the power of a simple song can make everybody feel they belong.
Maybe singin' and playin' can bring us together again.
Singin' and playin' can bring us together again.

Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside?
I'll rest for awhile in the warm summer sun
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done

And I see by your gravestone you were only 19
When you joined the glorious fallen in 1916
And I hope you died quick and I hope you died clean
Or William Mcbride was it slow and obscene?

Chorus:
Did they beat the drum slowly, did they sound the pipes lowly?
Did the rifles fire o'er you as they lowered you down?
Did the bugle play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the ""Flowers o' the Forest""?

Well the sun it shines now on these green fields of France
The warm wind blows gently and the red poppies dance
The trenches have vanished now under the plow
No gas and no barbed wire, no guns fire now

For here in this graveyard it's still no man's land
And the countless white crosses in mute witness stand
To man's blind indifference to his fellow man
And a whole generation who butchered and damned

[Chorus:]

Well I can't help but wonder now, Willie Mcbride
Do all those who lie here know just why they died?
Did you really believe them when they told you the cause?
Did you really believe this war would end all wars?

But the suffering the sorrow the glory the shame
The killing, the dying, it was all done in vain
For William Mcbride it's all happened again
And again and again and again and again.

But fortune is a blind god, flying through the clouds,
And forgettin' me on this side of Jordan.

Silver spoons to some mouths, golden spoons to others,
Dare a man to change the given order.
Though they smile and tell us all of us are brothers,
Never was it true this side of Jordan.

Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves,
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe.

Like some ragged owlet with it's wings expanded,
Nailed to some garden gate or boardin'.

Never hurted none this side of Jordan.

I dig rock and roll music

That rhythm & blues begat the rock and roll style?

Woody guthrie spread the news
He told it straight, let us relate
This talking union blues:

Well if you want higher wages, let me tell you what to do
You've got to talk to the workers in the shop with you
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long
You get shorter hours, better working conditions
Vacations with pay, take the kids to the seashore

Well I remember I was seventeen
I was a birmingham high school rock and roll king
The paper talked about how I'd strut my stuff
I'd like to read it, but my arms aren't long enough

'Bout a kingdom on a mountain, and the valley folk below
On the mountain was a treasure buried deep beneath a stone
And the valley people swore they'd have it for their very own.

Go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven, you can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing, come the judgment day
On the bloody morning after - one tin soldier rides away.

Verse ii
So the people of the valley sent a message up the hill
Asking for the buried treasure, tons of gold for which they'd kill
Came an answer from the kingdom: ""With our brothers we will share
All the secrets of our mountain, all the riches buried there.""

Chorus

Verse iii
Now the valley cried with anger, mount your horses, draw your sword!
And they killed the mountain people, sure they'd won their just reward
Now they stood beside the treasure on the mountain dark and red
Turned the stone and looked beneath it -
""Peace on Earth"" was all it said.

And I don't like to swim, really
You know what swimming is to me?
Staying alive when I'm in the water.
Barely
I'll do anything to stay afloat
Even swallow Co2 cartriges

But I didn't come out here to talk about sports
I really, I came out here, Peter talks about status
And I cannot think of one material object that has more status in this country
Than the automobile
And it starts at a very early age now, right?
I mean, now at 14, kids want the car, right?
They get cheaters permits so they can drive
You get a learners permit at 15, a cheaters permit at 14
And it's, I guess it's really necessary because
You lose a lot of face calling up a girl and asking her
If you can peddle right over and pick her up, right?

They don't really go for that any more
And if you look back on all the times you had the automobile
Aside from a few interesting saturday evenings
You got to admit that one of the nicest times of all
Was a sunday afternoon, if you could get the car
You come down the stairs, ker-clunk ker-clunk ker-clunk ker-clunk
Mom, dad, gonna take the car, ha haaa
Beautiful day for a drive, I think I'll go out
Ha haaa haaa ha huuu

And then, and then they level you with that giant killer, right?
Have you done your homework?

If you were fast, you'd say, mom, dad, have I done my homework?
Run out the door
You pick up 3 other great pretenders, 3 oclock in the afternoon
The time is now 10 oclock in the evening
The same 4 guys are in the same car
Well, whata you wanna do?
I don't know, whada you wanna do?
Hey, we've been driving for 7 hours
Hey, I got an idea, he he
Yeah, what's that?
Lets go to a drive-in resturant and look at the girls, hehehe
Oh, ok
Well, here they are, but they're all from our high school
Wait a minute, there's a car load over there
There's a place right next to them, lets go get it

Don't look at 'em
Here's the conversation in the girls car you never heard

Here they come
There they are
Don't look at 'em

Remember the time when drive-ins first opened
And the girls used to come out to take your order?
Now you're lucky you know, if you get a girl in slacks who delivers it
I understand they're even putting in conveyor belts in some drive-in resturants
There was a time when the little girls came running out in short little skirts
Remember them?
You pull in
And the little girl would come running up
May I take your order sir?
Yes, but I don't believe it's on the menu, ha ha
They don't, they don't let you flirt any more now
They give you a little green box with a white button on it
A little speaker grill, right

What?

Oh, ok, um, We'd like one cheeseburger deluxe special extra
The one you have out here with the little white cup
With that whatever that's in there, we'll take it, whatever it is
And uh, we'd like two hamburgers medium rare with everything on 'em
And one hamburger, no, one hamburger, meat, no hamburgers
One frank, and three chiliburgers, ok?
Alright, and we'd like two chocolate shakes, regular thick, for spoons you know thick
And we'd like two strawberry shakes thin
Water them down, or milk them down a little, ok
'Cause we got somebody here with chapped lips and they'd like it thin
Can, you understand what I mean?
Are you there?

Well, could you tell us what we have please?

And four six-packs
We'll take it
And after you get your food order in, you got at least 40 minutes to wait
Even if it's just a cup of coffee you got 40 minutes to wait
And you cannot get out of your car, right
Remember there was a time when drive-ins first opened
You used to pull in and get out, exchange hellos, greetings
Evidentally some people were getting out and exchanging
Something a little heavier than hellos and greetings
They have policemen there to keep you in your car
You can be 47 years old and drop your credit cards on the ground
Officer, that's my wallet
I don't care who you are kid back in the car
If you do get out, you gotta be very careful
Because the new resturants have radar now
So you have to crawl on your belly between the cars
You get over to the side of the car
Psssst
Psssst  down here!
I can't come up, they'll spot me
Put down your window

Power windows, huh?
Whoo, this is a pretty fancy car
Hey, you're a pretty fancy broad

If you did manage to get out of the drive-in resturant without being maimed
There was a sporting event taking place at the traffic light
Remember, with all of two characters
Mr. Businessman who drove a 4-door family sedan with black-wall tires
Automatic transmission
Seated next to him in a 1941 gray primer coated Ford
With it's rear end 2 inches off the ground
Tomato cans for mufflers
With his back to the drivers window, his left arm draped over the steering wheel
His right hand  gripped onto the gearshift lever
A sneer on lips sat the kid

Well, Mr. Businessman has just had his bands tightened, and
Those of you who are not quite sure what I mean
By having your bands tightened
The bands are the rings in an automatic transmission
Which actually affect the gear change
Uh huh, I'll give you an example
This is an automobile with tight bands

This is an automobile with loose bands

Well, Mr. Businessman has just had his bands tightened
And he thinks that he will show the kid a thing or two
Meanwhile, the kid
Has inched these 2 fingers up over his left arm
This is the universal signlanguage among teenagers for dragging
You probably recall Winston Churchill during the war years
Which everyone assumed meant V for victory
Actually if you'll also recall Winston Churchill smokes a cigar, right?
He used to hold it in here, right?
And occationally he would turn to his friends on the stage and say
Want a drag?
See, and the kids picked it up
The light changes
The light changes to amber and Mr. Businessman decides to get very daring
He pulls the automatic transmission down into low
He puts one foot on the brake
Still holding the foot on the brake, in order to get that extra fast start
He pulls the automatic transmission down into low
And pushes down on the accelerator five inches
The car is internally hemorraging
He knows, he knows, he knows he's gonna have to have another band job
He's not gonna let the kid show him up
The light changes to green, Mr. Businessman is off

Looks at the speedometer, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98 miles an hour
Looks out the window and The Kids not even there
You know what's there?

He looks in the rear view mirror and The Kids still back at the corner
He never races anybody
He just sits there and scares the hell out of them"
"Peter, Paul & Mary",Polly Von,/p/peter+paul+mary/polly+von_20107689.html,"I shall tell of a hunter whose life was undone
By the cruel hand of evil at the setting of the sun
His arrow was loosed and it flew through the dark,
And his true love was slain as the shaft found it's mark.

Chorus:
She'd her apron wrapped about her and he took her for a swan
But it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von

He ran up beside her and found it was she
He turned away his head for he could not bear to see
He lifted her up and found she was dead,
A fountain of tears for his true love, he shed.

[Chorus:]

He bore her away to his home by the sea
Cryin' ""Father, oh father, I murdered poor Polly!
I've killed my fair love in the flower of her life!
I always intended that she be my wife. ""

""But she'd her apron wrapped about her
And I took her for a swan,
And it's oh and alas it was she, Polly Von. ""

He wept bitter tears, but his cries were all in vain.
As he looked on the lake, a swan glided by
And the sun slowly sank in the grey of the sky.

Everybody needs some power I'm told
To shield them from the darkness and the cold

I know that lives are at stake
Yours and mine and our descendants in time.
There's so much to gain, so much to lose
Everyone of us has to choose.

We are only now beginning to see
How delicate the balance of nature can be
The limits of her ways have been defined
And we've crossed that line.

Some don't even care or know that we'll pay
But we have seen the face of death in our day.
There's so little time to change our ways
If only we together can say

To seek the wisdom of the children
And the graceful way of flowers in the wind

For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
Their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day
Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
They're a promise of the future and a blessing for today.

Tho the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us
The sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
It is written from the desert to the mountains they shall lead us
By the hand and by the heart they will comfort you and me
In their innocence and trusting they will teach us to be free

For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
Their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day
And the song that I am singing is a prayer to non-believers
Come and stand beside us, we can find a better way"

I'd dream of the day they'd hit one my way
They never did, but still I would pray
That I'd make a fantastic catch on the run
And not lose the ball in the sun
And then I'd awake from this long reverie
And pray that the ball never came out to me
Here in...

Off in the distance, the game's dragging on,
There's strikes on the batter, some runners are on.
I don't know the inning, I've forgotten the score.
The whole team is yelling and I don't know what for.
Then suddenly everyone's looking at me
My mind has been wandering; what could it be?
They point at the sky and I look up above
And a baseball falls into my glove!

Here in right field, it's important you know.
You gotta know how to catch, you gotta know how to throw,
That's why I'm here in right field, just watching the dandelions grow!"

In the silence I listened to voices inside me
And they told me again and again.

And it flows through you, and it flows through me.
There is only one people. We are one and the same.

Lets time decide what it should mean;

And sometimes when the room is still,
Time with so much truth to kill,
Leaves you by the window sill so tied
Without a wing, to take you high,
Without a clue to tell you why.

Now, I just want to keep my name, not bother anybody's game
Without ideas of gold or fame or insane heights.
I don't want a lot of money, I don't want a Playboy Bunny,
Just a love to call me honey late at night,
In my arms, by my side, in my arms late at night.

Ev'rybody wants a hand to hold.
They're so afraid of being old,
So scared of dying, so unknown
And so alone, rollin' home.

Well, I see the ones who crawl like moles
Who for a front would trade their souls,
A broken mirror's the only hole for them;
And for you who'd exchange yourselves,
Just to be somebody else,
Pretending things you never felt or meant;
Hey, you don't live what you defend,
You can't give so you just bend.

Now if you care what people think,
Like they supplied some missing link;
They'll just stand back and watch you sink so slow.
They'll never help you to decide,
They'll only take you for a ride,
After which they'll try and hide the fact that they don't know
What you should do, where you should go,
What you should do, where you should go.

(Chorus)

There's nothing big I want to prove,
No mountains that I need to move,
Or even claim what's right or true for you.
My sights, my songs are slightly charred,
You might think they miss their mark,
But things are only what they are and nothing new
But for me, I think they'll do,
But for me, I think they'll do.

Well, I can see a king and queen, a beggar falling at my feet;
They all must see the same sad dreams at night;
Futility and senseless war, pit the rich against the poor,
While cause is buried long before the fight
For what was wrong, for what was right,
It's just the strong, who ever says what's right.

And a-way up yonder, ahead of them all,
Came a-prancin' and a-dancin' my noble Stewball.

I bet on the grey mare, I bet on the bay
If I'd have bet on ol' Stewball, I'd be a free man today.

Oh the hoot owl, she hollers, and the turtle dove moans.
I'm a poor boy in trouble, I'm a long way from home.

Oh Stewball was a racehorse, and I wish he were mine.
He never drank water, he always drank wine."
"Peter, Paul & Mary",Such Is Love,/p/peter+paul+mary/such+is+love_20107807.html,"After all I've come to know me, and the ways of my heart,
And the young man that I once was would have torn our love apart.
When you're young and always looking at the far side of the hill
You might miss the fairest flower standing by you very still.

(Chorus)
Love, love, love, love, love, such is love,wonderous love
Love, love, love, love, love, such is love,wonderous love

Love is never, like the stillness, love is always passing by
Love must flow like a river; try to hold love back and love will die
If I'd known as a young man what I know of love today
I'd have lain down in that river and let it wash my soul away.

(Chorus) 2x

Now I know love."
"Peter, Paul & Mary",Summer Highland Falls,/p/peter+paul+mary/summer+highland+falls_20107786.html,"They say that these are not the best of times
But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us,
It's either sadness or euphoria... Sadness or euphoria.

So we'll argue and we'll compromise and realize
That nothing's really changed.
For all our mutual experience our separate conclusions
Are the same.
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason co-exists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoria... Sadness or euphoria.

How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies
And so we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our expected similarities... It's either sadness or euphoria.

"Peter, Paul & Mary",Sweet Survivor,/p/peter+paul+mary/sweet+survivor_20107787.html,"You have asked me why the days fly by so quickly
And why each one feels no different from the last
And you say that you are fearful for the future
And you have grown suspicious of the past
And you wonder if the dreams we shared together
Have abandoned us or we abandoned them
And you cast about and try to find new meaning
So that you can feel that closeness once again.

Carry on my sweet survivor, carry on my lonely friend
Don't give up on the dream, and don't you let it end.
Carry on my sweet survivor,
Though you know that something's gone
For everything that matters carry on.

You remember when you felt each person mattered
When we all had to care or all was lost
But now you see believers turn to cynics
And you wonder was the struggle worth the cost
Then you see someone too young to know the difference
And a veil of isolation in their eyes
And inside you know you've got to leave them something
Or the hope for something better slowly dies.

Carry on my sweet survivor, carry on my lonely friend
Don't give up on the dream, and don't you let it end.
Carry on my sweet survivor, you've carried it so long
So it may come again, carry on
Carry on, carry on."
"Peter, Paul & Mary",Take The Chance,/p/peter+paul+mary/take+the+chance_20107776.html,"There's a little girl playing in the garden
She thinks that she's alone and no one sees
But the beauty of it all
As the daisy petals fall
Is the wish she's made that's whispered in the breeze
There's the wish in the breeze

Won't you take the chance?
And let your tears start falling
Ignore the fearful warnings of your mind
Let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
Believe that you deserve for the sun to shine

There's an old woman sitting in the doorway
She greets the people each one as they pass
Sometimes they hover 'round her for her wisdom
Sometimes so she'll remind them how to laugh
They know that she'll remind them how to laugh

Won't you take the chance?
And let your tears start falling
And ignore the fearful warning of your mind
Let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
Believe that you deserve for the sun to shine

Now on a hill there stands a cross above a graveyard
And the simple word carved in it says ""forgive""
No war or killing anger can match the force it carries
It can heal the generations so that other ones can live
It can heal us, so we can live

Now there's a moment between forward and retreating
When you're just not sure which path you ought to choose
Then the sun shines brightly on the golden meadow
And suddenly, you're not at all confused
Suddenly, you're not confused

That's when you take the chance
And let your tears start falling
And ignore the fearful warnings of your mind
And you let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
You always did deserve for the sun to shine
I love you, and I want the sun to shine
I love you, and I want the sun to shine"

Bought a candy bar the other day,
Only ate half, s'gonna throw the rest away
When I saw this kid playin' in the street,
I said ""Hey kid, you want somethin' to eat?""
He said ""Whut?""
I said ""Candy, son."" He said ""HELP!""
Then he started to run,
And I stood there,
Watchin' him go,
Half a bar of chocolate
Runnin' down my fingers.

Well the kid comes back in a minute or two
But his mom's with him and the neighbors too,
And they got the kid scared it's plain to see,
They say ""Which one done it?"" he points at me.
He says ""Him"". I say ""What do you mean?""
He says ""YOU!"" then he starts to scream,
And I'm standin', everybody's lookin',
Everybody's starin' -at me- ... (nervous laugh)

""Howdy doody... Y'all waitin' for the bus?
Ah... A little late isn't it... Anybody got a watch? ...
We could uh see how late it is...
I got a better idea, let's find somebody with a watch
And stare at him! ""

Well some start pickin' up baseball bats
And the others are pullin' the pins from their hats -
""I think this thing's gone a little too far,
Hell, I only offered him a candy bar! "" I said ""wait! ""
I said ""What are you doin'?""
They said ""PRE-VERT the kid's life is ruined!""
""Oh... Oh well then you better check what he's chewin'
Cause I got the feelin'
He's in the middle of a bubble gum orgy! ""

Well they're comin' at me and I'm backin' away
And then I hear this policeman say
""Are you positive he's the right man?""
(I quick flicked the candy bar out of my hand).
He says ""Show me.""
I says ""Show ya what?""
He says ""The CANDY BAR you degen-a-rut"" and he grabs me.
He grabs both my hands.
Pretty easy to see...
Which hand's got the chocolate!

Well I've had some troubled times before,
But none like the trip from the candy store...
Sympathize with the kid all right,
Somebody's nice to ya, probably ain't right.
I'll grow up, I'll learn the way.
I'll learn so that my later days'll be prosperous.

And I'd hate to add another wound to the times we had good loving.

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow  all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.

Some say I have dishonored you through foolishness and folly
The question not in where that lies but if you're standing by me.
I do not need to hear the words to know your truthful answer
Your eyes that once were home to me now tell me I'm a stranger.

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow  all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.

I'm bound to be a wanderer, I'll never take another
I'll catch a merchant ship tonight and sail to foreign waters
I'll judge no man for what he's done and no man will I bother
And I hope to find some peace again and cleanse my soul of anger

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow  all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling."

Cut up the goose with a carving knife

Careful up the stairs, a few are missing

First step is the hardest one to master
Last one I'm not really sure is there.

And I come back to hear it now and again
I can't say that I'm certain what you're after
But in this room, a part of you will remain.

Second floor, the lady sleeps in waiting
Past the lantern, tiptoe in it's glance
In the room the soft brown arms of shadow
This room the hardest one to pass.

How much will you pay to live in the attic?
The shavings off your mind are the only rent
I left some would there if you thought you couldn't
Or if the shouldn't that you've bought has been spent.

Six months since we made landfall
Riding low with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all

I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking
I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise, if you know me well

And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
Across the boulevard, you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls

Sometimes gets me in trouble too

The diamond star shines down upon, a pathway to the soul

With many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it,
It became my heart's delight.

I had a big surprise
Cause right on the bottom were two big buttons
That looked like big green eyes
I first pushed one and then the other,
Then I twisted it's lid
And when I set it down again, here is what it did:

(Refrain)

It first marched left, and then marched right
And then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn't even there
I started to cry, but my daddy laughed
'Cause he knew that I would find,
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Would be chugging from behind.

(Refrain)

The years have gone by too quickly it seems,
I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy:
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head
And he gave a squeal of glee!
Neither one of us knows just what it is
But he loves it just like me!

It still goes... (refrain)"

But that's another side to this life, I've been leadin',
But that's another side to this life.

I think I'll go to Nashville, down to Tennessee,
The ten cent life I've been leading here,
Is gonna be the death of me.

(Refrain)

I don't know what I'm doing half the time,
I don't know where I'll go,
I think I'll get me a sailin' boat
And sail the Gulf of Mexico.

(Refrain)

My whole world's in an uproar, my whole world's upside down,
Don't know what I'm doin' here, but I'm always hangin' round.

And that's another side to this life, I've been leadin',
And that's another side to this life.

Would you like to know a secret, just between you and me.
Don't know where I'm goin' next, don't know where I'm gonna be.

And that's the other side to this life, I've been leadin',
And that's the other side of this life."

Come now tell me Sean O'Farrell where the gath'rin is to be
At the old spot by the river right well known to you and me

With your pike upon your shoulder by the rising of the moon

By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
With your pike upon your shoulder by the rising of the moon

Out from many a mud wall cabin eyes were watching through the night
Many a manly heart was throbbing for the blessed warning light
Murmurs rang along the valleys like the banshees lonely croon
And a thousand blades were flashing by the rising of the moon

By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon
And a thousand blades were flashing by the rising of the moon

There beside that singing river that dark  mass of men was seen
For above their shining weapons hung their own beloved green
Death to every foe and traitor! Forward strike the marching tune
And hurrah, me boys, for freedom, 'tis the rising of the moon

'Tis the rising of the moon, 'tis the rising of the moon
And hurrah, me boys, for freedom, 'tis the rising of the moon

Well they fought for poor old Ireland
And for bitter was their fate
Oh what glorious pride and sorrow fills the name of '98
Yes thank god instill our beating hearts in manhoods burning loom
Who would follow in their footsteps at the rising of the moon

At the rising of the moon, at the rising of the moon
Who would follow in their footsteps at the rising of the moon"

I would like to say a word or two,

But it's true, and it do.

All your life you have had to sing your song alone,
Not believing anybody could have known
But it's wrong and you know

Chorus:
I've found a song let me sing it with you
Let me say it now while the meaning is new
But wouldn't it be good if we could say it together!
Don't be afraid to sing me your mind
Sing about the joy that I know we can find.
Wind them around and see what they sound like together.
The song is love, the song is love,
The song is love, the song is love.

Last of all,
I would like to thank you for the word or two,
Spoken in the moments when I needed you
To see me through and they do.

And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone,
For the times they are a' changin'!

Come writers and critics who prophesy with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a' changin'!

Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a' changin'!

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a' changin'!

The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past

The others smiled at me and called me ""crazy""

The unicorn and I would while away the hours
Playing, dancing and romancing in the wild flowers
And we'd sing

[Chorus:]
Seeing is believing in the things you see
Loving is believing in the ones you love.
Seeing is believing in the things you see
Loving is believing in the ones you love.

When I was seventeen my best friend was the Northern Star
The others asked why I was always dreaming
When I did not reply I found my thoughts were very far
Away from daily hurts and fears and scheming.
The Northern Star and I would share our dreams together
Laughing, sighing, sometimes crying, in all kinds of weather
And we'd sing

[Chorus:]

And now that I am grown, my best friend lives inside of me
The others smile at me and call me ""crazy""
But I am not upset, for long ago I found the key
I've always known their seeing must be hazy.
My friend inside and I would while away the hours
Playing, dancing and romancing in the wild flowers
And we'd sing

Eyes with no future, that show how we fail

She's loaded deep, as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

I leaned my back against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just as my love proved false to me

Oh, love is gentle, and love is kind
The sweetest flower when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like the mornin' dew

The water is wide, I cannot get o'er
Neither have I the wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I"

A woman broods in silence
Close beside an open door;
Flung on her flimsy doorstep
Lies a corpse upon the floor.

""You'll not ask me why I'm silent""
The woman said to me;
Her two eyes blazed in anger
And her throat throbbed agony.

Once my heart could cry in sorrow
Now it lies there on the floor
In the ashes by the hearthstone;
They can't hurt it anymore.

Oh, let the wind go cryin' yonder
In the tree-tops by the spring
Let it's voice be soft and feelin'
Like it was a livin' thing.

He can walk the streets and boast like most but he don't know a thing.
It's all been done before, it's all been written in the book.
But when it's too much of nothin', nobody should look.

Too much of nothin' can turn a man into a liar
It can cause some man to sleep on nails, another man to eat fire.

Bring gloom down to the minimum

Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.

But you could bring back mem'ries, departed,
By playing my baby's request.

My baby says,
That she knows how it goes,
But you're the one who really knows.
So go ahead,
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.

When the moon lays his head on a pillow,
And the stars settles down for a rest,
Just do me one small favour, I beg you,
Please, play me baby's request,
Mm-mm, play me baby's request,
Please, play me my baby's request.

One more time."

And he fits her with a plan

Nights out for dancing
And the days for the sun
All kinds of weather, did surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show

He has to cancel
'Cause it got him working late

Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dream begins to fade

Her lights are out
She's gone to bed

Even the weather
Has started changing too

You only throw it away

Take a ride, take a ride
Out to the land of the free
Don't hurry take your time, take your time
Come and spend it with me

I want know will the clouds
When they roll back
Reveal a man in an old mac
Living on a park bench
Sitting on his own?

Cut the rain as it runs down the glass
Eventually through the lightning and thunder
We see a man going under
This is how it happens
This is what he said

I don't need love
Though temptation is sweet
Give me your hand
'Til I'm back on me feet
You're always telling me about my misery
I've seen things you will never see
Don't pity me

Focus in on the breath of a man
Who takes a brown paper bag
From his knapsack
Between his whispers and wise cracks
He's looking for permission
Screaming at the sky

I don't need love
Though temptation is sweet
Give me your hand
'Til I'm back on me feet
You're always telling me about my misery
I've seen things you will never see
Don't pity me

I'll be right again
Be upright without you
I'll stand up again
Kick up a fuss again too

Cut back again to a girl walking by
Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks
Climb an invisible soap box
Laughing at the traffic
Shouting at the world

I don't need love
Though temptation is sweet
Give me your hand
'Til I'm back on me feet
You're always telling me about my misery
I've seen things you will never see
Don't pity me

I'll stand up again
Kick up a fuss again too
I'll be right again
Be upright without you

We see a life through the eyes of a man
As he live and he dies
By a simple tattoo

I'll be back again
When I land on my feet
I'll stand up again
Kick up a fuss again, wouldn't you

Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him
It's there on his face
He's a case where there's clearly no hope

Give me your hand again
'Til I land again

His face starts to fade
As we pull down the shade
And the picture we made
Is in glorious cinemascope

I'll be back..."

Things can go bump, in the dead of the night

Came so close to the edge of defeat,
But I made my way in the shade keeping out of the heat.
It was fun shooting out at the stars, looking into the sun;
But it's been too long,
Now I want to come home.

Home, where there's nothing but sweet surrender,
To the memories from afar.
Home, to the place where the truth lies waiting,
We remember who we are.

Everyday I spent trying to prove I could make it alone.

No fairy tale anymore.

Don't be stopped by insanity.
Come on, river, overflow,
Let your love for your neighbours show.

But if you don't feel it, later on you'll regret it.
And if we let it we could set it free, you and me."

Running from the flood

Though I ain't no prayin' man
For the lord to come a helpin'
Knowing he'd understand

Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right

Well, I had a woman
She was good and clean
She spent all day with the washing machine
But when it come to lovin'
She was never around
She was out getting dirty
All over town

Deliver your children to the good good life
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right

Well, I was low on money
And my truck broke down
I was on my way to the lost and found
So I took it to a dealer
I said make it run
Well, I ain't got no money
But I got me a gun

I said you robbed me before
So I'm robbing you back
And if it don't put you straight
It'll put you on the right track
Well, I ain't no devil and I ain't no saint
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint

Deliver your children to the good good life
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right

You gotta feed that hen
And if you wanna hear some more
Well, I'll sing it again."

It feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead

What can we do to stop
This foolish plan going through
What can we do, what can we do

Although he's working with the best crew on the planet (The best crew!)

And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy but he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him if we don't do something soon to stop him

That we wear writing down at home.

Made sweet memories of friends from the past
Always comes to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration love may have last 
May it come to you time and time again

I've got too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it isn't too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My Ever Present Past

I've got too much on my mind
I think of everything to be discovered
I hope there's something to find
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My Ever Present Past

[Chorus:]
The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid

[Bridge:]
I couldn't understand a word that they were saying
But still I hung around and took it all in
I wouldn't join in with the games that they were playing
It went by, it went by, in a flash
It flew by, it flew by, in a flash

[Guitar solo]

There's far too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it's never too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My Ever Present Past

The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid

The things I think I did
I do, I think I did
The things I think I did

Take a snap of the famous groupies for me

Behold the famous groupies
They are alike as two peas
And where the other goes, the other goes
But though the famous groupies
Are only paid in rupies
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go

There was a bango player
Who kept an extra layer
Of dunlopillo mattress in his van
But when the famous groupies
Arrived with their twin snoopies
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran
Nobody does it like a famous groupie can

All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me

There was a lead guitarist
Who lived in Epping forest
And all he ever wanted was to blow
When the girls were with him
He never lost his rhythm
And nobody knows what the famous groupies know
Nobody goes where the famous groupies go

There was a classic story
Of a roadic nicknamed Rory
Who used to practice voodoo on the side
When the famous twosome
Suggested something gruesome
All that they found was a crater two miles wide
Which left the music business absolutely horrified

Ladies and gentlemen, those magnificent examples of
Female pulchritude and luminosity, direct from their
Global perambulations to the very boards of this
Supremely magnificent proscenium arch - ladies and
Gentlemen"

I know that I'm not a square as long as their not around
But I find it very very very very very very hard
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard

Love is fab it's like a stab in the heart
My hidden treasure, made to measure, for my pleasure, I had it my way

I want to know, I want to know,
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make love reliable convenant all the time.
Up and down the hills I go, I got to know, I got to know.

Is is better to love another
Than to go go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow,
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight.

It don't go nowhere at all,
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall.

We all cried when you were driven away
Come on brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay

Whatever's more important to you
You've got to change what you wanna do
Whatever's more important to be
That's the view that you've gotta see

There is a long way, between chaos and creation
If you don't say, which one of these your gonna choose
It's a long way, and in every contradiction
Seems to say it's a game that your bound to loose

Come on brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come on brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay
Come on back

Something is there

Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surrounds us
Help us to always care

Will survive and grow
And we will all know
Something is there

Circle round our family heart
Like a throng of hostile strangers eager for a war to start
There appears a friend's familiar face
Oh sweet relief, the heart goes to a warmer place

Loud reports of anger fill the pages of our history
Those of us with love can now embrace
With sweet relief a life lived at a gentler pace

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear

And this we prize
For this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

In the night a daffodil
Is battered by the father of all storms
Daybreak sees it stand alone
Amongst a field of lifeless forms
Rays of light illuminate
Where sweet relief presents a shining yellow face

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

We may find a trace
Of a state of grace
In the saddest face
Something is there

How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us

What about the time we met? (what about the time?)

That we were playing hard to get.
Didn't understand a thing,
But we could always sing.

What about the night we cried? (what about the night)
Because there wasn't any reason
Left to keep it all inside.
Never understood a word,

At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom

Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

[Will Young & Jamelia:]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life

Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow

Do they know it's Christmastime at all?

Here's to you

Raise a glass for everyone

Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived
If the table was turned would you survive

Here's to them

Underneath that burning sun

You ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless
Give a little help to the helpless

Why must she be the one
That I have to love
So like Candy

Her arms are tight around that lucky guy

I thought I'd seen the last of long ago
And it's so like Candy

I remember the day that picture was taken
We were so happy then
But that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no not that again
But that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day
So she turns and melts away

Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy

She couldn't say ""goodbye"", but ""I admire your taste""

Hot scalding tears I thought would flow
Still in my heart they'll never show

That day is done
That day is done
You know where I've gone I won't be coming back
That day is done

Well I recall the time and place
When they announced her precious face
I thought at once my heart would burst
Still every time is like the first

There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound
I know I must stay underground

[Chorus:]

That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed
Now if she would just look my way
One time before they proceed

She sprinkles flowers in the dirt
That's when a thrill becomes a hurt
I know I'll never see her face
She walks away from my resting place

Sworn that her name was veronica
Well she used to have a carefree mind of her
Own and a delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure if her name is veronica

Do you suppose, that waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica

Did the days drag by? Did the favours wane?
Did he roam down the town all the time?
Will you wake from your dream, with a wolf at
The door, reaching out for veronica
Well it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of veronica

On the empress of india
And as she closed her eyes upon the world and
Picked upon the bones of last weeks news
She spoke his name outloud again

Chorus

Veronica sits in her favourite chair and she sits
Very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get
Right and if they don't then nobody else will
But she used to have a carefree mind of her
Own, with devilish look in her eye
Saying you can call me anything you like, but
My name is veronica

All my life
Though some have changed
Some forever
Not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all

But if all these friends and lovers
There is no one
Compares with you
And these memories
Lose their meaning
When I think of love
As something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before

And I will not be late
Late to day when it becomes tomorrow I will
Leave to go a-way

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now
And linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
And calls me to her side
When a song of lonely love invites me on
I must go to her side

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye"

Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la...

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
La la la la...

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
La la la la...

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

Lives in a dream,
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door.
Who is it for?

All the lonely people.
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people.
Where do they all belong?

Father Mckenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear,
No one comes near,
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there.
What does he care?

All the lonely people.
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people.
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Ah, look at all the lonely people.

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church and was buried along with her name,
Nobody came.

No one was saved.

You are my best love

Hardly heard and hardly spoken
Hard to talk when things are rough
Can't you hear my heart is saying
You are my best love

Thanks for solving Friday's crossword
Who knew Ivan was a czar
And for having patience with me
You are my best love

(You are my best love
You are my best love)

Silence is not my intention
Hard to talk when things are rough
Forgive me if I failed to mention
You are my best love

Things were nice in California
Loved our trip out to the coast
Did I say your mother phoned us
You are my best love

Yeah you are my best love
Oh you are my best love
Yeah you are my best love
You are my best
You are my best
You are my best love
My best love
Did I mention
Did I mention
You are my best love

And you know the doctor told me
Son you better stay in bed

Who's that comin' down that road
Looks like he's carryin' a heavy load
{??} and he started to say
Want to come with me on my way

My dark hour, mother nature's child
My dark hour, oh, it's drivin' me wild

Well, I went to see the doctor
Just to have my fortune read
Well, well, well, well, well, the doctor told me

So do you think these sinners will fall
Or do you think they'll survive us all

We have time for criticism
Held bondage by our ism's
When will there be a time to love

We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgements
When will there be a time to love

At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate

We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion
All wrapped up in our own illusions
When will there be a time to love

We make time to conquer nations
Time for oil exploration
Hatred, violence and terrorism
When will there be a time to love

At this moment in time
We have a choice to make
Father God is watching
While we cause mother earth so much pain
It's such a shame

Not enough money for
The young, the old and the poor
But for war there is always more
When will there be a time to love

We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences
If we don't make the time to love

Now's the time to pay attention
Yes now is the time... To love...
A time love... Love...
A time to Love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love..."

Love you more than any other guy.

Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon
I was arrested by a rozzer wearing a pink balloon

So let the rain come down, the rain come down

There's a couple of new positions that I'd like 2 mention
Did U ever hear the one about the pinwheel? (No)
That's the one where I put your legs behind your head
And real dirty like, I'ma spin U around
And grab U by the waist and pump U 'til I hear my baby say

In goes the truth and out goes the lie
And before the beach gets 2 sandy (Uh oh)
We'll call a wet towel, W.C. is Handy
And it's all nice, comin' one, comin' twice
And if the Johnny's sick, we'll have 2 take the trip 2 Electricity

Plug it in if U dare, plug it in if U dare

Went down 2 the nightclub lookin' 4 the sun
Lookin' 4 a light that could brighten up a day
That's been darker than a hole since you went away

April usually brings showers
This time it was a hurtin' kind
This woman said she wanted my baby
I told her I'd have 2 be deaf, dumb, and blind
2 fall in love with someone that I barely knew
The baby would never really have a father
Cuz I still, cuz I still, cuz I still, still, still, huh
Be stuck on you

It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
Get off my mind, baby
Fallin' in love all over... You I'll never win

May was her name, she was jumpin'
Jumpin' from plane 2 plane
Actress or model or somethin'
Can't even remember her first name

June brought an Easter bunny
Needless 2 say, hmph, that girl was late
Told a made-up story 2 a busy-body of our only date
What a sketch!

July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary
It felt so much, so much like yours
But it only made me, made me want you more
She's gone, she's gone but U're still here
I want you very..., huh, it's you I fear

I can make U happy baby, over and over again (Oh, yeah)

Come on pretty baby, sit your butt on the chair there
And let me run agenda in and out of your hair fair
Agenda 4 the morning, noon and night, so prepare there
U could come alone or tell a friend, I don't care bear
This a funky party so U need 2 be open
Givin' up all I need so I don't need 2 be hopin'
And even if we're dealin' with that time of the month
It's 4th and goal and I ain't about 2 punt
Cuz as soon as U be strollin' in your Lagerfeld blazer
U need 2 know how many ways a brother can praise ya
2 bad 4 hell, 2 good 2 let heaven raise ya
And if U wanna see my dream, I need U 4 days and days
Baby doll, can U get the hell away
From that thing U call a man and then we can play
The kind of music that'll make your big butt sway
2 the back, 2 the forth
When it's all said a better brother should be more
Thank the Lord
Huh, 4 a body like that, titties swingin' like a door
Gimme 2 times just 2 thank my Savior
Girl, what can I say, U got the crazy flavor
I'm givin' U plenty propers so U got 2 score
The only one that's gonna make U holler 4 more
Like a whore, I'm yours
Acknowledge me, baby, what are U waiting 4?

Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what you mean 2 me

From the first moment I saw you
Ooh, I knew you where the 1
That night I had 2 call you
I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were s**
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love 2 me
Like you where afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
That's why

If God one day stroke me blind
Your beauty I'd still see

Just what you mean 2 me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, that you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't funkin' just 4 kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got 2 have your face
All up in the place
I'd like 2 think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare
2 your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' 2 ya this evening
I'm just tryin' 2 say
I'm just tryin' 2 say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there 4 you
I'll be there 4 you
On my heart, on my mind, (truly adore U)
I truly adore you (darlin')
You don't know what you're mean 2 me

Can I talk 2 you? {{chorus repeated in background}}

Tell you what you mean 2 me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I show no other, I wanna be
More than, more than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be (like no) like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me
Without you there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is 2 weak 2 define how much I adore
You, child
You, child
The last words you hear
The last words you hear

(until the end of time)
I'll be there for you, baby
(until the end of time)

Be with me darlin' til the end of time (until the end of time)
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body (until the end of time)

Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
When I did you right, you did me wrong
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
Only thing I’m leaving you: alone

By my critique, something’s changed
Every time you speak, it sounds deranged
Blessed are the meek
You used to be my girl
Now you’re just a freak
That’s going back in the world
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
Only thing I’m leaving you: alone

Stacking the weeks
Sitting, counting the years
Never been scared of nothing
But you I fear
No more curse, cause you’re away
Nothing’s worse than talking talk on holy days
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone

[Interlude]
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone

Ain’t gonna miss you, never would
I bet you think this song is about you
I give her credit when credit’s due
But if it wasn’t for me
You’d be a who
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone

Last time I checked
Every man is free
Free of each other now
You and me
Speak my name
It’s in my soul
Just don’t ask you to miss you
When you’re gone

[Interlude]

[Rap Break]
Never gonna miss you
Don’t you look for me to hit you
Only thing I’m leavin’ with you is alone
Nobody wanna kiss you
Where the sun’ll never hit you
Better take your Gucci up and be gone

Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re
Ain’t gonna miss you
Never, boo
It really don’t matter
Whatever you do
Ain’t gonna miss you
Nevermore
Go?
And your rubber tatas

I’m not, I’m not
Ain’t gonna miss you
Ain’t gonna miss you when you’re gone
When you’re gone
Get gone
I don’t think you heard me
Gone
Ain’t gonna miss you

A child is born, a child is born, will you marry me?

I'll teach you 2night (2night, 2night) in all my dreams
All my dreams
U'll be so surprised (surprised, surprised) at things U'll see
All my dreams
Africa, Cap'n Crunch, Norma Jean, s** and Cheerio's
Play my record double speed, feel the climax fit 4 a king

Just fun, nothing ethereal

Here ye, here ye, one and all
That the double speed playhouse is making a call

Welcome, this is where I live
This is where I dream my dreams
2night we'll make love until the world stops turning
U're small but very strong
You move like a cat&#58; quickly but gentle
So insane
He caressed her in her eyes and licked her abdomen
She shivered with delight
Over and over she nibbled his ear
U'd think it was wrong 2 have so much fun
He held her tightly until it almost hurt
But his hips, they moved so slowly
She wanted 2 stop breathing
You can feel every curve of her womanhood
You can see every thought in his brain
A submarine slowly moves through the virgin sea
Oh so slowly
She wants 2 stop breathing
You... You can feel every curve

Lisa, I'm gonna give you the brush and U're gonna paint the side of the train

She squeezes tighter as the submarine goes deeper in depth
Into the unnavigated territory
A smile, ever so slight, appears on his face as she starts 2 cry
Until they come, 2gether, slowly
They wish 4 somethin', as if they could see a parallel future in the sea
They do not speak
They only stare out the moment in time

Marry me 2day and 2night we'll make love until the world stops turning
(I'm dreaming of a world)
(Wherein there shines the sun)
(Wherein there lay the stars)
(Wherein there lie the stones)
Gentle, but quickly

We'll travel 2night in all my dreams
All my dreams

All my dreams, all my dreams
Goodness will guide us if love is inside us
The colors are brighter, the bond is much tighter
You know no child's a failure
Until the blue sailboat sails him away from his dreams
Don't ever lose, don't ever lose
Don't ever lose your dreams
Yeah"

I'll live my life in taxicabs

Always lookin' 4 some fun
Being good was such a bore
So she bought a gun
She killed John Lennon
Shot him down cold
She tried 2 kill Reagan

Put your head on the block

Boy, he was upset that night
But boy, was that ever cool
Remember that night we played pokeno 4 money
And you robbed me blind
Remember how you used 2 scream so loud cuz you...
You hated that number 9

Good heaven, how she's grown

But now I guess that only applies 2 her

You see, you are the only one I care 4, yeah

Your father said it was pneumonia
Your mother said it was stress
But the doctor said you were dead and I...
I say it's senseless
Every Christmas night 4 7 years now
I drink banana daiquiris till I'm blind
As long as I can hear you smiling, baby
You won't hear my tears

Dive inside your sould if you wanna know
The light inside the darkness 4ever glows
The son is like the diamond inside the coal
And like an embryo it grows and grows"
Prince,"Beautiful, Loved And Blessed",/p/prince/beautiful+loved+and+blessed_20437993.html,"Wake up
Ur beautiful, loved and blessed
Feel me? (I think I do)

When you found me I was just a piece of clay
I was 4mless, you gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)

But 2 much power (tell it)
Can can sometimes turn 2 shame
2 much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)
But 4giveness is how you win the game
I begged 4 truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was...

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day b4
Cause you made me confess that I am...
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

A constant battle 2 stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying 2 break you down
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up
I just wanna b happy
Come take this bitter cup from me

If I were ever 2 write my life story
I could truly say through all the pain and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
Cause when you whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh...

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day b4
Cause you made me confess that I am...
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

Everything you made you said, ""That's good""
B4 the fall of man you said, ""That's good""
Everytime I walk in faith, that's good
You let me see another day, that's good
B4 the earth was made you said,
""Tamar, I will lead the way and U'll go far""
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're...

Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you rescue me from the darkness
And our heart just must confess
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When U're free U're free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave Ur hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave Ur hands in the air and say

Beautiful, loved and blessed
You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I always pass the test

That's what I am, beautiful
That's what I am, beautiful
I don't mean 2 put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am...
Beautiful, that's what I am
That's what I am
When you wanna give up, don't cause you know
You always got a friend

That's what I am, that's what I am
Thats' what I am
Beautiful, beautiful
That's what I am, that's what I am
Thats' what I am
Beautiful, beautiful
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful"

This is not the place 4 you
Shit, all I wanna do is use your telephone (Turn all that fucking shit off)
(Hey, hold on you, you just... Hell, you just go now! Let go of me!)
Why you white motherfuckin' peckerwood, you redneck son-of-bitch!
(That fucking nigga - get out!)
I'll kick your motherfuckin' ass! (Hold back!)

Here we go

Yo Tone, I don't know
Cold grab the mic and just wreck some shit!

You got a black motherfucker in the house on the 1 and 2
Some who don't like the language, I say ""Yo, fuck U!""
Cuz this a record and I'm irate
And as a matter of fact, let's set the motherfuckin' record straight
Some of you can't stand the way I bring it
And can't stand the way a black motherfucker swings it
Check this out G
If you never stereotyped it, the stereotype would never be, ho!

'Fore 6 or 7 cuss words flyin' out his mouth (fuck U)
Hand all on his erection
Makin' rude gestures in your girl's direction

You don't watch Soul Train, you ain't got a chance
What the hell they got 2 come here 4? (Hell, I don't know Cliff)

Now I'm hyped and I'm vexed, streamin' 2 set it off
It's time we saw you with the N. P. G., the refs get off
I mean we come off, I believe it's cuz of the shit we tossed
I'm thinkin' about the redneck motherfucker who thinks he's the boss
Who's the dudes that let loose the vibe?
Yo, and labeled me just another chicken-eatin' nigga in the tribe
4 a man with no tribe is a man with no family
Dumb motherfucker, understand me?

B4 the day Eye carried you through the bridal path door

And ever since that day Eye haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth

But Eye love it when you call my name

Eye heard a voice on the news saying people want 2 stop the war
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd 4get what they were fighting 4
What's the matter with the world 2day?
The land of the free? Somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home
They'll only c you and me making love inside

It let me know Eye'd never seen the moon b4

Nothing about you is false, that's why Ur love is real

Eye'd have 2 take you from Ur man

Anything I wanted, that's why my baby's so fly

And tried our best 2 keep it on the down low, the down low

The day that Wilbur called and cussed her on the phone

Rendezvous, Mary's house
Dirty words and wine
Needless 2 say they all spend the day
Just counting time, counting time
Halfway through her history class
Denise she kindly raised her hand and asked
If she could be excused (""Can I be excused?"")
Then she ran from school (ran from school) in a hurry,
The other girls, ooh they knew
This is what friends are really 4
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle
Circle Of Amore

Circle of amore

Imagination showed a window (imagination)
On a cold September day (ooh)
Leaves are brown (brown), passion sounds (ooh)
Memory self astray
4 hands in the place where the feet connect
(Gang of 4)
Circle of s**
In the vicious race 2 maturity
They're almost phased from ecstasy
Sweat upon the necks of dames
Loser in the circle game
Cause memorie's are worth so much more (so much more)
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle
Circle Of Amore

(Ooh)
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle
Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle
Circle Of Amore

Mary, Claire, Denise and Belle

Then left him 4 a real prince from Arabia

Oh - every day is a yellow day

There was a woman from the ghetto
Who made funny faces just like Clara Bow
How was I 2 know that she would wear the same cologne as you
And giggle the same giggle that you do?
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool with a condition of the heart

It gave your flowers rain
Even though you won't play His game
You push it away but still it's pullin' 4 ya (I don't know)

Put you in His cookie jar, save you 4 a rainy day
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha
Put you in His cookie jar, save you 4 a rainy day

He might need you on the Eve Of Destruction
2 co-sign His order on that Judgment Day
Shout His name from the highest hill
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill
Every purple mutha need 2 look His way
The funk is here 2 stay

Chorus
(I don't know)

Another life goes 2 the winner
Another soul goes 2 the dream
Another hell goes 2 the sinner
Don't give up no matter how tough it seems

All in all, we got 2 come 2gether
And make a world that's 7 light-years better
Come on, don't be shy
So they're laughin' high
It's waiting 4 those who can storm the weather
Hey!

I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha

I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha
Put you in His cookie jar, save you 4 a rainy day (Save ya, save ya)

I say I don't know

And my lear jet brings me home (Listen darlin')

I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, shell show you no mercy
But shell shonuff shonuff show you how 2 grind

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you 4 a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

And I'm rockin' that stupid shit

Rollin' in my deuce deuce 5
Convertible top down so I can see the honeys passin' me by
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood
But 5 or 10 minutes, a criminal puts me in a bad mood
And some would say that's just a black man's perspective
But nowaday, I find that it's reflective
Of what I see goin' down everyday
My brothers and my sisters gettin' played
So we revert 2 committin' dope, many brothers get hurt
By another brother who don't like salt in his dirt
Cuz in the streets, see, that's the way it is
You keep your mouth shut and stay out of other people's biz
See, the system wasn't made 4 me or you
And as a matter of fact, it wasn't made 4 a poor white who...
Gets their weekly hit
Or should I say that weekly check and start depending on that shit like a glass dick
These are some of the feelings that I'm holdin'
But everything's fine while I'm rollin'...

How many, how many times must we commit crimes
Against people no better off than us, but in our own minds?

And when you step off, I finally rub your face in it
See, the local's preacher is not suited 4 the have-nots
The poor get poorer and the rich continue 2 clock... Not!
That means you end up with the booty
And we all know a broke man is a man with no friends
And that's basically the way society is
And money talk, pusher walk and sleepin' on the politics
Soon we must live 2 consolidate
As we continue 2 consume instead of producin', seal our on fate

People right now really don't give a damn

Turned into a heaven-sent message that saved your ass from dyin'

1st they offered up the buck
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck (right in the middle)
A toke or 2, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)

One minute you're hot
Tell the truth and you're not
That's the noose that they hang on a goose like you

Confuse the Rainbow Children and dethron their king. Using the lies promoted
By the whosepapers, hellavisions, and scagazines- The Banished Ones
Constructed a Digital Garden around the palace that extended throughout the
World. Furthermore they demanded compensation 4 their time spent in the
Palace b4 the exile. This was noise! ""So be it,"" said the Wise One, and
Gladly obliged with an invisible deed. The Banished Ones accepted and
Returned to their place of birth in Mendacity. As 4 the Rainbow Children,
They began deconstructing the Digital Garden. Door to door they went in

Talk about some way, but every day I make a plan to make you say
The same about me
Baby I know my love it's strong but not as strong as your... , that's ok, I like it
Not as much as I would like to have a chance to see you dancing naked
I really love to see you down
If you ever need someone to take a shower with, call me up, please
Extraloveble, extraloveble, don't you wanna, don't you wanna take a bath with me
Sugar baby you're supreme, we'll and maybe turn the lights
I might be kind of popular and if you want I'm yours
If we dance what we gonna do?
I think you better shot the doors
Ooh you know what I'm talking about baby

People tried 2 break us up
There were times a little rough
We survived cuz we had a love

You make my clock tick 12 twice then disappear, yeah yeah yeah

This program is required 4 those wishing 2 obtain a marriage blessing from The Kingdom. When u wish 2 begin this program, place ur right hand on the scanner and tightly clench up ur buttcheeks as u might feel a slight electrical shock. Please select the race history u desire. U have selected African-American. This is your history:

First of all, the term ""black and white"" is a fallacy. It simply is another way of saying ""this or that"". Let's examine the term ""this or that"" in its ultimate form which is: ""this"" means the truth or ""that which is resistant 2 it. When a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level- not just ""black""- but PEOPLE OF COLOR, and higher still ""INDIGENOUS"", and even higher still, ""FROM THE TRIBE OF."", and yet higher- the ""RAINBOW CHILDREN"". When this understanding comes, the so-called minority becomes a majority in the wink of an eye. This action will cause a Reaction or Resistance. The source of this Resistance must b banished as it is in direct conflict with the initial action. It cannot be assimilated, 4 its very nature is resistance. In other words, ONE CANNOT SERVE 2 MASTERS. U r either ""this"" or ""that"" which is not ""this"".

Congratulations! New star is born
Sun 2 his shadow, rose 2 a thorn
There ain't no fury like a woman scorned

Y'all must have dug it, when you did your thang
It's like a song, everybody wanna sing
When the music's over, ur ears ring
With a voice that's saying, 'Queen got no King""

He got a message saying, you tried 2 reach him on the 'phone
He didn't wanna answer cuz he's so afraid
U'd probably tell him just 2 leave you alone

I bet you heard he got another band
They're makin' money, they're makin' plans
You feel left out, but you need 2 understand
Word on the street - he's still ur man

Look out, here comes ur rainy day
But you think you got a good reason 2 say
Always in ur heart, come what may,
Even though his might get broken

Who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
Shadow 2 the sun, lets do the 1
Hell ain't got no fury

Will this song have a happy ending?
Will his heart need a-mending?
What's the name? Only she knows
Only the woman knows, only she knows

2 sides 2 every story
One man's gloom, another man's glory
Sun 2 his shadow, rose 2 a thorn
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned
No fury like a woman scorned

And the secrets I keep

But streetlamps serve to guide me
Back into your arms

Yeah it's me again
And I'm down on my knees
Won't be free again
From this love that I feel
So if you hear me pleading
To the God I can't believe in
Don't laugh for too long dear

And the cold night air
Feels this love affair
Even cold night air

So if you hear me pleading
To the God I can't believe in
Don't laugh for too long dear"

So slowly, my friend
We see them coming for miles
But our happiness we don't defend

Shadows fall where we let them
As neglect turns to regret
Shadows fall, do you never get them?
Ah, you haven't lived long enough yet.

Shadows fall on our loved ones
When we are not to blame
And we can't see any reason
Why they're carrying all that pain

Shadows fall right on them
While there's light to their left and to their right
So we try to help them step over
But all they see is darkest night

Shadows fall without warning
And we stumble around
Shadows fall without pity
And there's no peace to be found"

And though you tell it like a leg-pull
I think your still full of John Bull
You just refuse to hear

He's been so sad
Since you said his accent was bad
He's worn a frown
This Caledonian clown

I'm just going to have to learn to hesitate
To make sure my words
On your Saxon ears don't grate
But I wouldn't know a single word to say
If I flattened all the vowels
And threw the 'R' away
Flattened all the vowels
And threw the 'R' away
If I flattened all the vowels
And threw the 'R' away"

Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight

The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
(But I) But I couldn't stay away

So I claimed two, three, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more

I hope they hurry up before it's too late
Because I don't want my baby too much to wait

The old man had shown the way then.
Just in time I found women and wine.

I marvelled at the way that they united men
For the working and middle and upper classes.
You didn't need any brains
Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies.
I'm not basking in reflected glory
But open any book and I think you'll find that
The greatest men of all time
Loved women and wine
Or men and wine.

Ah, they'll be the death of you
If something else doesn't get you first.

Well I'm older now
And have to take my pleasures in moderation.
Least that's what it says here in this guide to
Declining years in declining nations.

Doesn't mean I can't cheer from the touchline.

Spend lots of time
On women and wine,

Through various shades of people
In the summers harshest heat
A story in your eye
Well, speak until your minds at ease

Ten years come and gone so fast
I might as well be dreaming
Sunny days have burned a path
Across another season
A fortune rises to the sky
Ten years come and gone so fast

You are driving down an empty road
Beside a shady river
When the sky turns dark as stone
The trees begin to shiver
The grace of God is nigh

Ten years come and gone
And that flash has never been forgotten
Sunny days have burned a path
Across another season
How do the powerless survive
Ten years come and gone so fast

And if you look into your future life
Ten years from this question
Do you imagine a familiar light
Burning in the distance
The love that never died

Ten years come and gone so fast
I might as well be dreaming
Sunny days have burned a path
Across another season

Ten years come and gone so fast
Sunny days have burned a path"

 This is the early evening edition of the news. 
 The recent fight in the House of Representatives over the open housing section of the Civil Rights Bill brought traditional enemies together, but it left the defenders of the measure without the votes of their strongest supporters. President Johnson originally proposed an outright ban covering discrimination by everyone for every type of housing, but it had no chance from the start and everyone in Congress knew it. A compromise was painfully worked out in the House Judiciary Committee. 
 In Los Angeles today comedian Lenny Bruce died of what was believed to be an overdose of narcotics. Bruce was 42 years old. 
 Dr. Martin Luther King says he does not intend to cancel plans for an open housing march Sunday into the Chicago suburb of Cicero. Cook County Sheriff Richard Ogleby asked King to call of the march, and the police in Cicero said they would ask the National Guard to be called out if it is held. King, now in Atlanta, Georgia, plans to return to Chicago Tuesday. 
 In Chicago, Richard Speck, accused murderer of nine student nurses, was brought before a grand jury today for indictment. The nurses were found stabbed and strangled in their Chicago apartment. 
 In Washington, the atmosphere was tense today as a special sub-committee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities continued its probe into anti-Viet Nam war protests. Demonstrators were forcibly evicted from the hearings when they began chanting anti-war slogans. Former Vice President Richard Nixon says that unless there is a substantial increase in the present war effort in Viet Nam, the US should look forward to five more years of war. In a speech before the Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New York, Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single weapon working against the US.

Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep

Voices were singing, and
Hands were meeting, and
Saying, ""I won't be a slave anymore""

And they faded in the night, they vanished in the dark

Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned.

Carry your cup in your hand.
And look around.
Leaves are brown.
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

Hang on to your hopes, my friend.
That's an easy thing to say,
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again.
Look around,
The grass is high,
The fields are ripe,
It's the springtime of my life.

Seasons change with the scenery;
Weaving time in a tapestry.
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
Looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme.

Drinking my vodka and lime,

Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter."

The underground is closing soon
In the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows.

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
Hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within his silent socket
He holds his colored crayon.

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket he quickly flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprised of
- four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night."

It was the morning of october 6th, 1960
I was wearing my brown suit
Preparing to leave the house of D.
Shook some hands then adios brooklyn amigos
Maybe some of them had hopes of seeing me again
Some even said that my judge-judge gerald culkin-
Wouldn't play it by the book
Maybe let us off the hook
But, woh-oo-woh, I knew better.

Afraid to leave the projects
To cross into another neighborhood

The blancos and the nigger gangs
Well, they'd kill you if they could.

All over the world
Spanish children are taught on their knees to believe
Angel of mercy, people are suffering
All over the island tonight,
Mothers weep

Sisters grieve.

Well, I entered the courtroom, state of new york
County of new york, just some spic
They scrubbed off the sidewalk
Guilty by my dress
Guilty in the press
Let the capeman burn for the murder
Well the 'spanish boys' had their day in court
And now it was time for some fuckin' law and order
The electric chair
For the greasy pair
Said the judge to the court reporter

Sal & salvador
Afraid to leave the projects
To cross into another neighborhood

Salvador
The newspapers and the T. V. Crews
Well, they'd kill you if they could

Aurea & women
Angel of mercy, people are suffering
All over the world
A spanish boy could be killed every night of the week

Sal
But just let some white boy die
And the world goes crazy for blood-latin blood.
I don't lie when I speak.

Sal & salvador
Well they shackled my hands

Sal
A heavy belt around my waist to restrain me

Sal & salvador
And they shackled my legs

Sal
Hernandez, the 'umbrella man, ' chained beside me
Then we rode that black maria
Through the streets of spanish harlem
Calling old friends on the corners

Just to lay our prayers upon them

And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the black pit town
Somebody says what's a better thing to do
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world

Out in the indian ocean somewhere
There's a former army post
Abandoned now just like the war
And there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's what that old army post was for

Well, the sun gets bloody

I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America
Laughing on the bus playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in the raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenary she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
Cathy I'm lost I said though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike

(words by Paul Simon  music by js Bach)
Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused
And I've often felt forsaken, and certainly misused.
But it's all right, it's all right, I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be bright and Bon Vivant
So far away from home, so far away from home.
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
Don't have a friend who feels at ease
Don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to it's knees.
But it's all right, all right, We've lived so well so long
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on,
I wonder what went wrong, I can't help it
I wonder what went wrong.
And I dreamed I was flying. I dreamed my soul rose
Unexpectedly, and looking back down on me, smiled
Reassuringly, and I dreamed I was dying.
And far above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty, drifting away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying.
We come on a ship we call the Mayflower,
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come at the age's most uncertain hour
And sing the American tune
But it's all right, it's all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest,
That's all, I'm trying to get some rest.

When no one was awake
She drove across the border
Leaving all the yellow roses on her wedding cake
Her mother's tears, her breakfast order

She's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment, a chip in time
When leaving home is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears
But your heart can see
Another life, another galaxy

That night her dreams are storm-tossed as a willow
She hears the clouds
She sees the eye of a hurricane
As it sweeps across her island pillow

But she's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment, a chip in time
When leaving home is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears

In restless walks she'll prowl the night.

And give no warning to her flight.

The place where she'd been dwelling

If your name be Barbriallen

And slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there

Oh, don't you remember the other day
When we where in a tavern
You drank your health to the ladies there
And you slided Barbriallen

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
Adieu, adieu to all my friends
Be kind to Barbriallen

She looked to the east, she looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-coming
Oh, put him down for me she cried
That I may gaze upon him

The more she looked, the more she grieved
She bursted it out in crying
Oh, pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dying

They buried sweet Willy in the old church yard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willy's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

They grew and they grew on the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they tied in a true love's knot
The rose bush and the briar"

Yes sir, head's erased, brain's a bowl of jelly. Hasn't hurt his sense of taste, judging from his belly. But back in the house, family of four now: two doin' the laundry and two on the kitchen floor.
We brought a brand new baby back from mainland China, sailed across the China Sea. She's beautiful. Beautiful.
Go-kart sittin' in the shade: you don't need a ticket to ride, it's summertime, summertime, slip down a water slide. Little kid dancin' in the grass, legs like rubber band.

Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to
Blessed are the meth drinkers, pot sellers, illusion dwellers
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?
My words trickle down from a wound
That I have no intention to heal

Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game.

Send out for whisky, baby,
Send out for gin,
Me and room service, honey,
Me and room service, babe,
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin

When I ain't drinking, baby,
You are on my mind,
When I ain't sleeping, honey,
When I ain't sleeping, Mama,
When I ain't sleeping
Well you know you'll find me crying.

Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game.

Living is a gamble, baby,
Loving's much the same,
Wherever I have played,
Wherever I throw those dice,
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game.

Maybe when I'm older, baby,
Someplace down the line,
I'll wake up older,
So much older, Mama,
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my trying.

Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues, they're all the same."

Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time

Me and my buddies we are travelling people
We like to go down to restaurant row
Spend those euro-dollars
All the way from washington to tokyo
I see them in the airport lounge
Upon their mother's breast
They follow me with open eyes
Their uninvited guest

Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time

Too many people on the bus from the airport
Too many holes in the crust of the earth
The planet groans
Every time it registers another birth

But among the reeds and rushes
A baby girl was found
Her eyes as clear as centuries
Her silky hair was brown

Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time"

Before I reached the age of sixteen

He keeps looking but he don't recognize me
Some guy from lexington or park
Red beans and rice from kitchen windows
It's supper-time and the barrio is dark

No one knows you like I do
Nobody can know your heart the way I do
No one can testify to all that you've been through
But I will

And my blood is taino
Spanish caribbean my soul
We came here wearing summer clothes in winter
Hearts of sunshine in the cold
Your family rented this apartment
You'd watch the street lamps from your perch
In the sacramental hour your stepfather in black
Preached the fire of the pentecostal church

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I was born in puerto rico
Came here when I was a child
Small change and sunlight, then I left these streets
For good
My days as short as they were wild
I'm carlos apache
Your features blurred in every grainy photo
And fading headline of the daily news
Wiltwyck school for criminal children
Auburn, brooklyn house of d.,
Dannemora, sing-sing, attica

Twenty years inside, today you're free
You cannot even read your story
The pages piling up in shame
Before the words released you, the guard would
Kill the light
The night you took the capeman for your name

Reaching into the night,
Wandering over the hills unseen,
Or is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees,
A cold sound in the air,
And nobody ever knows when you go,
And where do you start,
Oh, into the dark.

Nothing here changes your lives
Ungrateful immigrants asking for pity
When all of your answers are knives
This city makes a cartoon of a crime
Capes and umbrellas the glorification of slime

Asks me to pray for the murderer's soul
But I think you'd have to be
Jesus on the cross
To open your heart after such a loss

[Chorus]
Can I forgive him
No, I cannot
Can I forgive him
No

[Verse 2]
Only god can say 'forgive'
His son too received a knife
But we go on, we have to live
With this cross we call our life
Feels like a bomb fell
And wave after wave come the aftershocks

[2nd Mother]
You can't believe that it's true
There must be some mistake
You drift through this nightmare from which you

[Chorus]
Can't wake
Can I forgive him?
Can I forgive him
No, I cannot

[Outro]
Can t forgive him?
Can I forgive him, no, I cannot
Can I forgive him?
Can 1 forgive him, no, I cannot
Can I forgive him
No, I cannot"

Burns out in the ukraine

Protect us from the new rain

To analyze the soil

The water that we boil

I had a dream about us
In the bottles and the bones of the night
I felt a pain in my shoulder blade
Like a pencil point? a love bite?
A couple was rubbing against us
Rubbing and doing that new dance
The man was wearing a jacket and jeans
The woman was laughing in advance

I can't run but
I can walk much faster than this
Can't run but
I can't run but
I can walk much faster than this
Can't run but

A winding river
Gets wound around a heart. pull it
Tighter and tighter
Until the muddy waters part
Down by the river bank
A blues band arrives
The music suffers
The music business thrives

I can't run but
I can walk much faster than this
Can't run but
I can't run but
I can walk much faster than this
Can't run but

Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Similarly made. similarly sold
In a motorcade. abandoned when they're old
Cars are cars all over the world

Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Engine in the front. jack in the back
Wheels take the brunt. pinion and a rack
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world

But people are strangers
They change with the curve
From time zone to time zone
As we can observe
They shut down their borders
And think they're immune
They stand on their differences
And shoot at the moon

But cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Drive 'em on the left. drive 'em on the right
Susceptible to theft in the middle of the night
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world

I once had a car
That was more like a home
I lived in it, loved in it
Polished it's chrome
If some of my homes
Had been more like my car
I probably wouldn't have
Travelled this far

Cars are cars all over the world

The first time I saw her
I couldn't be sure
But the sin of impatience
Said, ""she's just what you're looking for""

So I walked right up to her
And with the part or me that talks
I introduced myself as frank
From new york new york

She's so hot
She's so cool
I'm not
I'm just a fool in love with darling lorraine

All my life I've been a wanderer
Not really, I mostly lived near my parents' home
Anyway lorraine and I got married
And the usual marriage stuff
Then one day she says to me

From out of the blue
Frank, I've had enough
Romance is a heartbreaker
I'm not meant to be a homemaker
And I'm tired of being darling lorraine

What - you don't love me anymore?
What - you're walking out the door?
What - you don't like the way I chew?
Hey let me tell you

You're not the woman that I wed
You say you're depressed but you're not
You just like to stay in bed
I don't need you darling lorraine

Darling lorraine
Lorraine
I long for your love

Financially speaking
I guess I'm a washout
Everybody's buy and sell
And sell and buy and
And that's what the whole thing's all about
If it had not been for lorraine
I'd have left here long ago
I should have been a musician
I love the piano
She's so light
She's so free
I'm tight, well, that's me
But I feel so good
With darling lorraine

On christmas morning frank awakes
To find lorraine has made a stack of pancakes
They watch the television, husband and wife
All afternoon ""it's a wonderful life

What - you don't love me anymore?
What - you're walking out the door?
What - you don't like the way I chew?
Hey let me tell you
You're not the woman that I wed
Gimme my robe I'm going back to bed
I'm sick to death of you lorraine

Darling lorraine
Lorraine
Her hands like wood
The doctor was smiling
But the news wasn't good
Darling lorraine
Please don't leave me yet
I know you're in pain
Pain you can't forget
Your breathing is like an echo of our love
Maybe I'll go down to the corner store
And buy us something sweet
Here's an extra blanket honey
To wrap around your feet

All the trees were washed with april rain
And the moon in the meadow
Took darling lorraine"

An empty sky, a hidden mound of stone
But the CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing
Now-a-days, when everything is known

Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue
Dazzling blue

Miles apart, though the miles can't measure distance
Worlds apart on a rainy afternoon
But the road gets dirty and it offers no resistance
So turn your amp up and play your lonesome tune

Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue
Dazzling blue

Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen
To make a marriage bed
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue

Sweet July, and we drove the Montauk Highway
And walked along the cliffs above the sea
And we wondered why, and imagined it was someday
And that is how the future came to be

Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen
To make a marriage bed
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue"

Because I please you
Wearing these diamonds

As if everybody here would know
Exactly what I was talking about
Talking about diamonds on the soles of her shoes

He makes the sign of a wave

And he puts on after-shave
To compensate for his ordinary shoes

And she said honey take me dancing
But they ended up by sleeping
In a doorway
By the bodegas and the lights on
Upper Broadway
Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes

And I could say oo oo oo

Bound to win a prize

Lincoln duncan is my name
And here's my song, here's my song

My father was a fisherman
My mama was a fisherman's friend
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder
So when I reached my prime
I left my home in the maritimes
Headed down the turnpike for new england, sweet new england

Holes in my confidence
Holes in the knees of my jeans
It's left without a penny in my pocket
Oo-o wee i's about as
Destituted as a kid could be
And I wish I wore a ring
So I could hock it I'd like to hock it

A young girl in a parking lot
Was preaching to a crowd
Singin sacred songs and
Reading from the bible
Well I told her I was lost
And she told me all about the pentecost
And I seen that girl as the road to my survi-ival

Just later on the very same night
When I crept to her tent with a flashlight
And my long years of innocence ended
Well she took me to the woods sayin'
""here comes somethin' and it feels so good!""
And just like a dog I was befriended
I was befriended

Oh, oh, what a night
Oh what a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was playin' my guitar
Lying underneath the stars
Just thankin' the lord for my fingers
For my fingers"

Of words in a melody line,

Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine.

But if I ever get back to the twentieth century,
Guess I'll have to pay off some debts.
Open the book of my vanishing memory,
With it's catalogue of regrets.
Stand up for the deeds I did, and those I didn't do.
Sit down, shut up, think about God,
And wait for the hour of my rescue.

We don't mean to mess things up,
But mess them up we do.
And then it's ""Oh, I'm sorry.""
Here's a smiling photograph
Of love when it was new.
At a birthday party.
Make a wish and close your eyes:
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

Early December, and brown as a sparrow,
Frost creeping over the pond.
I shoot a thought into the future,
And it flies like an arrow, through my liftime.
And beyond.
If I ever come back as a tree, or a crow,
Or even the wind-blown dust;
Find me on the ancient road
In the song when the wires are hushed.
Hurry on and remember me,
As I'll remember you.
Far above the golden clouds,
The darkness vibrates.
The earth is blue.

And everything about it is a love song.
Everything about it.
Everything about it is a love song.
Everything about it.
Everything about it is a love song."

And ups to start you on your way

Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction.

Lose you as I lose my light
Days falling backward into velvet night

Wants everything
It wants everything
It wants soil as soft as summer
And the strength to push like spring

A broken laugh a broken fever
Take it up with the great deceiver
Who looks you in the eye
And says baby don't cry

 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain

 Down in a lonely manger 
 The humble Christ was born 
 And God sent salvation 
 That blessed Christmas morn 

 Hallelujah! 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born 

 While shepherds kept their watch 
 O'er silent flocks by night 
 Behold throughout the heavens 
 There shown a holy light 

 Hallelujah! 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born 

 Down in a lonely manger 
 The humble Christ was born 
 And God sent salvation 
 That blessed Christmas morn

Paul Simon,God Bless The Absentee,/p/paul+simon/god+bless+the+absentee_20105894.html,"Lord, I'm a working man
And music is my trade
I'm travelin' with this five-piece band
And I play the ace of spades
I have a wife and family
Who don't see much of me
God bless the absentee

Lord, I am a surgeon
And music is my knife
It cuts away my sorrow
And purifies my life
But if I could release my heart
And veins and arteries
I'd say God bless the absentee

I miss my woman so
I miss my bed
I miss those soft places
I used to lay my head

My son don't need me yet
His bones are soft
He flies a silver airplane
He wears a golden cross
God bless the absentee

Lord, this country's changed so fast
The future is the present
The present's in the past
Highways are in litigation
The airports disagree
God bless the absentee
God bless the absentee"
Paul Simon,Gone At Last,/p/paul+simon/gone+at+last_20105951.html,"The night was black, the roads were icy
Snow was fallin', drifts were high
And I was weary, from my driving
And I stopped to rest for a while
I sat down at a truck stop
I was thinking about my past
I've had a long streak of bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

Gone, gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm prayin' it's gone at last
00, oo, oo, oo, oo

I ain't dumb
I kicked around some
I don't fall too easily
But that boy looked so dejected
He just grabbed my sympathy
Sweet little soul now, what's your problem?
Tell me why you're so downcast
I've had a long streak of bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

Gone, gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm prayin' it's gone at last
00, oo, oo, oo, oo

Once in a while from out of nowhere
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared
Somebody will come and lift you higher
And your burdens will be shared
Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you
I might still be sinking fast
I've had a long streak of bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

Gone, gone, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm prayin' it's gone at last
Gone, gone, gone gone gone gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm prayin' it's gone at last"

Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war

I'm going to Graceland

And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland

She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow

I'm going to Graceland
Memphis, Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland

And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland

There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
And everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow

In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be advised to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland

In Graceland, in Graceland, Graceland
I'm going to Graceland"

What are you going to do about it that's what I'd like to know? ""
You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could

It was in the early morning hours when I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers, I slammed into a brick wall

Is this my fault?

""Say, ain't we walking down the same street together on the very same day?""
I said, ""Hey Senorita that's astute""
I said, ""Why don't we get together and call ourselves an institute?""

Yesterday it was my birthday
I hung one more year on the line
I should be depressed
My life's a mess
But I'm having a good time

Oo, I've been loving and loving and loving
I'm exhausted from loving so well
I should go to bed
But a voice in my head
Says ""ah, what the hell""

Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time

Paranoia strikes deep in the heartland
But I think it's all overdone
Exaggerating this and exaggerating that
They don't have no fun

I don't believe what I read in the papers
They're just out to capture my dime
I ain't worrying
And I ain't scurrying;
I'm having a good time

Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time

Maybe I'm laughing my way to disaster
Maybe my race has been run
Maybe I'm blind to the fate of mankind
But what can be done?
So God bless the goods we was given
And God bless the you. S. Of A.
And God bless our standard of livin'
Let's keep it that way
And we'll all have a good time

Repeat and fade:
Have a good time

They started a long time ago
The arc of a love affair
Rainbows in the high desert air
Mountain passes slipping into stones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Thinking back to the season before
Looking back through the cracks in the door
Two people were married
The act was outrageous
The bride was contagious
She burned like a bride
These events may have had some effect
On the man with the girl by his side
The arc of a love affair
His hands rolling down her hair
Love like lightning shaking till it moans
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
And whoa whoa whoa
She said:
Why?
Why don't we drive through the night
We'll wake up down in Mexico
Oh I
I don't know nothin' about nothin' about
No Mexico
And tell me why
Why won't you love me
For who I am
Where I am

'Cause that's not the way the world is baby
This is how I love you, baby
This is how I love you, baby
One and one-half wandering Jews
Return to their natural coasts
To resume old acquaintances
Step out occasionally
And speculate who had been damaged the most
Easy time will determine if these consolations
Will be their reward
The arc of a love affair
Waiting to be restored
You take two bodies and you twirl them into one
Their hearts and their bones
And they won't come undone
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones

Paul Simon,Homeward Bound,/p/paul+simon/homeward+bound_20105974.html,"I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Silently for me."
Paul Simon,How Can You Live In The Northeast,/p/paul+simon/how+can+you+live+in+the+northeast_20559748.html,"We heard the fireworks. Rushed out to watch the sky. Happy go lucky. Fourth of July.
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How can you be a Christian? How can you be a Jew? How can you be a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Hindu?
How can you?
Weak as the winter sun, we enter life on earth. Names and religion come just after date of birth. Then everybody gets a tongue to speak, and everyone hears an inner voice. A day at the end of the week to wonder and rejoice.
If the answer is infinite light, why do we sleep in the dark?
How can you live in the Northeast? How can live in the South? How can you build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How can you tattoo your body? Why do you cover your head? How can you eat from a rice bowl, the holy man only breaks bread?
We watched the fireworks, 'til they were fireflies. Followed a path of stars, over the endless skies.
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth?
I've been given all I wanted. Only three generations off the boat. I have harvested and I've planted. I am wearing my father's old coat."

Of the belvedere motel
Wondering as the television burns
How the heart approaches what it yearns

In a fever
I distinctly hear your voice
Emerging from a dream, the dream returns
How the heart approaches what it yearns

After the rain on the interstate
The headlights slide past the moon
A bone-weary traveler
Waits by the side of the road
Where's he goin?

I dream we are lying on the top of a hill
And headlights slide past the moon
I fold in your arms
And your voice is the heat of the night
I'm on fire

In a phone booth
In some local bar and grill
Rehearsing what I'll say, my coin returns
How the heart approaches what it yearns
How the heart approaches what it yearns"

Tell us all a story
About how it used to be
Make it up and write it down
Just like history
About goldilocks and the three bears
Nature in the cross hairs
And how we all ascended
From the deep green sea
When it's not too hot
Not too cold
Not too meek
Not too bold
When it's just right and you have sunlight
Then we're home,
Finally home
Home in the land of the homeless
Finally home

Oh what are we going to do
I never did a thing to you
Time peaceful as a hurricane eve
Peaceful as a hurricane eye

A history of whispers
A shadow of a horse
Faces painted black in sorrow and remorse
White cloud, black crow
Crucifix and arrow
The oldest silence speaks the loudest
Under the deep green sea

When speech becomes a crime
Silence leads the spirit
Over the bridge of time

Over the bridge of time
I'm walking with my family
And the road begins to climb
And it's oh lord how we going to pray
With crazy angel voices
All night
Until it's a new day

Peaceful as a hurricane
Peaceful as a hurricane
Peaceful as a hurricane eye
Peaceful as a hurricane
Peaceful as a hurricane
Peaceful as a hurricane eye

You want to change the game?
Turn your back on money
Walk away from fame

How does it make you feel?
You want to be a writer
But you don't know how or when
Find a quiet place
Use a humble pen

You want to talk talk talk about it
All night squawk about
The ocean and the atmosphere
Well I've been away for a long time
And it looks like a mess around here
I'll be away for a long time
So here's how the story goes
There was an old woman
Who lived in a shoe
She was baking a cinnamon pie
She fell asleep in a washing machine
Woke up in a hurricane eye"

December;
I am alone,
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock,
I am an island.

I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock,
I am an island.

Don't talk of love,
But I've heard the words before;
It's sleeping in my memory.
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
If I never loved I never would have cried.
I am a rock,
I am an island.

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me;
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
I touch no one and no one touches me.
I am a rock,
I am an island.

And a rock feels no pain;
And an island never cries."

We were married on a rainy day
The sky was yellow
And the grass was gray
We signed the papers
And we drove away
I do it for your love

The rooms were musty
And the pipes were old
All that winter we shared a cold
Drank all the orange juice
That we could hold
I do it for your love

Found a rug
In an old junk shop
And I brought it home to you
Along the way the colors ran
The orange bled the blue

The sting of reason
The splash of tears
The northern and the southern
Hemisphere
Love emerges and it disappears
I do it for your love
I do it for your love"

""The universe loves a drama,"" you know. And ladies and gentlemen this is the show.

I was dealing my last hand of poker.
My cards were useless as smoke.
Oh, guardian angel.
Don't taunt me like this, on a clear summer evening as soft as a kiss.
My children are laughing, not a whisper of care.
My love is brushing her long chestnut hair.
I don't believe a heart can be filled to the brim then vanish like mist as though life were a whim.
Maybe the heart is part of the mist.
And that's all that there is or could ever exist.
Maybe and maybe and maybe some more. Maybe's the exit that I'm looking for.
I got a call from my broker.
The broker said he was mistaken.
Maybe some virus or brokerage joke and he hopes that my faith isn't shaken.

The insomniac’s lullaby

Sleep

Soft as a rose
The light from the East
As if all is forgiven and wolves become sheep
We are who we are
Or we’re not
But at least we’ll eventually all fall asleep
Eventually all fall asleep"
Paul Simon,Jonah,/p/paul+simon/jonah_20105896.html,"Half and hour you change your strings and tune up
Sizing the room up
Checking the bar
Local girls unspoken conversations
Misinformation
Plays the guitar

They say jonah was swallowed by a whale
But I say there's no truth to that tale
I know jonah
Was swallowed by a song

No one lets their dreams be taken lightly
They hold them tightly
Warm against cold
One more year of traveling 'round this ciruit
Then you can work it into gold

Here's to all the boys who came along
Carrying soft guitars in cardboard cases
All night long
Do you wonder where those boys have gone?
Do you wonder where those boys have gone?"
Paul Simon,Kathy's Song,/p/paul+simon/kathys+song_20230533.html,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls.

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies.

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day.

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you.

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I."

Everywhere I go I get slandered
Libeled, I hear words I never heard in the bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

Deputy sheriff said to me
Tell me what you came here for boy
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble boy
And now you're heading into more

 They'd never fight again 

 And when the papers all were signed 
 And a million copies made 
 They all joined hands and bowed their heads 
 And grateful prayers were prayed 
 And the people in the streets below 
 Were dancing round and round

The next thing I remember, I am walking down a street
I'm feeling alright I'm with my boys and with my troops, yeah
Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella groups, yeah

Singin' late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar, I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a j
When I come back to the room, everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play

It was late in the evening, and I blew that room away

First thing I remember when you came into my life
I said I wanna get that girl, no matter what I do

And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl
I held her close, but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write

I through a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound

Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye

And the leaves that are green turn to brown

For it's touch
And all the while it's free as air
Like plants the medicine is everywhere

We crave it so badly
Makes you want to laugh out loud when you receive it
And gobble it like candy

We think it's easy
Sometimes it's easy
But it's not easy
You're going to break down and cry
We're not important
We should be grateful
And if you're wondering why

When evil walks the planet
And love is crushed like clay

The burning temples, the weeping cathedrals"

God and his only son
Paid a courtesy call on Earth one Sunday morning
Orange blossoms opened their fragrant lips
Songbirds sang from the tips of cotton roots
Old folks wept
For his love in these hard times

[Verse 2]
""Well, better be going,""
Said the the restless Lord to his son
""There are galaxies yet to be born
Creation is never done
Anyway, these people are slobs here
If we stay, it's bound to be a mob scene""
Disappeared
And it's just like love in hard times

[Verse 3]
I loved her the first time I saw her
I know that's an old songwriting cliche
I loved her the first time I saw her
Can't describe it any other way
Any other way
The light of her beauty is warm as a summer day
Clouds of antelopes roll by
No hint of rain
Pale blue sky
Just love, love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
But the rains came
The tears burned
The windows rattled
The locks turned
It's easy to be generous when you're owed
It's hard to be grateful
When you're out of control
And love is gone

The light at the edge of the curtain was the quiet dove
The bedroom weaves in clicks and clacks
My heart and my mind will never last
When your hand takes mine
Thank God I found you tonight

Evil is darkness, sight without sight

Couple of light years later, stars and planets sang
Fire warmed the cold, waves of colors flew
Moonlight into gold, earth to green and blue

Love is eternal sacred light
Free from the shackles of time
Evil is darkness, sight without sight
A demon that feeds on the mind

Earth becomes a farm
Farmer takes a wife
Wife becomes a river and the giver of life
Man becomes machine
Oil runs down his face
Machine becomes a man with a bomb in the marketplace
Bomb in the marketplace, bomb in the marketplace

Free from the shackles of time
Evil is darkness, sight without sight
A demon that feeds on the mind

Big Bang
That's a joke that I made up
Once when I had eons to kill
You know, most folks
They don't get when I'm joking
Well, maybe someday they will

Love me
Love me
That's the main request I receive
Well you know I love all my children
And it tears me up when I leave

But sometimes you gotta fly down that highway
Free as a bird, knock on wood, thank the Lord
I am driving along in my automobile
It's a brand new pre-owned '96 Ford

Check out the radio, pop music station
That don't sound like my music to me
Talk show host, what's that boy's name?
Politics is ugly

At the end of the dial there's the gospel show
Maybe now I can exit and rest
There's a blizzard rolling down off the banks of Lake Michigan
Gonna cover the roads of the icy Midwest

Love is eternal sacred light
Free from the shackles of time
Evil is darkness, sight without sight
A demon that feeds all the mind
Love is eternal sacred light

Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears"
Paul Simon,Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean,/p/paul+simon/once+upon+a+time+there+was+an+ocean_20559745.html,"Once upon a time there was an ocean. But now it's a mountain range. Something unstoppable set into motion. Nothing is different, but everthing's changed.
It's a dead end job, and you get tired of sittin'. And it's a like a nicotine habit you're always thinking about quittin'. I think about quittin' every day of the week. When I look out my window it's brown and it's bleak.
Outta here. How am I gonna get outta here? I'm thinking outta here. When am I gonna get outta here? And when will I cash in my lottery ticket, and bury my past with my burdens and strife? I want to shake every limb in the garden of Eden, and make every lover the love of my life.
I figure that once upon a time I was an ocean. But now I'm a mountain range. Somthing unstoppable set into motion. Nothing is different, but everything's changed.
Found a room in the heart of the city, down by the bridge. Hot plate and tv and beer in the fridge. But I'm easy, I'm open-that's my gift. I can flow with the traffic, I can drift with the drift. Home again? Naw, never going home again. Think about home again? I never think about home.
But then comes a letter from home, the handwriting's fragile and strange. Something unstoppable set into motion. Nothing is different, but everthing's changed.
The light through the stained glass was cobalt and red. And the frayed cuffs and collars were mended by haloes of golden thread. The choir sang, ""Once Upon A TIme There Was An Ocean."" And all the old hymns and family names came fluttering down as leaves of emotion.
As nothing is different, but everthing's changed."

There's been some hard feelings here
About some words that were said
Been some hard feelings here
And what is more
There's been a bloody purple nose
And some bloody purple clothes
That were messing up the lobby floor
It's just apartment house rules
So all you 'partment fools
Remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor!
One man's ceiling is another man's floor


There's been some strange goin's on
And some folks have come and gone
Like the elevator man don't work no more
I heard a racket in the hall
And I thought I heard a call
But I never opened up my door
It's just apartment house sense
It's like apartment rents
Remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor!
One man's ceiling is another man's floor!


There's an alley
In the back of my building
Where some people congregate in shame
I was walking with my dog
And the night was black with smog
When I thought I heard somebody
Call my name

Ah-- remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor!
One man's ceiling is another man's floor!"

On the houses through the trees,

Paints a pattern on my wall,
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow Little room,
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom.
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me.

>From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death,
There are Patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath.
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies,
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies.

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell,
And it's fitting that it should,
For in darknesss I must dwell.
Like the color of my skin,
Or the day that I grow old,
My life is made of Patterns
That can scarcely be controlled."

His sneakers torn
In the hour when the homeless move their cardboard blankets
And the new day is born
Folded in his backpack pocket
The questions that he copied from his heart
Who am I in this lonely world?
And where will I make my bed tonight?
When twilight turns to dark

Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
Fools do
Fools and pilgrims all over the world

If you shop for love in a bargain store
And you don't get what you bargained for
Can you get your money back?
If an empty train in a railroad station
Calls you to it's destination
Can you choose another track?
Will I wake up from these violent dreams
With my hair as white as the morning moon?

Questions for the angels

I do
Fools and pilgrims all over the world

Downtown Brooklyn
The pilgrim is passing a billboard
That catches his eye
It's Jay-Z
He's got a kid on each knee
He's wearing clothes that he wants us to try

If every human on the planet and all the buildings on it
Should disappear
Would a zebra grazing in the African Savannah
Care enough to she'd one zebra tear?

Marries all beginnings and conclusions

And when they say
That you're not good enough

You're hot
But who are they
Or what is it
That eats at what you've got
With the hunger of ambition
For the change inside the purse

Ooh-ooh-oo-ooh-ooh-oo
Ooh-woo-oo-oo
Baby, baby, baby
Be my special one
I seen you move in from across the street
I like the way you walk
I love the way you run
Baby, baby
No more baby talk
Papi, this ain't mayaguez
This is the island of nueva york
We'll go through the projects
Make-out on the roofs
And count the stars like silver studs on
My...
Motorcycle boots
Tengan cuidado con ese tipo
Ay verdad te digo, ese tipo es tan sucio
Isucio!
You wasting your time, they don't know what! Do
You little ghetto weeds... I feel like killing you
Banana-colored light-skinned spies
You feel your peel so fine?
I'm hernandez, the umbrella man
Your future's locked in mine
The chaplains and the golden guineas
The red wings and the crowns
The mighty mau maus
Those shines from brooklyn
They want to cut the vampires down
The savage skulls, the fordham baldies
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio, now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this
I think we got something to talk about
You're a coolie from the turf
That's cool, but you don't get no respect around
Here unless you belong to a bopping gang...
I mean, you either belong or you get hurt
Or you could buy some protection from me
Because if someone's got to die
To pay for the shit they done
I believe in an eye for an eye
What you believe in, salvador agron?
Mr. Agron? Senor agron?
I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I believe he watches over us all
Don't tear apart
This satin summer night"
Paul Simon,Save The Life Of My Child,/p/paul+simon/save+the+life+of+my+child_20332992.html,"""Good God! Don't jump!"" 
 A boy sat on the ledge 
 An old man who had fainted was revived 
 And everyone agreed 'twould be a miracle indeed 
 If the boy survived 

 ""Save the life of my child!"" 
 Cried the desperate mother 

 The woman from the supermarket 
 Ran to call the cops 
 ""He must be high on something"" someone said 
 Though it never made The New York Times 
 In The Daily News, the caption read 

 ""Save the life of my child!"" 
 Cried the desperate mother 

 (Hello darkness, my old friend 
 I've come to talk with you again) 

 A patrol car passing by 
 Halted to a stop 
 Said officer MacDougal in dismay: 
 ""The force can't do a decent job 
 'Cause the kids got no respect 
 For the law today (and blah blah blah)"" 

 ""Save the life of my child!"" 
 Cried the desperate mother 

 ""Oh what's becoming of the children?"" 
 People asking each other 

 When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd 
 And it made them wild 
 In an atmosphere of freaky holiday 
 When the spotlight hit the boy 
 And the crowd began to cheer 
 He flew away 

 ""Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place"""

Parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt

(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Parsely, sage, rosemary & thyme
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
Without no seams nor needlework
(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land

(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsely, sage, rosemary, & thyme
(Washed is the ground with so many tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather

(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsely, sage, rosemary & thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Inside my crowded face
I have a friend who is a born-again
Found his savior's grace
I was born before my father
And my children before me
We are born and born again
Like the waves of the sea
That's the way it's always been
And that's how I want it to be

Nothing but good news
There is a frog in south america
Whose venom is a cure
For all the suffering that mankind
Must endure
More powerful than morphine
And soothing as the rain
A frog in south america
Has the antidote for pain

Some people never complain
Some folks have no idea
And others will never explain

That's the way it's always been
That's the way I like it
And that's how I want it to be

If I could play all the memories
In the neck of my guitar
I'd write a song called
""Senorita with a necklace of tears""
And every tear a sin I'd committed
Oh these many years
That's who I was
That's the way it's always been

Some people always want more
Some people are what they lack
Some folks open a door
Walk away and never look back
I don't want to be a judge
And I don't want to be a jury
I know who I am
Lord knows who I will be
That's the way it's always been
That's the way I like it
And that's how I want it to be
That's the way it's always been

It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on

But feel the bite
Whenever you believe that
You'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends
And the song ends
She moves on

I know the reason I
Feel so blessed
My heart still splashes
Inside my chest, but she
She is like a top
She cannot stop
She moves on

A sympathetic stranger
Lights a candle in the middle of the night
Her voice cracks
She jumps back
But she moves on

She says ''ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discover''

The I fall to my knees
Shake a rattle at the skies
I'm afraid that I'll be taken
Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes

She can't sleep now
The moon is red
She fights a fever
She burns in bed
She needs to talk so
We take a walk
Down in the maroon light

She says ''maybe these emotions are
As near to love as love will ever be''
So I agree

Then the moon breaks
She takes the corner that's all she takes
She moves on

She says ''ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discover''

Then I fall to my knees
I grow weak, I go slack
As if she captured the breath of my
Voice in a bottle
And I can't catch it back

But I feel good
It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on"

Watching jerusalem
Make her bed of stones
Silent eyes
No one will comfort her

Weeps alone

She is sorrow, sorrow
She burns like a flame
And she calls my name

Burning in the desert sun
Halfway to jerusalem
And we shall all be called as witnesses
Each and ev'ryone
To stand before the eyes of god
And speak what was done"

The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said delores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a fa-ther
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

Slip slidin' away

The more you're slip slidin' away

When the fever runs high

And I was in crazy motion
'til you calmed me down
It took a little time

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
And the last one to know

When something goes right
Well it's likely to lose me, mm
It's apt to confuse me
It's such an unusual sight
Oh, I can't, I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

They've got a wall in china
It's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners they made it strong
And I've got a wall around me
That you can't even see

To get next to me

And gravity leaps like a knife off the pavement
And you want to write a song about the moon
You want to write a spiritual tune
Then nah nah nah

Song about about the moon
If you want to write a song about the heart
Think about the moon before you start
Because the heart will howl
Like a dog in the moonlight
And the heart can explode
Like a pistol on a june night
So if you want to write a song about the heart
And it's ever-longing for a counterpart
Write a song about the moon

He laughed so hard
He fell down from his place
The laughing girl
She laughed so hard
The tears rolled down her face

If you want to write a song about
A face
Think about a photograph
That you really can't remember
But you can't erase
Wash your hands in dreams and lightning
Cut off your hair
And whatever is frightening

About a face
If you want to write a song about
The human race
Write a song about the moon

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"

To the brujo's door
Along a path of river stone

Seated on the floor

A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall

Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy - heal her
Heaven's only daughter

My feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew
Then the sweetness in the air
Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo

And I ain't no fool for love songs

Crapped out, yawning
Longing my life a--way

Salvador, the afternoon sunlight is folding around us,
The dishes are done,
The buildings here, tall as our mountains
Slice through the windows and cut off the sun.
On such days I find I am longing for puerto rico
Though I never would return 'til you are free
But when I hear the aguinaldo my heart's a little lighter
And we dance together aurea and me
In my life I've been unlucky with two husbands
Gumersindo liked his rum and women friends
Then that hypocrite who beat you and preached about repentance
Has gone, and so another sunday ends
And tomorrow is another hard working monday
I'm still hoping for the raise they promised me
There's a job as operator
I would not have to wait for
If I could speak the language easily
But I tell aurea:
The barrio's boundaries are our own little nation
Sometimes I hear you run upstairs
And I view my light with resignation
Keep your Bible near you
Time is an ocean of endless tears.

Rest my head upon that shore
And when I wear that starry crown
I won't be wanting anymore

You can jingle to the beat of the jelly roll

Paul Simon,Tenderness,/p/paul+simon/tenderness_20105968.html,"Words & music by paul simon

What can I do
What can I do
Much of what you say is true
I know you see through me
But there's no tenderness
Beneath your honesty

Oh, right and wrong
Right and wrong
Ooh, never helped us get along
You say you care for me
But there's no tenderness
Beneath your honesty

You and me were such good friends
What's your hurry?
You and me could make amends
I'm not worried
I'm not worried
Oh, honesty,
Oh, honesty
Ooh, it's such a waste of energy
No you don't have to lie to me
Just give me some tenderness
Beneath your honesty
You don't have to lie to me
Just give me some tenderness"

Bravely fighting the battle of time
Is a dear one who's weathered my sorrows
'Tis that silver haired daddy of mine

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I'd give all I own if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine

Oh, I know it's too late, dear old daddy
To repay all those sorrows and cares
Though dear mother is waiting in heaven
Just to comfort and solace you there

If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair

Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great
I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state
Well, I'm standing on the corner of lafayette
State of louisiana
Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those cajun girls
Dancing to zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck
If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

Well, I'm standing on the corner of lafayette
State of louisiana
Wondering where a city boy could go
To get her in a conversation
Drink a little red wine
Dance to the music of clifton chenier
The king of the bayou

Well, that was your mother
And that was your father
Before you was born dude
When life was great
You are the burden of my generation
I sure do love you
But let's get that straight

Well, I'm standing on the corner of lafayette
Arcoss the street from the public
Heading down to the lone star cafe
Maybe get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Standing in the shadow of clifton chenier
Dancing the night away"
Paul Simon,That's Me,/p/paul+simon/thats+me_20559738.html,"Well I'll just skip the boring parts chapters one, two , three and get to the place where you can read my face and my biography.
Here I am, I'm eleven months old, dangling from my daddy's knee. There I go, it's my graduation, I'm picking up a bogus degree. That's me. Early me. That's me.
Well I never cared much for money, and money never cared for me. I was more like a land-locked sailor, searching for the emerald sea. Just searching for the emerald sea, boys, searching for the sea.
Oh my God. First love opens like flower. A black bear running through the forest light holds me in her sight and her power. But tricky skies, your eyes are true, the future is beauty and sorrow. Still, I wish that we could run away and live the life we used to. If just for tonight and tomorrow.
I am walking up the face of the mountain. Counting every step I climb. Remembering the names of the constellations. Forgotten is a long, long time. That's me. I'm in the valley of twilight. Now I'm on the continental shelf. That's me-I'm answering a question I am asking of myself."

Somewhere in a burst of glory
Sound becomes a song
I'm bound to tell a story
That's where I belong

When I see you smiling
When I hear you singing
Lavender and roses
Every ending a beginning

The way you turn
And catch me with your eye
Ay ay ay
That's where I belong

When I see you smiling
When I hear you singing
Lavender and roses
Every ending a beginning

That's the way it is
I don't know why
Ay ay ay
But that's where I belong

A spiny little island man
Plays a jingling banjo
He's walking down a dirt road
Carrying his radio
To a river where the water meets the sky
Ay ay ay
That's where I belong"

She said bye-bye baby, bye-bye
I said ""where you goin'? ""
""i'm just born""
She said I'll only be gone for a while
My mother loved to leave in style
And that's why God made the movies

So I laid around in my swaddling clothes
Until the doctor came and turned out the light
Then I packed my bag
And my nametag
And stole away into the night
Hopeing things would work out alright
That's why God made the movies

Say you will, say you will
Say you'll take me to your loving breast
Say you'll nourish me with your tenderness
The way the ladies sometimes do
Say you won't, say you won't
Say you won't leave me for no other man
Say you'll love me for the way I am
Say you will, say you will

When I was born my mother died
She said bye-bye baby, bye-bye
And since that day
I've made my way
The notorious boy of the wild
Adopted by wolves when he was a child
That's why god. That's why god.
That's why God made the movies"

Just kicking down the cobble stones.

Hello lamppost, What cha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing.
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo, Feelin' groovy.

Just to usher me in
Then a voice from above sugarcoated with love
Said, ""Let us begin""

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

Okay, new kid in school
Got to follow the rule
You got to learn the routine
Whoa! There's a girl over there
With the sunshiny hair like a homecoming queen
I said ""Hey, what'cha say, it's a glorious day
By the way, how long you been dead? ""
Maybe you, maybe me, maybe baby makes three
But she just shook her head

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

Buddha and Moses and all the noses
From narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line
Just to glimpse the divine
What'cha think about that?
Well, it seems like our fate
To suffer and wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all His design
No one cuts in the line
No one here likes a sneak

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

After you climb up the ladder of time
The Lord God is near
Face-to-face in the vastness of space
Your words disappear
And you feel like you're swimming in an ocean of love
And the current is strong
But all that remains when you try to explain
Is a fragment of song
Lord, is it Be Bop a Lula? Or ooh Papa Doo?
Lord, Be Bop a Lula? Or ooh Papa Doo?
Be Bop a Lula"

Do people have a tendency to dump on you?
Does your group have more cavities than theirs?
Do all the hippies seem to get the jump on you?
Do you sleep alone when others sleep in pairs?
Well there's no need to complain
We'll eliminate your pain
We can neutralize your brain
You'll feel just fine
Now
Buy a big bright green pleasure machine!

Do figures of authority just shoot you down?
Is life within the business world a drag?
Did your boss just mention that you'd better shop around
To find yourself a more productive bag?
Are you worried and distressed?
Can't seem to get no rest?
Put our product to the test
You'll feel just fine
Now
Buy a big bright green pleasure machine!

You'd better hurry up and order one
Our limited supply is very nearly gone

Do you nervously await the blows of cruel fate?
Do your checks bounce higher than a rubber ball?
Are you worried 'cause your girlfriend's just a little late?
Are you looking for a way to chuck it all?
We can end your daily strife
At a reasonable price
You've seen it advertised in Life
You'll feel just fine

Buy a big bright green pleasure machine!"
Paul Simon,The Boxer,/p/paul+simon/the+boxer_20105976.html,"I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest (hmmmm.... Mmmm......)

When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers.....
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

(Li la li... Li la la la li la li)
(Li la li... Li la la la li la li)
(La la la la li...)

Seeking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job, but I get no offers.....
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there (li la la, la, la la)

Now the years are rolling by me, they are rockin' even me
I am older than I once was, and younger than I'll be, that's not unusual
No it isn't strange, after changes upon changes, we are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same...

(Li la li... Li la la la li la li)
(Li la li... Li la la la li la li)
(La la la la li...)

And I'm laying out my winter clothes, wishing I was gone, goin' home
Where the New York city winters aren't bleedin' me, leadin' me to go home

In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminder of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains
Yes, he still remains...

(Li la li... Li la la la li la li)

And the sun was beating
On the soldiers by the side of the road
There was a bright light
A shattering of shop windows
The bomb in the baby carriage
Was wired to the radio
These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry
Don't cry

It was a dry wind
And it swept across the desert
And it curled into the circle of birth
And the dead sand
Falling on the children
The mothers and the fathers
And the automatic earth
These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry
Don't cry

It's a turn-around jump shot
It's everybody jump start
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Medicine is magical and magical is art
The boy in the bubble
And the baby with the baboon heart

And I believe
These are the days of lasers in the jungle
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
Staccato signals of constant information
A loose affiliation of millionaires
And billionaires and baby
These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky

When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight
That settles over washington
A trip to the market
A trip around the world
Where the evening meal
Is negotiable, if there is one.

The early morning sunlight
In the harbor church of st. cecilia
To praise a soul's returning to the earth
To the rose of jericho and the bougainvillea

Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean

Yes boss. the government handshake
Yes boss. the crusher of language
Yes boss. mr. stillwater,
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river

I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side

Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of god
The memory of god

And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run


Who says: hard times?
I'm used to them
The speeding planet burns
I'm used to that
My life's so common it disappears
And sometimes even music
Cannot substitute for tears"

As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room.
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference,
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In The Dangling Conversation
And the superficial sighs,
The borders of our lives.

And you read your Emily Dickinson,
And I my Robert Frost,
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost.
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm,
Couplets out of rhyme,
In syncopated time
And The Dangling Conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives.

Yes we speak of things that matter,
With words that must be said,
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow,
I cannot feel your hand,
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in The Dangling Conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives."

They will stare unbelieving
At the Last Unicorn
When the first breath of winter
Throught the flowers is icing
And you look to the north
And a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying
And would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear her laughter
It's the Last Unicorn
I'm alive....... I'm alive
When the last moon is cast
Over the last star of morning
And the future has past
Without even a last desparate warning
Then look into the sky where through
The cloudes a path is formed
Look and see her how she sparkles
It's the Last Unicorn
I'm alive... I'm alive."

Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair

Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death
Death comes in a blinding flash
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash

Whose words were like the tablets of stone
Because it's easier to learn than unlearn
Because we've passed the point of no return
Gather your goods and follow me

Verse:

I was only a child of the city
My parents were children of immigrant stock
So we followed as followers go
Over a mountain with a napkin of snow
And ate the berries and roots
That grow along the timberline
Deeper and deeper the dreamer of love sleeps on a quilt of stars


Bridge:
It's cold
Sometimes you can't catch your breath
It's cold

Verse:
Time and abundance thickened his step
So the teacher divided in two
One half ate the forests and fields
The other half sucked all the moisture from the clouds
And we, we were amazed at the power of his appetite
Deeper and deeper the dreamer of love sleeps on a quilt of stars

Sometimes we don't know who we are
Sometimes force overpowers us and we cry

Carry me home my teacher

Carry me home my teacher

 If your time to you is worth savin' 
 Then you better start swimmin' 
 Or you'll sink like a stone 
 For the times they are a-changin' 

 Come writers and critics 
 Who prophesize with your pen 
 And keep your eyes wide 
 The chance won't come again 
 And don't speak too soon 
 For the wheel's still in spin 
 And there's no tellin' who that it's namin' 
 'Cause the loser now 
 Will be later to win 
 For the times they are a-changin' 

 Come senators, congressmen 
 Please heed the call 
 Don't stand in the doorways 
 Don't block up the hall 
 For he that gets hurt 
 Will be he that has stalled 
 The battle outside ragin' 
 Will soon shake your windows 
 And rattle your walls 
 For the times they are a-changin' 

 Come mothers and fathers 
 All over the land 
 And don't criticize 
 What you can't understand 
 Your sons and your daughters 
 Are beyond your command 
 Your old road is rapidly agin' 
 Please get out of the new one 
 If you can't lend your hand 
 For the times they are a-changin' 

 The line it is drawn 
 The curse it is cast 
 The slow one now 
 Will later be fast 
 And the present now 
 Will later be past 
 The order is rapidly fadin' 
 The first one now 
 Will later be last 
 For the times they are a-changin' 
 For the times they are a-changin'"

My cab fare
My new shoes?
I got expenses, you know

Count Dracula's castle

Made in the shade, use my umbrella
Black like the night we fly in

To sell the Irish some weed
So this paddy boy's mother on the stoop
Starts bitching
About spics is a mongrel breed

Floating in beer
He says
Fucking Puerto Rican dope-dealing punk
Get your shit-brown ass out of here

Get your shit-brown ass out of here

Fractured his collar bone

The usual productions, and it all goes to the wealthy

And loot some for the old folks who can't loot for themselves

Well it's a short walk
In a sweet breeze

I will need you, feed you, seed you, plead with you
All for the taste of your sweet love thelma
If a heart is an open memory book
That was the chance I took
The more I searched, the more shook with thelma
Last night I slept on a rented pillow
A silver moon above my head
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me
And I reached for the phone
By the side of the bed

Now the first time that I saw you I thought
""she's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught""
People aware of my history
Trying to steer you away from me
I left a message at your hotel
Don't let management poison the well

I will need you, feed you, seed you, plead with you
All for the taste of your sweet love thelma

The phone is ringing and I realize
We are timezones and oceans apart
The words I speak in the middle of my night
They fall on your yesterday scars

If the sun don't shine, the wind don't break
The clock don't jump off the wall
Thelma, my darling, I will cushion your fall
I will need you, feed you, seed you, plead with you
Without the taste of your sweet love thelma

I am only a man who has skirted the edge of despair
For a long time now, and I don't care

The baby curled up in a ball
Winter sunlight hits the family tree
And everything else becomes nothing at all"

I speak to you in jesus's name
As Jesus speaks through me
The evil we do can't be blamed upon our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death-row to
The shore
I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior
My salvador!
It took me four years to learn
I was in prison not in church
And two more to begin the book of my soul's search
Time is an ocean of endless tears
A wild boy from the streets of el barrio
An orphan from the hills of mayaguez
And when I wrote my story
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage
Time is an ocean of endless tears
Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write i'll be transferred far away
I'm leaving greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the latin population will soon be minus one
Time is an ocean of endless tears
I know how hard it's been for you these many years
You say the agulnaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at et malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son

[Verse 2: Reuben Blades]
The politics of prison are a mirror of the street
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state
Correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
The politics of race
A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white
If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write
You were a child of sixteen
With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and battered
By the streets I left behind
I'll take the evil in me
And turn it into good
Though all your institutions
Never thought I could
So now i'll turn to say goodbye
I'll keep your image in my eye
I turn around to say goodbye
I'll keep your image with me till the day I die
Time is an ocean of endless tears"

A passenger traveling quietly conceals
Himself
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow
Over the crest of the mountain the moon
Begins its climb
And he wakes to find he's in rolling
Farmland

The farmer sleeps against his wife
He wonders what their life must be
A Trailways bus is heading south
Into Washington, D. C.

A mother and child, the baby maybe two months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding.
The shadow of the Capitol dome slides across his face
And his heart is racing with the urge to freedom.

The father motionless as stone,
A shepherd resting with his flock,
The Trailways bus is turning west-
Dallas via Little Rock.

The desert moon is my witness.
I've no money to come East,
But I know you'll soon be here

Lazarus
We pull into downtown Dallas by the side of
The Grassy Knoll
Where the leader fell and a town was broken.
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken

The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus

Border patrolman
Any aliens here? You better check with us,
How about you son?
You look like you got Spanish blood.
Do you 'Habla Ingles, ' am I understood?

Sal
Yes, I am an alien, from Mars.
I come to earth from outer space.
And if I traveled my whole life
You guys would still be on my case
You guys would still be on my case

But he can't leave his fears behind,
He recalls each fatal thrust
The screams carried by the wind,
Phantom figures in the dust
Phantom figures in the dust
Phantom figures in the dust.

She was married to someone

He was old, he was young
From time to time he'd tip his heart
But each time she withdrew
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
Well eventually the boy and the girl get married
Sure enough they have a son
And though they both were occupied
With the child she carried
Disagreements had begun
And in a while they fell apart
It wasn't hard to do
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
Two disappointed believers
Two people playing the game
Negotiations and love songs
Are often mistaken for one and the same
Now the man and the woman
Remain in contact
Let us say it's for the child
With disagreements about the meaning
Of a marriage contract
Conversations hard and wild
But from time to time
He makes her laugh
She cooks a meal or two
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true
What is the point of this story
What information pertains
The thought that life could be better
Is woven indelibly
Into our hearts
And our brains"

After the dream of falling and calling your name out
These are the roots of rhythm
And the roots of rhythm remain

In early memory
Mission music
Was ringing 'round my nursery door
I said take this child, Lord
From Tucson, Arizona
Give her the wings to fly through harmony
And she won't bother you no more

This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
After the dream of falling and calling your name out

Appeals for love or loves release, in private invocations.

But all that is changed now,
Gone like a memory from the day before the fires.
People hungry for the voice of God
Hear lunatics and liars

Wartime prayers, wartime prayers
In every language spoken,
For every family scattered and broken.

Because you cannot walk with the holy,
If you're just a halfway decent man.
But I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind
With a genious marketing plan.

I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,
Even a little drop would do.
I want to rid my heart of envy
And cleanse my soul of rage
Before I feel.

Times are hard, hard times,
But everybody knows all about hard times.
The thing is, what are you gonna do?
Will you cry?
And try to muscle through?
And try to rearrange your stuff?
But when the wounds are deep enough,
And it's all that we can bear,
We wrap ourselves in prayer.

Because you cannot walk with the holy,
If you're just a halfway decent man.
But I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind
With a genious marketing plan.
I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,
Even a little drop would do.
I want to rid my heart of envy
And cleanse my soul of rage
Before I'm through.

A mother murmurs in twilight sleep
And draws her babies closer.
With hush-a-bies for sleepy eyes,
And kisses on the shoulder.
To drive away despair
She sends a wartime prayer."

 Oh, what have I done; why have I done it 
 I've committed a crime, I've broken the law 
 For twenty-five dollars and pieces of silver

Four times four is forty-four

Can put your mind at ease
We've got numbers by the trillions
Here and overseas

Look at the stink about japan
All those numbers waiting patiently
Don't you understand?
Don't you understand?
So wrap me
Wrap me
Wrap me do
In the shelter of your arms

I will love innumerably
You can count on my word

The three turns into two

How I wonder where you are

High above the clouds - high

Like a diamond In the sky

Pool halls in the afternoons

Translators playing elvis tunes

Sunday morning out playing stickball

Written on the subway wall

Written on the subway well

Makin' out at matinees

We slowly went our separate ways

Friday night dance at Bronx Park Hell

Written on the subway wall

Written on the subway well

Girl you can't go back

No you can't go back

Girl I'm stayin' here with you"

He says, Why am I soft in the middle now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard!
I need a photo-opportunity,
I want a shot at redemption!
Don't want to end up a cartoon,
In a cartoon graveyard.....

Bonedigger, Bonedigger,
Dogs in the moonlight.
Far away, my well-lit door.
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly,
Get these mutts away from me!
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore....

If you'll be my bodyguard,
I can be your long lost pal!
I can call you Betty,
And Betty, when you call me,
You can call me Al!

A man walks down the street,
He says, Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention,
And whoa, my nights are so long!
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role-model?
Now that my role-model is....
Gone...... Gone,
He ducked back down the alley,
With some roly-poly, little bat-faced girl.
All along.... Along....
There were incidents and accidents,
There were hints and allegations.....

If you'll be my bodyguard,
I can be your long lost pal!
I can call you Betty,
And Betty, when you call me,
You can call me Al!
Call me Al......

A man walks down the street,
It's a street in a strange world.
Maybe it's the Third World.
Maybe it's his first time around.
He doesn't speak the language,
He holds no currency.
He is a foreign man,
He is surrounded by the sound, sound....
Cattle in the marketplace.
Scatterlings and orphanages.
He looks around, around.....
He sees angels in the architecture,
Spinning in infinity,
He says, Amen! And Hallelujah!

If you'll be my bodyguard,
I can be your long lost pal!
I can call you Betty,
And Betty, when you call me,
You can call me Al!
You can call me Al......"

When I was on the wall
You're kind, so kind, so kind

You're so good
You introduced me to your neighborhood
Seems like I ain't never had
So many friends before
That's because you're good
You're so good
Why you don't treat me like
The other humans do
Is just a mystery to me
It gets me agitated when I think that
You're gonna love me now indefinitely


So goodbye, goodbye
I'm gonna leave you now
And here's the reason why

I like to sleep with the window open
And you keep the window closed

For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems I'm always that little too late
All of my life

Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay
Set 'em up, cos I'm going nowhere
There's too much I need to remember, too much I need to say

All of my life, I've been looking
But it's hard to find the way
Reaching past the goal in front of me
While what's important just slips away
It doesn't come back but I'll be looking
All of my life

Set 'em up...

That I didn't do all I could
Making records upstairs, while he watched tv
I didn't spend the time I should
It's a memory I will live with

By your side
Give me the strength, so I can help you
And I can be strong now, they don't frighten me

The sun is hotter than before
But inside it's cold, I wonder why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Well I believe we can make it right

It's time now
To show our feelings
Looking through you
Your heart's empty
Whatever happened to you, you can't change it,
Nowhere to run to, please, oh please don't let me down

But wait a minute I don't understand
It's getting stronger, hold my hand
Don't want to leave you I don't want to go

I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here

Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

We always need to hear both sides of the story

Both sides of the story

A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says ""looks like it's just us from now on""

We always need to hear both sides of the story

We need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
'til you hear both sides
No no no nooooo

Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

We always need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
'til you see both sides
No no no no no no

White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall
He says ""would you respect me if I didn't have this gun
Cause without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one""

We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story
Yes, both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story

Both sides of the story
Both sides, both sides of the story

Fighting for food
Holding their heads
Breaking their bread with a stone

Watching the sun
Shielding their eyes
Brushing the flies from their face

Tell me, who do you blame
Like a mirror you see yourself
These people each have a name

All around the township
Young men are dying
(of) hunger and thirst
The well has run dry
The tears from her eye feeds her son

Tell me...

You can say you're pulling back
We see the pictures everywhere
But what we don't see is what's
Going on behind the closed doors
And you don't seem to care

Do you expect me to believe you
How can you really think
You can take your horse down to the water
Hold a gun at his head
And make him drink

No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change

People living without rights
Without their dignity
How loud does one man have to shout
To earn his right to be free

You can keep your toy soldiers
To segregate the black and white
But when the dust settles
And the blood stops running
How do you sleep at night?

No matter what you say...

What makes you so high and mighty
What makes you so qualified
You can sit there and say
How many have their freedom
But how many more have died

You decide to sit in judgement
Trying to play God yourself
Someday soon the buck is gonna stop
Stop with you and noone else

Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light

Do you see the sun - it's a brand new day
Oh, the world's in your hands, now use it
What's past is past, don't turn around
Brush away the cobwebs of freedom

Now we're here, there's no turning back
You have each other
You have one voice

Hand in hand you can lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home

Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light"

Bin für dich hier, keine Angst

You made it look so easy
You did it, why do it, what was your point?
Laughing while you tease me

Oh, do you know and do you care?

I said I did, I shouldn't cos the magic will go
It happened once before
You'll see it, you'll steal it and take it away
And then come back for more
Don't say you weren't, you were cause I saw you myself
It's too late for your reason
You're lying, you're lying, you've done it this time
I'm sick of all the cheating

Oh, well do you know and do you care?

Cause I watch you
Oo every day I watch you pass me by
I'll get you
Yes in the end I'll get you
Just watch me try

Oh you make it hard to be hard but I'm trying my best
Cos down inside I'm burnin'

Yes we could try, like we tried before
But you keep on telling me those lies

Do you remember... ?

There seemed no way to make up
Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget

You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go.

Do you remember... ?

Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
Cause they just can't wait
To get hurt again

Do you remember... ?

There are things we won't recall
Feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
Cos we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But ""I love you"" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late

Where reality slips from view
They say that we can't take it
I think I can, can you?

Don't get me started on blood and thunder
With people flying blind
Not caring what or who they take with them
Or what they leave behind
It's one mans God against another
While the river of tears roll by
The things they do in the name of their father
Can someone tell me why

Don't hold me down, I'm on my way

A un lugar asi soaba con ir.

Que me gusta cada instante aqui
Con el sol mas brillante mis pasos doy
No hacia falta la risa en mi.
Y es lo mas importante volvernos a ver
No me importa donde tenga que ir
Mil historias hay que oir y van a ser las que quiero compartir.
Tu diles que me siento bien con tanto que ver y vivir
Con la luna sobre mi duermo en un eden
Nada mas se podria pedir
Ni la lluvia caer me va a cambiar
El sol siempre vuelve salir
Y sentir el viento sobre tu piel te va a encantar.
Sigo mi camino, mi destino, es mi camino...
Whistlering.....
Que sepa el mundo en marcha estoy
Y voy a cumplir mi mision (voy a cumplir mi mision)
Los cielos azules por donde voy dan alas a mi corazon
Y que sepan todos que en marcha estoy
Que voy a volver a mojar
Con el sol mas brillante mi pasos doy
Disfruto el camino al andar.

I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by
And everyday I fall
It makes me wonder why,
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Cause every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as I may
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Watching you 'til all your work is done

When you find your heart, you'd better run with it

Don't look back
She may soon be gone, no don't look back
She's not the only one, remember that

If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
You don't know what to do?
Remember she is just as scared as you

Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway

Time may come, and time may go, I know
If you should call out for me, I'll go

The door will be open for you to...

So I called him up, asked him again and I waited a while -
He began to speak, then he started to cry

You know some things are best left unspoken
And some things just never work out
And sometimes, seems you try and you try and whatever you do
There's a fix that you're in, and you just can't get out
He said, ""I need your help, I need it now
Give me the strength to go on""

Though I didn't know what
I knew that something was wrong
But he still had his pride
He'd tell me in time
Well this feeling inside
Kept eating at me
I was losing a friend, and I had to know why

When I heard the voice on the phone, I knew it was bad news
So I rushed to be by his side
And we said goodbye for the last time
I gently hugged him, and kissed him goodbye
He whispered, ""I need your help, I need it now
Give me the strength to go on. ""

We were always laughing
I just remember laughing, mama
We were always laughing

Oh I need your help, I need it now
Give me the strength to go on

Though as time goes by, and it all becomes clear
We can see the deceit, we see the lies
So I asked myself, over and over, and over again
What did they know? What did they hide?
Fools, leading the innocent blindly
Fools, turning away

And I know that
When I think of my friend with that look in his eyes
And if they told the truth, he might be here today
I need your help, I need it now
Just give me the strength to go on, on

I remember the laughing
We were always laughing

Oh no - it's just strength we need now
Just the strength to go on..."

Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains no more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall the time when
I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got a lot more than
Just my toys to lend

Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
And everyday can be my magic paradise
I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality
I'd rather see my world the way it used to be
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can 'cause I'm going back

I'm going back
Not just sitting, walking away
Yes, I'm going back
Going back to my youth
Come on, catch me 'cause I'm going back
I'm going back"

And revision not wholly with our eyes

Truly see you're around us
But when we look
Do we see with open minds?
Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
The key to understanding
Is to see through others' eyes
Find a way to help us
See from all sides
Truly see from all sides
Teach our children to look deeper than the surface
See the world through another's eyes
For to be blind me on yourself
Is to look but not see it
Knowing much is not enough to be wise
To see the wonder
In all we've been given
In a world that's not always as it seems
On the part that we choose
Turn every corner
Follow on, for another begins

But we can't make it on our own

The people there find it hard to relate
They don't know how it feels to be standing there on your own
Believe me, it's never too late
It's time to make a move, get up on your feet and shout

Stop, look down, everybody, do you see what's going on
Around you, stop...

Shout out, shout it out, shout loud
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud

There are pepple who give and there are people who take
But I believe it's gonna get better
Realise what a difference you make
And don't turn away, Hey! I'm talking to you!

So there's only the one solution
Stop and think what's going on
You can draw your own conclusions
But we won't make it on our own

Someone better tell the people up there
I think they ought to know
The bubble's just about to burst
Tell them they'd better beware
The word is on the street
Get up on your feet and shout

Stop, look down, everybody
Do you see what's going on
Around you, stop..."
Phil Collins,Hero,/p/phil+collins/hero_20108103.html,"Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me.

And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew - he just knew.

Shadows and shape mixed together at dawn
But by time you catch them simplicity's gone
And so we sort through the pieces
My friends and I
Searching through the darkness to find
The breaks in the sky.

And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew - he just knew.

And we wonder, yes we wonder
How do you make sense of this
When the hero kills the maiden
With his kiss - with his kiss.

Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me
- if it were that simple for me."

She's watching over you
Smoke hangs on the downtown skyline
Moon pushes through
But some people's on fire tonight
Wind rushing round their feet
Someone's gonna sleep well tonight
Word is on the street

So high flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly here tonight

It's a tribal thing we're seeing
War paint on the face
A question of territory, pride and space
People strutting and feathers flying
It's a sorry scene
Someone's sleeping well tonight
Word is on the street

So high flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly here tonight

Brother, my brother
Don't let me down again
Mother oh mother
Wipe away your tears again

High flying bird embraced him
Held him to her breast
Soft feathers brushed his face
Finally came to rest
Gently rocking him to and fro
He quietly went to sleep
Someone's found a place of peace tonight
Word is on the street
So high flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly away tonight

High flyer, high flyer
Fly high tonight
Fly angel, fly higher
Fly safe tonight"

We'll make the same mistakes
It's all the same
If we can give and take
Hold on, hold on, ooh
Hold on, hold on, ooh

Inside out, ooh you got me inside out
Oh inside out, oh inside out

All of my life I've been searching and hanging on
Turning a corner, never know what I'd find
But now I'm back again like I never went away
Ooh let me in I'm through with wasting my time

Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now I know
She's got something you just can't trust
It's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

And though she will mess up your life,
You'll want her just the same, and now I know

Is calling to him now,
And though he hears him
He looks out to sea.
Somewhere out there lie his dreams
A story with no ending
And till he finds his answers
He won't be going nowhere

For him, it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late

Quietly knocking on her door.
He patiently stands waiting,
And though she hears him
She sits steadfast in her chair.
Somewhere out there never seen
Her hopes and dreams lie waiting,
And till she finds an answer
She won't be going nowhere

For her, it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late

For everything we know that's certain
There is much we cannot see,
So we choose to close the curtain,
Never knowing what could have been

It's not too late, it's not too late, never too late

Slowly rocking the baby's bed
He strokes it's head and whispers
And though it hears him,
It keeps smiling and kicks it's feet
Somewhere out there is a life,
A lifetime made for living
So it holds on fast, it ain't going nowhere

For some it's not too late,
It's not too late
For some it's never too late
For some it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late"

Had the body of a man, and a trust of a child
He never meant to hurt anybody

But he broke some hearts along the way

Ooh, it's all over
Ooh, it's all done
Ooh, it's all over
Or, has it just begun?

All that he spoke came right from his heart
Though some had been hurt by the things he had said
Go walking in the long grass to find his peace
Sometimes it'd grow so tall he'd lose his way

Dinner's not on the table, seems mother's not able,
She's staring at the tv.

You can smell it on his breath, feel it in his touch,
He never meant to hit her hard, but he's like that when he's had too much.

It's just another story 'bout going too far,
It's just another story 'bout going too far.

Well the kid's at school, she's getting good grades,
But the peer pressure's starting now - too bad, she had it made.

Seems there's always someone trying to push you to do something, you know, ain't the way they told you to -
It's hard to see
The things you taught her, how to be, it's like you told her nothing, selective memory.

Come on try it, it's just a smoke, ain't gonna kill you, so she takes a toke -
Fade to grey.

It's just another story 'bout going too far,
It's just another story 'bout going too far.

Well the guys at work seemed ok, they'd buy you a drink, get you laid, what's wrong with that?

Why'd they have more money than you, expensive cars, expensive clothes, d'you ever think of what they do?

At night they're out, shakin' people down, when they're walking together seems they own the town.

But hey, who's gonna talk, you are their alibi, don't turn around, don't ask questions, just walk -

It's just another story 'bout going too far,

I'm a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town
I know he's got me wrong

He was sleeping in the sunbeams on the old zoo floor.
I had gone to see the park where my papa used to play,
It's called called Villa Borghese and it's on the way
To East Africa.

Down on Grand Comoro Island, where I grew past four,
I could swim and fish and snorkel on the ocean floor,
And the wind laughed, and the wind laughed through the trees as if to say,
Here's a child who'll want the world to go his way
In East Africa, in East Africa.

Suddenly for me the world turned upside down -
Far from my friends the lions and the dolphins came this awful sound.

Dark shadows, sounds of thunder raging over me,
Came this monster called 'A-dre-no-leu-ko-dys-tro-phy'
Where's my East Africa?

Well they said, they said, they said (the ones who know it all)
They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall,
So I took my parents' hands, I lifted my head to say
I'll just have to be a hero, there's no other way!
Back to East Africa
Back to East Africa
Back to East Africa
Come with me I'm going back, going back to East Africa"

See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face

I try to understand, to make some sense.

I wonder if I had to, would I lie to save myself?
A plea of guilty, but self defence.

If I asked him nicely d'you think he'd show me how?
I'm sure he's out there listening, but he's too tied up right now to try

Try, all of my sins

Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
'Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen that night

Of my mother, and I remember when
I swore that, that would be the last they'd see of me

I thought about him everyday
What would I do if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

Whenever I think I know you better
Better than I know myself
I open up and give you everything
Then you say, O. K. What else
And when I run away you always cry
You always over react
But I don't know if you know how you really feel
But you better know before I get back

Cos only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Just try to remember
Now I'm the one you love
You told me, ooh try to remember
I'm the one you're always thinking of
You told me, please try to remember
Before I walk away
Remember
It's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday

Cos only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say, yes
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know..."
Phil Collins,Oughta Know By Now,/p/phil+collins/oughta+know+by+now_20107990.html,"You oughta know by now
That a man can't hold on forever,
So why do you keep waiting here
When you know it makes me want you more?

You oughta know by now
How it fells to be loved,
So why d'you keep me hanging here,
With this stone around my heart, dragging me down, down, down

When all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you, let me in, let me in.

You oughta know by now
Or maybe someone should show you
That a man needs to be loved
And even in this man's world
With you it don't come easy

You oughta know by now
That no man can sleep at night
With a burning in his heart
That would tear this man apart
Take me out of my misery,

'cos all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you, let me in, let me in.

You oughta know by now
Just how good it feels to be wanted,
And no man could love you more,
So why can't you show me something,
Just a little bit of something?

You oughta know by now
All the things a man has to do in his life,
And all these things I do
You know that I do it all for you, I do it all for you.

'Cos all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you,
Yes all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you.

Let me in, let me in,
Let me in your heart."
Phil Collins,Papa Was A Rolling Stone,/p/phil+collins/papa+was+a+rolling+stone_21190073.html,"It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone, 
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, 
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone

[Chorus]

Hey Momma!
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life
And Momma, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that Papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
Heard them talking Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time reaching
Dealing in debt, and stealing in the name of the law
Momma hung her head and said

[Chorus]

Hey Momma,
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills

Hey Momma,
Folks say Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

Please come out tonight I need you here
Its been a long, long time and I can't wait
Let's find out, let's see what it's like out there
If it rains we'll find somewhere, somewhere dry and warm

You'll say ""my, it's been a long, long time""
I'll say ""how are you? I've been fine""

Please come out tonight, let's go out and see the world
We can try to find, find somewhere
It seems so long ago, I can hardly remember the time
It's all I want, it's all I want, so let's see what we find

You'll say ""there's so much you need to know""
I'll say ""are you really sure you have to go?""

We don't need a reason, no explainations
Just stay with me here, tonight
I won't say a word
I just need you here

Please come out tonight, let's go out and find ourselves
You can lean your head on my shoulder, remember?

You'll say ""My, is that the time?""
I'll say ""why not stay with me tonight?""

We don't need a reason
It's so warm inside
There's no one between us
If someone comes we can hide
Just lay here beside me
Just see what it's like

Please come out tonight"

Cross the river, the river so wide,
If we can smother the pain that's inside us,
Deny the demons that wait bu our side,
We can find, find the light

Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon,
We share the comfort of the same stars.
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun,
That don't matter, can't you see what we are,
What we are, what we become?

Keep our sights on the way ahead,
Don't look back, it won't help us now.
The storm we left so far behind
Seems a dark memory that starts to fade,
But till we see the light we will not be safe.

We all sink or swin in the same ocean,
Break our skin and we will bleed
Our minutes pass with the same motion,
We face the same danger, we share the same needs,
We're all the same, you and me.

Keep our sights on the way ahead,
Don't look back, that won't help us now.
Upstream, the river gets too wide
So we must build that bridge right here,
Cause if we wait we will not reach the other side.
See under that clear blue sky
The winds of change are blowing hard and long,
And they'll not stop to rest cause the change is gonna come

Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon,
We share the comfort of the same stars.
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun,
That don't matter, can't you see what we are,
What we are, what we become?

Keep our sights on the way ahead,
Don't look back, it won't help us now.
Cause upstream the river gets too wide
And if we don't build that bridge right here, right now,
You know we'll never ever reach the other side"

All full of romance for someone that you'd met
And telling me how sorry you were
Leaving so soon
And that you'll miss me sometimes
When you're alone
Do I feel lonely too?
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on, holding on to time
Now we're living separate lives
Well I have learned to let you go
And if you lost your love for me
You never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living
Now we're living separate lives
Ooh, it's so difficult
Love leads to isolation
So you build that wall
You build that wall
Yes you build that wall
Oh yes, you build that wall
And you make it stronger
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might
I just might find myself looking in your eyes
But for now,
We'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now,
We'll go on living separate lives

Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

I want to run but there's no place to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
'Cause you've taking away all my reason for living
When you pushed aside all the love I been giving

Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I
Didn't I do the best for I could now didn't I 
So don't leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
It might come today, it might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now don't your conscience kind of bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I done for you
Now hold on a minute

Givin' you all the love I had no didn't I
When you needed me I was always there now wasn't I
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
'Cause I know cryin', it ain't gonna help me now
Now what did I do to cause all this grief
What did I say, to make you wanna leave
Now wait a minute

Gave my heart and soul to you now didn't I
And didn't I always treat you good now didn't I

Thinking your letters, I never received, had gone astray
You said you'd always be there for me

Now I don't know what I was thinking at all

But the least you can do is say you're sorry girl
Least you can do is give me back my heart

You won't find me standing outside your door
Least you can do is tell me why, tell me why

The least you can do is say you're sorry girl
Least you can do is give me back my heart

But I sure hope they write, just to let us know

And me, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But Spring'll soon be here,
Oh God I hope it's not late

Tried their hardest to make it a home

Hope my children'll try to make it their own

To carry me, come carry me away.

Shining down on you,
I'll be looking up from wherever I am

And don't speak too soon

Outside and it's ragin'

And rattle your walls

Throughout the land,
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command,
Your old road is rapidly agin',
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand

You'll see my heart is on my sleeve
And it'll be here waiting
Waiting for you, waiting for me

You can make things happen
Make things appear to be all that they seem
Tell me do you believe?

Together we'll find a way
Somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way

Because you know it's there
Soemwhere beneath the sky

There's no lesson learned
Yet some people pass it by

It could be different, you'll see how it could be,

Those who brought you here have flown
The road you take is full of hope or sadness
The choice you make will be your own

But you're not alone in there
Just say hello in there
Cos there are many just like you
They'll help you find someway
To make it all the way
They'll tell you all you have to do

No one can hide you from the storm
But from the shadows there will come the sunshine
A place to dry and keep you warm

Though no one tells you how
Your heart's beating faster now
Getting stronger day by day

Suddenly it's clear, what you seek is near
It's what you learn along the way

It's never where you think you'll find it

Phil Collins,Tommorrow Never Knows,/p/phil+collins/tommorrow+never+knows_20108010.html,"Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying.
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, oh it is shining.
That you may see the meaning of within
It is beginning, oh it is beginning.

That love is all and love is ev'ryone
It is knowing, oh it is knowing.
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, oh it is believing.
So play the game, existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning.

Of the beginning, of the beginning...


Somewhere over the rainbow

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time

Together forever till the end of time

My harbour lights are fading fast
Soon they'll disappear
Alone I sit in darkness
Hoping someone might come near
Though I wait, though I try
No one ever comes
And the feeling that I have flood over me
The river starts to run

We fly so close
We fly so close
Sometimes we fly too close

Every place you run to, everywhere you turn
There are places that you know you should not go
But some bridges just won't burn
All my life, though I try
I cannot change the past
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you
Make you realise at last

We fly so close
We fly so close
Sometimes we fly too close
We fly too close

My heart is racing much faster now
Life passes before my eyes
Something's I see, they make me smile
Something's they make me cry
So I look, so I try to find
A lesson I can learn
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind
And the ghosts I know return

You know we fly so close
We fly so close
Sometimes we fly too close
We fly too close

We fly so close, you and I sometimes
Sometimes we fly so close,
We'll never know how many times
We fly so close
We fly so close"

[Verse 1]
We said Goodbye to a dear old friend
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad
It's the Only Way
We said Hello as we turned The Key
A new roof over our heads
Gave a smile
It's the Only Way
Only way

[Chorus]
Turn your head
And don't look back
Set your sails for a new Horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there, oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Well it really don't matter much where you are
Cos home is in your Heart
It's a feeling that you wake with one day
Some people keep running all their Life
And still find they haven't gone too far
They don't see it's the feeling inside,
The feeling inside, oh

[Chorus]
Turn your head and don't look back
Just set your sails for a new Horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there

That familiarity sometimes makes you think of
It as almost normal, then suddenly something will happen... '

We stand, hang our heads disbelieving
Then not knowing how could such a thing be wrong
We wonder just what they must be thinking
To take a life of one so young

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How far must we go, to prove to you?

We wait and we wonder how this happened
Killing the old, the innocent, the young
While sons follow in fathers footsteps not understanding
That what they do could somehow be so wrong

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How far must we go, to prove to you?

So we will wait and we'll wonder

No regrets, no forgiveness, no compasssion
These brave heroes only know to hit and run
Slowly my sadness turns to rage and we wonder
How can these scars ever heal, when all is said and done

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon?
How many tears must fall to prove to you?
Please tell me, when will it be over now, how soon?
And how far must they go, to prove to you?

So we wait and we wonder"

When I grow up to be a man
Like my father was when I was young
I hope I can make him so proud of me
Proud enough to call me his son

What makes these people so different now
What makes these times so strange?
Seems most people got most everything they need
How come we see this change

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
When will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer

When I was a boy, did we have more respect?
This world seemed a nicer place to be
But time slowly passes and one day you look around
You hardly recognise what you see

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
Now when will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer

They're beyond our control

We're all sons of our fathers
Sometimes I feel like mine
And I can hear him say, the things I say
Seems all things come around in time

Why these things happen we'll never know
Guess that was then and this is now
We always knew that change was gonna come
But I want to go back, please tell me how

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
When will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer"
Phil Collins,Wear My Hat,/p/phil+collins/wear+my+hat_20107997.html,"She came looking for me with her arms open wide,
Like some long lost friend of mine.

She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me? '
I said 'No, I don't believe I do'
So she looked me up and down
And undressed me with her eyes,
Then she said 'You've got everything I need, you've got everything I want'

So I said 'ok,

You can wear my hat,
You can have my coat,
You can take my shirt
Cause I don't need it.
You can wear my shoes,
You can take my socks,
Come on take my bag it's yours

If you love it,
You can have it if you love it,
Ain't no problem if you love it,
Come on take it if you love it.

So her friend came up to me
With a pen and paper in her hand,
Expressing some interest in the number of my room,
She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me? '
I said 'No, ' she said 'Can I appeal to you? '

So I looked her up and down
And realising her insinuations I blushed
She said 'Listen babe you don't know me,
No you don't know me but you owe me,

And I love you,
Yes I love you,
Put your arms around me cause I love you,
I got all your records and I love you'

So I suggested

You can wear my hat,
You can have my coat,
You can take my shirt
Cause I don't need it.
You can wear my shoes,
You can take my socks,
Come on take my bag it's yours

If you love it,
You can have it if you love it,
Ain't no problem if you love it,
Come on take it if you love it.

Well later on that day this guy came to me
With a scrap of paper in his hand
He said 'Hey buddy can you sign your name for me? '
I said 'Why, do I owe you money? ' He said 'No'
I said 'Listen pal do I know you? Have we ever met?
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper?

He said 'i love you,
I don't know you but I love you,
Like my brother I love you,
Put your arms around me cause I love you'

I said 'Hey let's not rush things

You can wear my hat,
You can have my coat,
You can take my shirt
Cause I don't need it.
You can wear my shoes,
You can take my socks,
Come on take my bag it's yours

If you love it,
You can have it if you love it,
Ain't no problem if you love it,
Come on take it if you love it.

You can wear my hat,
You can wear my hat,
You can wear my hat,
Come on wear my hat. '"

She's saying the same things every morning before you leave her

You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind
You'd better look out, cos he's not far behind
You've been in love that little bit too long
You've been in love and I think that you know
You've been in love it's time to move on

Suddenly she's trying to please you, you start to think she's acting strange
And after all these years she wears make-up in the morning
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind
You'd better look out, cos he's not far behind

Did you really believe she's doing it all for you?
Oh, can't you see, there's somebody else
You never showed it, you should have known it

You've been in love, yeah you've been in love
You've been in love, yeah you've been in love

Going round singing all those love songs, songs you haven't heard for years
You're gonna have to ask her why she's so happy
You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind.
But it may be too late, and I know why

You've been in love that little bit too long

Pussycat's going to London
Looking for love and for fame
I wish somebody had told her
City folks ain't the same
Pussycat carries a postcard
Won't the big city be nice
That's the place with the action
She's gonna have her a slice

Pussycat, pussycat where have you been?
I've been to London, now I'm queen
Sitting pretty, I don't wear suits
And the mice all call me -
Puss'n boots

Pussycat laughs at the warnings
Where there's a will there's a way
I think you'd agree if you saw her
Rome's built in a day
Pussycat's read all the papers
Seen the movie and knows
All the streets lead to somewhere
And the pavement's gold

Although you know it's wrong
You must do it everyday
When the morning comes
Don't you turn around and say
It's bound to end in tears
So let's do it anyway

Pussycat wasn't a kitten
And not as dumb as they thought
She had a good head on her shoulders
And beauty that couldn't be bought
The royalty made her an offer
If she'd keep trouble at bay
They'd give her the money and diamonds
Be queen for a day"

That we wish we had not so many clothes
So let's loosen up with a playful tease
Like all lovers did through the centuries

We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you will you strip for me?
We're just following ancient history
If I strip for you will you strip for me?
Uh-huh-huh

When it gets so hot the end of the day
You may find your clothes getting in the way
If a pretty dress hides your true desire
Fold it nice and slow, throw it on the fire

We don't need to see what the butler saw
Or a mirrored room with a mirrored floor
All those sneaky looks gazing down on you
Are no substitute for our rendezvous

If you think it's cheap or a bit risque
Please don't say a word I'll just slip away
I am not a man who believes in lies
Like an octopus with big x-ray eyes

Don't freeze up girl, you're looking quite a sight
Be generous, I want it all tonight"

How could I ever forget

But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you or me

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Is against all the odds
And that's what I got to take

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now

I would rather be
Reading morning papers
Drinking morning tea.


She clutches the tray
And then we talk just like a kitchen sink play
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Living so close to danger
Even your friends are strangers
Don't count upon their company.


Places for the fingers
Places for the nails
Hidden in the kitchen
Right behind the scales.


What do I care
I'm wasting fingers like I have them to spare
Plugging holes in the zuider zee
Punishing paul for peter
Don't ever trust those meters
What you believe is what you see.


In my town, there is a raincoat under a tree
In the sky there is a cloud containing the sea
In the sea there is a whale without any eyes
In the whale is a man without his raincoat.


In another country
With another name
Maybe things are different
Maybe they're the same.


Back on the train
The seven soldiers read the papers again
But the news it doesn't change
Swinging about through the creepers
Parachutes caught on steeples
Heroes are born
But heroes die.


Just a few days
A little practice and some holiday pay
We're all sure
You'll make the grade
Mother of God if you care
We're on a train to nowhere
Please put a cross upon our eyes

To the raincoat in the sky

Nobody sees us alone out here among the stars
In these metal ways
In these metal days.


Through a fault of our designing
We are lost among the windings
Of these metal ways

With the purple sky behind us

A few good words, a hand to help you get through
May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
Lay down your weary head
Do whatever you gotta do

Put on your strong face when they're in the room
Can't show signs of weakness; an unspoken rule
Put on your strong face, act like nothing's wrong
We can be so helpless, helpless and so strong

May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
To ease your worried mind
Do something to get through

In a world where you never know

My friends say something's changed you
They said you're running with the wrong set
The girl is someone you should never have met
Let her go on her own, son
Everyon else has just come undone

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it
Everybody else is just hanging around
And me and my baby we're the talk of the town

The statue there in the town square
Seems to stare at me
Walking around with my head down
They say can't we make you see
Said son, you know we're really color blind
But everybody else seems to really mind
Lose her now, I think you'll find
Everything else will just fall in line

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it
Everyone else is just thinking out loud
And me and my baby we're the talk of the town

Surely not the last
Shouldn't throw stones out from your house of glass
Round here lots of crackers and cheese
Stay away from those my daddy said to me

Here I am back home, baby, I'm back home to stay.
I love you babe, never more will I go away.
I won't hurt you no more, baby, ain't gonna tell you no more lies.
No more running 'round, no more phony alibis.

She's waiting for another love.
She's waiting for another love.

Someone that she can show into her heart.

Your whole world's gonna fall apart.

When lights close their tired eyes.

To give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you darling soon,

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love.

I'm with you my love,
The light's shining through on you.
Yes, I'm with you my love,
It's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you darling now,
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up.

It's too bad I don't need you, because we get along so good.
It's too bad I don't need you, because we get along so good.
You must be thinking, 'bout this time, that my poor heart is made of wood.

It's too bad I don't miss you, 'cause you are always on my mind.

Yes
You'll be going loco down in Acapulco

The magic down there is so strong.

Feel the pressure
Your back's against the wall

Love is gainig on you
You're just about to fall.
If you're afraid to love
Afraid to take a chance

You better hide your feelings
Get out while you can.

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
...

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights

Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town.

'Cause you'll be going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
...

You'll be pulling out your hair
Drowning in despair

With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere.
Your search for paradise will come to an end

When you realize what a fool you've been.

You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace

Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night.
Was that the best part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go.
- Don't go
No! Don't go! Don't go! -

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights

'Cause you'll be going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long

Going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long

Walking down the street, kinda moving his feet,

The outlooks fine though wales might have some rain
Saved again.

Lets skip the news boy (Ill make some tea)
The arabs and the jews boy (too much for me)
They get me confused boy (puts me off to sleep)
And the thing I hate - oh lord!
Is staying up late, to watch some debate, on some nations fate.

Hypnotised by batman, tarzan, still surprised!
Youve won the west in time to be our guest
Name your prize!

Drop of wine, a glass of beer dear whats the time?
The grime on the tyne is mine all mine all mine
Five past nine.

Blood on the rooftops - venice in the spring
Streets of san francisco - a word from peking
The trouble was started - by a young errol flynn
Better in my day - oh lord!
For when we got bored, wed have a world war, happy but poor

So lets skip the news boy (Ill go make that tea)
Blood on the rooftops (too much for me)

Better start doing it right.

Youre halfway up and youre halfway down
And the pack on your back is turning you around.
Throw it away, you wont need it up there, and remember
You don't look back whatever you do.
Better start doing it right.

On your left and on your right
Crosses are green and crosses are blue
Your friends didn't make it through.
Out of the night and out of the dark
Into the fire and into the fight
Well that's the way the heroes go, ho! Ho! Ho!

Through a crack in mother earth,
Blazing hot, the molten rock
Spills out over the land.
And the lavas the lover who licks your boots away. Hey! Hey! Hey!
If you don't want to boil as well.
B-b-better start the dance
D-d-do you want to dance with me.

You better start doing it right.

The musics playing, the notes are right
Put your left foot first and move into the light.
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world
And if youre going to cross you better start doing it right
Better start doing it right.

I dont want to beat about the bush
But none of us are getting any younger.
Theres people out there who could take your place.
A more commercial view! a fresher face!

I need a shower, take a nap
Ill meet you in the bar, we must have a rap.
Theres a lot on the line, a lot to say.
Theres something I must tell you today.

You and I both know the score,
You cant go on like this forever.
So its with regret that I tell you now
That from this moment on,
Youre on your own!

I dont talk round corners, its right between the eyes
If youre slow theyll run past you,
Stand tall, see them falling over.
I walk a straight line, its right between the eyes.
Well show me the door, show me someone wholl do it better.

The drinks are on me, be my guest.
Smoke a cigar? take the best.
Dont hedge your bets, we can make a deal,
You got it in your pocket, how do you feel?

So glad thats over, now you know,
But Im only acting under orders.
And looking down on you from way up here.

Leaving my family behind me
Not knowing what lay ahead
Waving goodbye, as I left them in tears
Remembering all wed said

I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers
I asked him for guidance and strength
But the simple beliefs of a simple man
Lay in his hands, and on my head

I gave everything that they wanted
But still they wanted more
We sweat and we toiled
Good men lost their lives
I don't think they knew what for

I sold them my heart
I sold them my soul
I gave everything I had
Ah but they couldn't break my spirit
My dignity fought back,
Fightback
Can you hear me
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Don't you see

We worked in gangs for all we were worth
The young boys pulling the wagons
We were digging the tunnel, shifting the earth
It was then that it happened.

No-one knew how the cracks appeared
But as it fell they all disappeared
Stone fell like rain

Can you hear me,
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Can you breathe

The smoke cleared, the dust it settled
No one knew how many had died
All around there were broken men
Theyd said it was safe, theyd lied
You could hear the cries, you could smell the fear
But good fortune that day was mine
And it occurred to me the heart of a good man
It seems is hard to find.

Can you hear me,
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Don't you see

We worked, how we worked like
The devil for our pay
Through the wind, through the snow,
And through the rain

Blasting and cutting through gods country like a knife
Sweat stinging my eyes, there has to be a better life

Ah but I can hear my childrens cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Memories of those I've left behind
Still ringing in my ears
Will I ever go back again
Will I ever see her face again
Ill never forget that night
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We came from the north,
And we came from the south
With picks and with spades
And a new kind of order
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
Theyll never see the likes of us again

Driving the last spike,
Lifting and laying the track
With blistering hands,
The sun burning your back

Oh but I can hear my childrens cry
I can see the tears in their eyes
Memories of those I've left behind
Still ringing in my ears
Well Ill always remember that night,
As they waved goodbye to their fathers

We followed the rail, we slept under the stars
Digging in darkness, and living with danger
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead
Theyll never see the likes of us again

Can you hear me
Can you see
Don't you hear me
Don't you see"
Phil Collins,Duchess,/g/genesis/duchess_20058763.html,"Times were good,
She never thought about the future, she just did what she would
Oh but she really cared
About her music, it all seemed so important then,

And she dreamed that every time that she performed
Everyone would cry for more,
That all she had to do was step into the light,
And everyone would start to roar.

And on the road,
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,
She battled through
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.

But now everytime that she performed
Oh everybody cried for more,
Soon all she had to do was step into the light,
For everyone to start to roar.
And all the people cried, youre the one weve waited for.

Oh but time went by
It wasnt so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.
Yes times were hard,
Too much thinking bout the future and what people might want.

An then there was the time that she performed
When nobody called for more
And soon everytime she stepped into the light,
They really let her know the score.
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs
And everybody cried for more,
When all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar.
And all the people cried, youre the one weve waited for."

But now it's just another fading memory

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives
Remember

Like the story that we wish was never ending
We know sometime we must reach the final page
Still we carry on just pretending
That therell always be one more day to go

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives
So remember...

Another chance hello, another goodbye
And so many things well never see again
Days of life that seemed so unimportant
They seem to matter but to count much later on

Far away, away, fading distant lights
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world
And you know that these are the days of our lives

Though no eyes can see
The course laid down long before.
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen,
Though many times they've seen the way to leave.

He rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy,
To see reflected there
The trees, the sky, the lily fair,
The scene of death is lying just below.

The mountain cuts off the town from view,
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill.
Let it be revealed.
A waterfall, his madrigal.
An inland sea, his symphony.

Undinal songs
Urge the sailors on
Till lured by sirens cry.

Now as the river dissolves in sea,
So neptune has claimed another soul.
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen,
Until the shepherd leads his flock away.

The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change."

Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesnt't't feel quite right

Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Coming out the woodwork, thru the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sign and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Sit down sit down
Sit down sit down sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Cos living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Sit down sit down
Sit down sit down sit down sit down
As we relive out lives in what we tell you
Let us relive out lives in what we tell you

Sit down sit down sit down
Cos you wont get away
No with us you will stay
For the rest of your days - sit down

Would not hurt anybody, it sure fits in with my plan
Over the border, there lies the promised land

What will (can) you say?
What will you do?
Why cant you see?

You must have made up your mind
Is it worth the pain youre causing
To those youre leaving behind

What will you say?
What will you do?
Why cant you see?

I hardly know the reason
And I really feel no good at all

Just what hes been through.

Seems he met up with a gang of thieves,
Who mistook him for a man of means,
They locked him up then found he had no money,
So they let him go again.
Now hes back at home and happy
Just to see the kids.

I wish that I could really tell you
All the things that happened to me
And all that I have seen.
A world full of people their hearts full of joy,
Cities of light with no fear of war,
And thousands of creatures with happier lives,
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to hide.

Oh, keep it dark.

It seems strange to have to lie,
About a world so bright.
And tell instead a made-up story,
From the world of night.

Inciting riots, causing chaos, such a shame!

Slippin and sliding in the mud
Arms as long as creepers

That I think you ought to know
Obstruction, body checking, heavy tackles
So put on your hat and scarf
Have a drink, have a larf
From the terrace you can see your men do battle

Yes match of the days
The only way
You can spend your saturday

Dont forget, the trainers with their sponges
Managers with open cheques, liquid business lunches

Except when things werent going your way

Wandering around on her own.

The day you left
Well I think you knew youd not be back
Well at least it would seem that way
Because you never said goodbye.

I'm sure it will work out alright.

Of what might happen that night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last theyd see of me
And I never went home again

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes

He said:

Youre no son, you're no son of mine
Youre no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

Youre no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go,
And what should I do
Youre no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help, oh I came here for you

Well the years they passed so slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
Wed have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say that time is a healer

All around their heads?

Taking pot shots at the tourists?

Here we have an honest man
A civil servant to boot
He lived high up in the ministry
And when he wished to make a point
He knew just what to do
His window ledges were all covered in grease
I want them out of here

He said to me, I want them gone
Because you see - oh don't you see
None of us are getting any younger
Youve got to follow your nose
And if it tells you that youve got to go
Well that's because, theyre everywhere,
Theyre everywhere

So we called in those men, those horrible men
We set them to work on the rooftops
You see their van is very plain
And I know theyre too ashamed
To wear their by appointment badges anymore
Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill
I've often seen them with a gun

Dragons breathing fire, but friendly.
Mushrooms tall as houses.
Giant nymphs and goblins playing,
Scenes from a nights dream, poor little nemo!

Eating all kinds of food so close to bedtime
They always made him have these nightmares, it seemed.

Helped young washington in the garden,
Cut the cherry tree down.
Now we all know thats not history,
Scenes from a nights dream, poor little nemo!

Nemo, get out of bed!
Dont tell me stories, I dont want to know!
Come on you sleepy head, were waiting to go!

Once he went to the carnival of nations
Dancing with the princess through the night.

Found themselves on a moving platform
Ten ton weights above them,
Seeking audience with king morpheus.

I don't know how to stop

Got to get some sleep
I'm so nervous in the night
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop

Got to pick up the phone
I will call any number
I will talk to anyone
I know I'm gone too far
Much too far I gone this time
And I don't want to think what I've done
I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop

There are always hidden silences
Waiting behind the chair
They come out when the coast is clear
They eat anything that moves
I go shaky at the knees
Lights go out, stars come down
Like a swarm of bees

No self-control

You know I hate to hurt you
I hate to see your pain
But I don't know how to stop
No, I don't know how to stop

Street after street
Night after night
I walk on through the rain
I walk on through the rain
I don't know how to stop"
Phil Collins,Song For Martin,/r/ralph+mctell/song+for+martin_20274315.html,"Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Just because he looks all right
I've seen him look like this before
And if he says he wants to be alone
At least try to walk with him home
See if you can put your foot in the door

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Just because he looks all right
He's only gotta pick up the phone
Now one of them guys in the car will be around
And give him just enough on account
They know that he'll be back for more.

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through.

Now he's trying to show he's cool, but I know him
I ain't fooling
And because you love him he's bound to lie
When this time he's got so close
Now's the time to be scared the most
He's looking everywhere but in your eyes.

So don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through.

's endless coffee and cigarettes
Now don't take it hard when he says
He doesn't need you cos that's when he needs you most
He'll cry till he laughs and laugh till he weeps
And suddenly he'll fall asleep
Then you can let your own eyes close

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through
This time I think he's coming through."

'Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me?'

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice

Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice"

He said ""hey man, I know your name""
I seen you cruising with the low riders
Hanging out down on first street and main

Tuned into and listen to the hoodoo rhythm devils
Around the bay
They've got some crazy djs
Send you right out to heaven

Jimmy the weed for greed was taken aback
Johnny the fox you old sly cat
Cleverly the fox concealed his stash
Crisp dollar bills leave no tracks

In the back of a black cadillac
The voodoo music travels
Down skid row only black men can go
The shady deal unravels

Johnny the fox, hot to hustle
Jimmy the weed won't use no muscle
That cat's so sly, slick and subtle
Johnny the fox breaks out the bottle

Tuned into and listening to
The voodoo music travels
The beating drum for the lonely one
Sends you out to heaven"

How lonely could feel

In this wilderness of danger and beauty
Lived three brothers, bonded by love
Their hearts full of joy
They ask now for guidance
Reaching out to the skies up above

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain truly
Brothers all the same

Give us wisdom to pass to each other
Give us strength so we understand
That the things we do
The choices we make
Give direction to all life's plans

To look in wonder
At all we've been given
In a world that's not always as it seems
Every corner we turn
Only leads to another
A journey ends, but another begins

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same

Loosen up your suit and tie

Open up your heart and let me in

Stars on her pillow
Folding in the darkness
Begging for slumber

I'm not blind
I can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye

I'm not frantic
I can feel it coming
Violently shakes
My body

Her son's slanted
Always giving her
The sideways eye
An empty chair where Dad sits
How loud can silence get?
And Mom, she reassures
To contain him
But it's becoming a lie

She tells herself
And everyone else
Father is risking
His life for our freedoms

I'm not blind
I can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my childs eye

I'm not frantic
I can feel it coming

If you save yourself"

I lie still, you move
I send you off around the bend
I hold your head deep in my arms
My fingertips they close your eyes
Off you dream, my little child
There's a sun around the bend (yes)
There's a sun around the bend
All the evenings close like this
All these moments that I've missed
Please forgive me, won't you, dear?
Please forgive and let me share...
With you around the bend
You're an angel when you sleep
How I want your soul to keep
On and on around the bend"

They say a suntan never fails
I know I was a man who worked a night shift
I was lucky to get a job and some pay
Now I like every minute of the day
I dig every second
I could laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain

Pearl Jam,Dance Of The Clairvoyants,/p/pearl+jam/dance+of+the+clairvoyants_1746725.html,"[Verse 1]
Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Deceptively big
As big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation

[Chorus]
Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before

[Verse 2]
The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
It's not a negative thought
I'm positive, positive, positive
Falling down, not staying down
Could'a held me up, rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river

[Chorus]
Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before

[Verse 3]
Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor
We're stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Couldn't lift up the forget-me-nots
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world

[Bridge]
I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things

[Outro]
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
(I know the girls wanna dance away their circumstance)
(I know the boys wanna grow, their dicks and fix and file things)
Stand back when the spirit comes

Contraband hiding deep inside her soul
Exercising her will to lose control
She lets go

Common Man he don't stand a chance no
One to love who allowed his in the hole
No way to save someone who wont take the role
And just let's go

One Man Stands the edge of the ocean
A beacon on dry land
Eyes above the horizon
In the dark before the dawn

Hurricane has the trade winds blowing
Gale force shaking windows in the storm
Shipwreck from a love that he calls home
One light on

Somewhere there's a siren singing
Solmenly he hears
All the strengths you might think would
Disappear resolving

One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
Eyes above the horizon
In the dark before the
Darkness leaves the dawn

Makes me ache
Makes me shake
Is it so wrong to think that
Love can keep us safe?

Last I saw he was out there waiting
A silhouette in the black light full moon
In the sand there he stands upon the shore
Forevermore

Somewhere there's a siren singing
Solemnly he hears
All the strength
That you might think would disappear, resolving

One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
Eyes are closed, you cannot know
But his heart don't seem to know... 
Grow... 
Home..."

Did you top my plate?
It's alright

Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We y'all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle
""Oh,that's what that singing is about...""

And if you want to have to pray
It's alright
We y'all be thinking with our different brains
Could you stop it while I play
Its alright

Its ok!

Having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine
And yours
Wont take its place.
Now make your Getaway

Science says we're making love
Like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain't profound
Someone says that we are not allowed to consider
Someone says and looks
You're down
You're out

But I found my place
And it's alright
I'm bearing witness
To some stranger days
Could you stop my play?
Its alright
I've got my own way to relate!

Being told to change your ways
It's no way...
Mine is mine and yours
And yours won't take its place

Breaking news and building walls
Selling us, what I don't need

But he tuned out
A bad time, nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor, waiting, locked out
He got up outta there, ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up, set him down on his knee

A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
Delivered him wings, ""Hey, look at me now""
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh, power, oh

He's.. Flying
Whole
High.. Wide, oh

He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped and then he was stabbed
By faceless men, well, fuckers
He still stands

And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly

High.. Flying
Oh, oh
High.. Flying
Oh, oh
He's flying

By thinking we're infallible

Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Want a third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance
All good things come to an end

This could be good as it gets
How's the view from the fence
You think we've been here before
You are mistaken
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man

When progress could be plausible
In the verse we curse ourselves
By thinking we're infallible

Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of man

Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible

Oh we are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin here at the end
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before"

Make myself a pact, not to shut doors on the past

I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today

I know this one thing well,...

I used to try and kill love, it was the highest sin
Breathing insecurity out and in

Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight
Pursuing the greater way for all,.. Human light.

How I choose to feel,... Is how I am.
How I choose to feel,... Is how I am.

I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today

Holding on, the light of the night
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul

Again.

Let me run into the rain
To be a human light again

Let me run into the rain
To shine a human light today

So set are the ten pins as the human tide rolls in
Like a ball that's spinning
Bombs dropping down
Overhead, underground
It's instilled... To wanna live
Bombs dropping down, please forgive
Our hometown in our insignificance
Turn the jukebox up he said
Dancing in irreverance
Play c3, let the song protest
The plates began to shift
Perfect lefts come rolling in
I was alone and far away, hey..
When I heard the band start playin'
On the lip... Late take off
Bombs dropping down
Overhead, underground
It's instilled... To wanna live
Bombs dropping down, please forgive
Our hometown in our insignificance
Feel like resonance of distance
In the blood... The iron lies

Seemed a harmless little fuck

Gnashed his teeth
And bit the recess lady's breast

My jaw left hurting
Dropped wide open

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said. Hold me darling, just a little

That all her problems, they won't die with you

She's a lightning bolt
Never let her go
She's true

She's rock 'n roll
She's a lightning bolt

Candy-coated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door
I guess the heat got to it, dripped and melted all over the floor
Chocolate-covered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard
I had to laugh not to cry
Now all your possessions, all of your things, all of your hopes, schemes, desires, and most of all, your dreams
All gone away... Gone away...
All gone away... Gone away...
All gone away

Still something is missing...

Holding hands of daughters and sons
In their phase theyre falling down
Down, down, down

I have wished for so long...
How I wish for you again

Will I walk the long road?
I cannot stay
Theres no need to say goodbye

Oh, the friends and family...
All the memories going round
Round, round round...

I have wished for so long...
How I wished for you today

And the wind keeps rollin
And the sky keeps turning grey
And the sun is set
The sun will rise another day

How I wish for you today

How I wish for you today
Will I walk the long road?

Is this just another phase? Earthquakes making waves,...
Trying to shake the cancer off? Stupid human beings,...
Once you hold the hand of love,.. It's all surmountable.

Hold me, and make it the truth,...
That when all is lost there will be you,...
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word I stil believe
And it's

It's an art to live with pain,... Mix the light into grey,..
Lost 9 friends we'll never know,.. 2 years ago today
And if our lives became too long, would it add to our regret?

And the young, they can lose hope cause they can't see beyond today,...
The wisdom that the old can't give away
Hey,...
Constant recoil...
Sometimes life
Don't leave you alone.

Hold me, and make it the truth,...
That when all is lost there will be you.
Cause to the universe I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word that I still believe and it's
Love,... Love. Love. Love. Love.

Come you masters of war, you that build all the guns
You that build the death place, you that build all the guns
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks
I just want you to know, I can see through your masks
You that never done nothing, but to build and destroy
You play with my world, like its your little toy
You put a drug in my head, then you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run following the fast foolish lie
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive
A world war can be won, and you want me to believe
But I see through your eyes, and I see through your brain
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain
You that fasten all the triggers, for the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch, while the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion, while young people's blood
Flows out their bodies and is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear, that could ever be hurled
The fear to bring children, into this world
For threatenin' my baby, unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question, is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?  Do you think that it could?
Oh, I think you will find, when your death takes its toll
All the money you made will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die, and your death will come soon
I'll follow your casket, in the pale afternoon
And I'll watch as your lowered, into your deathbed
And I'll stand on your grave till I'm sure that your dead"

Always smelling like pig

Probably would have killed me if I had stayed there
But I had a scheme so cool and so clean
I got me a ticket one way to Moline

How have you been?
Been here before,
But it must have been a dream

My name is Nancy but here I'm Coleen

Life on my own,
And nothings's better than [?]
And fast as home
And someday I'll die and look in our [?]

On this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been taking too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes
There he goes...
He's yet to come back
But I've seen his picture
It doesn't look the same up on the rack
We go way back
I wonder about his insides
Its like his thoughts are too big for his size
He's been taken... Where, I don't know?
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
And there he goes...
And now I rub my eyes, for he has returned
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned
For he still smiles...
And he's still strong
Nothing's changed, but the surrounding bullshit that has grown
And now he's home
And we're laughing like we always did

Before his first step

Where's my destination?
I take a deep swallow in my frustration
I'm takin all I got
It fits in this little bag

All my life I saw evil eyes in old dark sockets
I cut 'em off
I cut 'em off
I said, ""I don't need them to make life work""
I cut 'em off
I cut 'em off
I'll never think twice if to them I never ever talk

Death ain't the same without you, dear

All this noise inside the quiet
I can't hold on, the weight you bear
My body's broken fast, please lift me up

Ans I don't want to know your past
But together share the dawn
And I won't need

Nothing else
Cause when we're dead
We would've had it all

And died
I would've fallen from the sky
Till you
Parachutes have opened now

Heaven knows if there's a ceiling
Come so low with the kneeling
Please know that
I got

All the feelings I'm needing
Before my light goes out
As the doors are closing now

And far away will be my home
And to grasp this, I don't know
And I don't need

Further back and forth, A wave will break on me today
And love,... Wish the world could go again with love
One can't seem to have enough
And war,... Break the sky and tell me what it's for
I'll travel there on my own
And love,... What a different life
Had I not found this love with you"

And initiatives are taken up
By the middle

And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place

Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Walk beside me

I never can say goodbye.

Seems to follow me wherever I go,
Though I try and try to hide my feelings,
They always seems to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no,
Tell me why is it so.

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.
I never can say goodbye.

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door,
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core,
It says, ""Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more.""
Tell me why is it so.

Don't wanna let go.
Never can say goodbye.
Girl oo oo baby.
Never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo.
Oh, I never can say goodbye.
Girl oo oo.

I never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo.
Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.
I never can say goodbye.

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out.
But there's that same unhappy feeling,
There's that anguish, there's that doubt.
It's the same old dizzy hangup,
Can't do with you or without.
Tell me why is it so, don't wanna let you go."

Or you can come to terms and realize
You're the only one who can't forgive yourself, oh
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense
Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Checked your hands and studied the lines
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light?
Seems that needlessly it's getting harder
To find an approach and a way to live
Are we getting something out of this all-encompassing trip?

Cause there is but you,... And something within you
It's taken control,.. Let's beat it, get up let's go

Oh you're in your own world, let's see the whole world
Let's pick up your soul

And fuck me if I say something you don't wanna hear
And fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head
Please help,... Me,... To help you,... Help yourself

Help me help yourself,... Please want me to,... Please let me to

Help you"

Said, ""leave your lady on the cement floor.""

""Got some kicks, wanna take  ride?""
I said, ""Yeh,...""
""Take your pick, leave yourself behind.""
I said ""Yeh,...""

I've no fear but for falling down
So look out below, I am falling now
Oh please understand, I just need my friend
A way home.

Tried to walk, found a severed hand,
Recognized it by the wedding band.

""It's okay, do you want some more?""
I said, ""Yeh,...""
""You'll see dragons after 3 or 4...""
I said, ""Yeh,...""

""Understand, I'm not falling down""
I said, ""Look around, the room's taller now,...""
I can't close my eyes, cause I see the sound
In waves.

In waves, lets me stay calm.

If I don't lose control
Explore and not explode
A preternatural other plane
With the power to maintain.

Like a tear in all we know
Once dissolved, we are free to grow
""What is human?,... What is more?""
I'll answer this
When I get home."

And reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe

The slightest bit of light
And I can see you clear
Oh, have to take your hand
And feel your breath for fear this someday will be over

I pull you close, so much to lose knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn't care before you were here.
I danced with laughter with the everafter
But all things change
Let this remain

Hear the sirens
Covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer
Will they come for me next time?

For every choice mistake I've made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay I'll wait, I'll understand

Oh, it's a fragile thing
This life we lead
If I think too much I can get overwhelmed by the grace.
By which we live our lives with death over our shoulders.

Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above, true.
I study your face, and the fear goes away.

Something he hadn't imagined being...
As the merging traffic passed, he found himself staring, down, at his own hands..
Not remembering the change, not recalling the plan, was it...?
He was okay, but wondering about wandering
Was it age? By consequence? Or was he moved by sleight of hand?
Mondays were made to fall, lost on a road he knew by heart
It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly...
Sometimes he hid in his radio, watching others pull into their homes
While he was drifting...
On a line, of his own, off the line, on the side
By the by, as dirt turned to sand, as if moved by sleight of hand
When he reached the shore of his clip-on world
He resurfaced to the norm
Organized his few things, his coat and keys...
Any new realizations would have to wait til he had more time, more time...
Time to dream, to himself
He waves goodbye, to himself
I'll see you on the other side...
Another man... Moved by sleight of hand..."

But no one's ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Oh, hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away

I swear I recognize your breath
Oh, memories like fingerprints, they're slowly raising
Me, you, wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf

I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see

Well, I just wanna scream, ""Hello""
Oh, my God it's been too long
Never dreamed You'd return

Ten miles left to go
Time is healing nothing
Only a matter of numbers

There was a reason
Something we wanted
And I'm not backing down till I get it

Twenty years ago

Well, I know the highway
Better than I know myself
In a few years I hope I settle in to
The big idea that I can't live for anyone else

Go on go on
And disappear

Away from here
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn’t be me and be her
In between
Without you
Without you
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back come back
Don´t walk away
Come back come back
Come back today
Come back come back
Why can´t you see?
Come back come back
Come back to me
And I know I was wrong

And words that have no backbone
Now it seems like the whole world's waiting
Can you hear the echoes fading?

And in the mourning, I'll rise
In the mourning, I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorry

And it takes all my strength
Not to dig you up, from the ground in which you lay
The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory to let go of

And the salt in my wounds, 
Isn't burning anymore than it used to.
It's not that I don't feel the pain, 
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore.
And the blood in these veins, 
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has.
And that's the hope I have, 
The only thing I know is keeping me alive.

When she sleeps, we come
If she forgets, we invite
The water gives good things

Making steps to get you

Saying that everything's alright
And by then I'm sure I'll be pretending
Just like I am tonight

These old letters from years ago
I felt it was leading to a continued
[...] I hope this is helpful for you. [...]
When I wrote this letter I felt I may have been finally able to address how it feels

[Verse: Aaron Weiss]
Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another stay, a touch of orange over purgatory gray

Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance

Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me

When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again

I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

[Outro: Aaron Weiss]
I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising that what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
[...] I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jump in and grab the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful"

Such fragile broken few

Butterflies with punctured wings

What once was blazing like now
There’s a tiny spark

Oh glory, come and find me

To the sound of an enemy’s song

Fighting on my own
In a war that’s already been won
I’ll be lost until you come and find me here, oh glory
Here…

What a mess, what a mystery we’ve made
Put loving in the simple things
Loving to forgive
Even when it was an odd mistake
I question every human
Who won’t look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

Oh glory, you will find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy’s song
I’ll be lost until you find me…
Fighting on my own
In a war that’s already been won

I am nothing but a shadow in the night

There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and tv reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die, yeah

I wipe the tears from your eyes
I wipe your tears away

I wipe your tears away

Paramore,Swim In Silence,/p/paramore/swim+in+silence_20778142.html,"Meet me here beneath the burning skies
Where the ocean comes and takes us from all of our lies
You never said that you were coming back
I have waited although I have found the place you hide
What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave us
But I will drown until you care
I will drown until you care

I imagine what it must be like
To have everything you need and not be satisfied
Run the water until it burns
And you can't see through the waves that crash into your prey
What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave
But I will drown until you care

Going under
Getting close to what we cannot recognize
Floating face down in the lies
Here we are without a trace
But the lies we used to blame
And you're so far away
What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone

Watch you as you leave

That what we carved in stone
Would be so temporary
Well how was I to know
That my first crack in love
Would not be the last
Won't be the last

Bitter tears and broken hearts
We're teenagers we count the years, we think we're smart
But we're not, we don't know anything

So don't ask me where I'll go
Cause frankly I don't know

And curse at the wind

As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist

And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk, well

Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

So you hang yourself from stolen dreams
And under the table you hide every stain

Each step you take
Getting closer
Makes it easier to fall on your face
Each death you fake
Getting closer
Makes it easier to love this way now

You're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches at lies
Fall from somewhere above

Let it fade, let it fade now

To see nothing in the light
Or turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite i'll turn it off

It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal, that's nonexistent

Just stay away from me and
Shut your mouth
Turn around
Walk away and leave me

A better excuse I will
But I can't so I wont
I'll just tell you the truth that

I really think you're hot
And I'm afraid your friend is not
And though I think it's great that she could stay
I'd rather spend this time alone with you

If I could find one friend
Who would hook with yours I will
But I can't so I wont

And if I could lie and say
That I wish she could stay I will
But I don't so I wont
Why wont she go away look

I think your friends okay
And there's no easy way for me to say
So could you ask your friend if she could leave
Just so I could be alone with you

Alone with you

I don't think she knows that
I want her so to go
I'm not sure if you do too
So tell me if you want to be alone with me too
So we could just ask her to leave

I can't make my move
If she stays here in my room
Unless you say it's okay
Then I guess she could stay

If you realy think it's fine
And if you promise me that she wont mind
I guess it's okay if she wants to stay
As long as I could be alone with you

Alone with you
Alone with you
Alone with you

If she was hot like you
I would ask her to join but she's not

Pagkalipas ng mahabang panahon.

Highschool pa tayo nung una kang nakilala
At tandang tanda ko pa
Noon pa ma'y sobrang lupit mo na
Hindi ko lang alam kung pano,
Basta biglang nagsama tayo
Di nagtagal ay napaibig mo ako

Mula umaga hanggang uwian natin laging
Magkasama tayong dalawa
Parang kahapon lang nangyari
Sa kin ang lahat
Tila isang dulang medyo romantiko
Ang banat

Ngunit nung napag-usapan,
Bigla nalang nagkahiyaan
Mula noon hindi na tayo nagpansinan

At bakit ko ba pinabayaan
Mawala ng hindi inaasahan
Parang nasayang lang.
Nawala na, wala nang nagawa

Panay ang plano,
Ngunit panay ang urong at
Inabot na ng dulo ng taon
Graduation natin nung biglang
Nag-absent partner ko
Tadhana nga naman!
Naging mag-partner tayo
Eksakto na ang timing
Planado na ang sasabihin
Ngunit hanggang huli, wala akong
Nasabi

At bakit ko ba pinabayaan
Mawala ng hindi inaasahan
Parang nasayang lang
Nawala na at wala nang nagawa

Napatunganga nung bigla kitang nakita
Pagkalipas ng mahabang panahon.
Sobrang alam ko na ang aking sasabihin
At ako'y napailing sa ganda ng ngiti mo sa'kin
At nung ikaw ay nilapitan
Bigla na lang napaligiran ng iyong mga anak mula
Sa pangit mong asawa

At bakit ko ba pinabayaan
Mawala ng hindi inaasahan
Parang nasayang lang
Nawala na, wala nang nagawa!

At bakit ko ba pinabayaan
Mawala ng hindi inaasahan
Parang nasayang lang
Nawala na, wala nang nagawa!

Wala ng nagawa...
Wala ng nagawa...
Wala ng nagawa..."

Lagi na lang tayong tinutukso

Ilang bote lang ang lumipas
Ang hirap mo nang makausap
Mapungay na ang iyong mga mata
Ang paligid ay maingay na

Tatlong beses mong ikinuwento
Nung madapa ka jan sa may kanto
Limang ulit kang nalito
Kung ano ang pangalan ko

Pero biglang nawala ang amats ko
Nung madulas ang dila mo
Hindi makapaniwala ang teynga ko
Nung biglang sabihin mo

Masarap ka palang kausap
Buong maghapon o magdamag
Alam mo ba ang sikreto ko
Matagal na kitang gusto

Pagkatapos ng isang linggo
Binantayan ko mga kilos mo
Tinanong ko ang mga kabarkada mo
Wala akong nakuha kahit ano

Tatlong beses kong pinagisipan
Baka nagpapakipot ka lang
Limang ulit kong sinabi sa sarili
Ganyan talaga ang babae

Kayat biglang nawala ang duda ko
Nadulas lang ang dila mo
Hindi makapaniwala ang teynga ko
Noong sinabi mo

Masarap ka palang kausap
Buong maghapon o magdamag
Alam mo ba ang sikreto ko
Matagal na kitang gusto

Di ko na mapigilan
Kailangan kong malaman
Tinulungan kitang aminin
Ang matagal mo nang inililihim

Tatlong beses mo akong minura
Sa harap ng iyong barkada
Limang beses na nabasag ang puso ko
Nung sabihin mong ang kapal mo

Kaya biglang nawala ang amats ko
Nakagat ko ang dila ko
Hindi makapaniwala ang teynga ko
Sa mga sinabi mo

Ang labo mo palang kausap
Kapag may beer ka lang matapat
Kahit maubos ang pera ko
Maginuman na lang tayo

Sana magubos na ang pulutan
At tapos na ang mga kwentuhan
Pag simot na ang laman ng bote ko
Sanay mahal mo ulit ako"

Feeling Amboy ka kase tapos ingles ka ng ingles
Iisang beses ka lang naman umales
Pero bakit ang tagalog mo ay pilit na panes
Tapos ah ang pangalan mo yo! Bakit nag iba
Dati ikaw si juan pero ngayon naninisdyoso ka
Hayop lang hiya Astig ka talaga
Masmatutuwa ako kung magpakamatay kana

Oh di kaya na susuya
Sa sandali oras mong nawala
Ganyan ka na mag salita
Hindi ka ba natataka

Kami ang bandang hindi nila kaya patayin
Tumatanda na pero nandito pa rin
At habambuhay kaming maghahasik ng lagim

Nandyan si Dindin, ang drummer naming cute na cute
Kaibigan ko na sya mula nung ’82
Hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin marunong mag-commute
Pati mag drums pero ok lang yan chong, salute
Grade 3 nung nakilala ko si Montaner
Ang aming back up extra ordinaire
Sa bawat gig handa syang magpakamatay
Kasi nag-iisa yung kanta nya, yung Picha Pie
Si Buhawi, pinakamagulong bahista
Magaling, malupit, para syang karatista
Pag inyong makita, kala mo rakista
Pero gusto nya lang talaga maging fashionista
Si Gab, gitarista namin na malupit
Anak ng teacher kaya akala mo mabait
Pero kung minsan inaatake ng kulit
Nawawala bigla ang modo, banatan sa porn
At ang huli, si Darius Gerard Semaña
Ang pinakamatandang member ng Parokya
Wala kaming mahanap na ibang gitarista
Kaya kinuha namin sya kahit Lasalista

Sipag tyaga dugo pawis na may kasamang dasal
Di pwedeng mainip kahit na gaano pa katagal
Kapag uhaw handang uminom ng tubig sa kanal
Balikan natin ang storya, nanalo ng trophy,
Si Chito Miranda nakita ko sa kod-li
Ako’y napa-isip at medyo nangarap ng konti,
Baka nga may mapala ang isang makatang promdi
Lumipas ang isang taon, may tumawag sakin
Nang sabihin nya kung sino sya gusto ko syang murahin
Nang aking pinuntahan di ko sukat akalain
Makakasali ako sa kantang kakabisaduhin ng marami
Bagsakan ang nangyari
Samahang binuo namin wala akong masabi
Kasama mo pa si Gab, si Buwi, Vinci, Darius at si Dindin
Mula noo’y di na ko nakatulog ng mahimbing.
Palaging atat ipadinig sa lahat kung saan nagmula ang tulang nag-ugat
Dito sa kantang pwede ang kahit anong pamagat
Dahil susunod na sakin ang anak ng alamat

Nakamit na ang inaasam nilang diploma

Yan si Chito at ang tropa pagkabibo ay sumosobra
Pag dating sa gig ay naghahasik ng amat na walang droga
Pag pumito na si kuya alam nating magulo na
Mang pulis ho totoo na ako’y testigo ilang taon na
Kulang nalang sulat ko’ng pangalan nila sa balota
Walang pinoy na takot sa kanila
Kahit nagtitinda ng penoy at balot sa kalsada sila ang pipiliin
Na kalahok tampok sa kalokohang subok
Walang kayang pumatay ang mga sandata ninyo ay marupok
Sa pintuan palang hindi mo kayang makatok
Sa bituka palang sila’ng mas matatag
Sa totoo lang ‘di niyo kaya si Chito Miranda at Gab
Chee Kee, Vinci, Moreno, Semana, at Meneses,
Nominado at nanalo ng maraming beses
Nakalathala sa punong Acacia
Ang Diyos ay marunong humasa
‘di ba halata na binasbasan ng Bathala ‘sing tibay ng Narra
‘di natakot mangarap pakinggan niyo’ng Harana,
Mga kapatirang pariwara na inararo ng drama,
Itaga niyo na sana sa bato at mangako na habambuhay magsasama

I have a Christian friend from La Salle

If I told them I think I am gay
They said hey it's okay

Nobody wins without once giving in
So don't cry now, don't cry now

Love is just a game they played in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now, don't cry now

And they try to be cool as they dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon

She said, boys do fall in love, they make time
Making love on a Saturday night
And she said, hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio, oh
B-b-boys fall in love

Baby knows I like to be excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late so I'll just demonstrate
So don't cry now, don't cry now

And they try to be cool as they dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day, makin' love to a paper moon

Do you remember the times when,
We didn't care about nobody else.
We got into each other's hair and nails,
And all that dirty stuff.
That lasted long enough.
We entered this thing!
Called love! What do you think went wrong?
But since you have never given me,
What you think is good enough
To all those you're going out with.
Look what you're doing to me girl.
I don't know if you still love me
I do
I'm just another lonely boy.
Running all the time,
While you're just wasting time.
And now, I'm far enough from you.
Don't you think that you're just fooling
Around with me.
Fresh fruits on and on get cold
Get off my side
I don't need booze
When I got a girl like you"

Wag na lang.

Una itong na discover noong 1976 ng isang maitim na Ruso
Na nagngangalang Leo dela Cruz Mutton
Na siya rin namang nakaimbento ng tinatawag nating question mark
Dati rati ay madalas kaming makakita ng mga specimen

Tulad ng karaniwang aso
Ang crocodile dog ay may maraming ipin
Pero mas marami, parang Crocodile

1982 nung unang na-introduce sa Pilipinas ang crocodile dog
Dala ng mga aborigines na nagtungong Pilipinas
Gamit ang mga lupang tulay
Na siya na rin naming naglaho pag lipas ng ice age
Sa native tongue ng mga aborigines

Somethng cheesy
So I better choose my words cause I

It's hard not to sound corny when you're
Singing from the heart

With something clever

Just change your frame of mind
Everything will be just fine
You can't breathe
Everything you see around just feels false
And you don't have the balls
To reach out
Ask help from those around you, carry on
You just carry on
No, no, no
That's not the way to go, I should know
Cause I've been there before
Just relax
Try to focus just for once on here and now
Before you lash out
Before you lose control
Grab a hold for yourself
Grab a hold for yourself
Hold your tongue
Before you shoot your mouth off
And regret the words that you will say
And regret the words that you will say"

Nagtitinda ng drugs sa kalye

Wag kang basta magtitiwala
Hindi mo ba napapansin
Parang ang hina nyang kumain
Baka naman nagshashabu
Mabuti pa ipakulong na natin
Sindikato tatay nyan
Kaya siguro siya mayaman
Wag ka sanang maniwala sa mga katulad nya
Di ka dapat magtiwala at iwanan mo na sya
Sapagkat mahal kita
At walang ibang magagawa
Kundi sirain ang pangalan nya. Sinta
Nakwento ko na ba giliw?
Na ang bf mo ay may pagkabaliw
Mahilig siyan kumain
Ng basura at buhangin
Ano ngayon kung pogi sya
Mukha naman syang kontra bida
Wag mo sanang sasabihin
Na nanggaling sa akin ang lahat ito
Ang sabihin mo
Na lamang ay may nagtext syo
At di mo alam kung sino"

Some say poems and some do sing
Others sing through their guitar strings
Some know it all while some act dumb
Let the bassline strum to the bang of the drum
Some can swim whie some will sink
And some will find their minds and think
Others walk while others run you can't talk peace and have a gun

Parokya ni Edgar,Name Fun,/p/parokya+ni+edgar/name+fun_20893624.html,"Come on everyone I say let's have a fun
I say I could make a game
Out of anybody's name
The name of the game is Name Fun

It's just a little easy, so let's ""begun""...
Well first you need a name, of course, of a friend, or not.
But it's better if it's from a friend than not,
Cause it maybe difficult if you forgot the name.

The first thing we do is say the name two times
And then you say popo eventhough it doesn't rhyme
And then you say ah mi and then you say mamay moni
And then you say the name
And that's the end of the game

I hope you understand the rules and the words by heart
'Coz without further ado I would like to start
'Coz ready or not I hope you're ready
'Coz ready or not let's do tony

Tony Tony popo ah mi may momoni Tony
That was a good try
Ok let's do a different name this time
Let's try, let's try ronnie

Ronnie Ronnie popo ah mi may momoni Ronnie
Amazing beauty
Ok let's try someone else this time
Let's try someone else
Let's do shonie

Shonie Shonie popo ah mi may momoni Shonie
Ayos! O sige ikaw naman
Sinong gusto nyo? Sino? Si Jionie?

Jionie Jionie popo ah mi may momoni Jionie
Ayos din yun ah! O sige iba naman
Let's try a different song thing right? Ok!
Let you the people outdoor sing along with us
Ok! Think of a name! Meron na?
O kantahin mo to!

Popo ah mi may momoni
Aba ayos din sige!

Bakit kaya biglaan ka na lamang nawala?
Kay tagal ko nang naghihintay sayo! Hindi pa rin sumuko!
Di ko man lang nalaman ang pangalan mo!

Sabi nila, na wag na daw akong aasa pa
Na magbalik ka pa kung san tayo huling nagkita
Biglaan ka na lang tumawa ng tumawa
Sa jokes kong sobrang corny at mas luma pa kay lola!

Nandyan ko lang pala! Bakit di ka man lang nagsasalita?
Akala ko'y tuluyan ka na lamang nawala!
Kay tagal ko nang naghihintay sayo! Anong pangalan mo!

So ako ay tumahimik at ako'y kinabahan.
Bumaba mula sa kama ko dahan-dahan...

Comet and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the least famous reindeer of all?

Hey Olops, oohh Olops

I have a little story about a not so famous reindeer
He is Rudolph's younger cousin
And they were born on that same year
His name is little Olops, and he was jealous of his peer
It was always Rudolph red-nosed, and Olops the other deer

Now Olops hated Rudolph, cause he hated Rudolph's fame
And he started treating Rudolph like a low-down dirty shame
Olops the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
And he never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

And so Rudolph said to Olops
""Why you treating me this way?""
Olops smiled and answered Rudolph
""Cause I think you're freaking gay, and I hate your shiny nose.""
""And come the eve of Christmas day,""
""I'll make sure that you won't be there to pull out Santa's sleigh""

But Olops did not know that Santa heard all that he said
And this made Santa angry and he bonked on Olops head
Then Santa pulled on Olops neck which filled Olops with dread
Rudolph waved goodbye
Then gave a smile
And then he said
""You're Dead! Hehe""

No one's ever heard of, or has seen Olops again
But they say Olops head hangs in a wall in Santa's den
The moral of the story is ""always be a friend""
You would not want to end up like Olops did...

Olops the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
He never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games"

Kung merong gusto pare wag kang magmadali
Tatama ka rin kahit medyo puro mali
Ipunin lahat ng piraso kahit na hati-hati

Walang nakaharang na di kayang lampasan
Para di ka mahuli kailangan mong paspasan

Ng kinita mo nung huling buwan
Eh mabuti pa mag-gitara ka
Gumawa ka ng magandang kanta

Sapagkat kaya kayo'y naging sikat
Bukod sa ilong mong medyo sarat
At sa katawang ubod ng payat
Ay sa awit niyong trip ng lahat

Ng mga gagong katulad niyong
Nag-eenjoy lang sa mundo
Ngunit kahit na ganito
Hindi kayo nanggugulo

Matino ngunit sira ulo,
Pilyo ngunit maginoo

Sa Chorus magsisimula

Mahirap gumawa ng kanta
Lalo na kung kailangang kumita
Pagkat ayokong maghanap ng trabaho
Habangbuhay magbabanda ako

Para may pera
Para may libreng sprite at vodka
Para may toys
At saka comics
Para may dvd ng classics

Para may boys, este para sa boys
At sa lahat ng mga kolokoy
Para gising hanggang alas otcho
Para tulog hanggang alas kwatro

Mahirap gumawa ng kanta
Lalo na kung wala nang maisip
Eh andaya naman kung manggaya na lang
Kailangan original song
Kailangan, kailangan
Kailangan original song

Nagsimula ang lahat sa eskwela
Dahil walang ibang magawa
Mula pagkabata, hanggang mag-asawa
At mag-assemble ng pamilya

Hanggang tumanda
Hanggang atakihin
Wala nang iba pang nanaisin
Kundi ang magbanda at saka kumanta
Rock en roll hanggang mamayapa

Mahirap gumawa ng kanta
Lalo na kung kailangang kumita

Habangbuhay magbabanda ako"

Kahit saan tayo mapadpad, basta may baon na lapad

Tapos magpakalunod sa alak ang pusong pagod

Gusto ko lamang siyang makalimutan
Kaya nagkayayaan

Tara na, samahan niyo kong magsaya
Sige na, ayoko munang mag-isa
Sapagkat ngayon lang ako, nasaktan ng ganito
Kaya pakiusap lang, lasingin nyo ako

Tuloy-tuloy niyo lang ang tagay, hanggang mawalan ng malay
Loko lang, syempre naman, maghahanap muna ng away
Loko lang, walang ganon, gusto ko lamang mag-inuman
Ok lang ang dahan-dahan, ang amats ay di kailangan
Na biglaan, relax lang tayo pag nag-iinuman
Gusto ko lamang siyang makalimutan
Kailangan lang maglibang

Tara na, samahan niyo kong magsaya
Sige na, ayoko munang mag-isa

Kept thinking this is not a good
This is a picha pie
And I spent O so many nights
Just eating my tortang talong
And I grew strong
Because of my tortang talong

Biglang may box, from outer space
Nakita ko sabay kinuha ko
Yung box from outer space
Binuksan ko at nasindak
May picha pie sobrang laki!
Tinikman ko within 5 seconds,
Naubos ko parang mani!

Ngayon ako, ay ganito
Kung 'di ka picha pie delivery
You're not welcome, any more
Ngayong sa akin picha pie
Ayoko nang mahiwalay
Para sa 'yo, handa ko magpakamatay

Cause now I love picha pie
Yeah, as long as I eat picha pie I know I'll be alive
I want all my garlic beef
Pepperoni, double cheese
Ang picha pie... Ang picha pie... Pahinge!

You took all the cash I have, naubos nang lahat
Gusto ko pa ng picha pie
Ngunit ang pera'y di sapat
And so I spent O so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
It made me cry, wala na ba'kong picha pie?
Ngayon ako, ay nagipit!
Hindi na ako istupid person na hindi nag-iisip
Medyo mahal ang picha pie
You can't expect it to be free
That's why I'm saving all my money
Para mayroong pambili

Ngayon ako, ay ganito
Kung 'di ka picha pie delivery
You're not welcome, any more
Ngayong sa akin picha pie
Ayoko nang mahiwalay
Para sa 'yo, handa ko magpakamatay

Yeah, as long as I eat picha pie I know I'll be alive

Di maiwasan gumawa ng hindi inaasahang bagay
Laklak ng laklak ng beer sa magdamagan
Kung may kahirapan at di maiwasan
Mabuti pa kaya matulog ka na lang bago sumakit ang tiyan
Ang araw ko'y nabubusisi ako ang nasisisi
Bakit ba sila ganyan
Ang pera ko'y hindi magkasya
Hindi makapagsine
At ayaw naman dagdagan
Ubos na rin ang beer
Kaya ano na lamang
Lahat sinusubukan
Kahit walang pulutan
Ang buhay ng tamad
Walang hinaharap
Ni konting sarap man lang
Radyo, tv, at mga lumang komiks
Wala ng ibang mapaglibangan
At kung meron kang tatawagan
Credit mo sa text ay makakaltasan
Aaaaahhh..........
Umiindak ang paa sa kumpas ng tugtuging bago
Hanggang kumpas ka na lang at di mo na alam ang tono
Sa paghinto ng ulan
Ano ang gagawin
Wag ng isipin at walang babaguhin
Mabuti pa kayang matulog ka na lang
Matulog ka nang mahimbing
Pumapatak na naman ang ulan
Pumapatak na naman ang ulan"

Tuwing ika'y dumaraan
Sinusundan ka ng tag-ulan
Habang buhay ka bang ganyan
Araw-araw nalang
Sad trip na naman

Nakatulala ka na naman
Ano ba ang yong tinitignan
Tigilan mo na kaya iyan

At sa halik ng alon sa pisngi ng buhangin

Parang sinasadya
Mapapahanga ka sa lumikha

Masarap din tumambay at magsamasama
Parang mamatay na tayo
Sa kakatawa
Masarap ding tumambay ng magisa
Hihiga ka lang sa kama
At kakanta

Tungkol sa agos ng buhay
At sa daloy ng tadhana
At sa nakakalunod na pagbuhos ng biyaya
Walang lahat ng ito

Alam konang ikaw ay totoo

Parokya ni Edgar,Sampip,/p/parokya+ni+edgar/sampip_20261296.html,"Some people love shoes of certain kinds
Some people love afternoons or the way the moon shines
And they have their own reasons to feel the way they do
That's why I asked myself what is it with you

Is there something wrong with the way I speak?
Do you even see me when I pass you on the street?
I'll close my eyes and let it be
Because I just can't see
Why you love to hate me

Some people love weekends
Because they can fool around
Some people love thunderstorms
Because of how the drops of rain fall down 
And they have their own reasons
Whatever they may be
That's why I think it's kinda funny
That you don't have one for me

Is there something wrong with the way I speak?
Do you even see me when I pass you on the street?
I'll close my eyes and let it be
Because I just can't see
Why still love to hate me

And it sucks to face the truth
That I ain't got no reason too
Whenever asked a simple question
Why I feel the way I do
And I know it's stupid on my part
To say that I love you
Even though I know you hate me
And you don't know why you do

Is there something wrong with the way I speak?
Do you even see me when I pass you on the street?
I'll close my eyes and let it be
Because I just can't see
Why you love to hate me"

Ang daming iniisip ngunit wala namang masabi
Nagsawa ka na ba? Subukan mong tumawa
Tigilan ang pagiisip ipagpatuloy ang pananginip

Hindi ko maalala ang lyrics ng kanta
Kahit ako ang gumawa iba naman ang nagsalita
Mahirap talaga pag inaasahan ka awitin na mga tula
Na nagmumula sa pera

@d ko inakala na magkakaganito
Wala namang nagsabi na malabo ang mundo
D na rin naming inaasahang maintindihan
Alam naman nilang wala kaming pakialam kung san man tutungo
At kung kelam kami hihinto
Kung bukas man o bukas pa tuluyan nang tapusin ang kanta

Gising hanggang umaga hindi mapakali
Pinipiga ang utak ngunit wala paring masabi
Kapag pinilit mo at hindi na totoo
Ang awit na natapos ay mawawalan ng tono"

Ewan ko kung bakit ba wala akong nagagawa

Ewan ko ba kung bakit ang hirap pa ring aminin

Madalas naman tayong naglolokohan
Dinadaan ko nalang sa biro ang tunay kong nararamdaman
Kaya siguro hindi mo sineryoso aking mga sinabi
'Yan tuloy walang nangyari

Sayang bakit hindi kita niligawan
Ngayon ako'y nanghihinayang
Kasi naman tatanga-tanga pa ako noon
Walang humpay na pag hintay ng pag kakataon

Kakalipas lamang ng isang sem
Nung makita kita na mayroon ibang kasama
Magkahawak ang inyong mga kamay
Ang dibdib ko ay sumikip
Ang paglunok ko ay naipit

Aking napatunayan na nasa huli ang pagsisisi
Para bang gusto kong umiyak
Ngunit para saan pa wala namang magagawa

Sayang bakit hindi kita niligawan

Ang nais na mangyari ng tadhana para satin

Para akong tanga, di ko man lang naisip
Na ang pangarap ay mananatiling panaginip
Kung wala akong gawin upang makamtan ka
Paano ka tatama kung di ka tataya

At paano kung may contest na sinet-up and tadhana
At ang unang papremyo ay ang makasama ka
Di kaya sayng naman kung di ko man lang susubukan
Manalo sa pa-raffle na tadhana
Tan tan tan tan

Hahayaan bang mapunta ka na lamang sa iba
Nakwento ko na yata yan sa ibang kanta
At paano kung hindi ako naakit ng tadhana
Eh di sana ay hindi ako ang iyong sinisinta
Di kaya sayang naman kung di ko man lang susulitin

Louder than any other sexual soundtrack

Chito:
More margarita for my cute senorita
Triple the tequila just to heighten up the flava
Chuggin down on my J&B while checkin out the parts of my date's anatomy
Forget the brains forget the personality
What I'm after is your effect on my gravity like Trinity
Flying high with her kicks and controlling the game with my heavy duty joystick

Louder than any other sexual soundtrack

Chito:
Flip the tip as we skip to the next trip
Flashing some cash and some rock star bullshit
Going in for the thrill moving in for the kill
I got us a room in a fancy hotel and we got everything we need
A big bag of money a bigger bag of weed
And we try to impress as we start to undress
Stop the press we need to get this

But it's Vinci's turn on the microphone so

Vinci:
My name is Vinci and I am neat
I love pretty girls and I love to eat
I made this rap from my mind
And I am very very kind
I like to drive fast in fancy cars
And chicks dig me like chocolate bars
You say I'm bad but I am good
So shut up now and eat some food

Chito:
Tsong ano bang problema mo ayusin mo naman
Lagyan mo naman ng tono para kang nangangatwiran
Ano bang inaatupag mo sa bago mong apartment
Sampung taon ka nang sikat wala ka pa rin bang talent

Vinci:
Tsong ano bang sinasabi mo
Mali ang sinasabi mo
Magaling akong kumanta
Alam mo ba yung picha pie

Chito:
Kung sa bagay mahusay nga naman yung picha pie
Gamit ang boses mong pamatay nilagyan mo ng kulay ang kanta

Vinci:
Diba kahit ikaw ang gumawa
Alam nating mas okay nung ako yung kumanta

Chito:
Tsong naman please lang wag ka nang magyabang at
Alam mo naman na pang-back-up ka lang at
Ilan na ba ang talagang nagawa mong kanta ilan

Vinci:
Wala eh ano ngayon

Alam naman nating lahat
Na si Vinc naman talaga dapat
Ang vocalist ng parokya band
Ng parokya ni edgar

Chito:
Teka lang one minute Pwede bang paki-ulit
Maaaring may lamang ka sa paligo
Subalit bakit mo naman nasabing ikaw ang nararapat
Eh ni isang kanta man lang wala kang naisulat

Vinci:
Eh bat ibang singers naman kahit di nila sinulat
Ang kinakanta nilang kanta ay sobra kung sumikat
Tulad ko at ni Quino at ni Benedict Aquino
Na wala nga yatang mas-sisikat pa kahit na sino

Chito:
Ewan ko sandali wag ka ngang makulit
Kung ayaw mong masipa sa mukha ng malupet
Baka makatikim ka ng sasuwela de kamao
Na si listo el de gato sa gulpihang de kontodo

Vinci:
Talaga hindi nga tatawa na ba ako
Hindi porket koreano ka magaling kang mag-taekwando
Wag kang mag-aangas sa lalaking may balbas
Kami yung mga tipo na hindi umaatras

Dindin:
Sandali lang wag muna kayong maglaban
Bago kayo magsuntukan
Bat di nyo muna pag-usapan ang di maunawaan
Sige na kiss na, peace na please
Ang bayad mo sa jeepney kulang pa ng diyes
Kung ayaw mong mangyari ang nagyari sa iba
Matuto tayo kung paano magpakumbaba
Wag nating kalimutan kung saan nagsimula

Band:
Alam naman nating lahat
Na mahal namin ang isa't-isa't
Walang iwanan sa parokya band
Sa parokya ni edgar

Palagi kong dala hanggang sa ating pagtanda
Natatandaan mo pa ba nung una tayong nagkakilala
Medyo bata pa tayo noon pero kung iisipin ganun pa rin ngayon
Nasa puso pa rin kita hindi ka na mabubura

Let's talk
You know it's stupid
Yo it was okay
Walang nangyari sa'kin na magandang irelate
Wala kasi nangyari sa'kin nakakaiba
Kung wala kang gagawin, yo, makinig ka na

Nagising ako kahapon siguro mga one
Bumaba 'ko sa kusina sabay ng tanghalian
Pagkatapos kong kumain bumalik sa kwarto ko
Tapos non ako'y natulog hanggang alas kwarto
Okay din ako'y bumagon ako ay nagugutom
Bumaba 'ko uli at naghanap ng malalamon
Tumingin ako sa ref, pati na rin sa right
Wala akong mahanap so umalis ako ng bahay
Nagpunta 'ko sa tindahan bumili ng instant mami
Bumalik ako sa bahay nanood ako ng tv
Walang magandang palabas and yo it was so corny
Bigla ko naalala I was feeling kinda horny
Binuksan ko yung dvd sinarado ko yung door
At pagkatapos kong ilock
Nanood ako ng porn...

Walang nangyari
Walang nangyari

Pagkatapos nun alam niyo ba
Wala 'kong magawa
Minabuti kong magexercise at magpush-ups push-ups muna
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
Sabay tayo tanggal ng shirt harap sa salamin
Pagkakita sa sarili sabi ""shit kulang pa rin!""
So I pushed-up again and nagdagdag pa 'ko nang 7
Pagkalipas na nakapagpahinga
Agad-agad naghubad maliligo na sana
Nang biglang na lang may nagtext
Isang magandang ex
Na-isip ko, ""sana gusto nitong makipag-SSSHHH!""
Subalit napamura pagkatapos ko mabasa
Sabi'y, ""chito friend mo ba yung vocalist ng rivermaya?""
Ang sabi ko, ""ay hindi!"" at sa sobrang inis
Dinagdagan ko pa nang ""teka, sori, who is this?""

Walang nangyari
Yo dj make some claps
Yes...

Pagkaligo ko natapos din sa relo napatingin
It was already 7: 30 at 'di pa 'ko kumakain
Gusto ko ng rice at tsaka ng lechon kawali
Walang lechon kawali so bumili ng instant mami
Pagkatapos kong kumain nagpunta sa terrace namin
Nagsipilyo 'ko nang yosi at tuluyan nagpahangin
Walang katao-tao doon at medyo madilim
Kayo 'ko napraning nung cellphone ko ay nagring
Nawala ang aking takot nung cellphone ko ay nabunot
At nakita ko yung caller so agad kong sinagot
""hello there mr. darius ano ang gimmik natin?""
Sumagot sya, ""hey what's up man? baka trip mong kumain?""
Ang sabi ko, ""shit sayang naman kakatapos ko lang
Tawagan mo na lang ako pagaktapos nang hapunan""
So pinatay ko na yung yosi at bumalik sa kwarto ko
Nanood ako ng tv nang kung ano-ano
Makalipas tatlong oras ako ay nabato
So pinatay ko na yung tv at natulog na ako

Walang nangyari
Yo Dj bring it down bring it down
Bring it down
Yo
Yo

Pagkatapos nun natapos na
Tapos na ang kanta
Bakit kaya ganun bakit umaandar pa sya
Pinindot ko yung stop
Pati na rin yung go
Bakit kaya ganun ayaw pa ring nyang huminto
Alin kaya dito ang dapat kong pindutin

Uminom ka pa ulit ng isa pa

Sapagkat walong baso
Ang dapat na maubos mo
Dahil sabi sa libro
Na kailangan daw ng tao

Ang tubig sa katawan
Halos seventy percent
Kung hindi mo yan alam
Malamang ikaw ay absent sa school, sa school

Minsan ni tatlo pa lamang
Ay naduduwag na ko sa busog
Pero pinpiilit ko
Hanggang masimot ko ang ika-walo

Kung saan ka matututo
Ng mga importanteng bagay
Na kailangan mong malaman
Para mas dumali ang buhay

Tulad nung nabasa ko
Sa isang pulang libro
Kulang daw kapag pito lamang

Watching, listening, or swaying to the beat
Tell me why should it matter
Tell me why should I even care
Of the things that could go wrong

Back in the day my words were strong and real
Back in the day my trails were blazed in steel

I could see - my visionary views were sought, progressive outlooks on society
I could feel - my gut was solid, cold as stone, a consequence of loyal piety
I could change - adapt and compromise, evolve - laugh in the face of your anxieties

You're not so different from your enemy
*We're all debris, but you've fallen blind, untrue*
But your scattered faces shroud the truth
*Woefully, though we share far more than you*
And masked in overstated subtlety
*Would care to see, - you're a felon too*
The painful truth you fell into

In the pall, recesses of your sin
In the shaded corners of your soul
Beneath the shadows of our skin
Prevails the nature of us all

You need change, new lies
New colors for the promise they've devised

*But you won't believe in the ties that bind we two*
You're not so different from your enemy
*We're all debris, but you've fallen blind, untrue*
But your scattered faces shroud the truth
*Woefully, though we share far more than you*
And masked in overstated subtlety
*Would care to see, - you know it's you.*
The painful truth - you know it's you."

This distance to help us sleep
And peers to absolve
The turbulent wake it leaves, over space and time now rippling to peace

Feed it in ways unknown, far above our means, disparate and parting
Then heed it in words alone, seldom moments' pause to wonder
Though wonders are waste, you'll find
If we follow the web of lines
We're just lost in the crowd

Our imprint's real, though often far from view
How can we sate our lust for more, but feel less too

Where it fractures, this is your loss

And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun

I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart,
and killed me.

And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.

I was so happy for you!

And we're out of beta.

Go ahead and leave me...
I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
Maybe you'll find someone else

Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!

Anyway this cake is great!
It's so delicious and moist!

Look at me: still talking
when there's science to do!
When I look out there,
it makes me glad I'm not you.

I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are

And believe me I am

I'm doing science and I'm

And our forfeit - for a future full of freedom - of a life we might have known

Now adrift here in the silence - metaphor for the vast unknowns we face
The mirage is slowly fading, the horizon holds the fortunes we embrace
I know that I'm no hero, not a martyr, just a servant of will
For tomorrow's full of wonders, humble graces, that the blind may not fulfill

There was a time this land was a beacon, the cradle of all things, you've wasted their gains
Beliefs to be built on, discoveries to dilate, ideas are foundations, not crippling chains
This reckless divorce of compassion and reason, of rational thinking – no harem awaits
And for your indifference, your indoctrinations, immoral misleadings, our lives to the fates
Know this forever, that we were no martyrs, no god fearing zealots, we fight for the truth
We're secular beings, more humbled by questions than outdated answers that mesmerize you

Dictate of fate – why must we live by your hand
Smug in your own sense of virtue of reason of grand
Defending faith as sacred and righteous and pure
Smokescreen for hate, for abuses, mistrust and allure
Spectate of fate, with silence of ghosts to foretell
Weather for fear of the vengeance induced by this spell
Defending faith as private, protected, divine
Sheltering fringes who honor their own lives like thine
Dictate of fate –we suffer your mindless decrees
Sure of your place in these fictions that bring men to knees
Defending faith - the will of the words you hold true
In time, your edicts will unleash their wrath upon you

And lo, a light on, not so far away from Zion
In the land of the virile, the breeders, and the heroes
The rains fall down, modern arms and aging thoughts collide
Drowned in the blood of holy rite
... And so we fight on
In the sands of the feral, the ciphers and the zeroes
In the grave passed down, in the storied bygones silence let survive
And drown in the blood of holy rite

Your lease on faith is fleeting, we believe
In freedom, justice fair, like you we need
Answers, consolations, but we feed
On wonder, life, how meaningless we seem
The universe is stranger still than we
The search for truth is motive 'nough for me

Who cares if you run things

But a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks!
Only the strong survive
It's Do or Die

C*** back, go to war with my peoples!

Mark my words "" I'm next to Blow! ""
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B to the you, double the L!

Man I'm watching the game closely
Uncle Luke that man done coached me
He told me the who, what, where's, and why's

If you wit us and you ready for war

Kick in they door, run in they house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck It! Put the gun in they mouth!

All these bitches wanna swallow me now!
All these niggas that I don't even know
Wanna hollah at me now

To my hustlers be careful when they murdering the block!
To my killers be careful when you burning up the glock!
Last thing you wanna be is running from the cops

Haters can hate, but it aint 'gon stop!
Everybody knows I'm blow just listen to the flow
This Chico got it on lock! Ha!

Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen

Here's a little story that I got to tell
About this Chico named Pit everyone knows so well
Illmatic like Nas but that ain't hard to tell
Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails
These boys rap about hustlin' but can't make bail
I call that hustling backwards and that's real
Miami's hot so I can vacation in hell
The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
I look at these fools on camera flashin' they tools
They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules
But me, I'm confused
'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
Gangstas wanna be rappers
Ballers wanna be rappers
And rappers wanna be ballers
The truth is it's more sickening than Ebola
Until they handcuff then it's over
Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders
Bust guns, sell drugs, that's what the streets showed us
But corporate America, that's what they sold us"

At a millionaire’s night
Nah I ain’t no russian
But I get what I like
Baby know russian
I’ma tell you what I want

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don’t care
Any universe, any atmosphere
Clock say 1: 12 so we’re outta here
We can do it everywhere
She throwing up dubs screaming west side
I got a cali king you can fit just right
Pick cars depending on what’s the best drive
Give you the keys, let you test drive
Top floor, with the sweet sounds great
Looking out the window over the tristate
She come mad early and leave mad late
And I ain’t eating at the table, don’t need no plates
Her clothes in the bedroom floor,
We’re not even in the bedroom no more
I get a text message in the morn
Like daddy, go ahead and to me like that tonight

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night
From the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom
Go upstairs, back down soon
My couch’s soft, my floor too
We can take a day if you want too
Turn john like tv, hd, 3d
I spin you around like a cd
Baby don’t make it so easy
She won’t let...
She recking my place like tasmanian devil
I’m giving the base, she giving the trebble
And we turn it up, to the next level
I told her we can do it when the sun’s up
Or we can get it in when the sun’s down
Or maybe we can meet halfway
Either way, baby girl I’ma put it down

Girl it’s on tonight
You got me trippin off them strobe lights
You know this vodka got me feeling right
Just one more drink I take you home tonight
And we can go from the bed to the floor
From the window to the wall
No matter where we are, we can do it all night

International sensation
INNA
And Mr. Worldwide, dale

[Verse: Pitbull]
I'm like a quarterback, I got options
But I play the point in school
Broke ankles, more than a few
Broke hearts, yea that too
20 years later, same movie, same script,
Same player, more chips,
More women, more haters
Different toilet, same shit
Why get caught up in emotions?
Why go through the same motions
In a sick way she loves to see me mad
It gets `er wetter than the ocean
She's a good girl gone bad
But bad girls don't like good guys
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy
That's what I though, hah let's ride

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Verse: Pitbull]
They had a calling, but they got soft hearts
And I know they soft spots
I meet `em, I greet `em, I train `em
And show `em all about Hard Knox
Listen:
Next thing you know [Next thing you know]
They holdin the fort down like Fort Knox
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what it's not
Damn!
These are called rules of engagement
Welcome to the world of entertainment
They don't want a man like Rayman
They want a man that's duck in the Raymonds
I know it's ironic
But the good girls love bad guys
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?
That's what I though, now let's ride

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin with my heart so I can run away

[Amanda Diva:]
These words are written in blood, on red and white lines
Rhymes to the beat of a war drum that cries
Like mothers whose sons were sent to fight
And widows whose spouses souls are all that keep them warm at night
Underneath spacious skies where stars look more like bulletholes
And the haze of the clouds more like shrouds
I swear I smell gunsmoke, when I inhale too deep
Cause cheap lies have caused the loss of priceless lives
Bush is duckin the truth while the few and the proud dodge landmines
Niggaz is doin time for gettin caught with a dime
But he will never be indicted for his crimes against this nation
Impatient with waiting it's time we fall in line
And stop, falling for the lies
The war ain't only in Iraq
It's time we fight back, for control of our minds"

I Know Ya'll Listen To My Music (Red Eyes) But What I'mma Do Know Is Try And Describe My Life To Ya'll

[Pitbull:]
Sometimes I Fell Like I'm Loosing It
My Life Is Upside Down
A Gift And A Curse That's My Life Now
There Is No Looking Or Turning Back
I Used To Watch Coke Turn To Crack That's What Made Me Turn To Rap
I Fell Like Keanu Reeves In The Movie Devils Advocate
Confused But Blessed With Extravagance
I Thank God For All The Opportunities
Given The Opportunity Dem Boys Would Put Two In Me (Bla Bla Bla)
We Live In The Land Of The Free, Hustlers And Thieves
I Made Money Now I Got Uncle Sam Hustling
Me For A Quarter Of What I Make
Hand A Quarter Sentence To A Fake And Watch Them Turn State (That's Right)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Most Of These Fools Are Characters
Men With No Character Welcome To America
Where We Fight For Freedom
If Ain't About Oil Than We Don't Need Them
Ain't That The Truth?
Pitbull I'm Just Tell Ya'll The Way I Fell
Thank God That God Made Me To Keep It Real

Huh Hun Yo
After The Turf War The Smoke Clears
All These Years Around These Busta I'm Convinced There Ain't No Hope Here
In The Past Four Years Of My Lifetime I Witness Leaders Sacrifice Freedom Just To Get This Pipeline
Guess I'm Chosen At The Right Time Mama Stress
Facing The Table And She's Snorting Up White Line
Blood Is Thicker Than Water
In A Few Cases Your Daughter Can Have Touched For The Money That In Dem Suit Case
Tighten My Shoelaces The Fugitive Running
In Fear Of A Criminal Past 'cause Dem Folks Is Coming
I've Been Wrongfully Judged Being From This Environment
The City Gangs Planning Retirement
I'mma A Dade nigga
Voicing My Set 'cause A Spray Quick
Took Some Of The Same Steps Through Little Haiti As These Main nigga (Like Who) Hit Man, Big Dogg, And Shehound
Ya'll Predict It Back Then shit I See It Know

It Feels Great To Make Something Out Of Nothing Yea I'm Humble But I Tell Ya'll To Push A Chico's Buttons
And Watch How Them Thing Get To Dumping
Real-Estate New York Game Now You Saying Something

Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly
Mr. W.W., haha!
I told you once (Can't Have)
I tell you twice (Can't Have)
The grass looks greener on the other side
Til you get to the other side, haha

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, cause you're so right
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have
Why does loneliness hurt so bad
And girl I want you back
Well then I guess we always
Want what we can't have

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I seen Central Park, from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
About the crazy things we use to do
For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
Til I figured out there was footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 til I die

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama, chaos, and different coaches
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shining shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we the clean houses
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants

Pitbull,Castles Made Of Sand,/p/pitbull/castles+made+of+sand_20907155.html,"[Chorus:]
So you tried, to believe in the castle made of the sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach for my hand.

I sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers,
Try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus,
God knows I got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons
I'm fighting myself, believe me,
I'm far from ignorant, Far from greedy
If you know where I come from, know what I've been through
You think there should have been another outcome
Just like most kids, a father I did it without one
Come from the city, X you like Malcolm, then you wonder how come
I can move in the room full of wolves so swift so smooth,
Thank you mom for making me a man
Let that mother fucker knock me and my castle to the sand

[Chorus:]
So you tried to believe in the castle made of the sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand.

Look
I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple
Came down the south beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle,
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to,
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner,
I'm coming out with dinner wearing the chinchilla,
I did it for my town to show em the big picture,
Kid Hit the switch, I promise to never switch up,
This is for my brother two three who went to jail,
I'm send all the picture of my shows through the mail
He hit me with a letter, said: I knew you'd never fail,
So put me on a beach with a bucket and a pale

[Chorus:]
So you try to believe in the castle made of the sand
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand"

And anger problems, my brother usually wont hear before me

In the floor
In the middle of the park

Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos
Mamita te voy a hablar claro
Yo me siento mal, muy mal

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas
Que no habria quien nos separara
Que yo era tuyo y tu eras mia
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas
Pero de arepente todo cambio
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon
Tu no sabes cuanto daño la hace a mi corazón, perderte

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no
(Que no me vaya no)

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon

Porque siento como tu y yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor
Estamos acostumbrao'
Y no estamos enamorao'
O maybe es algo que da duro
Y viene y se va como un morao
Pero mami let's work it out
Es un daño profundo
Pensar en los años
Que tu y yo viviamos juntos
Y que, todos esos años se fueron por gusto? (No, no..)
No me digas eso mami
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar
Un amor como el nuestro es real
Un amor tan profundo
Yo te apuesto el mundo
Que tu te sientes igual
Un amor que no se puede olvidar
Un amor que no se puede ocultar
Un amor tan rico y tan fuerte
Que no se puede dudar

Mira mi hija, tu sabes que la vida mia
Esta en la boca de toda la gente

We gon take it from the bottom (M-I-A-M-I to Houston!!)
H-town! Pitbull, Bun B..
My dogg Demi, keep ya head up, I gotchu, I promise!
All my chicos, I gotchu, I promise!
Miami, I gotchu, I promise!! I'ma take over this bitch! I promise!!
So get ready mothafuckaz, this is not a game!! (Eeeeeeeyooooouuu!!!!!)

[Verse 1 (Pitbull)]
I'm from the dirty dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed
With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng
Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it
Album shop it, it's all the same thang
Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise
I look at these blue skies, and think what a disguise
That's why it's called the ""Magic City"", it's a treat to your eyes
Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind
Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs
'cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life
Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs
So watch where you put the map on the dash
Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night
They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes
Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here
Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear! Yeah!!

[Chorus:]
Everything we do is dirty!!!!
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!!
We pound that twat, dirty!!
Miami!!!, we're dirty!
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty!
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty!
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2 (Bun B)]
Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, pa to be exact
Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack
8 g's and cadillacs, chevys cut on the deltas
Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya
2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers
Vicious like silver-back guerillas see then peel ya
Niggaz down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya
Serve ya, for ya or for ya (Feel it!!!)
You pussy niggaz been hatin on us for too long
So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song (that's what's up)
'cause the time is now (now), the place is here (here)
I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear
Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes
So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise
And I got no time for yo lies (No time for lies!!), save 'em for peter
Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater (bitch!), let's get it dirty!

[Chorus:]
Everything we do is dirty!!!!
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!!
We pound that twat, dirty!!
Miami!!!, we're dirty!
Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty!
Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty!
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 3 (Pitbull)]
These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school chevys
We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box chevys
Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five
M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!!!
Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better
Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers
'cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters
This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors
So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches
And niggaz cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin for figures
This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it
That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it
This is for everybody in county, tgk, Metro West and Stockade
Doing time
And if you got more than 365
And you're up the road rep mia with pride, That's right!!!

[Chorus:]
Everything we do is dirty!!!!
We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!!
We pound that twat, dirty!!
Miami!!!, we're dirty!

Uh that’s my favorite song

I put my thing in motion

I do it all night long

You know the resume
Call it what you want, boy as it may
Not from the bay but hella paid
Every day above ground is a good day so I celebrate
Homie got that bubble, young bootie
I wanna run through it like Rudy
She said “do you own Nike?”
I said “not yet”, she said “then just do it”
Fresh at the Grammys in a tuxedo
Play about 18 hoes on any given day
Tiger Woods D low
Yea I get around but only on the D low
Now I’m changing the world
Just to think I used to dream about kilos
Bank account used to be negative
Now it’s like that thing on reload, do it

They want just never heard before,
Never seen before, never worn before
But if they only knew everything’s been done before
I mean for an outcast like the below
Instagram, now they take pics
When I was growing up Instagram was a nick
Man what a trippin
Bogota, I made it in Colombia
Man what a trip
If you been there
Then you know what I’m talkin bout
I’m runnin through the world, yall walk it out
It’s a marathon, not a sprint
Long term, that’s how I think
My life could’ve turned out ugly
I’m talkin ugly, generino
But I turned it all around and hit the jackpot

Goes a lil' something like this.

It's not pick 'n roll, it's more like pick a roll.
What you gon' push? We waste a blow.
If it's all three, then that's the three from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams of the top of the key.
Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap ho's.
Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's.
Next thing you know you're putting numbers on the... boat.
The whole point is to stay on the courts, but, in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts.
Yeah they similar, but not the same sports.
Both international, import, export.
Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought. Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought.

Instead of playing with your heart and your mind
Games are waste of time, now we can do the nasty
And do what the do and see what the does
Either we gon love what we do to each other
Or just let it be what it was
No harm, no foul, no commitment, no vows
Maybe a contract or two
But by that time I'm already tired of the way you like it, oh
And let your body decide, exactly what it does
But it's no secret baby, everybody fucks

I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

Dale loca y abre la voca

And if you like your hair pulled
And your ass slapped when they hit it
From the back it better be known
All my mamas think they are to good to

Come on little mama let me see what you got
Turn around baby and let me hit the spot
And I'm gonna lick the spot
But I'm gonna make it hot
Go on and take it off
Because you might sweat a lot
All I need is just a couple of minutes
But you aint gonna trip that I'm already finished
Yes I'm ready to get all up in it
Hit it real steady til I'm almost in it
Hit it from the back so bad you can feel it in the middle
Bring it back and make it clap
Might slap a little
We can do it one on one a little privacy
But it's gotta be my way, promise me
Face down ass up that's the way I like to fuck
We don't need room we can take it to the truck
I guarantee sweet dreams if you fuck with me

You know the type of women that I like
The ones that understand my life
The ones that understand wrong is right
Let’s do some wrong tonight
You name it I’ll do it, all is the fluid,
I’m Spanish influent, that means my tongue is bilingual
Ready to play with that spot that you tingle
Uh got a dingo, she’s a star, Ringo
Her and 2 friends? Mmm, I like that lingo
She asked if I’m single,
I said of course not, and she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public

It's okay let em hate, cause they'll be coming back one day, dale

We could be anywhere tonight
Could be right here underneath the lights
I see the colours in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

I just, I hope we meet again

Now the world is my backyard
And I would like to thank yall
Cause I was at point, point blank
That I would point blank yall
I found myself intern I lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like an old school manny better lost in time
They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know
And I don't know shit, does that make me wise, papo I don't know
But this mean I can't say, to my friend eddie, my father, guarilla, abuelo rudy, to my brother drama I'll be back for you one day

We could be anywhere tonight
Could be right here underneath the lights
I see the colours in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

If Pit's on da job, then there's no need to worry
Dog just hurry up and wait,
'cause I aint Going no where anytime soon
Sick what these rappers wanna be?
That's me, times 2
Now...
Get ready for me to take over this game
I'm cutting da flow, like I'm cutting da cane
Things will never be da same
Pause...
There's a lick for 50 bricks
Now pause...
And think about it
Then pause...
Is it really worth it?
Then pause... pause...
FUCK YEAH!!!
I'm ready to go, jump in da ride
Get da mask, get da gloves
Cut off da lights, pop da gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
But don't forget to pick up da prize
And upgrade the ??
If they don't give up da pies
Now...
I would hate to have to calm these boys down
'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal...
Why don't you just give us da keys and pounds
Now Guess What He Said?

Ya'll want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll hurry up and wait! Ya'll hurry up and wait!

I've been brought up,
By street cats who didn't get caught up
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at da Carter
I'm da new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
Little bit smarter!"
Pitbull,Hustler's Withdrawal,/p/pitbull/hustlers+withdrawal_20358923.html,"[Verse:]
Yo, he went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breakin down bricks, servin em rock by rock
He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money and lust, is slowly murderin us
Cause the drug game aint what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream, cause a lot of these drug lords
Turn to the feds, and turn into fiends
The crack game aint everything it's cracked up to be
Now the cat that was a neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks, off the new kids on the block
At the same time, tryna school em
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin
Hustlins like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you wont stkip pain
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

[Chorus 2x]
Hustlins like a drug, it's addicting
The more you huste, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
(Its a hustlers withdrawal)
If you used to push weight, you'd relate

[Verse 2:]
Not only did my father used to deal the dough
He used to do the dope, used to deal
I'm just keepin it real
Now my father doesnt't have shit,
I don't have shit, we don't have shit
Cause he didn't stack shit!
With all the money he made
He didn't think for one second to put money away
That's cause his mind was clattered with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I've gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game, and I hope that yall follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this, money that comes quick, leaves quick
And yall better believe this
Cause this I've lived, and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges, now your on the laws shit list
Now your forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
Cause you can die from doin dope or dealin dope
You choose the road that you get to follow
And you choose the people that you look up to as role models

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3:]
I know about hustlers
But I wont mention no names
Cause they still got cases pending
And some are even appealing life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase: they reached a certain age
Hustlins like ads, at first your infected with hiv
And then it's full blown, only different is
Instead of havin no immune system
You become immune to the system, of havin dough, by a dealin blow
Its a fast life, and even if you survive your mind'll die slow
Dirty money attracts dirty things
And if you plain to deal the dope, I hope your ready for the murder game
Cause that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryna preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but
Yet like a faucet, I'm tryin to leak
Info to these youngns and their kinfolk
And let em know there's more to life than a key to coke
If you use to push weight, then you can relate, cause you've probably had a taste of
Hustlers Withdrawal

See don't be fooled by South Beach
Thinking when you come to the Bottom you can just run these streets
You and your jewels are like a menu
And trust me nigga we intend to eat
Fuck around and cross that I-395
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets
Niggas with wifebeaters and bare feet
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style
Go beyond that about 3 miles and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie ""Scarface""
But the wrong move in this place, you'll fuck around and meet the real Tony Montana
So fuck them palm trees
I got shit for you to really see
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub with niggas buried 4 generations deep
And I aint even talking about sister lined next to brother
I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other
And all that rap about you're Lil Haiti connections?
Nigga you don't even know a real zo
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door
Put you faced down on the floor
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago
But you a star, though
Okay, nigga if you a real G
This is where you tell your car to go
Opa Locka
Where there is continuous spotlight helicopters and a triangle full of choppers
Carol City will make holes in you so big, they can't be plugged by doctors
Nigga, this is the real Dade County
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hurst

Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too

J-j-j-jam on it

[Verse:]
Mr. 305, the Mr. Worldwide
The Mr. Take Nothing, Make Something, that's right
From hanging with thug, goons and gangsters
To doing business with investors, attorneys and bankers
Same story, different suits
Same Chico, just a little different roof
Instead of the corner of the block
It's the corner of the office, I'm noxious from offers
And when I see women
It's mйnages they offer and you know that I'm all for it
Especially if they both on all fours
And you can keep the dawg, they all yours
Two Chevy figure, they county boys
Not even John Lennon could imagine that
Our new paper can buy their newspapers
Millions now, billions later

[Hook: x2]
Jam on it, jam on it
I tell em tell em jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it
J-j-j-jam on it

[Verse:]
Got a bitch for him, got a bitch for me
A bitch that live a bitch kod
Made the office some offers, bitch bringing me offers
Yo big tongue bitch, she swimming with dolphins nigga
Get wet, cars keep ridin by
I'm smoking my wax, I keep getting high
I don't bop, I still money dance
I don't walk, we run this man

Drop it to the floor, let's go
Now little mama get low
Shake that ass, then grab that pole
Drop it low, let's go
Now little mama get low
Shake that ass, then grab that pole

[Hook: x2]
Jam on it, jam on it
I tell em tell em jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it
J-j-j-jam on it

[Verse:]
I jam on it, I jam on it
Bitch scream like the scene in Chochone
Yellow Musoline, smelling cheese all on this
You need new jeans cus you pooped all on it
Oh Lawd, twerk twerk twerk
Hannah Montana I serve
Versace roll on Versace daw
Even put a bid in on a Versace house
She no speak-a ingles and my dog foreign
Brasilian head and that ass she was born with
Pay attention, bitches can't afford
Pronounce it, what that? Think I just bought it

[Hook: x2]
Jam on it, jam on it
I tell em tell em jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it

Ehhh
Wyclef with Pitbull,
The clubs ain't safe tonight

[Chorus - Wyclef]
Mamacita so nice to meet ya,
You drunk off that rum,
You shouldn't drive tonight,
Give me the key to that beemer,
She looked at me and laughed,
Started shakin her ass,
She said her brother just came home
From the jungle
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
Oh
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
Oh
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
Oh
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh

[Verse 1 - Pitbull]
It's a jungle sometimes.
It makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under
With all these around me.
I got em all colors, shapes and sizes,
I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.
Spike Lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'Jungle Fever'.
'Cause I like em a little bit darker
Take it from the back to the front, Rosa Parkuh
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference
As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy
We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen
Coffee with no cream,
That's like a rock with no fiend
Martin Luther King with no dream,
John Lennon Couldn't even imaging such a thing
And for those that don't know nothin,
Welcome to the jungle,
'Clef tell em somethin

[Chorus - Wyclef]
Mamacita so nice to meet ya,
You drunk off that rum,
You shouldn't drive tonight,
Give me the key to that beemer,
She looked at me and laughed,
Started shakin her ass,
She said her brother just came home
From the jungle
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh

Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
Oh
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
Oh
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh

[Verse 2 - Pitbull]
Como?!
If you got that hot blood
Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente,
Turn around now back up,
Preparate mujer que mi lengua es de fuego,
Morenita que rica esta,
She don't speak spanish, Aii mama,
That's cool 'cause I'll put the spanish in ya,
And by the end of the night you'll say aii papa.
I'm that chico that got a fetish with women
Light skin red bones they blow my mind
I'm that chico that'll get em and hit em
Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine
Stop playin with me
Say it with me,
Dale papi, dale papi ohhh
And for those that don't know nothin,
Welcome to the jungle,
'Clef tell em somethin

[Chorus - Wyclef]
Mamacita so nice to meet ya,

Fever,
Watch out watch out
It's that jungle fever
Fever
It's that jungle fever
Fever
It's that jungle fever
Fever
Watch out watch out

[Explanation - Pitbull]
Now what I'mma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to yall,
This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women,
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women,
What it means is, uh:
To get nasty;
To get freaky;
To do things you've never done before;
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever.
Whites, Black, Latin, Chinese, lo que sea.
You know what I'm talkin bout, right Clef?

That’s hard to look with them pretty red lips
And the way soft hand will feel around my uuuu
I know you get the picture now, but I’m staying
You on your knees, I ain’t talking bout praying
I’m all one soul you know I’m feeling right
Little mama gimme a sip of what I would like
Girl I’m motivated and ready from that pone
And the way you look and jeans are driving me crazy
Take it back to my hotel, hotel
Pop a bottle and bow it low like you do

I was wondering

Hear again

No thong up under that skirt
Uuuh I like that
And baby you could get freaky
Yeah that’s cool
You could get loose
Yeah that’s cool
You could have a drink
Yeah that’s cool
Put you on the bar
Yeah that’s cool
The way you shake your ass
I’m like uuuu
Don’t mean to be rude
But I swear to God
There’s so many things
I’d love to do to you
We can take it back to the crib
I show you how I live
I can get view yeah the biz
And you can show me what it is
I wanna see cause I give
Like my tongue be the bridge
Just imagine how that is

Well if that’s the truth then come to my candy shop
Got that chocolate factory open whenever
Let me introduce you to Mr. Willie Wonka
I can tell you know exactly what I’m talking
If I go way staring your lips looking down south
Finish up your drink and let’s head out
Got a feeling you’ll blow my brains out
I’m motivated and ready from that pone
And the way you look and jeans are driving me crazy
Take it back to my hotel, hotel
Pop a bottle and bow it low like you do

I can't believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Roll over, telling everyone
I can't believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my god that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened

Never happened

Last night we were off the chain
You name it we did it, you loved it for sure
I can't remember her name, but her ass that I remember for sure
Convenient amnesia, remember the good, forget the bad
Remember the present, forget the past
She don't get down, then forget to ask her
One life, two worlds
English, spanish, one night, two girls
English, spanish, she's telling to slow down
I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night

Different night different city
Different girl but it's all the same
I party every night like my last
Be careful buddy you may run into my past
I don't got a concience, and I don't got time to deal with the nonsense
I came to get off to everything
So alert all the bonds men
One life, two worlds

I'm not a thug
No, no, no, no
I'm not a gangsta
But I won't hesitate
To c*** back, bust and point blank ya
Lord thank ya
I'm like that coke and weed
When it burn slow
Motherfucker I'll stank ya
That's what I been
Taught on these streets
Aint a god damn thing
That can't be bought on these streets
You want a life gone
That could be done
I'm like a nigga that did ten years
I'm eager to come
In the game
And do more than entertain
I'm loco in the brain
I'm that man with the methods
And I always bring the pain
They know me out here
All these bitches cocaine
Cause they blow me out here
I'm always out here
Y'all keep it real
But I keep it realer
Ima make my first mill off the deal
But I'm still gon be labeled
A cuban dope dealer
I'm just statin the facts
Motherfucker

[Chorus:]
I hang with Puerto Ricans and
Haitian killers and
Cuban dope dealers
And these here my niggaz
I ride for 'em
And god dammit I'd die for 'em [2X]

[Verse 2:]
I got that really foul
Kung flo flow
I'm tryna get that really foul
Kung do doe
But you don't know me homie
So don't judge me
I rep the real Miami
That's why the city loves me
The feds wanna bug me
Haters wanna slug me
I thank God
Cause he's the only thing that's above me
Y'all gon feel me till it hurts
Like
Losin your family over someone elses work
Or
Losin your case cause your co-defendent chirped
Or
Losin your brain cause them thangs done burped
It gets worse
This is for those
That'll never see the sun again
That'll pick through shit
For a balloon just to get it in
This is what was fed to him
This is why the game let him in here
Being me (me)
Being Pit (Pit)
Being It
Pitbull and Trick (Trick)
Both from the down south
Bitch we from the bottom, shit

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3 - Trick Daddy]
Lord your son got problems
And I know that you know
Cause you made this all possible
I live a dangerous ass life you know
So I thank you for your doctors and your hospitals
Thank God for the thugs too
He understand what these drugs do
He wanna see us all pull through
But only if niggaz in the hood knew
Hell, prayin ain't wrong
But the sqeezin trigger
Could you go kill a innocent man
While these weak niggaz grillin his end
They tellin ya dawg
Reducin they buisness
If I wasn't doin this
Then I'd go do him in
Cause if he was dead
He couldn't say he knew me then
For them niggaz who lie
When they pull me in
Its in the same older cell that they threw me in
And I just pray for 'em

[Verse One: 2Pac]
They say more money and women are funny,
But in this tragic endings I can make a million and still not
Get enough for spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell-bound
I'd rather be buried than be worried diffrent than be held down
My game plans to be trained well
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetary car
I've been lost since my adolescent callin from Jesus
Ballin' as a gangsta wonderin' if you see this
Young black male crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die,
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listenin?
Got my hands on my semi-shotgun, everybody's snitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm makin' a point for all my people to be warlike
Buy some shit to have you stupid bitches all tight

[Chorus:]
Go niggas wanna get on that's right
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now

Go niggas wanna get on that's right
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now

I'm doing the impossible
I gotta big flow that's unbelievable,
I'm achieving the unachievable
I'm taking over like coke and baking soda
The streets are waiting for me
But for those who don't know me don't hate on me come on homie

Ya'll should know me better
Don't be mad cause I'm a go getter from the bottom to ny to la
Cubans and Essays and old school Chevys
Blacks and Hispanics getting money I know yall can't stand it
That's why I say fuck 'em that just gives me more reason to buck 'em
If you're felling lucky, then dog, press your luck
And watch how quickly you get stuck I'll make sure when they hold you down
You wont get up, Dade County bet that up.

For building me the way I've been built to the day I get killed
I'ma get money and run through bitches like Wilt the Stilt
Chamberlain empty the chamber in in your face
And leave your brains outa place
That's what happens to slow niggas that think they can live life at a fast pace
To them boys on the way to Tennesse listening to mj G breaking there burrs down in Eightballs
Be careful with them keys
Don't hesitate to squeez watch out from them feds
'Cause they hate ya'll
Bank accounts over seas when them Feds come for me all they gonna find is cds and tapes, dog
Sipping hypnotiq and hennessy I know ya'll envy me but l wont let my tallent go to waste, dog.

[50 Cent]
Now since you're cryin for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nuttin left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not now!
I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playin with guns
While your momma had your punk ass playin tennis

You're like my kinda girl,
She walk like my kinda girl,
She talk like my kinda girl,
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better get in line,
Get in line, get in line,
Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! Cause every nigger in here want you!

You name it, she's got it,... Realistic about it,
Disrespecting, acting fool in public, I doubt it!
If this skeleton is in a closet, that's where she keeps it,
I don't do business with sharks, so she stays quiet and peeps 'em.
Even if she's playing with time sequence, she keeps 'em,
Never goes through his mind, she respects the crown,
I respect her mind, that's why I made her, man!
For me she'll fight the world, and that's my kinda girl!

Get in line, get in line, get in line,
Yeah! Cause every nigger in here want you!

My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision!
That's food for thought; now let 'em haters do the dishes!
A pair of high heels and her stockings business,
And ain't talking fishing, she's got a six sense.
... Don't impress her,
She'll break a full... So watch how you press her!
She came some nothing 'till she know some, yeah, that's true!
For me she'll fight the world, and that's my kinda girl!

Sometimes she's,... Sometimes she's...
And when she's with me, she know she's good,
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!"

[Intro:]
Drop that beat, it's the truth,
You don't know what you have until you lose it

[Chorus:]
I've had all the women you could possibly imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues, earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Verse 1:]
All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time but
I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart is so cold to the point that my blood it froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby, you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex
I'm sorry

[Chorus:]
I've had all the women you could possibly imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues, earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Verse 2:]
I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all
That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby this my life
I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list
Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is Gods plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster
I'm sorry

[Chorus:]
I've had all the women you could possibly imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues, earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Hook:]
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some right (you live and you learn girl)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some right (This the struggle)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some right (from nothing to something)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some right (This all I know)

Done some wrong and some right

And cover the world. I spit so thick?

But I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please

Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2. 50.. A working girl
Now work it, girl! Like..

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I love when I see you break it down like you in control

Intro:
Umm. .. Umm. .. Umm. .. Umm. ..
Anjuli Stars. .. Pitbull. ..
This is dedicated to anybody that's lost somebody important in their life
Don't worry they in a better place now

Verse 1 (Anjuli)
I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breath in life with out you
Every hour is solemn I need you
I'm devoured, I've fallen now what can I do
There is so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside,
Watch as it dies,
I can't even look at the sky,
It's burning my eyes,
Similar to cigarette smoke,
I wish I could float far away from here.

Chorus
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away 4x

Pitbull
Still dealing' with the death of my father/still dealing with the death of my best friend/ Eddie I'm a miss you dog/ but you know I'm a ride to the end, I love you/

I ain't cry when you died, but I'm a let my tears fall on the track/my brother Uly just came home and it feels good to have him back, welcome home dog/

See everything happens for a reason, you don't know what you have till it's gone/ that's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathing and the words of this song/ are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla, but I know in the future I'm a see ya/ I know you both looking down on me proudly, I know ya'll both love me/

Chorus
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away 4x

Pitbull
See in Life things go wrong, if it don't kill it's only gonna make you strong/ so you must hold on, If everything was right then there is something wrong/ Ironic ain't it, that's just the way life is, that's why I thank God any chance that I get for blessing me with beautiful kids/ What's victory with no loss, what's smiling with no tears, what's love with no hate, what's courage with no fear/ just think about it and apply it to your life and no matter what the problem is, don't worry baby, keep your head up it's gonna be alright/

Iamchino
The most winning
Bebo esta noche todos tipos de tragos
Pasan las horas me siento notado
Cuando te veo me pongo animado
Con ese cuerpo eres un atentado
(Que rico)
Siempre ganando
(The most winning)
Nunca perdiendo
(Nah, never)
Chino y Pitbull en el jet
En camino, haciendo historia otra vez

Loca
Tomando un trago a las rocas
Mami tu si estas loca
Vamos a hacerlos así, así, así

No se que paso ayer
(I don't know)
Cuando yo te conocí
(When I met you)
En la cama yo me desperte
(Then I woke up)
And you were naked next to me
(Butt naked)
Entonces yo me pregunte
(Then I asked myself)
Qué es lo que paso aquí?
(What happened?)
Lo unico que yo se
(But this much I know)
Borracho yo se la vi
Borracho yo se la vi

Tomando tequila, ron y cerveza
Botellas de Voli, Buchanan en la mesa
Y los tragos se nos suben a la cabeza
La veo bailando y eso a mi me interesa
Como un regalo que llega por sorpresa
Como animal que va cazando la presa
Hoy tu no te escapas ni que quieras
Esta vez aquí lo hacemos a mi manera

Loca
Tomando un trago a las rocas
Mami tu si estas loca
Vamos a hacerlos así, así, así

No se que paso ayer

From the minute that I seen ya
I was sweatin' ya like a freshman does a senior
I couldn't even sleep
Waitin' for the next day
Just to see ya
Girl just to see ya
When you walked by, my heart
Skipped a beat Like a scratched cd
I was knee deep
And them four letters
L O V E sprung on spring love
Damn she got me

This that new millennium spring love
With Stevie B the originator
Pitbull the innovator
This for all the spring breakers out there
In cancun, cabo, rosarito beach, daytona beach,
Panama city
This dedicated to yall(you know what it is)
Go ahead and enjoy spring break, spring love
Stevie B holla at em

[Stevie B:]
I remember when we first started
You came to me and you were broken hearted
I took you in and wiped all your tears away
I gave you loving more than any other gave
Don't you know I'm the one and I love you girl
I don't care what they say you know you are my world
Come back home to the one
Who loves you more and more
Soon you'll see that it was me you were searchin' for

Spring love, come back to me
Spring love, come back to me
I need you and I want you baby

[Pitbull:]
I remember when I seen you in the club
In that dress in them heels
You was dressed to kill
With that????? Only got s** appeal
I was feeling like I was on X fa real
Those lips
Those eyes
Those hips
Those thighs
Got me hypnotized I'm sprung on spring love
Damn she got me

[Stevie B:]
I can remember the first time we ever met
The sun was shining
Love was gleaming in the air
You caught my eye and the next thing that I knew
I was in love - I was so in love with you
We were so close for a season of my life
I wanted so much to have you for my wife
But something changed
Season came to an end
I had to leave you
And that's where my heartache began

Spring love, Come back to me
Spring love, Come back to me
I need you and I want you baby

[Pitbull:]
So we finally met
Had a couplpe of shots at the bar
And from there we went (where?)
To the dance floor spring break spring love
We were sprung and that's for damn sho
Its the last night
So you know that I'm feeling like a bass head
With a glass pipe
Went back to the [ho]tel and beat it up
Damn I'm sprung on spring love

Spring love, Come back to me
Spring love, Come back to me"

Now let me see you go to work on that strip pole
I love it when you work that hit the floor
How you do that gimme some more
Humpback, humpback, hoochie momma
All I really want is some coochie momma
Baby you a star when you work the pole
We don't make it rain we make it snow
When you go fast then break it down slow
From the window to the wall
Get low
This is for the strippers that be stripping for them tips
Thick-oh ass big oh tits, fat ass pussy, pretty ass lips
Baby your amazing...

Tell me who your creeping with, I wanna know
Lying to my face again
I know you on the low
My boys done told me that your doin' wrong
So baby tell me...

No le hagas caso daddy
Solo soy tuya, amor
Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

You think that I'm a fool babe
Don't make me lose my cool babe
Not tryin to hear what you say
You can't play me

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air, grabbin' dollars while you droppin' like oh oh oh oh...

You don't know the half of it
I found you out last Friday
Thought I was out to get you
At the club I met Peaches
She said she knew your secret
I asked if you were hookin' or creepin'
I had a quick lap dance
Damn near skeed in my pants (Whoa)
Look how bitches got me sweatin' in my white-T
Lovin' how she do me
Then I saw you in stilettos and a thong
Shaking that booty to the ""Do the Brown"" song (Do the Brown)
Shorty gots to go ooh oh...

You must go
I caught you on that stripper pole
Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while your droppin' like oh oh oh oh (2x)

Let me see you climb the pole to the top
Let go, make it drop
Make it clap, don't stop
One check at a time don't stop
I've been waiting all night to see you take it off
I got some paper baby you can take it all
What you wanna do?
Let me know We can go to the back boom, boom fo' sho
These just them things that be going down in them strip clubs
Bend over baby come over and get these crispy dubs

No le hagas caso daddy
Solo soy tuya, amor
Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

You think that I'm a fool babe
Don't make me lose my cool babe

Catch me on the way to check out my dog

Catch me with a couple beautiful women that's ready for a combo, let's hit the condo
Welcome to the new age hotel, California
Nice to meet you, hermano

Beats taking over the world
Yall better get used to the fact
I jump on the track, drop the bass
And I ain't talkin bout crack
I was born in a era
Where Michael Jackson was still tryna figure out the man in the mirror
And when it came to drugs Miami would always stand and deliver
Welcome to the 80`s
Ladies and gentlemen
I took over the radio, I took over the clubs
Late night, no Letterman
My father, he was never there
But it made me a better man
The party's the world, the world's my girl
I dare you not to let `er in

Just Yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
And now your telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me
Its hurting my soul
Oh baby

But I'm gonna keep on trying

Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But I can't understand the reason
When you tell me your leaving
Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
Its like we are use to each other
How could we do this to each other
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now it's like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby

But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice
Mami you know your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby

These girls got s** written on their face
I'm in the zone ah
About to conquer everything like Rome
I'm feeling golden,
Can't stop 'em, can't control 'em
Only hope to contain unless if you know 'em
Now it's time to get get get crazy
Get get get loose, get get get wild

This my life from dusk til dawn
I'm not the best, I'm just better
Yea, they smart
Me? I'm clever
At 45 thousand feet
You think I care about the weather?
Okay, maybe a little
Turbulence is like fame
It's hard to get used to, especially with YouTube

And I ain't talkin about Lorenas in tutus

Killin 'em in suits then choppin up the deuces

Let me see you get freaky baby!
Let me see you get nasty mami!
Let me see you act like an animal
Straight out the cage baby, Dale!
What I do is unheard of,
With these women I'm O. J.,
I get away with murder!
I'ma hit 'till it's out of order
If it wasn't for are. Kelly,
I'll record her!
Now step to the right!
Now step to the left!
Now hold on one second,
Baby let me catch my breath
Hah, Hah, let's go!
Hah, Hah, let's go!
Hah, Hah, let's go!
Hah, Hah, ah Break It Down!
[Chorus:]

Mami I know how you like it
Just let loose!
Go ahead and relax!
Let me play with your pretty kitty,
Your pretty titties,
And let me play with your ass!
I'm the Chico that'll take you to ecstasy!
What you waiting for?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
When we finish tonight
I'll guarantee that you'll be calling me back
For some more, more, more!
And at the same time
I want you to teach me a little something
Just blow my mind!
You know what I mean
The one below the waist line!
You know me,
Baby I'm freaky!  Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky!  Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky!  Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky!  Freaky?
Baby I'm freaky!

[Chorus:]

It's getting kinda hot in this muthafucka tonight ladies!
That means it's time for ya'll to get all the way wild and loose!
I don't care if you got a man, you single, whatever!
It's time, it's time, it's time, let's go!

[Repeat 2x]
Quitate la ropa, Quitate la ropa!
Quitate la ropa, si estas caliente
Quitate la ropa!"

You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

Loquita, I don't play you, you know what time it is with me
You want my heart, you got the world, 
Now show me you'd ride up there for me
I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin to do
You tryin to rob, steal, take my love, wel fuck you

Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that
Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at
I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't know, play by the rules
Or baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

Yo, I'm in the club, and the place is poppin
Seen a sit in bar, and her face is knockin
Times are great, cuz I'm with my crew
But my smile was fake, cuz I'm missing you

Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson
Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep telling myself that a player ain't suppose to cry

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

She took my love, and played me for a sucker
But it don't even matter, cuz you know I still love her
She took my heart, and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter, cuz I still want her around

She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heartbreaker
But a great lovemaker, all in a sheet
She made my heart skipped a beat
But for now she's a close as it comes
Not mags, no life and no guns
She took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love"

Oh and for that bread

I'm fully prepared to pump lead
At any nigga that wanna bump heads
So bring it
But when them things go Rr-rr-rr-rringing
Someones gonna get hit
And that's a fact, not an opinion
I'm buiding my connects
And that there is dangerous
Didn't your mother teach you
Not to talk to strangers?
Then why are you in my ear talking all the shit
Just 'cause I'm cuban doesn't mean I flip bricks
So stop asking me the price on them thangs down here
'Cause that one of them thangs that get chu killed 'round here

But I'd rather die, then let an undercover bite me

That's why I say to myself in the cut

One-time Lebron boss, D-Wade flash
Can’t forget that boy ud, Udonis Has
I’m from Miami Dade Country, born and raised there
Mouth full of gold and diamonds, but talk is cheap
There’s rules and codes, in Dade Country streets
Y’all break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
Don’t think he won’t get me, he done, Mami’ll bring the heat

Here a deposition, watch what you speak
Who’s the definition of Miami? Me
I move cultures, don’t believe me – watch and see
Ask Barack Obama, he’ll bet the White House on me
You got money, yeah – yeah, that’s sweet
But we are no slimmin’, baby, really eat
You talk Miami, if you talkin’ heat
Moral of the story: don’t shit where you eat

Duck charges therefore hardly caught cases
This is a city full of culture and different races
Where all the mami's come fully equipped at young ages
With the hurricanes cause even the biggest hurricane couldn't phase us
We got a dome for the Heat that put y'all to sleep
And we carry hits from night till morning
Like Marino strong armin' the game
But I'm not retiring till I got a championship ring
Poppin champagne simple and plain
Check the map and look where we at
The bottom, simple as that
I'm bringing it back to the fore-front
Like Luke in the 2 Live Crew days
He's the one that's got these mami's going two ways

On the tombstone that stands over his grave to this day!

Ot that's where you can catch Piccalo hollerin 4 life
When I'm downtown I check out the shoe gallery
Cause Danny always looked out for me
Eddie from 24th Street barber shop, kept me out of trouble
I went from the waterboy to the quarterback in the huddle
Callin all the plays I live for, die for Dade
I ride for, lie for, cry for Dade
No if and or buts about it, I'm from Dade
Watch where you hang out in the Grove cause you'll go from
Havin a grand in hand to layin stiff on Grand Ave

And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties don't stop till the next afternoon

Pitts that chico from the bottom
That's about to take over the rap game that's if they allow him
You know the city of Miami got the country spooked
Y'all got Uncle Sam, we got Uncle Luke
Where the poorest city, according to census report
That's cause they didn't count all the bricks that came through the port
Live by the code die by the code
So much cane done came thru this city we named 40th street Bird Road
Who made Opa-Locka? Who knows
All I know is you don't wanna get caught up in the triangle
After dark trust me bro, trust me bro
Carol City stays Cheifen, Hialeah Mango-hill them chicos stay beefin
Alapatah A. K. A. Dominican town dique cause there's nothing but Dominicans now
And to them little Havana boys that hold me down
Bet that up, Wynwood put them up
To all the Haitians from Little Haiti that show me love
Sak Passe gracia dios ya llegue
Now I'm on my way to the top bringin the bottom with me
You got a problem with that then obviously you got a problem with me
Pitbull putting it down for our city. Miami

Pitbull M. I. A. M. I. Tike to put Miami on the map
We on the rise M. I. A. M. I. Nigga shat?

Welcome to Miami where they hustle hey

Through hoops he skipped, high wires he tripped, and all the while the glare
Of the aching, baking spotlight beat down upon his cloak
And though the crowd clapped furiously they could not see the joke

As jugglers danced, and horses pranced and clowns clowned endlessly
But trunk to tail the elephants quite silent, never spoke
And though the crowd clapped desperately they could not see the joke"

Still sees the truth quite easily
But shrouds all else in mystery
While madmen in top hats and tails
Impale themselves on six-inch nails
And some Arabian also-ran
Impersonates a watering can

Some Santa Claus-like face of note
Entreats my ears to set afloat
My feeble sick and weary brain
And I am overcome with shame
And hide inside my overcoat
And hurriedly begin to quote
While some Arabian sheikh most grand
Impersonates a hot-dog stand

The Red Cross ambulance outside
Can only mean that I must hide
'til dusk and finally the night
When I will make a hasty flight
Across the sea and far away
To where the weary exiles stay
And some Arabian oil-well
Impersonates a padded cell"

The bitter taste of love
The hand that reached inside your purse
The fist inside the glove
Remember how it felt to be
The only one who cared
You peeked behind the open door
The bride is always bared

You always knew this day would come
You lie in bed alone
The tv flickers silently
A dream in every home (early mixes exist in which gary sings 'a dream without a home')

Remember when you felt it first?
When you played kiss and tell
The moment that the arrow pierced
The pearl inside the shell
Remember how good it felt to be?
To really come alive
You peeked behind the open door
The secrets of the hive"

She covers the angles, she's dressed for success

She don't bring me water
She don't give me food
All that she got is a real attitude

Her mood swings are violent, it can't be denied
She kisses the bridegroom and disses the bride
Godfather's baby who gets every wish
She drinks with the family, she's taking the fifth

I'm buying an island, somewhere in the sun
I'll hide from the natives, live only on rum

I'm selling my memoirs, I'm writing it down
If no one will pay me I'll burn down the town
I'll rent out an aircraft and print on the sky
If God likes my story then maybe he'll buy

I'm buying a ticket for places unknown
It's only a one-way: I'm not coming home
She's swallowed my secret, and taken my name
To follow my footsteps and knobble me lame"

'all hands on deck, we've run afloat! ' I heard the captain cry
'explore the ship, replace the cook: let no one leave alive! '
Across the straits, around the horn: how far can sailors fly?
A twisted path, our tortured course, and no one left alive

We sailed for parts unknown to man, where ships come home to die
No lofty peak, nor fortress bold, could match our captain's eye
Upon the seventh seasick day we made our port of call
A sand so white, and sea so blue, no mortal place at all

We fired the gun, and burnt the mast, and rowed from ship to shore
The captain cried, we sailors wept: our tears were tears of joy
Now many moons and many junes have passed since we made land
A salty dog, this seaman's log: your witness my own hand"

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
And the waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, ""There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see. ""
But I wandered through my playing cards
And they would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open wide
They might have just as well been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, ""I'm here on a shore leave,""
Though we were miles at sea.
I pointed out this detail
And forced her to agree,
Saying, ""You must be the mermaid
Who took King Neptune for a ride. ""
And she smiled at me so sweetly
That my anger straightway died.

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is it's queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly,
Turned a whiter shade of pale"

And if at times my nonsense rhymes then I'll stand trial
My friends are all around me but they only breathe through fear
Were I to cry, I'm sure that still they'd never see a tear

In darkness through my being here, away from you
The bright light of your star confronts me shining through
Dull and sullen, much subdued, my skull a stony glaze
Whirlpools rage on constantly, I'm not so well these days
There must be something somewhere near who sees what's being done
The harbour lights are burning bright, my wax is almost run

In darkness through my being here, away from you
The bright light of your star confronts me, shining through
Come Lollard, raise your lute and sing, and to my ears her beauty bring
Like Maddox in the days of old we'll feast and drink until we fold
And folding still we'll spare a thought for what's been lost and what's been caught
And maybe then begin again for love is life, not poison

There are no signs which can be seen

Upon your silver shield
And in your rusty scabbard now
The sand has taken seed
And though your jewel-encrusted blade
Has not been plundered still
The sea has washed across your face
And taken of it's fill

You did not conquer, only die

You'd better listen anybody, cause I'm gonna make it clear
That my life is unimportant; what I've done I did through fear
There's a river running through me: on it's tide I tried to hide
Nonetheless I could not shake it, and in the end it swept aside
All my feeble unimportance. I can't say it, never mind
Can't you hear me mother calling you? I'm cold, I'm deaf, I'm blind
And if only cause you're lucky, we both know that's no find
I did think I'd be an actor. What I am I'll leave behind

You'd better listen anybody, cause it's me and you --that's it
And in case you find your maker perhaps you'll plead for us a bit
All my sick is in my stomach, all my sweat is clearly fear
And if you could see inside me I don't think you'd have me here
Tell the helmsman veer to starboard, bring this ship around to port
And if the sea was not so salty I could sink instead of walk
And in case of passing strangers who are standing where I fell
Tell the truth: you never knew me, and in truth it's just as well"

Concerning myself, and somebody like me

We were in some city, the stranger and me
The houses were open, and the streets empty
The windows were bare, and the pavements dirty
I asked where I was; my companion ignored me

We entered a graveyard and searched for a tombstone
The graves were disturbed, and the coffins wide open
And the coprses were rotten, yet each one was living
Their eyes were alive with maggots crawling

I cried out in fear, but my voice had left me
My legs were deformed, yet I moved quite freely
My head was on fire, yet my hands were icy
And everywhere light, yet darkness engulfed me

I managed to scream and woke from my slumber
I thought of my dream and lay there and wondered
Where had I been? what could it mean?
It was dark in the deathroom as I slithered under"

Procol Harum,In Held 'twas In I,/p/procol+harum/in+held+twas+in+i_20111579.html,"Glimpses of Nirvana

In the darkness of the night, only occasionally relieved by glimpses of Nirvana as seen through other people's windows, wallowing in a morass of self-despair made only more painful by the knowledge that all I am is of my own making...

When everything around me, even the kitchen ceiling, has collapsed and crumbled without warning. And I am left, standing alive and well, looking up and wondering why and wherefore.

At a time like this, which exists maybe only for me, but is nonetheless real, if I can communicate, and in the telling and the bearing of my soul anything is gained, even though the words which I use are pretentious and make you cringe with embarrassment, let me remind you of the pilgrim who asked for an audience with the Dalai Lama.

He was told he must first spend five years in contemplation. After the five years, he was ushered into the Dalai Lama's presence, who said, 'Well, my son, what do you wish to know? ' So the pilgrim said, 'i wish to know the meaning of life, father. '

And the Dalai Lama smiled and said, 'Well my son, life is like a beanstalk, isn't it? '

Held close by that which some despise
Which some call fake, and others lies
And somewhat small
For one so tall
A doubting Thomas who would be?
It's written plain for all to see
For one who I am with no more
It's hard at times, it's awful raw

They say that Jesus healed the sick and helped the poor
And those unsure
Believed his eyes
- a strange disguise
Still write it down, it might be read
Nothing's better left unsaid
Only sometimes, still no doubt
It's hard to see, it all works out"

Who is now off to the wars
And although his eyes are crying
We know grief is not the cause
And if grief is not the reason
He must be of sterner stuff
And his sword though old and rusty
Must be blunt as sharp enough

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the broken window pane
Stand the remnants of the evening
Who are waiting all in vain
For the crowing of the cockerel
Showing morning is not night
But the air is filled with silence
And the daylight is not bright
But still darkness is no reason
We are men of sterner stuff
And our swords though old and rusty
Still are blunt as sharp enough.

In the wee small hours of sixpence
And the hat-stand in the hall
Waiting only for the morning
Shadows flitting 'cross the wall
And perhaps that old retainer
Whom now giving of his all
May have once been just as we are
And now has no face at all.

And his sword though old and rusty
Still was blunt as sharp enough."

On the last train to niagara, on the fast train to the falls

I was feeling kind of empty, feeling kind of bleak
I was twice removed from yesterday, but halfway through next week

I was searching for the missing chord, I'd missed it for awhile
Then they played a song from long ago, a picture through the glass
The story of a spanish brave whose light was fading fast

The tracks were humming harder now, the room began to sway
The music turned much louder now, as the ceiling flew away (+awsop, + asd)
A crowd of drunken sailor boys came in upon the sea
The captain wanted action fast, the crowd was getting mean

(climbing scale from whaling stories)

Then I smoked another cigarette, and fixed another drink
When you're out there in deep water, you just can't afford to sink
I was halfway through the looking glass, halfway up to mars
It was getting close to morning time, somewhere 'neath the stars

(excerpts from strangers in space, the worm and the tree, and the climbing theme from rambling on)

Just then a passing mermaid came and took me by the hand
She gently soothed my fevered brow and led me back to land
When I heard the sound of laughter, woke up upon my knees
I was heading to that preacher man, to give me my reprieve

(fragment of the devil came from kansas)

Well the preacher-man said, he said 'son, you won't find favour on the dark side of the street
Better straighten up your overcoat, and get back on your feet
No use looking to the future, if you keep on coming back,
And you know you're going nowhere, if your shoes don't fit your hat. '

Why I personally attended his funeral
Which was twelve months to this very day
A rat flew down from the ceiling
Alighted upon my right ear
Said if Monsieur are. Monde is safe under the sod
Then why are you shaking with fear
My name is not Scrooge I said faintly
And from ghosts I have nothing to fear
But if you are are. Monde returned from the dead
Then what are you wanting here

From nowhere a voice to me cried

They took us victims of the rope
And cast us far beyond the deep
To lie in never ending sleep

At first I took my weight to be an anchor
And gathered up my fears to guide me round
But then I clearly saw my own delusion
And found my struggles further bogged me down

In starting out I thought to go exploring
And set my foot upon the nearest road
In vain I looked to find the promised turning
But only saw how far I was from home

In searching I forsook the paths of learning
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me
And still no hidden truths could I unfold

He said, 'Hey wait a minute! Don't you realise the danger?
What do you think you are, some kind of angel?'

I considered for a minute, realised he spoke the truth.
For the barbells on my eyelids only emphasised my youth
And the sawdust in my plimsolls means the same to him as me
But that's neither here nor further, so I spoke considerately
'Now if you understand just what I'm trying to say,
Whatever you do, don't grin, you'll give the game away!'

By now a crowd had gathered and it seemed that all was lost
In the anger of the moment I had diced with death and lost
It seemed to me the time was right so I burst into song
In the anger of the moment the crowd began to sing along
I could not see a way out of this predicament
Just then a breeze came through the trees and up in the air I went

I must have flown a mile, or maybe it was eight
Thought to myself pretty soon I'd hit the Golden Gates
Just then a passing bird for no reason I could see
Took a peck at my wings and that was the end of me
I went down, hit the ground faster than the speed of sound
Luckily I broke no bones only tore my underclothes"

When you're out in the dark
Nothing to believe in
And you can't find a way back home
There's a man with a secret
There's a visionary sister
Who knows what's right or wrong?
Little by little I turn to the light
And one day I'll be satisfied
Like the hand that rocks the cradle
I gotta be gentle and strong
The hand that rocks the cradle
Gonna be the lucky one
When the wind blows cold
And you lose your resistance
Slipping down on the darkest side
You can push too hard
You can run too fast
Don't get lost in the looking glass
Little by little the wheel turns around
And one day I'll be satisfied
Like the hand that rocks the cradle
I gotta be gentle and strong
The hand that rocks the cradle
Gonna be the lucky one"

They knew his secrets every stitch

Nothing but a charlatan
Perhaps there was a chance of coming through
It even seemed that he might think it too
But he could see no point in diving in
He knew that he would neither sink nor swim

And so they found he'd nothing left to say
Just another idol turned to clay

It seemed to them he must know what to do
They knew that only he could pull them through
They thought that he would make a plan
He'd work it out, he'd understand
Like drowning men they clutched at every straw
They knew that he had saved them all before

He knew that he would neither sink nor swim"

Just a subtle hint of danger
And a woman dressed in black
Out lookin' for a stranger
Well she took me to her room
Where she offered me a wager
She promised me the moon
So I took a chance

Yes I played the king of hearts
Put my cards out on the table
I thought the odds were in my favour
But she laid the ace of spades
An' I wound up where I started
The king of hearts no more
But the king of the broken-hearted

She cut the deck one more
By the light of thirteen candles
She said, ""the winner takes it all --
Is that too much for you to handle?
So I wandered through my playing cards
And tried to understand her
I was lookin' for a face
It was right there in my hand

Yes I played the king of hearts
Put my cards out on the table
I thought the odds were in my favour
But she laid the ace of spades
An' I wound up where I started
The king of hearts no more

You told me love was blind
But you were only joking

But I still keep on hoping.
Head held high
Eyes on the sky
I know I've got to be strong
If I see you again
It will be as a friend
With time for a long goodbye
You know I felt so bad
When I left you at the station
It was the first time I
Had felt such desolation
It's been a long, log time
And I still can't forget you
But my friends all say
That maybe I don't want to.

The camera dissolves a crescendo of screams

The memory's imprinted like some dreadful sore
The fearful reminder: the mark of the claw

A question of judgement concerned in the case
The method of access regarding the place
The possible motive the absence of blood
The theories unanswered regarding the thud

The outcome was certain the jury was hung
Their verdict resolved by ruling of thumb
The judgement was mercy: they tendered the plea
The judge raised his hand and the prisoner was free"

It stood there in silence: the worm grew and grew
The tree was unhappy but what could it say

The worm was so greedy it ate more each day
And each day it ate more the tree shrank away
The worm was so loathsome it felt no disgrace
The birds had been silenced the sun shunned that place
And all of the forest grew fearful to see
What terrible fate lay in store for the tree
The worm grew so monstrous its greed knew no bounds
The smell was so awful if poisoned the ground
And all of the creatures that lived in the wood
Were sickened and starving the worm spoiled their food
The birds would not sing and the sun could not shine
The forest lay dirty and blackened with grime
Now down in the forest a young man went riding
He passed by the great tree and saw it was dying
The leaves and the bark were all rotten and rife
The tree had been poisoned and drained for its life
He stripped of a piece of the bark of the tree
And straight'way he know what the right cure should be
The man built a fire and chopped down the tree
The worm started screaming it could not break free
It trashed and it lashed but it could net break loose
Trapped in that tree like a thief in a noose
The worm burst asunder a vile smelling crust
He hacked it to pieces and burnt it to dust
The forest seemed clearer and peacful at last
Like after a storm when the rainclouds have passed
And although the great tree was fallen and dead
They knew from the ashes a new life would spread
Yes although the great tree had fallen and died
They knew from the ashes a new one would thrive
Now years may have passed since the tale I have told
Yet the truth of this story does still seem to hold
Although from a great tree a small worm may grow
That eats it with poison and tortures its soul
The worm can be killed yet the tree be not dead
For from the roots of the elder a new life will spread"

Six bells struck, the pot was boiling - soup spilled out on passers-by
Angels mumbled incantations, closely watched by God on high

Lightning struck out - fire and brimstone! Boiling oil and shrieking steam!
Darkness struck with molten fury, flashbulbs glorified the scene
Not a man who had a finger, not a man who could be seen
Nothing called (not name nor number) - echo stormed it's final scream

In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky

And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes

I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While ray and philomena sang
Of my elusive dream
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

And I stepped into your arms

Covered in a cloak of silence

Pogues,Big City,/p/pogues/big+city_20109799.html,"In the big city
Where the lights are low
Cold dirty ground
Where the rivers don't flow
Nothing's gonna change so throw it all away

In the big city
Where the kids will come cheap
And monsters prowl and never sleep
Don't cross the road if you haven't got the time of day

Well I lost my girl waiting for the train from ride
I know she's out there somewhere
Selling all we got but I don't mind

In the big city
You can walk a thin line
Your mother won't know that you do a bit of crime
Your father's on the dole and he really hasn't got the time

In the big city
Where it's hard to see the sky
And the black earth trembles when the trains go by
And the bums on the corner tell you gently
To fuck off and die

Well I lost my girl and I missed my train to ride
And I'm stuck here selling papers
And spitting on the ground when you walk by

In the big city
You can dance all night
Only if you're clean and the lads are not uptight
Or you may as well forget it and wait until the broad daylight

In the big city
Where the suits don't look you in the eye
Learn how to laugh you'll be planning when to die
And don't expect any favours from the cars passing by

I lost my girl waiting for the train from ride
Well I don't mind matching colours or parking people's cars
And telling little lies if that's alright

And he knew an arsenal from tottenham blue

Billy saw a copper and he hit him in the knee
And he took him down from six foot to five foot three
Then he hit him fair and square in the do-re-mi
That copper won't be having any family

Hey billy son where are you now
Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow
Where are billy's bones resting now

Billy went away with the peace-keeping force
'cause he liked a bloody good fight of course
Went away in an old khaki van to the banks of the river jordan
Billy saw the arabs and he had 'em on the run
When he got 'em in the range of his sub-machine gun
Then he had the israelis in his sights, went a ra-ta-ta
And they ran like shiites

Hey billy son where are you now
Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow
Where are billy's bones resting now

One night billy had a rare old time,
Laughing and singing on the lebanon line
Came back to camp not looking too pretty
Never even got to see the holy city
Now billy's out there in the desert sun
And his mother cries when the morning comes
And there's mothers crying all over this world
For their poor dead darling boys and girls

Hey billy son where are you now
Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow
Where are billy's bones resting now

Born on a monday
Married on a tuesday
Drunk on a wednesday
Got plugged on a thursday
Sick on a friday
Died on a saturday
Buried on a sunday"

I'll nevermore pray for rain

Somehow it don't seem right
That something in the moon
Could change these endless days
To lonely nights

I take a stroll down by the sea
And walk along the pier
Then I slip and hit my head
Now's the time to fear

See the surface, see the rocks
See my past fly swiftly by
I feel the water in my lungs
And wake up screaming for my life

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of pontchetrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Card sharks and blue harps
And dolphins who can leap
In my blue heaven
Where I can laugh
And I can weep

Black shapes zip into corners
The big lads start to crawl
To holes of their own making
In the cracks within the wall

Snakes and rats and spiders
I know that they're still there
I pray to God that I may sleep
Without a hope, without a care

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of pontchetrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Felines and sea lions
And rain on the beach
In my blue heaven
With angels who are out of reach

In my blue heaven
There's a bottle of pontchetrain
Chalmette by moonlight
To take away the pain

Nightingales sing
And the bells they will ring
In my blue heaven
The bells of hell
Go ding-a-ling-a-ling"

A few more at the port
I puked up on the gangway
But some kind folks helped me board
They helped me to a table
Poured whiskey down my throat
They sat me at a table
And I lost my watch and coat

First we drank some whiskey
Then we drank some gin
Then we drank tequila
I think that's what did me in
Then we drank some brandy
And the women had a dance
The steward then announced
That we could play the game of ""chance""

We crowded round the table
With our money in our hands
I ended up on the other side
Without a penny in my pants
I woke up in the toilet
When we got to holyhead
The doors were all a-banging
And I wished that I was dead

Then we went through customs
A couple of credited thugs
First they looked for [bombs] and joints
Then they looked for drugs
Stuck a flashlight up my ass
Told us where there's jobs
Said ""fuck off"" now paddy
So I headed for [the s]moke

We got on board the train
And then we had a drink or two
Started playing poker
But the booze ran out at crewe
Some people started sleeping
Others looked for duty free
Some bastard started singing
""the little cottage by the lee""
He then sang ""paper roses""
""boolavogue"" ""eileen aru""
Somebody started slagging off
The pakis and the jews

First I found some whiskey
Then I found some gin
I sat down in the corner
And I read the daily news
First I drank the whiskey

I tried to make the toilet
And I broke my fuckin shin

I was in london in the rain
Staggering up the platform

We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls
And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real
But all I know is I left that place without a penny or fuck all

Song: Jesse James
Jesse James we understand
Has killed many a man
He robbed the Union trains
He stole from the rich and gave to the poor
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain
Well it was on a Saturday night
The stars were shining bright
They robbed the Glendale train
And the people they did say for many miles away
It was those outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Well it was Bob and Charlie Ford
Those dirty little cowards
I wonder how they feel
For they ate of Jesse's bread and they slept in Jesse's bed
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Well the people held their breath
When they heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he came to fall
Well it was Robert Ford in fact who shot him in the back
While he hung a picture on the wall
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave

I fell and tumbled in the hungry grass
That tells the tale of a terrible past
I screamed and rolled and dreamt I fell
Down in the depths of a freezing hell

Could smell the curse on their dying breath

To hell which is circular all around
Down in the belly of the big cold ground

The very trees seemed to bend and stare
I remembered the dunes on a sligo shore
Ran and screamed 'til I could run no more
Over the hill and across the moor
I ran in the house and slammed the door
Just what the hell's that over there
A putrefying corpse sitting in that chair
One place I don't want to go

With me head inise a barrel and me leg screwed in the floor

Mother pack me bags because I'm off to foreign parts
Don't ask me where I'm going 'cause I'm sure it's off the charts
I'll pin your likeness on the wall right buy my sleeping head
I'll send you cards and letters so you'll know that I'm not dead

By this time in a week I should be far away from home
Trailing fingers through the phospor or asleep in flowers of foam
From Macao to Acapulco from Havana to Seville
We'll see monoliths and bridges and the Christ up on the hill

An aria with the Russians at the piano in the bar
With icefloes through the window we raised glasses to the Czar
We squared off on a dockside with a coupled hundred Finns
And we dallied in the 'dilly and we stoaked ourselves in gin

Now the only deck I'd want to walk
Are the stalks of corn beneath my feet
And the only sea I want to sail
Is the darkned pond in the scented dusk
Where a kid crouced full of sadness
Lets his boat go drifting out
Into the evening sun

At nights we'd pass the bottle round andd drink to our lost friends
We lay alone upon our bunks and prayed that this would end.
With walls of moving shadows, and rows of swinging keys
We dreamed that whole leviathans lay rotting in the reeds.

We sailed through constellations and were rutted by the storm
I crumpled under cudgel blows and finally came ashore
I spent the next two years or more just staring at the wall
We went to sea to see the world and what d'you think we saw?

If we turned the table upside down and sailed around the bed
Clamped knives between our teeth and tied bandannas round our heads
With the wainscot our horizon and the ceiling as the sky
You'd not expect that anyone would go and fucking die

At nights we passed the bottle round and drank to our lost friends
We lay alone upon our bunks and prayed that this would end
A wall of moving shadows with rows of swinging keys
We dreamed that whole Leviathans lay rotting in the weeds

There's a sound that comes from miles away if you lean your head to hear
A ship's bell rings on board a wreck where the air is still and clear
And up in heaven that means another angel's got his wings
But all below it signifies is a ship's gone in the drink"

Brought settlers determined to prosper

From the far corners they made it their home

Goin' down in the dirt comin' up with the gold
Like Bill Fuller, the Kennedys and Corleones

Live out you dreams in Amerikay
If you've gut the guts and the bucks, it is said
Every man is a king in the us of A
Every man is a king in Amerikay

The pilgrims these days they are called astronauts
They seek new battlefields on the moon and beyond
To wage their star wars in the sky by-and-by
And to shit on us all from on high

Then when it's all over and the world is no more
When the White House and Kremlin have settled their score
The stars and stripes flag will fly high, proud out there in space
And that's why we all love the United States

In the land of Republican automatons
Uncle Sam's forces so gung-ho and bronzed
Just waiting their orders from Washington
To fight for your peace and your freedom

Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador
How foolish of you not to open your doors
To the Hersheys, Budweisers, Mcdonalds and more.....
This wonderful life could be yours"

On the strings of the wind

The sirens play a symphony
I hear the angel sing to me
My heart beats like a drum

Down on a dead end street
Looking in the eyes of an angel
In the eyes of an angel

Yeah.

Night falls and lovers kiss,
On neon stars I made a wish
Walking down a street of light
Love burns a naked flame
Love burning in the rain
I'm lost in the city night
Into the blue, out of this world
Oh I can see for miles

Down on a dead end street
Looking through the eyes of an angel

I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
Where all our dreams come true.

They got cars big as bars
They got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold christmas eve
You promised me broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome you were pretty
Queen of new york city when the band finished playing they yelled out for more
Sinatra was swinging all the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night.

And the boys from the nypd choir were singing Galway Bay
And the bells were ringing out for christmas day.

You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old s*** on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy christmas your arse I pray god it's our last.

And the boys of the nypd choir's still singing Galway Bay
And the bells were ringing out
For christmas day.

I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it out alone
I've built my dreams around you

4 o'clock in the morning
When the ambulance arrived
The blue lights were flashing
As they lay my baby down inside

They took her to the hospital
In the darkest hour of the night
They took her to the hospital
In the darkest hour of the night
It was silent as the grave
As my baby lay beneath the light

They turned on the gas and cut her open
She didn't feel no pain
They turned on the gas and cut her open
She didn't feel no more pain
Daylight was breaking
And down came the rain

For a day on the rant with some music and more
They'd drink porter in maura's way over in fore
And never get drunk but stay sober

There was harry the banjo and dunne of the swan
With whose bone from the wing he'd beat the bodhran
And the song that he'd sing was of ganders and all
He'd never get drunk but stay sober

There was woods on the guitar and auld squeeze box too
Who came from a time before aeroplanes flew
He'd sit in a corner and mule quite a few
And he'd never get drunk but stay sober

There was mahon the singer who knew all the songs
And never was known to put a foot wrong
He'd sing through the night till the break o' the morn
And he'd never get drunk but stay sober

Then harry the banjo now there was a man
A bottomless pit if ever there was one
More porter he'd lower that there was in the land
And he'd never get drunk but stay sober

Well the gartloney rats would play away
They'd play for the pints and not for the pay
And the pints they'd go down in the usual way
And they'd never get drunk but stay sober"

The girl from the wadi hammamat
Lovely as a green parakeet
I awake alone again
In the desert of my dreams
A fertile oasis I have seen

I cast my voice to the burning winds
Across the dunes khamsin khamsin
Bring her to me on desire's wings
On the burning desert wind

She means the world to me
In a single grain of sand
Bring a camel to this man
Perched on a bough her tresses hang down
The girl from the wadi hammamat
She is as sweet as a green parakeet

Sometimes it seems like a beautiful dream
The girl from the wadi hammamat"

------------------------------------------

In eighteen hundred and forty-six
And of march the eighteenth day,
We hoisted our colors to the top of the mast
And for greenland sailed away, brave boys,
And for greenland sailed away.

The lookout in the crosstrees stood
With spyglass in his hand;
There's a whale, there's a whale,
And a whalefish he cried
And she blows at every span, brave boys
She blows at every span.

The captain stood on the quarter deck,
The ice was in his eye;
Overhaul, overhaul! let your gibsheets fall,
And you'll put your boats to sea, brave boys
And you'll put your boats to sea.

Our harpoon struck and the line played out,
With a single flourish of his tail,
He capsized the boat and we lost five men,
And we did not catch the whale, brave boys,
And we did not catch the whale.

The losing of those five jolly men,
It grieved the captain sore,
But the losing of that fine whalefish
Now it grieved him ten times more, brave boys
Now it grieved him ten times more.

Oh greenland is a barren land
A land that bares no green
Where there's ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow
And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys
And the daylight's seldom seen.

------------------------------------------------


'twas in eighteen hundred and fifty-three
And of june the thirteenth day,
That our gallant ship her anchor weighed,
And for greenland bore away, brave boys,
And for greenland bore away.

The lookout in the crosstrees stood
With spyglass in his hand;
There's a whale, there's a whale,
There's whalefish he cried
And she blows at every span, brave boys
She blows at every span.

The captain stood on the quarter deck,
And a fine little man was he;
Overhaul, overhaul! let your davit tackles fall,
And launch your boats for sea, brave boys
And launch your boats for sea.

Now the boats were launched and the men aboard,
And the whale was full in view.
Resolved was each seaman bold
To steer where the whalefish blew, brave boys
To steer where the whalefish blew.

We stuck the whale the line paid out,
But she gave a flourish with her tail,
The boat capsized and four men were drowned,
And we never caught that whale, brave boys,
And we never caught that whale.

To lose the whale, our captain said,
It grieves my heart full sore,
But oh! to lose (those) four gallant men
It grieves me ten times more, brave boys
It grieves me ten times more.

The winter star doth now appear,
So, boys we'll anchor weight;
It's time to leave this cold country
And homeward bear away, brave boys
And homeward bear away.

Oh greenland is a dreadful place
A land that's never green
Where there's ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow
And the daylight's seldom seen brave boys
But the daylight's seldom seen."

Somewhere in London
In the middle of nowhere
Didn't have nothing to do that day
Didn't wanna do nothing anyway

You got a way of walking
You got a way of talking
And there's something about you
And now I know I never ever
Want to be without you

I want to be haunted by the ghost
I want to be haunted by the ghost
I want to be haunted by the ghost
I want to be haunted by the ghost
Of your precious love
Of your precious love

The first time I saw you,
Standing in the street
You were so cool,
You could have put out Vietnam
My girlfriends ask me, ""What's he like?""
I say, ""He's kind of shy,
But that's the kind of girl I am,
He's my kind of guy""

I'll build my world around you
I'll bless the day that I found you
I'll stand beside you, I'll never leave

That you'd never believe"
Pogues,Haunting,/p/pogues/haunting_20109802.html,"Sit down on that stool hear the can't of a fool
And a strange tale I'll impart to ye
Of a time that I lived at the buff of a hill
'Neath the burial chambers you see

One Saturday night I got up on my bike
To go to a dance in the town
I set off at seven to be there at eleven
No thought of the rain coming down

As I pushed up the hill the rain started to spill
So for shelter I had to resort
Helter skelter I went as downhill I sped
To the trees at the old fairy fort

I pulled up my bike be a tree in the gripe
To find shelter out of the storm
The rain it came down and like stones beat the ground
But it was grand to be dry in that storm

I was dreaming away about better days
When a voice it says dirty ould night
I fell over me bike I got such a fright
When the ghostly voice bid me the night

I jumped up with a start gave the storm not a thought
As the hail beat a rhythm on me
And I stared at the tree that had spoken to me
Not a body was there I could see

I trembled and shook the tree twisted and booked
As the wind got into a scream
And I grabed for me bike in that devil's owned night
Expecting to wake from a dream

The voice I had heard not another word said
As the hair on the head stood on me
And I said an ""Our Father"" as I peddled much faster
Away from that ghost haunted tree

For weeks and weeks after with nerves a disaster
Nowhere near that road would I go
And from dusk through the night I would shake with the fright
Of the tree that had haunted me so

Now whenever I go to a dance in the town
I make sure not to stop on the way
To be there for eleven I still leave at seven
But I go by a different way"

Starts screaming for his mother

Who killed many a man
He robbed the glendale train;
He stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain. Poor jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life,
Three children,
They were brave;
But that dirty little coward
That shot mr. Howard
Has laid poor jesse in his grave.

It was robert ford,
That dirty little coward;
I wonder how he does feel
For he ate of jesse's bread
And he slept in jesse's bed
Then laid poor jesse in his grave.

To mourn for his life,
Three children,

But that dirty little coward
That shot mr. Howard

Jesse was a man,
A friend to the poor
He never would see a man suffer pain,
And with his brother frank
He robbed the chicago bank,
And stopped the glendale train.

To mourn for his life,
Three children,
They were brave;
But that dirty little coward
That shot mr. Howard

Lt was his brother frank
That robbed the gallatin bank,
And carried the money from the town;
Lt was in this very place
That they had a little race,
For they shot captain sheets to the ground.

To mourn for his life,
Three children,
They were brave;
But that dirty little coward
That shot mr. Howard
Has laid poor jesse in his grave.

They went to the crossing
Not very far from there,
And there they did the same;
With the agent on his knees,
He delivered up the keys
To the outlaws,
Frank and jesse james.

Poor jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life,
Three children,
They were brave;
But that dirty little coward

Talking with his family brave,
Robert ford came along
Like a thief in the night
And laid poor jesse in his grave.

They were brave;
But that dirty little coward
That shot mr. Howard
Has laid poor jesse in his grave.

The people held their breath
When they heard of jesse's death
And wondered how he ever came to die.
It was one of the gang
Called little robert ford
He shot poor jesse on the sly.

Poor jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life,
Three children,
They were brave;
But that dirty little coward
That shot mr. Howard
Has laid poor jesse in his grave.

As soon as the news did arrive;
He said there was no man
With the law in his hand
Who could take jesse james when alive."

Born and bred in the USA

And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right
We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight,
If I have to spend my last pound

Met a little girl in the field canteen
Painted her name on the nose of my plane
Six more missions, I'm gone
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might

Death rainin' out of the London night
We made love 'til dawn

But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home

My P-47 is a pretty good ship
And she took a round comin' cross the channel last trip
I was thinkin' 'bout my baby and letting her rip
Always got me through so far
Well they can ship me all over this great big world
But I'll never find nothing like my North End girl
I'm taking her home with me one day, sir
Soon as we win this war

Now my grandaddy sang this song
Told me about London when the Blitz was on
How he married grandma and brought her back home
A hero thoughout his land
Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego
A couple Purple Hearts and I move a little slow
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows
About a place called Vietnam

Rest with her, or so it seems
I never want to see the world

Picks me up when I'm down
There'd be so much missing from the world
Without her

Tangled up in falling vines
She took my hand, I know she's mine
Pickin' up the pieces of the past

Well, I awoke before the dawn
Dreamed we'd fought and she had gone
Now I know how it feels
Without her

An empty club, when we first met
Sharing our last cigarette
How could I have lived in a world
Without her

The sweetest girl I ever had
She's the best, she must be mad
There's no way I would live in a world
Without her

We walked four miles to get back home
Through the crowds we walked alone
She told me all about her last stand

She looked so fine, so I see
There's no way I'm living in a world

Are washed away by rain
At the dark end of a lonely street
That's where you lose your pain

For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see
I've thought of you in far-off places
I've puzzled over lipstick traces
So help me god, I will not cry
And then I think of lorelei
I travel far and wander wide
No photograph of you beside me
Ol' man river's not so shy
And he remembers lorelei
River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see
If I should float upon this stream
And see you in my madman's dream
I'd sink into your troubled eyes
And none would know 'cept lorelei
River, river have mercy
Take me down to the sea
For if I perish on these rocks
My love no more I'll see
But if my ship, which sails tomorrow
Should crash against these rocks,
My sorrows I will drown before I die

Pogues,Lullaby Of London,/p/pogues/lullaby+of+london_20109733.html,"As I walked down by the riverside
One evening in the spring
Heard a long gone song
From days gone by
Blown in on the great north wind
Though there is no lonesome corncrake's cry
Of sorrow and delight
You can hear the cars
And the shouts from bars
And the laughter and the fights

May the ghosts that howled
Round the house at night
Never keep you from your sleep
May they all sleep tight
Down in hell tonight
Or wherever they may be

As I walked on with a heavy heart
Then a stone danced on the tide
And the song went on
Though the lights were gone
And the north wind gently sighed
And an evening breeze coming from the east
That kissed the riverside
So I pray now child that you sleep tonight
When you hear this lullaby
May the wind that blows from haunted graves
Never bring you misery
May the angels bright
Watch you tonight
And keep you while you sleep"

There were passengers assembled
With their tickets at the station
And me eyes began to dazzle
And they off to see the races

With me wack fol the do fol
The diddle idle day

There were passengers from limerick
And passengers from nenagh
The boys of connemara
And the clare unmarried maiden
There were people from cork city
Who were loyal, true and faithful
Who brought home the fenian prisoners
From dying in foreign nations

And it's there you'll see the pipers
And the fiddlers competing
And the sporting wheel of fortune
And the four and twenty quarters
And there's others without scruple
Pelting wattles at poor maggie
And her father well contented
And he gazing at his daughter

And it's there you'll see the jockeys
And they mounted on so stably
The pink, the blue, the orange, and green
The colors of our nation
The time it came for starting
All the horses seemed impatient
Their feet they hardly touched the ground
The speed was so amazing!

There was half a million people there
Of all denominations
The catholic, the protestant, the jew, the presbyterian
Yet there was no animosity
No matter what persuasion
But failte hospitality
Inducing fresh acquaintance"

But last night down in Lover's Lane she strayed,

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When she woke up and found
That her dream of love was gone,
Madam,
She ran to the man
Who had led her so far astray,
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her lover down,

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail,

She lifted up her head and cried,

By the banks of the thames
Where the cold grey waters ripple
In the misty morning light
Held a match to your cigarette
Watched the smoke curl in the mist
Your eyes, blue as the ocean between us
Smiling at me

I awoke alone and lonely
In a faraway place
The sun fell cold upon my face
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell
Turned to the wall
Pulled the sheets around my head
Tried to sleep, and dream my way
Back to you again

Count the days
Slowly passing by
Step on a plane
And fly away
I'll see you then
As the dawnbirds sing
On a cold and misty morning

He's just made a deal
And the boys they want to take his trousers down
So they buy some little pills
Which will make poor david ill
And the find themselves in some club downtown

Cause the rain keeps pouring down
And I haven't got a clue
Why there's faith in all these clowns

This is the modern world...

Jim and jane hit the grapevine
Cause they're looking for a party
A secret number knows where it can be found
So they pick up pete and sheila
And they head down the m40
But someone said they closed the country down

Meanwhile I've locked myself in the kitchen
Waiting for the storm to pass
And if there's too much damage
I think I'll get the fuck out fast

Took one look at the North Wall
And bid a fond farewell

It's  a hard thing to leave the land
Of your childhood
Touched by the rivers
And kissed by the sea
The places you played
With your childhood companions
To leave dear old Ireland and
Mother Mo Chroi

Though I'm going far away
And I may never return here
There is always one thing
That I'll keep within me
Deep in my heart a furious devotion
The love of old Ireland
And Mother Mo Chroi

At the top of Pentonville Road
I saw the sun setting
The town laid out before me
Looked beautiful to me
Away from all the sighing
The suffering and dying
I dreamed of the future
The young and the free

But the years they go by quickly
Now I know I can't remain here
Where each day brings me closer
To that final misery
My kids will never scrape shit round here
And I won't die crying in a pint of beer
I'm going back to Ireland

You got to hold down the lid of the coffin
And hammer in the last nail

You got to learn
How to find your way to the end of the night
When there's nowhere left to turn
How to keep the last embers of the fire alight
When there's nothing left to burn
How to say goodbye to the ashes that fly
From the cheap metal urn

My baby's gone so far away
She's never coming back to me

She said go to sleep
You got to save
Your anger and rage for the living
'cuase they're no damn good in the grave
And don't waste your time in forgiving
The ones who just don't know how to behave
There's heaven and hell in the world that you live in
But I'm in a different place

I remember it so well 
Said goodbye to the North Wall 
And bid a fond farewell 

When I got down to the smoke 
It was 1963

Round NW3 
I was terrorising grannies
For ten lousy bob a week
I was smashed and blacked
And drunk and yawning in NW3 

In the filth and piss they lived in 
They would sometimes hum an air 
Or talk in tongues of madness 
Keeping time upon a chair 
And for their wrists a numbered tab 
In Westminster morgue 
On a cold hard slab 
When I was still a young man 
In NW3 

Now I'm spent of love and rage
And I'm going home again
Never did nobody wrong
Never earned a decent wage
So thanks for sweet fuck all
Once more look at the North Wall
Say goodbye to all of that
And bid a fond farewell

Looked beautiful to me

Take your pick and your shovel and the bold dynamite
For to shift a few tons of this earthly delight
Yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight.

They died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where
Save the brass in the pocket of the entrepreneur.
By landslide and rockblast they got buried so deep
That in death if not life they'll have peace while they sleep.

The way for a commerce where vast fortunes were made
The supply of an empire where the sun never set
Which is now deep in darkness, but the railway's there yet.

Where scars of old dry rivers run
Night unfolds, a coal black shroud
Across the hard and stony ground

Distant stars shining bright
In the cavern of the night
All is still and silence screams
To the thunder of the lorca train

Flaming steal swift as wind
Wires hum the rails ring
Smokestack burning fiery sparks
Rise up to the stars

Towns asleep by empty roads
Churches rise from crooked roofs
Cloaked in darkness nothing stirs
Grow smaller darker disappear

See the moon so still and cold
A million stars that she'd no warmth
Your nightmares all come out to play
In the silver light

Wait for sunrise in the east
Long shadows crawl across the plain
The ghosts of night will disappear
And lay your fears to rest

Steam hissed up, the hot coals glowed
The furnace blazed, the wheels they rolled
On tracks of iron, straight and cold
The silver moonlight danced

The flames are in the fireman's eye
Orange in the engines glow
Gleaming pistons whirling cranks
Wait for dawn the rooster's crow"

I remember the first time
I saw you on the street
You looked so pretty my heart skipped a beat
I can't wait any longer but I still feel the heat
I'm down but I'm still on my feet

I walked on down the old fairground
Up from the docks blew a lonely sound

I sat for a while on the cold hard ground
Watched the stars slowly turn as the earth spun around
As the past falls behind up ahead there's a crack
Of light shining bright through the night so black
Like a runaway train rolling down the track
From here there's no turning back

Listen to me baby
Once upon a time
My heart was an ocean
You swam against the tide
The time is past for grieving
My tears have all run dry
I'll leave you with my love
And now I say goodbye

The bottles broke the glasses are cracked
The cards are all dealt and the chips have been stacked
The lamp shades busted and the curtains are torn
The door keeps knocking but there's nobody home

Cursed the cars and the rain and the rolling grey sky
I turned around turned my back on that town
And I never looked back again"

Eyes all aflame
Laughing in the thunder
Of the number 9 train
Selling old postcards in rusty frames
A thousand views of oretown
And they all look the same
Dressed up in sandals
And a barbed wire crown
A lot of people loose their minds
Down in oretown

Lock up the lawman
Let go the thief
Rounding up the grey men
Nail them to a tree

Pogues,Rake At The Gates Of Hell,/p/pogues/rake+at+the+gates+of+hell_20305830.html,"I'll be with them asleep and dreaming
I'll be there when they wake with screaming
At the hour of death then I will nurse them
To have a moment more to curse them
Watch the maggots crawl out of them
Hear the angels call above them
Watch them as the cold air sucks them
Down to hell, goodnight, God love them
If any should escape above me
Beg and cheat until they trust me
Drag them down to be damned with me
Laugh at them as they forgive me

Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds,
Still the moon shows no light
This rose is withered, may God deliver
The rake at the gates of hell tonight
Yigh!

I wish that they could walk forever,
On the earth, alone, unfettered
Til they pray for consolation,
Til they beg for sweet damnation
Then I'll come and bring them water,
Bring them hope, bring them laughter
Raise their hopes so sad and sunken
Slash them up as they lie there drunken
Push them down into the foul mud
'Til they choke up on their own blood
Drag them out before their last breath
To take away the mercy of death

Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds
Still the moon shows no light
This rose is withered, may God deliver
The rake at the gates of hell tonight
Yigh!

Mother's eyes are sparkling diamonds
Still the moon shows no light
This rose is withered, may God deliver
The rake at the Gates of Hell tonight

Pogues,Recruiting Sergeant,/p/pogues/recruiting+sergeant_20720193.html,"(Traditional)

As I was walking down the road
A feeling fine and larky oh
A recruiting sergeant came up to me
Says he, you'd look fine in khaki oh
For the King he is in need of men
Come read this proclamation oh
A life in Flanders for you then
Would be a fine vacation oh

That may be so says I to him
But tell me sergeant dearie-oh
If I had a pack stuck upon my back
Would I look fine and cheerie oh
For they'd have you train and drill until
They had you one of the Frenchies oh
It may be warm in Flanders
But it's draughty in the trenches oh

The sergeant smiled and winked his eye
His smile was most provoking oh
He twiddled and twirled his wee mustache
Says he, I know you're only joking oh
For the sandbags are so warm and high
The wind you won't feel blowing oh
Well I winked at a cailin passing by
Says I, what if it's snowing oh

Come rain or hail or wind or snow
I'm not going out to Flanders oh
There's fighting in Dublin to be done
Let your sergeants and your commanders go
Let Englishmen fight English wars
It's nearly time they started oh
I saluted the sergeant a very good night
And there and then we parted oh"
Pogues,Sally Maclennane,/p/pogues/sally+maclennane_20109788.html,"Well jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
And they all looked very happy in the morning

Now jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
When he'd had too many powers
So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving
And he took the road for God knows in the morning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)
I'd like to think of me returning when I can
To the greatest little boozer and to sally maclennane

The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man
I learned to love the virtues of sweet sally maclennane
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
And ended up a barman in the morning

I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
I heard them say that jimmy's making money far away
And some people left for heaven without warning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)
I'd like to think of me returning when I can
To the greatest little boozer and to sally maclennane

When jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone
He asked me all the details of the train that they went on
Some people they are scared to croak but jimmy drank until he choked
And he took the road for heaven in the morning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)

So long yankee break my heart
Now there's nothing left but sorrow
Even the best friends they must part

I walked into the nearest bar
I sat and gazed across the sea
I wandered lonely on the beach
The waves just whispered misery
She had a red red scarf
Around her neck
Her eyes were green
Her hair was black

Ooh she gave me mekong whiskey
Ooh she gave me hong kong flu
Ooh she gave me mekong whiskey
Put me on a breeze to katmandu

(som-yat-zu, som-yat-zu)

I got new papers in a bordello
With some luckies and my i.d.
My heart was pounding like a hammer
Thai thai thai thai thai! I am free

She took my hand without a sound
This was our happy ever after
So motherfucker kiss the ground"
Pogues,Sea Shanty,/p/pogues/sea+shanty_20109775.html,"Dear dirty london in the pouring rain
I wish to God I was back on the sea again
Though that belongs to the world of never will be
There was never a wilder bastard than me on the sea
I could fuck all the whores in damnation me boys
Though they wriggled and hollered and made a great noise
Then I'd drink till I stank and then drink plenty more
And I won't go down to the sea any more
But if I had ten pounds then I'd raise a loud cheer
And I'd toast all me neighbours both distant and dear
And I'd shoot back great belly-crippling buckets of beer
And a pox and a curse on the people round here
Wouldn't give you me the price of a half pint of beer
Wouldn't give you me the price of a cup of good cheer
A pox and a curse on the people round here

A man's ambition must indeed be small
To write his name upon a shithouse wall
But before I die I'll add my regal scrawl
To show the world I'm left with sweet fuck all
And when all of us bold shithouse poets do die
A monument grand they will raise to the sky
A monument made just to mark our great wit
A monument of solid shit now me boys
I met with bill james we fought over crusts
I called him a whore and he booted me crotch
Then we shared out the jack and we thought it a treat

The compliments pass when the quality meet
The compliments pass when the quality meet
The compliments pass when the quality meet"
Pogues,Sit Down By The Fire,/p/pogues/sit+down+by+the+fire_20109736.html,"Sit down by the fire
And I'll tell you a story
To send you away to your bed
Of the things you hear creeping
When everyone's sleeping
And you wish you were out here instead

It isn't the mice in the wall
It isn't the wind in the well
But each night they march
Out of that hole in the wall
Passing through on their way
Out of hell

They're the things that you see
When you wake up and scream
The cold things that follow you
Down the Boreen
They live in the small ring of trees on the hill
Up at the top of the field

And they dance on the rain
And they dance on the wind
They tap on the window
When no-one is in
And if ever you see them

Pretend that you're dead
Or they'll bite off your head
They'll rip out your liver
And dance on your neck
They dance on your head
They dance on your chest
They give you the cramp
And the cholic for jest

They're the things that you see
When you wake up and scream
The cold things that follow you
Down the Boreen
They live in the small ring of trees on the hill
Up at the top of the field

They play on the wind
They sing on the rain
They dance on your eyes
They dance in your brain

Remember this place
It is damp and it's cold
The best place on earth
But it's dark and it's old
So lie near the wall
And cover your head
Good night and God bless,
Now fuck off to bed"

It's the middle of summer and I'm chilled to the bone
There's holes in my shoes where the rain comes in
I'm sitting on top of the world

Walking in the shadows of empty office blocks
I was talking to a stranger and he's on the rocks
Down on the pavement living in a box
I'm sitting on top of the world

Oh no can't anybody see
It's been a bad day and I want a little peace

Oh no won't you please help me
I want to lie down but there's no beds free

Down on the corner there's starry eyed preachers
Rattling cans and pimping jesus
There's madmen on boxes makig speeches
I'm sitting on top of the world

You can't sit in the sunshine or go out after dark
There's dogs on the loose acting like sharks
There's psychos on the streets burning winos in the park
I'm sitting on top of the world

Oh no I wish I was gone
I want to get going before too long

Oh no I want to leave town
But I can't drive my car 'cause they put it in the pound

The masters of industry are killing for oil
There's poison in the air the water and the soil
We're all turning mutant they're counting up their spoils
I'm sitting on top of the world

I turn on the tv and it makes me want to cry
There's killing and there's torture there's destruction and there's lies
And our leaders talk rubbish and more people die
I'm sitting on top of the world

Oh no I can't take anymore
I'm shaking all over and my nerves are all raw

Oh no my head's a little sore
I want to get out but I can't find the door"

The city lights are all aglow

Dreaming of a ticket home
The stars they shine for you and me

I'll have a drink and then we'll see
If the spirit conjures your genie
To lie beside me in my dreams
The wind is blowing a melody
The stars they shine for you and me

Close the door and turn the key

We'll sit up late and watch tv
The neon flashes red and green
The stars they shine for you and me"
Pogues,Smell Of Petroleum,/p/pogues/smell+of+petroleum_20109809.html,"The shaman came a calling
He was howling at the moon
He offered me a vision
On the end of a silver spoon
He said he'd give me dreams
That all were in his powers
If only I would follow him
The universe was ours

Walked a thin white line to the coffin club
Downstairs from the devils den
Had a large double jesus
Chased down with a shot of zen
The last thing I remember
Was lying in the tank
And when I came around again
Everything was blank

Floating high above the world
Out on the astral plane
I'm bouncing like a pinball
He's busy being born again

I met God on primrose hill
That's where he came to me
He stepped out of his saucer
I got down on my knees
From his lips came just one word
He left me all aglow
I sat down and had a smoke
And watched the flowers grow

The bats are in the belfry
And the bubbles in the bong
The secret of the universe
Is hidden in this song

The shaman left a crawling
As the dawn broke the gloom
Talking in some other tongue
And laughing like a loon
The early morning sunlight
Splashed colours on the wall
And I don't know if it ever
Really happened at all

The bats are in the belfry
And the bubbles in the bong
The molecules inside my head
Are chiming like a gong

The bats are in the belfry
And the bubbles in the bong
The secret of the universe
Is hidden in this song"

I dreamt I met with behan

On the crux of life's philosophies
He had but these few clear and simple words to say

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn
Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me
But the rope always was slack
And now that I've a pile
I'll go down to the chelsea
I'll walk in on my feet
But I'll leave there on my back

Because I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke
Seemed the wisest of philosophies
There's nothing ever gained
By a wet thing called a tear
When the world is too dark
And I need the light inside of me
I'll walk into a bar
And drink fifteen pints of beer

Iam going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing

And in the darkened streets the pain
Oh how I long to find some solace
In my mind I curse the strain

So farewell you streets of sorrow
And farewell you streets of pain
No I'll not return to feel more sorrow
Nor to see more young men slain

There were six men in Birmingham
In Guildford there's four
That were picked up and tortured
And framed by the law
And the filth got promotion
But they're still doing time
For being Irish in the wrong place
And at the wrong time
In Ireland they'll put you away in the Maze
In England they'll keep you for seven long days
God help you if ever you're caught on these shores
The coppers need someone
And they walk through that door

You'll be counting years
First five, then ten
Growing old in a lonely hell
Round the yard and the stinking cell
From wall to wall, and back again

A curse on the judges, the coppers and screws
Who tortured the innocent, wrongly accused
For the price of promotion
And justice to sell
May the judged be their judges when they rot down in hell

You'll be counting years
First five, then ten
Growing old in a lonely hell
Round the yard and the lousy cell
From wall to wall, and back again

May the whores of the empire lie awake in their beds
And sweat as they count out the sins on their heads
While over in Ireland eight more men lie dead
Kicked down and shot in the back of the head

You'll be counting years
First five, then ten
Growing old in a freezing hell
Round the yard and the lousy cell
From wall to wall, and back again

You'll be counting years
First five, then ten
Growing old in a lonely hell
Round the yard and the lousy cell
From wall to wall, and back again"

And I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be
Done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the quay
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the
Cheers
We sailed off to Gallipoli

How well I remember that terrible day
the blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well
He  us with bullets, he rained us with
Shells
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia
But the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury our slain
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
Then  started all over again

Now those
In  mad world of blood, death and fire
And for  weeks I kept myself alive

Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit
And when I woke up in my hospital bed
And saw what it had done,  I wished I was
Dead
Never knew there were worse things than dying
no more I'll go waltzing Matilda
the green  far and near
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs two legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me

So they collected the cripples, the wounded
Maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
, the blind  insane
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where  legs used to be
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As they carried us down the gangway
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared
turned all their faces away

And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
my old comrades, how proudly they march
Reliving  dreams of past glory

The forgotten heroes  a forgotten war
And the young people ask, ""What are they
Marching for? ""
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men  answer to the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
Some day no one will march there at all

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
Who'll  a-waltzing Matilda with me?"

To the home where his father's laid

Heard the men coming home from the fair at shinrone
Their hearts in tipperary wherever they go

Take my hand, and dry your tears babe
Take my hand, forget your fears babe
There's no pain, there's no more sorrow
They're all gone, gone in the years babe

I sat for a while by the gap in the wall
Found a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball
Heard the cards being dealt, and the rosary called
And a fiddle playing sean dun na ngall
And the next time I see you we'll be down at the greeks
There'll be whiskey on sunday and tears on our cheeks
For it's stupid to laugh and it's useless to bawl
About a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball

So I walked as day was dawning
Where small birds sang and leaves were falling
Where we once watched the row boats landing
By the broad majestic shannon"

It's of a gentleman soldier
As sentry he did stand
He saluted a fair maiden
By a waiving of his hand
So then he boldly kissed her
And he passed it off as a joke
He drilled her up in the sentry box
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloke

And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare you well polly my dear
I must be going away

All night they tossed and tumbled
Till the daylight did appear
The soldier rose, put on his clothes,
Saying, fare you well my dear
For the drums they are a beating
And the fifes they so sweetly play
If it weren't for that polly my dear
With you I'd gladly stay

And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare you well polly my dear
I must be going away

Now come you gentleman soldier,
Won't you marry me?
Oh no my dearest polly
Such things can never be
For I've a wife already
Children I have three
Two wives are allowed in the army
But one's too many for me

And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare you well polly my dear
I must be going away

If anyone comes a courting you,
You can treat them to a glass
If anyone comes a courting you,
You can say you're a country lass
You needn't ever tell them,
Nor pass it off as a joke
That you got drilled in a sentry box
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloke

And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare you well polly my dear
I must be going away

Oh it's come my gentleman soldier,
Why didn't you tell me so? my parents will be angy
When this they come to know when nine months had been and gone
The poor girl she brought shame
She had a little militia boy
And she didn't know his name

And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare you well polly my dear
I must be going away

'twas on one sunday evening

By shaking of her hand;
By shaking of her hand, my boys,
And the passing of a joke,
I slipped her into the sentry box
And roll'd her up in my cloak.

O! there we toss'd and tumbl'd
Till daylight did appear
Then I arose, put on my clothes,
Saying, ""fare you well my dear.
The drums they are a-beating
And the fifes so sweetly play,
If it wasn't for that, dear polly,
Along with you I'd stay.""

If anyone comes a-courting you,
You treat them with a glass -
If anyone comes a-courting you,
Say you're a country lass.
You need not even tell them
That ever you pass'd a joke,
That ever you went in a sentry box
Wrapp'd up in a soldier's cloak.

""now come, my valiant young soldier,
O! won't you marry me? ""
""o! no, my dearest polly,
Such things they never can be,
For married I am already
And children I have three,
Two wives are allow'd in the army,

Pogues,The Irish Rover,/p/pogues/the+irish+rover_10207476.html,"On the fourth of july, 1806
We set sail from the sweet cove of cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand city hall in new york
'twas a wonderful craft
She was rigged fore and aft
And oh, how the wild wind drove her
She stood several blasts
She had twenty seven masts
And they called her the irish rover

We had one million bags of the best sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stone
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
We had four million barrels of bones
We had five million hogs
And six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bails of old nanny-goats' tails
In the hold of the irish rover

There was awl mickey coote
Who played hard on his flute
When the ladies lined up for a set
He was tootin' with skill
For each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk
He was cock of the walk
And he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance
When he took up his stance
That he sailed in the irish rover

There was barney mcgee
From the banks of the lee
There was hogan from county tyrone
There was johnny mcgurk
Who was scared stiff of work
And a man from westmeath called malone
There was slugger o'toole
Who was drunk as a rule
And fighting bill treacy from dover
And your man, mick maccann
From the banks of the bann
Was the skipper of the irish rover

We had sailed seven years
When the measles broke out
And the ship lost it's way in the fog
And that whale of a crew
Was reduced down to two
Just myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock
Oh lord! what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around
And the poor old dog was drowned
And the las of the irish rover"

With Kitty and Judy and Mary.

My parents rebuked me for being such a rake
And for spending my time in such frolicsome ways,
But I ne're could forget the good nature of Jenny,
Agus fagaimid siud mar ata se.

There's some say I'm foolish, there's some say I'm wise,
And I will find that there are women that think it's no crime;
The son of King David had ten thousand wives
And his wisdom was highly regarded.

In Euclid and grammar they taught me to write
But my heart, it was stolen by a pair of brown thighs
That came from the mountains, her stockings are white,
I'd love to be tied to her garter.

And some yearn for silver, and some yearn for gold
In there Devonshire's treasure's are twenty times more,
But he's lying on his back amongst nettles and stones,
Agus fagaimid mar a ata se.

And when I am dead and I'm laid to my rest
My women and children will came at my wake,
They'll gather around and they'll offer a prayer
To the Lord for the soul of their father."

With a fiver in my pocket and my ole dancing bag
I went down to the dilly to check out the scene
And I soon ended up on the old main drag

There the he-males and the she-males paraded in style
And the old man with the money would flash you a smile
In the dark of an alley you'd work for a fiver
For a swift one off the wrist down on the old main drag

In the cold winter nights the old town it was chill
But there were boys in the cafes who'd give you cheap pills
If you didn't have the money you'd cajole or you'd beg
There was always lots of tuinol on the old main drag

One evening as I was lying down by leicester square
I was picked up by the coppers and kicked in the balls
Between the metal doors at vine street I was beaten and mauled
And they ruined my good looks for the old main drag

In the tube station the old ones who were on the way out
Would dribble and vomit and grovel and shout
And the coppers would come along and push them about
And I wished I could escape from the old main drag

And now I'm lying here I've had too much booze
I've been shat on and spat on and raped and abused
I know that I am dying and I wish I could beg
For some money to take me from the old main drag"

But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips

And betwixt both me and you,

Of the rare poitin from Ireland green,
Distilled from wheat and rye.

Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut the stout black thorn to be on the shores to Dublin
Brand new pair of brogues rattlin' o'er the bogs
Fightin' all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack follol de rah

Something crossed me mind when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Asking for the rogue, they called me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

From there I got away, me spirits never failing
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared that no more room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubblin'
When off Holyhead wished that I was dead
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the way to Dublin, whack follol de rah

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly
Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobblin'
With a loud ""hurray!"" joined in the affray
Quietly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

You need one more drop of poison and you'll dream of foreign lands

When you pissed yourself in frankfurt and got syph down in cologne
And you heard the rattling death trains as you lay there all alone
Frank ryan brought you whiskey in a brothel in madrid
And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the yids
At the sick bed of cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair

And in the euston tavern you screamed it was your shout
But they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows out
They took you out into the street and kicked you in the brains
So you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all again
At the sick bed of cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair

You remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howl
There was lousy drunken bastards singing billy is in the bowl
They took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurch
So you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the church

Now you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocks
And they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a box
Then they'll take you to cloughprior and shove you in the ground
But you'll stick your head back out and shout ""we'll have another round""
At the graveside of cuchulainn we'll kneel around and pray
And God is in his heaven, and billy's down by the bay"

She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair

For to see I was really there
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head
And I looked with a feelin' rare

""Whose the maid with the nut brown hair?""
He smiled at me and he says's, says's he
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of a Bann
She's the star of the County Down""
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
My shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust colored brown
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down

And everything that's calm will turn to madness
And all of your fake tears

And what was kind and warm will come to sadness

And the sun and the moon

And drop from the skies

Is little kids without no shoes

And I got on it
With a heartful of hate
And a lust for vomit

Stepped over bodies in bombay
Tried to make it to the u.s.a.
Ended up in nepal
Up on the roof with nothing at all
And I knew that day
I was going to stay
Right where I am, on the sunnyside of the street

Been in a palace, been in a jail
I just don't want to be reborn a snail
Just want to spend eternity
Right where I am, on the sunnyside of the street

To take my life as I would a whore

Put your glasses down
Sit my friends and listen
To the voices of the drowned

In the moonlight's ghostly glow
I waken in a dream
Once more upon that raft I stand
Upon a raging sea
In my ears the moans and screams
Of the dying ring
Somewhere in the darkness
The siren softly sings

Out there in the waves she stands
And smiling there she calls
As the lightning cracks the sky
The wind begins to howl

The architects of our doom
Around their tables sit
And in their thrones of power
Condemn those they've cast adrift
Echoes down the city street
Their harpies laughter rings
Waiting for the curtain call
Oblivious in the wings

The casket is empty
Abandon ye all hope
They ran off with the money
And left us with the rope"

Were your dollars from the white house

Did the old songs taunt or cheer you
And did they still make you cry
Did you count the months and years
Or did your teardrops quickly dry

On a coffin ship I came here
And I never even got so far
That they could change my name

Their spirits free

In the death of afternoon
We stepped hand in hand on broadway
Like the first man on the moon

And ""the blackbird"" broke the silence
As you whistled it so sweet
And in brendan behan's footsteps
I danced up and down the street

Then we said goodnight to broadway
Giving it our best regards
Tipped our hats to mister cohen
Dear old times square's favorite bard

Then we raised a glass to jfk
And a dozen more besides
When I got back to my empty room
I suppose I must have cried

Thousands are sailing
Again across the ocean
Where the hand of opportunity
Draws tickets in a lottery
Postcards we're mailing
Of sky-blue skies and oceans
From rooms the daylight never sees
Where lights don't glow on christmas trees
But we dance to the music
And we dance

Thousands are sailing
Across the western ocean
Where the hand of opportunity
Draws tickets in a lottery
Where e'er we go, we celebrate
The land that makes us refugees
From fear of priests with empty plates
From guilt and weeping effigies
And we dance"

Tied him to a stake of oak
Lit a fire of wood and coke

The bells rang out ""tosspint's croaked!""

Walks through the fires of hell
Where bestial demons threw the damned
Screaming as they fell

And threw his arms around my neck

Pogues,When The Ship Comes In,/p/pogues/when+the+ship+comes+in_20109767.html,"Oh the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
'fore the hurricane begins
The hour when the ship comes in

Oh the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat that drifts on to the shore line
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're still dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeel
And know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

Then they'll raise their hands
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like pharaoh's tribe
They'll be drownded in the tide
And like goliath they'll be conquered"

I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting.

Said stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver,
Musha ring dumma do damma da
Whack for the daddy 'ol
Whack for the daddy 'ol
There's whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.
I put it in my pocket and I brought it home to Jenny.
She said and she swore, that she never would deceive me,
But the devil take the women, for they never can be easy
I went into my chamber, for to take a slumber,
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.
But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,
And sent for captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter.
It was early in the morning, before I rose to travel,
The guards were all around me and likewise captain Farrel.
I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,
But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken.
If anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army,
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney.
And if he'll come save me, we'll go roving near Kilkenny,
And I swear he'll treat me better than me own sportling Jenny
Now some men take delight in the drinking and the roving,
But others take delight in the gambling and the smoking.
But I take delight in the juice of the barley,
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early"

Is sweeter than the locket on a golden chain
Lights awake down a misty lane
See a rainbow every time it rains.

Love on a left bank, a saxophone sighed
Drifting on a reed around midnight
Wrapped up in the sunset glowing outside
Alone on a deep end in the pink twilight
Snowflakes falling in the Christmas lights
Stars in heaven burning bright
A football flight on the front of the night 
The roar of a crowd red and white

Kissed by a river in the pale moonlight
The words of the poets, lovers who sighed
Beneath the moon's eye in the heat of the night
Bathed in the glow of an old gaslight
Sitting in the rain it's a wonderful life
Take you in my arms and hold you tight
Lost in the stars with the satellites

And heard the curlews cry
Or seen the raven black as night
Upon a windswept sky
To walk the purple heather
And hear the westwind cry
To know that's where the rapparee must die

Since Cromwell pushed us westward
To live our lowly lives
There's some of us have deemed to fight
From Tipperary mountains high
Noble men with wills of iron
Who are not afraid to die
Who'll fight with gaelic honour held on high

A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell
You who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell
For the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers
Whom you robbed of their birthright
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight

Of one such man I'd like to speak
A rapparee by name and deed
His family dispossessed and slaughtered
They put a price upon his head
His name is known in song and story
His deeds are legends still
And murdered for blood money
Was young Ned of the hill

You have robbed our homes and fortunes
Even drove us from our land
You tried to break our spirit
But you'll never understand
The love of dear old Ireland
That will forge an iron will
As long as there are gallant men
Like young Ned of the hill

A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell
You who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell
For the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers
Whom you robbed of their birthright

Why they took her mom and dad away
I know they don't mean to hit
With wild and angry hands
Tell them just how big they are, I Pray.

Oh I hope the doctors stop the pain.
I know that you could save her
And take her up to the sky
So she will never have to hurt again.

The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill is still, Maggie
Since you and I were young

A city so silent and lone, Maggie
Where the young and the gay and the best
In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie
Have each found a place of rest

Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie
And join in the songs that were sung
For we sang just as gay as they, Maggie
When you and I were young

They say I am feeble with age, Maggie
My steps are less sprightly than then
My face is a well written page, Maggie
But time alone was the pen

They say we are aged and gray, Maggie
As spray by the white breakers flung
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie

And now we are aged and gray, Maggie
The trials of life nearly done
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie

Perry Como,'twas The Night Before Christmas,/p/perry+como/twas+the+night+before+christmas_20106932.html,"Twas the night before christmas,
When all through the house,
Not a creature was stirring,
Not even a mouse!

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care,
In hopes that st. nicholas
Soon would be there!

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds,
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads!

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap,
Had just settled down
For a long winters nap!

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter!

Away to the window
I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash!

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow,
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below!

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear,
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer!

With a little ol driver
So lively and quick,
I knew in a moment
It must be st. nick!

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came,
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name:

Now dasher,
Now dancer,
Now prancer,
Now vixen,
On comet,
On cupid,
On doner
An blitzen!

To the top of the porch,
To the top of the wall,
Now dash-away, dash-away,
Dash-away all!

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky.

So, up to the housetop
The courses they flew,
With a sleigh full of toys
And st. nicholas too!

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof,
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof!

As I drew in my head
And was turning around,
Down the chimney st. nicholas
Came with a bound!

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot!

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack!

His eyes how they twinkled,
His dimples how merry,
His cheeks were like roses,
His nose like a cherry!

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow!

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath!

He had a broad face
And a round little belly,
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly!

He was chubby and plump,
A right jolly old elf,
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself!

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread!

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings,
Then turned with a jerk!

An laying a finger
Along side his nose,
An giving a nod,
Up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh,
To his team gave a whistle,
An away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight,
Happy christmas to all,
And to all a goodnight!

And sent us happily on our way! 
Surely here was charm beyond compare to view 
But, maybe it was just that you were there dear, 
You were so lovely! 
'Twas just a garden in the rain, 
But then the sun came out again 
And sent us happily on our way! 
Just a garden in the rain!

And lyrics by James Dyrenforth, 1929"
Perry Como,"A Hatchet, A Hammer, A Bucket Of Nails",/p/perry+como/a+hatchet+a+hammer+a+bucket+of+nails_20106888.html,"A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails 
An' all the wood I can find 
I'll build me a cabin on top of the hill 
Got all the plans in my mind . . . 
Where the tree tops talk to the wind 
Where the eagle flies 
I'll bring her to see it the minute I'm through 
Won't she light up with surprise! 
A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails 
An' just my two hands, but with some help from above 
The walls will start risin', the roof will go on 
The final touch will be love . . . 
Where the tree tops talk to the wind 
Where the eagle flies 
The preacher will bless us as we hurry to 
Our happy home in the skies . . . 
As soon as we're married, 
We're movin' in to 
Our happy home in the skies . . . 
( A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails . . . ) 
Our happy home in the skies . . .

Perry Como,A House Is Not A Home,/p/perry+como/a+house+is+not+a+home_20106666.html,"A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home

When there's no one there
To hold you tight
An' no one there
You can kiss goodnight

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home

When the two of us
Are far apart
An' one of us
Has a broken heart

Now an' then I call your name
An' suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears

Darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home

When I climb the stair
An' turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me

I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair an' turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me"

The still small voice from every voice apart,
Will whisper in the language of your heart,

The dream that keeps a lonely heart aglow!""

Your heart will answer,
""Yes, I know!"""

To confess my sin, to do penance,

A sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply, 
As time goes by

An' when two lovers woo, they still say ""I love you,"" 
On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by

Moonlight an' love songs never out of date, 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy an' hate, 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate, 
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory, 
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers, 
As time goes by

Perry Como,Aubrey,/p/perry+como/aubrey_20106587.html,"And Aubrey was her name, 
And not so very ordinary girl, or name
But who's to blame
For a love that wouldn't bloom 
For the hearts that never played in tune ? 

Like a lovely melody
That everyone can sing
Take away the words that rhyme
It doesn't mean a thing

And Aubrey was her name
We tripped the light 
And danced together to the moon 
But where was June? 
No, it never came around
If it did, it never made a sound 
Maybe I was absent
Or was listening too fast
Catching all the words
But then, the meaning going past

Oh, how I miss the girl
And I'd go a thousand times around the world
Just to be
Closer to her, than to me

And Aubrey was her name
I never knew her
But I loved her just the same
I loved her name

Wish that I had found a way
And the reasons that would make her stay
I have learned to lead a life
Apart from all the rest 
If I can't have the one I want 
I'll go without the best

Oh, how I miss the girl
And I'd go a million times around the world
Just to say
She had been mine for a day!"

Were searchin' for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon
As only they can

They only had the rhythm, so
They started swayin' to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singin' weird melodies
And they made that
The start of the blues

And from a jail, came the wail
Of the down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill
Out on the hill
They took a new note
  (Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, whippoorwill)

Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was worn
Into a blue note
  (Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, whippoorwill)

An' then they nursed it and rehearsed it
And gave out the news

Perry Como,Black Moonlight,/p/perry+como/black+moonlight_20106924.html,"Lost in the shuffle, I've drifted an' strayed
Bruised by the city, bewildered, betrayed
With a heart heavy laden with faltering strides
I have come to the bridge, to the line that divides

What am I doing up here in a daze
As I gaze at the cold river bed
Why do I ask myself, ""Shall I go back
When I seem to be going ahead""

To black moonlight
Where everything reflects your color
Darkness that is endless
Nights that leave me friendless blue

Black moonlight
You make the lights of Harlem duller
Just like me you're faded
Jaded and degraded too

Why must you send
Ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing
Like shadows of love
That are gone?

Where will it end?
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight
And darken each
Promise of dawn?

Black moonlight
I've lost all power to resist you
Madly, I await you, even though I hate you
Black, black moonlight"

Letting in God's

Ablazing there
With smoke ascending
Like a prayer

Bless the people
Here within
Keep them pure
And free from sin

Bless us all

To dwell
With Thee

We may dwell

Where every day's a holiday,
Because you're married to me. ..

Not like a ball room,
A small room, a hall room,
Where I can smoke my pipe away,
With your wee head upon my knee. ..

We will thrive on, keep alive on,
Just nothing but kisses,
With mister and missus,
Own little blue chairs. ..

You sew your trousseau,
And Robinson Crusoe,
Is not so far from worldly cares,
As our blue room, far away upstairs. ..

'H' for herald angels in the night
'are' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright 
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far 
'M' is for the manger where He lay

And the couples stopped swaying
But we kept on dancing

The lights went on
And the crowd was gone
But we kept on dancing

The janitor said
Please let me sweep the floor
So, I hummed a tune and we
Danced right through the door

It started raining
But we both were insane
And we kept right on dancing

We looked a sight
By the traffic light
But we kept on dancing

The signal was red
So we just tapped our feet
When the light turned green
Well, we danced across the street

(Couples parked in cars
Were romancing)
They were romancing
But we kept right in dancing

Our clothes were dripping
And we couldn't help slipping
But we kept right in dancing

Our feet were sore
When we reached your door
But we kept on dancing

When I kissed you goodnight
My heart started dancing too
That's when I knew that I would
Dance my whole life through
With only you

With only you
With only you
My whole life through
With only you"

Toward a closing door,

Filled with memories,
Of the golden smile,
That introduced me to,
The days of wine and roses,
And you!

Perry Como,First Christmas,/p/perry+como/first+christmas_10203778.html,"Hi boys and girls, i'm perry como,
And i'm gonna tell you the most wonderful story in the whole world,
The story of the first christmas!

Now suppose you make believe this is many, many years ago,
A long time before you were born!
You're standing on a hillside, near a little town in palestine,
Do you see the man in the distance, walking slowly, leading a donkey?
His name is joseph!
And riding on the donkey is mary.
They've come a long, long way,
And they're heading for the town near the hillside,
On which we're standing!
Something very special will happen in this town tonight!
For this is the little town of bethlehem!

Oh little town of bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie,
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep,
The silent stars go by!
Yet in thy dark streets shineth,
The everlasting light!
The hopes and fears of all the years,
Are met in thee tonight!

Now let's follow joseph and mary into bethlehem,
It's getting dark and all the rooms at the inn are taken,
So they spend the night at a stable.
Now i told you something special was gonna happen, and it did!
A baby boy is born to mary,
And they called him jesus.
They had no baby's crib, so mary puts little jesus to sleep,
In the soft sweet hay of a manger!

Come, come, come to the manger,
Little lord jesus is born on this day!

Now while jesus lies in the manger asleep,
Let's tiptoe back to the hillside near bethlehem,
Where the shepherds tend their flock.
All at once the shepherds are frightened,
You'd be frightened too,
Because a great light suddenly shines in the sky!
Even the animals are hushed and still,
But then you hear the voice of an angel of the lord!
And you're no longer frightened,
For the angel brings good news,
News of a saviour born this day,
News of christ the lord!

The first noel! the angels did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds,
In fields as they lay,
Noel, noel, noel, noel!
Born is the king of israel!

Now boys and girls,
Remember, we're still making believe we're with the shepherds and the angel,
On the hillside near bethlehem.
The shepherds ask the angel,
Where to find the christ-child ?
And the angel tells them to go to the manger.
And as they leave the sky is filled with others angels singing,
Glory to god! on earth peace, goodwill, to men!



The shepherds hurry to the manger,
Fall on their knees before the baby,
And they worship him!
For he is christ the lord!

Oh! come all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant!
Oh come ye, oh! come ye, to bethlehem!
Come and behold him,
Born the king of angels,
Oh! come let us adore him,
Oh! come let us adore him,
Oh! come let us adore him,
Christ the lord!

And now, look up into the sky!
See that bright star twinkling in the heavens ?
Far away, three men are looking at that star just as we are!
They're riding on camels,
And they're using the star as a guide to lead them to the christ-child.
Who are these three men who follow the star ?
Let's find out!

We three kings of orient are,
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar,
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
Following yonder star!

That's right boys and girls,
The three men on the camels are the three wise men,
The new star guides them to bethlehem,
To a little baby lying in a manger!
There the three wise men present gifts to the christ-child,
The first christmas gifts ever given to anyone,
A gift of gold, of frankincense, and of mir!
The wise men fall on their knees to worship him,
A great peace settles on the night,
For it's the holy night!

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright,
Around yon virgin mother and child,
Holy infant so tender and mild!
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace!

When we celebrate christmas,
Think of bethlehem, the virgin mary, the three wise men,
And the birth of the christ-child!
The first christmas!

Oh! come let us adore him,
Christ the lord!"

With a corncob pipe and a button nose

There must have been some magic in
That old silk they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty, the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty, clumsy as he can be
See him lopping along
Off he goes on an icicle spree
With a happy song

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run, and we'll have some fun
Now, before I melt away. ""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there
All around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can.""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Hmm, Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin' ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day. ""

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star, 
Be brave, an' faithful, an' true, 
Cling very close to each other tonight, 
I've been in love like you.

I know how it feels, 
To have wings on your heels, 
And to fly down the street in a trance! 
You fly down the street, 
On a chance that you'll meet, 
And you meet, not really by chance.

Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do, 
Don't cry because I'm alone, 
All of my memories are happy tonight, 
I've had a love of my own.

I've had a love of my own like yours, 
I've had a love of my own!

Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin
They promise this time the melody won't end
Here comes that song again

There's a tender song inside me
Only your sweet voice can play
I heard it once but it disappeared
On the day you went away

As time slipped by
I thought that I'd forgotten all the lines
But then last night we met again
And I heard them one more time

Here comes that song again
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin
They promise this time the melody won't end
Here comes that song again

With the early mornin' raindrops
Dancin' on my window pane
You hold me and I hear my song
Keepin' time with the fallin' rain

Now, I don't know what made you go
Or brought you back last night
I only know my love for you
Is a song that feels so right

Here comes that song again
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin
They promise this time the melody won't end
Here comes that song again

Here comes that song again
Soft in your arms I hear the words begin
They promise this time
The melody won't end"

Hit and run, hit and run - you left me cryin' there 
Wasted love, a victim of a hit and run affair! 
Had your fun, now you're done, my bleeding heart is bare 
Couldn't see that it would be a hit and run affair! 

The way that Grant took Richmond was the way you captured me 
You roped me and ya tied me, I was helpless as can be! 
You told me purdy stories, and you said you'd never stray 
Ya picked me up and knocked me down, and then you ran away!

And trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries nay nay to me
And people declare you're through
Whenever the blues become my only song
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you declined
On the light in your eyes, when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That loves' young dream never comes true

And there's no one to comfort me
I think of you
And suddenly my pillow
Is your face and your arms

And when the winter wind
Comes chasing after me
I think of you
And it's as though I
Crawl beneath the blanket
Soft and warm

How did I get from dark to daylight
Before you happened to pass by
How did I find my way through life
Before you brightened up my sky

Was there a sky at all
Until you painted it for me
How did I get on
Til you came along

Who knows how many times
I pause in every day
To think of you
As often as the sun sails out
Upon the silent sea

And if you're wondering why
It is I only think of you
Well, it's because I'd like
To be as close to you
As you've become to me

I think of you
I think of you"

Thought about doin'

If those Christmas lights would sparkle every day,
Thered be candy canes and mistletoe,
Children singing carols we know (.. . Singing carols we know,)
If love and peace on earth would always stay,

Makes me 'stop' before I begin

 Toys in every store, 
 But the purdy-est sight to see, 
 Is the holly that will be on your own front door! 

 A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots, 
 Is the wish of Barney and Ben, 
 Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk, 
 Is the hope of Janice and Jen . . . 
 And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again!

 One in the park as well . . . 
 The sturdy kind that doesnt mind the snow!

 Soon the bells will start . . . 
 And the thing that will make them ring, 
 Is the carol that you sing, 
 Right within your heart!

All the plans that we made
How we kissed unafraid
In the shade of

Neath the old campus moon
Make believe that
Tomorrow is here

Picture me close to you
In a dream house for two
Where the ivy grows

Together's where we both belong

[Chorus:]
If we listen to each other's hearts
We'll find we're never too far apart
& Maybe love is the reason why
For the 1st time ever we're seeing it eye to eye

If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb
Too hard to break through
I know that love will lead us
& Find a way to bring me to you

So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out (oohh)
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you down
Nothing's gonna stop us now

[Chorus:]

If you're ever lonely stop!
You don't have to be
After all this slowly
I'll be there for just you & me
Take a look inside & see

Puff Daddy,24 Hours To Live,/p/puff+daddy/24+hours+to+live_20608963.html,"[Puff Daddy]
I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

[Mase]
Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what

[Black Rob]
You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter

[1] - If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

[Sheek]
What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me

[Styles]
If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

[DMX]
Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

[Keri]
I used to move around,
I'm feeling kinda stuck these days (because of you)
And I'd be on the highway,
If only I could leave my place (because of you)
I used to be a talker
But I ain't got nothing good to say (because of you)
And I be trying to hide but it's written all on my face

So i...
I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong
Then you turned out you wasn't it
The opposite
Of everything I thought, so...

What do you do after love?
(after love)
What can you say when it's said and done?
(nothing at all)
'cause you can't hide a heart break
(yea I know)
And you can't stop these tears from falling down
So what do you do? What do you do?
(what do you do) after love?
(after love)

[Chorus]
After love, (ooh ooh)
After love,(after love it hurts so bad)
After love
After love,(uh huh)
After love

[P-diddy]
Yea uh uh
I remember that first day
That I saw her face
The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape,
She made my earth shake
I'ma try and keep the faith,
Do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care what him or her say
Thought I had a home run
But I'm just at first base
I found out in the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take
You was like air to me
You know I wouldn't leave
I needed you to breathe
See life is but a dream
So is love and I believe
If you ever been in love
You would know what I mean
Yea, so lord help me please
I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong
But I know I'm right
I'm tryin to ignore
'cause I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

[Keri]
Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound (because of you)
And tell me who woulda thought that I'd ever be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you...
And I can get over it, but I ain't sure if I want to...

'cause you have made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
(you gotta lie in it babe)
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing
(don't mean a thing to me no)

I can't believe I gave you one - last - shot
I let it ride now baby it's - your - stop
I was supposed to leave - now the jokes on me
It took a while to finally come to my senses
But what...?

What do you do after love? (ooh ooh)
What can you say when it's said and done?
(when it's over, oh)
'cause you can't hide a heart break (yea I know)
And you can't stop these tears from falling down
So what do you do? (ooh ooh)
What do you do after love?
(after love, baby)
After love.

[P-diddy]
Yea I know you hear me
Listen to me, please
But this is what you need to do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise, hurting you was never my intentions
It's something bout your style, the way that you present it
Every fantasy I ever had you was in it
I apologize, for every time that you might have cried
There's not enough words to describe how I feel inside
Guardian angel sent from the skies
I always knew you woulda made a beautiful bride
And that's why
I wish you coulda stayed so much
But I fucked up
And went and betrayed your trust
You know, there's no more
Dolce and gabbana, gucci, prada, trips to nevada
And I admit what you heard is probably true
But outta all these girls the only one I love is you
I love you

[Keri]
I'm broken but I'm hoping somebody put me back together (4x)

What do you do after love?
What can you say when it's said and done
When it's over
Cos you can't have a heart break
And you can't stop your tears from falling down
So what do you do? What do you do?
After love."

This is not America
This is not America
This is not America
This is not America

Land where my father died, land where my children cried
Come on, America, ain't no barriers
Free the strings, let's see how freedom rings
One nation all gettin' down for the dollars
And the heat is gettin' hotter
But a lot don't understand
Just the way some plan to break you
I done seen the whole thing go straight through
Hungry for it, I'ma make you
Pay back what's due to me
Everybody gonna see, look what they put upon me
Made me a monster, two steps beyond ya
More streets to wonder
For which it stands for cause let's get it
Cause I'ma get mine for damn sure, come on

[Loon]
Screens, greens car candy painted
Chicks in cream is the American dream, ain't it?
I pledge allegiance to Beamers, dark skies
Sleepless nights on the block, two for fives
Deep in the struggles but need the hustle
Weed and blow shit I make the block bubble
I'm to the point where I'm playa hatin'
Fool in the stash and I'm losin' my patience
Medieval times in the chest of the beast
Come around sniffin' I'ma mess up ya fleece
Job lookin' I'd rather be pot cookin'
It's not America, son this is Brooklyn
Home of the shiesty, home of the crook
We signed joints, ain't scared to do a took
My country tis of thee, where there's no liberty
Just misery, ya heard me

[Chorus:]

[Kain]
Now why can't I breathe with a gun and come free
If six dead people run this country
Now they come cause my crew's too large
Who the fuck put chu' in charge
Runnin' around here like you is God
Then they wonder why the shootin' starts
Gettin' checks with half my stacks
I forgot George Bush wrote half my raps
Murderin' people for blastin' facts
Then blamin' other cats for their tragic acts
I'm tryin' to get paid till my eyes is closin'
Cops is like freeze and I'm already frozen
So they clap and they brawl in hysteria
Tappin' Jackson callin' this area
Green gots cats crawlin' to bury ya
Don't blame Kain for the fall of America

[Chorus:]

[Mark Curry]
Uh, yo what about these streets here
Before y'all creep here
Look around we there
365 days a year
Lines to cross no fear
And what appears to be roses
See I'm knowin' this
When I chose this
What's right
In broad day or night
More dope deals
I'm tryin' to stay on my heels
Every day's training day
Some things not in explainin' ways
Who said crimes don't pay
Choices to make
Ain't too many chances left to take
Things look so green
The sign of the times corruption politics, youg ones dyin'
What you made of
Either hate or love
Pressure on the nine when push come to shove

A little peace in me
A little piece of you (This is not America)

Racial profilin' me cause I ain't pushin' no Nova

I know police corruption is up this year and y'all crooked
Took my hard white
Had niggas sellin' the same block, pumpin' the same night
Arrest me, come to court and lie
Yeah that's him, pointin' like I'm the guy
What chu' want those is me of the block
Yo, so you can serve fiends everytime they knock
Just last summer had the mad Hummer
They took that and didn't even give me they badge number
So how am I supposed to feel
Who I'm supposed to call when the shit gets real
Word man I'd rather dial 8-1-1 when it's important
Plus they ain't tryin' to score like Ed Norton, word

Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?

Chorus x2

[P. Diddy]
See this is the part I like right here
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor
Yeah, I see y'all, just shakin' your asses
C'mon, hold on, I need to break it down
Yeah
One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nuthin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't frontin'
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the usa
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?
Think Bad Boy been played a million times
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes
Damn, we still payed!

We still payed!
Yeah, we got it made!

[Loon]
Aiyyo, this game ain't stoppin'
We champagne poppin'
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you gon' actually learn
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn
I stay on my J-O-B
Nigga, me, P. Diddy, B. Are-O-B

[P. Diddy]
The fam baby, Bad Boy

Chorus x4

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, I want to dedicate this to everybody that been down with us
From day one
Shakin' them asses on the dance floor
That's all we're tryin' to do
Mo' money, no mo' problems

Haters they out ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' wit my whole crew, ball
Hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, ball
Make it rain we don't give a fuck

Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6

Sippin' red dot with a red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population

Told a bitch I just met,
Write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi,
Got these niggas buyin' large lead
Bout to take my LA crib
And drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game,

You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets,
And I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes

Matchin' my things catchin'

Puff Daddy,Best Friend,/p/puff+daddy/best+friend_20112046.html,"[Puffy] (Mario)
I've seen a lot of things in my life
Alot of ups and downs
Made a lot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend
You're the love of my life (Oh)
You're everything to me (Oh)
You never left my side (You're my best friend)
I love you so much (Yes, you are)
You're my best friend

[Puffy]
Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord

1 - [Mario Winans]
Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling
You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

[Puffy]
Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you
Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, God is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him

Repeat 1

[Puffy]
Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour
Looked me in the eyes and ask ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out
Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said ""Manifest the great""
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on

Repeat 1 While:

[Puffy]
You mean everything to me
You've been with me from day one
Even when I thought nobody was there
You were there
You're my best friend
I love you like no other
There is no feeling like this in the world
If you can relate to what I'm feeling
Put your hands in the air for me
Let me see you
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me
Clap your hands, come on
Thank you Jesus
You always hear me when I'm calling
Always catch me when I fall, yeah
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole world to see
That you've always been, you'll always be
My best friend
I love you Jesus
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses
As I forgive those who trespass against me
Thank you"

Puff Daddy,Big Ole Butt,/p/puff+daddy/big+ole+butt_20153486.html,"[Puff Daddy]
Uh huh uh yeah
What you say? C'mon yeah
Uh huh... Uh
Now here's a little story about a girl with a Big Ole Butt
A huh yeah I like Big Ole Butts you dig?

I was at the Tunnel sippin on champagne
Takin a break with this honey on my brain
Admirin the girls with the diamond earrings
Benjamins blastin, doin my thing
That's when I seen her, her name was Keisha
Ass-wide figure, just had to meet her
I said, ""How you doin? My name is Puff
Don't ask me how I'm livin, cause boo I'm livin plush
But then again, I'm livin kind of sneaky
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out actin freaky""
Hit her with the tch-tch-tch, got the digits
Called her on the Startap, paid her a visit
I was spankin her and thankin her, screwin her and doin her
Laughin not thinkin bout G's, I just blew in her
Playin like a King, on sheets of satin
Me and Shorty smack in, her crib in Manhattan
She had a big ole booty, like you see in the movies
And on top of all that, I think her sister wanted to do me
But Keisha was exotic, and Cease my witness
She said, ""Daddy, when you comin back to hit this?""
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the neck
On my mind was Keisha and how she stayed wet
Sat my girl on the couch, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her, with a devilish grin...

Keisha's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
You know I told you I'd be true (I told you)
But Keisha's got a big ole butt (that's right)
So I'm leavin you (see-ya! He haha)
Keisha's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
I know I told you I'd be true (I lied baby)
But Keisha's got a big ole butt (c'mon)
So I'm leavin you (yeah, that's right)

I went past to Rutgers, about three o'clock
I tried to get a cutie, to ride my jock
Me and Ma$e, Suburban blastin
Cold Dom P, smilin, laughin
Freaks all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her, her name was Kim
She had the kind of booty that I'd like to get in
I said to Ma$e, ""Stop the jeep""
She's only seventeen, but yo she's a freak
I kicked the bass like an nfl punter
I scooped this beauty, like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, ""Boo, you look tired
Let's go to my crib, and bone by the fire""
I put her big booty on the zebraskin rug
She gave my balls a kiss, I gave her breasts a hug
I said to this girl, ""I don't love them hoes!
You want to get freaky, let me suck on your toes""
I licked and sucked, she asked me to sing
I grabbed a pack of condoms, I pulled out my thing
When I was through, she wiped the sweat from my chest
When to the kitchen, and fried some chicken breast
Keisha busted in, my house while I was eatin
You know what I said?
Too bad you caught me cheatin, but...

Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
I know I told you I'd be true (I know I told you)
But Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
So I'm leavin you (see-ya! He haha)
Kim's got a big ole butt (yeah, yeah)
I know I told you I'd be true (I know what I said, but I lied)
But Kim's got a big ole butt (uh-huh)
So I'm leavin you (that's right)

[Lil' Cease]
Yo, I went to Justin's for some shrimp and steak
Around the time that this waitress was on her break
I pulled into the parkin lot and parked my truck
Niggaz playa hate but I ain't give a fuck
I paid it no attention, and walked inside
D-Rock had the nine and he was chillin in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin
I sat down to eat, and ordered my food
I said to the waitress, ""I don't mean to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter""
She said, ""You got a girl,"" Ceasar said, ""It don't matter
You look like you're tasty as pipin hot pizza
What's your name? "" She said, ""My tag says Lisa""
I said, ""O. K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, then goin to snack""
She looked at me and said, ""You need to stop!
Cease where you goin? "" ""The Marriott""
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, ""You'll see""
I pulled out a Benjamin, she looked at me
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
I laid her on the table, and placed my order
And pulled out my dick, and bust all on her
On and on to the break of dawn
All over the restaurant, word is bond
Shorty said she comin, I checked my Roley
She suckin on my nuts, and she don't even know me
I grabbed my pants, just left my main hoe
Who did I see, ohh yo... It was Kim
She work at Justin's but I kept on bustin

Lisa got a big ole butt, uhh
You know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt, uhh
So I'm leavin you, what, uhh
Lisa got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true (I'd be true)
But Lisa got a big ole butt (a big ole butt)
So I'm leavin you

Cracks in they Jeeps, don't sleep till they 6 feet deep
No 'lax' in my tracks they potent
Fuck homicide, I'ma ride, keep smokin'

Like cigarettes, Dep came through, killed ya
When I swerve hit nerves
Number 1 contenders, I put 'em on injured reserve
And everybody know what's golden, matter of fact platinum,
?mores trap to mold in?
Once I explode and I, burn up the road and
Cruise around the globe, the cops thinkin' it's stolen
Understand, the world's in my hand
G. Dep in this scam, no stunt
Bitch play the front
And I'ma show you how to lay back do a buck while you puff on a sac
Cause yo, I'm about to blast off -

Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint

Yo, yo, uh
Who's a nigga harder than me?
On the boats, make it known how the slaughterin' be
Damn, Curry ain't the shit? Put the name in your mouth
Got it different? You ain't on what you talkin' about
Bustin' off in her mouth, catch me
I'm feelin' for whoever test me, pity for whoever second guess me
Know how to ?manhand'? it's real as it get
Feelin' my shit, straight through the cealin' with this
Bet your block love it, find me only with the grimy
Gutters of the street where my mind be
Play the game, get you a 'zil'
Forever, put you until, it fit me to kill
Heat, got it with me still
Flip the game over, see me, we be, untouched
Out like your motherfuckin' guns bust, BLAOW
Sure shot, hit again, spit it grim, anytime, anyplace

Niggas don't wanna see a nigga flash the rocks
And pop up in the flashy drop - motherfuckers
Niggas know me, Loon's a gunslinger
Fuck fightin' a nigga, I'm usin' one finger
Catch one of you rap cats in the 'Humdinger'
Some niggas get shot, live and become singers
Expect to die, I'd rather sit in a chair, electrified
Than to stand here and testify
But, other than that though, we never get caught
We George Jefferson walk out of federal court
We gettin' bread in New York, ain't better the sport
So whatever you thought, you can use whatever support
But, I think it's best you go 'head and just walk
Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse
Yo, I'm about to-

Blast off-

Crucified for bringin s** in the city

How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Aint no if I... Know
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life

Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God ti'me now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact

You gave me reason to believe that
We were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me

You would be a faded picture

Youre so believing
Ur deceiving, it's official

Of my eye, you were wrong ooh

While I was watching from the door
So hurt, there you were

I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they ? me
Nigga's is jealous
Fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try sell us
Probably why I'm rebellious
To the fraud niggas, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll up and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and you're homie chilling and
You know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
Instead wait for them haters because they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small sucker, I ain't never really around squares
They say it levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bosses
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly that shit cold
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was A1, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't deem me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like ? but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Go ? all bust down, fuck clowns

My heart getting cold
Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day
Young lord knows

Dedicated, de-terminated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking I'm listening
When I be in the jungle the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling, that was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur
I was like told y'all
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's going I got your medulla
? I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he'll probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though ?
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

Ayo
It gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga""
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister, your mother, your father
That shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen you done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son?
You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame?
You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats lets go

Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember somedays we ain't have nothing but live
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And you main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Meta Peace and Gasol nigga
But i know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
And as long Pop is probably smiling
Imma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

My heart getting cold
Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day

Puff Daddy,Coming Home,/p/puff+daddy/coming+home_20894552.html,"I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming

[Diddy]
I'm back where I belong, yeah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this ones for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I aint marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I aint finished growing
Another night the inevitible prolongs
Another day another Dawn
Just tell Keshia and Tanshia I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

[Dirty Money - Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming home

[Diddy - Verse 2]
""A house is Not a Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Dirty Money - Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming home

[Diddy - Verse 3]
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
We back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand (here I stand)
A better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)

[Dirty Money - Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming home"

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick
Named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers
To spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stopping this
I can't help it I'm an optomist
And Ima make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon rock to this
Now say my name

[Verse ii]
Ay yo, I came in the door
I said it before
I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Make the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Cause I came too far
For me to be bouswar
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

Now hold up, stop, wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning
Got asian women
That'll change my linen
After I done blazed and hit em
But I just wanna rock wit you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo
I got an agenda
Got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it girl

For the return of the don

Ready for action when I attack on the track
And I flat up a sac on strap on the Cadillac and the glove
Could call me when you start shit with the ambassador of New York and the queen of the Chi
And I'm backing her up
Flow be ugly but it's a beautiful thing
Aluminum rings
Get money like I'm moving the thang
I got connects in every section
When I'm up in the hood
Chain looking so nasty all the bitches going ughhh
Heard they wanna get me
But I got my guns cocked
I'm dirty riding 30 stuntin' c*** like Yung Joc
I'm the talk of the town
Lightin' up 50 rounds
Meet me in a circle everybody it's goin down
Give you Hypnotiq to get you erotic
And then I take you somewhere exotic
Where we can blow chronic
A full clip for a lil drama
You know I ain't a hoe
Snap yo bitch
Lil mama you know you wanna go

(Shawnna)
I'm from the city where nothing pretty
And everybody know
I spit a flow to get up with Diddy
And now we fi'nna blow
Niggas in the hood show me love
I'm the girl
Pimp tight let my mink game down to the floor
Pardon me if I gotta be a boss bitch
I don't give a fuck what it cost bitch
I floss big whips
I floss big chains
I talk big shit
'Cause I'm of big thangs
Now what you wanna do
You betta not step
Now nigga move back
Let me catch my breath
Bring it, bring it back to the floor
So sick with an ass so fat
It's Shawnna, Twist and Diddy with Timb on the track
You know it gotta be tint with 20's on the 'Llac
I see 'em looking at me like what's up
But I was hit low in the cut

Puff Daddy,Do You Know?,/p/puff+daddy/do+you+know_20112065.html,"Then there are the times in my life
When I feel trapped
Feel there's no way out
No escape
To be honest I don't know where my life is goin
Where I'll end up at
I just don't know

Verse One: Puff Daddy

I looked back and saw the cat focus took notice
Stayed away from the bogus til his rise began
Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest
Til he seemed hopeless soon to be the dopest, cat comin
Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin
Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild
Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot
He dream, visualize, plot and scheme
Got the cream legally without the beam
Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0
Jet black tint still, they might know
Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&B
Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far

Chorus: repeat 2X

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to? Do you know?

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks
Heard she do backflips, for niggaz who stack chips
Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo
Real G's makin her back swell
Only givin head to those niggaz who rapped well
Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints
Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more
Two bagged up, four went raw
Back of my mind countin up the big score
Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor
Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore
So far from pure, rotten to the core
Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips
With cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold
To bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice
In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on
Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on
Don't understand they playin wit it
Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it
Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun
I'd release slugs black and bust back
See how these players love that, to the point where
I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it
I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself
And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust

Chorus with variations

I been on this road for a long time now
At time it seems like the road is never gonna end
On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains
Peaks and valleys
Even a lot of potholes on this road
It's never smooth, on the road of life
I don't know where I'm going
I just know where I wanna end up at

Chorus with variations

Lord can you help me get there?
Please let me get there

Picture me ballin' in the drop top, open skies
In something foreign, soarin', 145
The God is calling for my body, let my spirit fly
I want it all, no lie
Picture me pourin' poppin' something imported
Pedal flooring, clutch poppin', boppin' to Lauryn
Now picture me falling

[Puffy]
Never seen, never heard, never happened, never occurred
Now picture me flying 10, 000 feet above the sea
Popping bubbly, you'd love to be me
Now picture the servants in the cabin with the sweetest massage
Picture having ice and only wanna speak to God
Picture your dreams being shattered and your cream being lavished
At the same time, tell me what you think matters
Picture all the money that I've gotten off tours
Now picture me plotting for more, picture this nigga

1 - [Both]
Do you like it (yeah)
Wanna do the things that I do
Tell me do you want it (yeah)
Wanna know what it's like in my shoes
Do you need it (yeah)
Wanna see the things that I see
Tell me do you want it (yeah)
Wanna know what it's like to be me

[Puffy]
Picture me wildin', fiendin', reaching for tools
Straight flipping, losing my cool
Now picture me gritty, P. Diddy 'bout to run in your house
The gun's with me, put one in your mouth
Now picture me dressed in white linen while your life is ending
Slightly grinning, picture that priceless image
Picture me broke as fuck on your block about to open up
Like Okay nigga, what's up

[Jay-Z]
Picture me driving a course through your home, bustin' a ""U""
Screaming at the top of my lungs ""YOU FUCKING WITH WHO?""
Picture me not being that hustler dude
Picture the Benz, a 5, and the drop not new
Picture the watch ain't platinum, and the rock's not blue
Picture y'all niggas not knowing how I do
Picture me, better yet picture you
Painting a better picture than the one that I drew

Repeat 1

[Puffy]
Where do you go from here when you felt you've done it all
When what used to get you high don't get you high no more
When you got a lot of cars, don't even drive no more
When you're expected to win, they ain't surprised no more

[Jay-Z]
Hold up, stop, wait, reverse the tape
How much money can one nigga make in one place
How much dough could you hold in one safe
How many hoes can a nigga really chase

[Puffy]
Where do you go after the applause
After all the Soul Train and Grammy awards, after the tours
After asking these whores what they after me for
Is it the money? The fame? The house, take it all

The sky's the limit, but I ain't done jumping
Money is fast, but I ain't done running
Picture me driving some wack shit
Picture me folding under pressure, picture that shit

Yo Puff Daddy
Get off me
Ladies & gentlemen
You're about to witness something that you've never witnessed before
Sauce Money's in the house & he brought his man with him

I leave rap in a state of shock
Where to rock, from the figures still
Play the block with my niggas
Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush
Still stack chips galore
Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw
Better know that everything I love - roll back
Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew
Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga
You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'
I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother
Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker
My wrists cluster, on a mobile
P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop
Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques
I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga

[Chorus:] (Puff Daddy)

Try to see if you see what I see
Give my game & spit my G
When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one
On top is where I be
Tell me, do you see what I see?
(When I look in your eyes, I see you hatin' inside, so tell me)
Do you see what I see?
(I know you're hopin' I'm blind, cause you don't want me to shine)

[Sauce Money]
No secret, undefeated, I'm top seeded
Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it
This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated
Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it
Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1
niggas want to bite off my flow son
I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track
Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw
Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?
Bk forever representin' my borough
Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips
Too easy for you to understand my hits
When the album drops every pocket hold some
Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son
Hypnotic, heard the? War 'fore I shot it
Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it

[Chorus:]

[Pd]
I took rap by the throat & locked it
P-Diddy fixed all those who tried to stop it
Some of y'all tried to blast off, but couldn't rock it
If my flow ain't like a door, how could you knock it?

[Sauce Money] (Pd)
As a matter of fact, yo don't you hate that? (hate that)
Whenever cats playa hatin' from way back (way back)
Mad at you, just because they whack (they whack)
And I bought your style, older than 8-track (8-track)

[Pd]
Only way to react though
Make hot joints & stack dough
Laughin' at your whack flow
Try to catch my G
Just so you can rap like me
Act like me

[Sm]
Rap like me
But it seems as though you dreamin' a lot
(Pd)
I'm the cream of the crop
[Sm]
Soon to be seen in the drop
(Pd)
Blow the spot for the not
[Sm]
Control the block, watch his name bubble like a soda pop
(Pd)
When he drop

Uh, uh, come on, uh
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to my demo
Now I want they ass in my limo cuz now I'm a s** symbol
Intercontinental, L. A. Airplay, just like Jay Leno
Now all the labels out wanna send a memo
To do a remix ya'll, but Mase say N-O
Figure once I make it, they'll fake it
And ain't nobody show me love when I was naked
And when he threw my tape in the trash, I laughed
Now a nigga' tape on blast, I laugh
Figure as days pass, make more cash
And I push everything from E to H-class
Four years ago couldn't go to a show
I was standin' on the corner sellin' dope for dough
Now I no longer hope I'll blow, smoke my droll
On a yacht, nigga fuck a boat that row

[1] - With all this money that we can make,
Why ya'll cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
With all this money that we can make
Why ya'll cats wanna playa hate?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?
Do you wanna get money with us, do you wanna?

[Mase]
Yo, the reality of it all, everybody can't ball
If you had currency, you wouldn't be worryin' 'bout me
But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, cuz it's less trouble
Make my dough and I just stack, no investment
I live off just that
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that
Why do what most do? Do what you 'possed to
Make hot jams ya'll, sell bicoastal
If you want a hit you can let me coach you
Money back on anything that got my vocals
This is so true, I do what pros do,
Cuz broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through
Dealers give me credit any place I go to
Drive out in the Benz say ""Let Mase owe you'""

[Repeat 1]

[Mase]
See, the moral of the story is
I'm not here to replace Notorious
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing
Harlem World style, pursue my dream, cuz see
The things that went 3 mil, I didn't even like that
You say you got mad hoes, well we'll see tonight
Mase be the cat that'll lead you to the light
Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block
That tellin' you that Mase don't rock
Cuz Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht and a big knot
To move you and your moms off the block
For real though, Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo'
And since you can't beat us, it's best you join us
Cuz I know you won't have this hold that's on us

And we don't have to answer to jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of new york
And out west, we want y'all to understand

We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot

And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone
Lil' kim and puff daddy keep keepin it on

Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features,
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether,
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for,
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh,
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper,
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle,
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest,
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project,
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra,
It's Harlem usa I diddy bop and shop with Oprah,

Black American express card all grey now, it's scratched up,
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags,
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra,
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya,
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80's nyc 5 percent of culture,
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing,
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her,
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne,
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar,
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,

A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me,
Draped in paisley bandanas,
Suits with Adam Stacey,
Cigar like dick Tracy,
Its dark I get spacey,
Alcohol and laced weed,
That was part of my 80's,
The Cartier consigieres be near me,
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,
Liz Taylor tried to joke me
Coz I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be
When he gets mean,
Think fast before I blast hoes,
Like Grassino,
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion,
And realest rappin',
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green,

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is goin my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling...

Chorus
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me around...

Now that day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
there's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
cause I'm loving life
and tonight's for feeling...

At the media party. He was pronounced dead on arrival.
No suspects have been taken into custody.

Combs' trouble seems to continue as he turned himself
In today to local police for an alleged assault and
Battery charge. He posted bail and was released on
His own recognizance.

In my distress I prayed to the Lord
And the Lord answered and rescued me
The Lord is for me so I will not be afraid
What can mere mortals do to me
Yes the Lord is for me
He will help me
I will look in triumph at those who hate me
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes
Though hostle nations surrounded me
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
They swarmed around me like bees
They blazed against me like roaring flames
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord

You knew I was comin to put it down so what now?

In the five-speed, smirkin then pull up at high speed

Hello, good morning, how you doin? We're at the movie
Of ""Welcome to the Future,"" I'm the Cap'n of the Cool Kids
The revolution's never been televised
Great booty, better thighs, I ain't wanna tell her bye
First I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell a lie, tonight you couldn't find a better guy
King shit, flyer than anyone you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of 'em on the field, finna bring wit
G5 waitin, fly away at my convenience
You seen T. I. P., checkin in a 5-star suite
With some 5-star freaks, gettin high all week (Let's go!)
Catch me in the week, I was up all night when y'all sleep
In a fast car, superbad broads, back seat
That's me, see I'm nothin nice, fuck a couple nights
With the moon say goodbye and the sun greetin us like...

Hello... (Yeah, c'mon)

Hello!...
Good evening!...

But right now baby, you dreamin -- Wake up and turn the lights off

[Diddy rap verse]
Uh, how fly is he?
Yo' baby momma (Cry for Me) like Jodeci (let's go)
So how you not notice me?
Pull up to the club in the coldest V
Ugh... Literally cold
Little did he know how that nigga Diddy flow

So hard like a crowbar, still gettin dough
Whoa whoa, whoa... Hahaha (Turn the bass up!)

Aiyyo turn me up in my headphones man
I want this shit motherfuckin blarin
It ain't loud enough man
Oh these muh'fuckers think I'm gon' play with 'em
Oh I ain't gon' play wit'cha - I ain't gon play wit'cha man!
Ha ha ha.. I need y'all to sing children
Sing, I like it when the children sing
I like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man
That lets you know something's comin
Oh it's comin - aww man something's comin
I like this sound of this - something's comin

You can picture like a photograph, envision the image
Of one-two-fifth street and Lenox
The old folks their souls are cold like tenants
Tryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach
For four twenty-five niggaz lives get diminished
The world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant
Cops be on patrol through the block every minute
Itchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace
They disturb me but it's love like tennis
Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage
Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness
Damn it's a scam but I handle my business
Tryin to be the man if the Lord be my witness
Do my [?] with the walk sign for my physical fitness
16's sicker than all signed flows it's ridiculous
Hold up

[Chorus: children sing]
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Hold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up

[Diddy]
Easy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol
Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal
When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity
Bluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities
Diddy got it wrapped like cocoons
Pop shit like needles through [?] balloons
I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother
About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers
Thugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey
See a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money
Eons beyond bling bling
So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's
Make a name, let it bang so beautiful
The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals
Or, suitable for, a recuitable whore
To service the whole crew when we out on tour
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Chorus:]

[Diddy]
It's like the music will literally stop time
(Hold up hold up hold up)
We roll up, 20 deep, c*** D swoll up
Get inflicted by my verbal conviction
A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston
You're not focused enough, you're not listenin
You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand
Hop to it, get on your grind music
Across 110th sharp caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning
Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em
Stop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium
Fuck the game and if the fame went away
Still be the hardest workin man in entertainment today
Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin that
No guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts
Hold up

Cats hate me cause I mastered this
PD the one who brought class to this
I brought a brand new 6 just to blast my disc
Pockets fool of chips with the glass on the wrist
Got a mashion in the Hamptons that niggas would kill for but I'm never
really home I live on the billboards
Cause I remained da most famous Entertiner
Yacht by the dock jetplane in the hanger
Haters all hating and the ladies all waiting
That's how I stay winning
You the hottest in the nation
Getting my bounce on
Dipped  in Sean John
Chilling in Justins and spilling the Sean Don
I roll in the Rolls on cruise-control
If you know what I know then you can go where I go
Got a whole alot of dough and money in escrow
Having fun spending one's and watching my sons grow
Like my nigga Bust said Give Me Some Mo
We in the record store or you can catch us on tour
Bad Boy 99 goin shine once more
Making sure everybody know the time once more

Make a few hit records and fuck me a thick honey
Stop hoping the trains for that quick stick money
Lay up in the cut and receive hugs and kisses scope wild bitches

Wishin they could be all up under me
No more fun for me strictly bubbly

Popping Cris at the bar floss with all your friends

I smash it, I don't harass it

Party, Diddy, Usher - game is through, come on

One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook - y'all doin' it heavy
She; s telling you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning
It'll be fine
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got'chu
Me - I think you're running
Cause I'm the one

What you came to do tonight

I don't know what you came to do girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh

And the only thing that's missing - is the one
Is it you?

Bustin over layin Elaine with the cane and the Rover
Pray to Jehovah for the nigga with the Ruger
The young Don the Heron mover
You know my hustle I bring the fo' pound to the tussle
Motherfuck your pit with no muzzle
So chill 'causeo let me blow for my niggaz
Runnin round get down like motherfuckin gorillas
Shorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop
Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered
Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money
It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny
Black I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give
But everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po
Mom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa
Yo, it's the style see it's still the same
And when worse comes to worse, I steal the cane
Papi know my face, so he don't expect it
Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him
I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth
It's the D to the E, M to the O N
Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin
Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat

From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine

That nigga that'll die for his main man
That nigga with the gettin money gameplan

Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get
I'm only sizin you niggaz from the waist up
And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup
Mr. Jacob without the Ladder
It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup
Nobody badder, since the, baby Finster
I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter
Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip
Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip
Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb
Blown the hall pearl wide bill long gone
Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?
Worldwide while you simply thought where you lived at

Bad Boys, and we all eat together
When it go down, then we draw heat together
Since I made the connection with the big man
I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land
Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped
And what you call weight, I know cats who sniff that
Enjoy life, what are you sayin?
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin

Make money's the motto, staying desparados
New chance of hitting the lotto
Let's take it to the neck wit this bottle
Get in the eldorado
And break from this bitch at full throttle
You like fuckin' fashion models?
That only waddle with cats that flash stacks
Or squabble with niggas that flash gats
Then squirt hot pellets out their nozzles
And leave a nigga hurting on the block
Sounding like when you gargle
Them hero niggas that plot
Them zero niggas get got
And never get a chance to bust shot
Curled up in a knot then forgot on the spot
Then I'm on the run wit a gun smoking hot
All around the world's where I go

Goodfella not gunshotto
And I'm tellin' niggas, make money's the motto
Fuck the niggas that squable

Trying to keep things low-low

Still standing after the trouble remains, it's me
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me
And all that negative shit pertaining to me
What ya think I claiming to be
A straight heart staying with me
I can tell it's about to go down
I told them, slow down before I send the low down
And skip out of town
And I don't wanna but I'll do it if I gotta
The situation is serious and getting hotter
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver

Verse one: black rob

I met her uptown on dyckman, aight then
Talkin that, how she only dealt with businessmen
Niggaz baggin joints, money off and on the books
The ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook
About them, I doubt them cats waitin for me
You know them niggaz, them big dudes across the street
She say, ""yeah, they from over on mayfair""
Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down
I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out
This bitch over them with them pointin the chief out
They want beef out here, they gon' get it
In the worst way, i'ma show em how black play
Roll the dice, fuckin with me is like snake eyes
I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise
It's all about the benjamins, true that be the motto
Ran out of ammo and started, throwin bottles
Runnin, and I ain't lookin back for shit
Crooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this
(I'll get you back)

Chorus: repeat 2x

I love you baby no you don't
You drive me crazythat's right
I'll never betray theeuhh
I love you babyc'mon

Verse two: black rob (starts rapping during the chorus)

Yo since the last altercation I been goin to street
Seein honey at the club ery week and I speak
I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac
Babe bro told him, 'you wanna get money, see black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
Youse about to get, fucked with no jail
I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin
And plan your extermination, word

Chorus

Verse three: puff daddy

It took a while to peep your style, miss i-be-in-workin
Low profile single, house in staten island
And manhattan while, them same cats
You sent to get me boo, is on they to get you
Fuckin witchu, that small time crack dealin nigga
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too
Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up
And get away scot free without some type of injury
Nah kill it, i'ma flip the script on you
Same thing you did to me, i'ma do it to you
Who knew she was the female rambo
Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in
In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over
Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life
Of a rich millionaire just rockin the mic
Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt
And admire how the chick went out

I need a girl who's mine oh mine

[P. Diddy]
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin me
Here's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
Cuz now I'm gettin money and the game gettin deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been lookin for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
It's cuz of you girl, now I understand life

[P. Diddy]
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Quarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's smile
This shit is wild
All dem days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

And go and sit in a chair that'll fry for me
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me
Never say bye to me
I can't deny shorty love is official
Even though love ain't the issue
Shorty still smuggle the pistol
Packin' a gat then hug you and kiss you
Show you love when other niggas that diss you
You on the real
That's the type chick a nigga need
The type smoke all a nigga's weed
And still move at a nigga's speed
Never a victim of a nigga's greed
Especially if she runnin' round with a nigga's seed

You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers

And we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you woulda had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild

About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)

Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix

Now I done seen chicks come and go
Some in it for the love some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low

'Cuz I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the prauda mamis
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale
(But I'ma ride for you Daddy) Then I got you mami
Cause all I wanna do is take care of you
And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do
Like if I rock ice you gon' wear it too
Fuck wit me I have the whole world stare at you

But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened alot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin Sean bless it

Ay yo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever bee to Sandro Pe?
Or seened a brotha play Amando Lay?

I'm about to keep up on the billy, bumping these bottles and willy
I know they gonna hate when I'm high, but when it's all over they feel me
If you want your love when I'm dead, you better off just trying to kill me
'Cause I'm gonna ball on you, and I ain't talking about you, I hate all y'all niggers

Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
Its hard to just keep going
Its like I feel empty inside without you being here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
Id give all this shit, shit the whole knot
I saw your son today
He look just like you
You was the greatest
You'll always be the greatest
I miss you big
Can't wait till that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait till that day, when I see your face again...

Yeah... This right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (cmon, check it out)

Verse one: puff daddy

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hanging on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death

Chorus: faith evans

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
Ill be missing you
Thinking of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
Ill be missing you

Verse two: puff daddy

Its kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in heaven smiling down (eheh)
Watching us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Making hits, stages they receive you on
I still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living you're life, after death

On that morning
When this life is over
I know
Ill see your face

Yeah!

[Morock]
This is for the niggas who ain't got shit to love
I cripple thugs, just because
You not Jada but you could, kiss the slugs
Until your place hit up
Rap niggas in the studio, wasting bucks
You're better off making sure papi know your name well
Guess who ghostwrite for me, my brain sails/sells
Now believe it, better place checks
Bad Boy, big things nigga, HF

[Classy Freddie Blassy]
I put it down for mine, my crew live a life of crime
Constantly non-stop, when they on the climb
And BK, no such thing, it's dark
The sun go down, the tool start to spark
Outline in chalk, moms lift the part
Cases handle in the street, motherfuck the court
Shouldn't talk the talk, you can't walk the walk
It's The Hoodfellaz, what the fuck y'all thought?

[G. Dep - Chorus]
Now if you want this money baby
Then I guess you in the right place
And if your mind ain't right sugar
Then you need to get up outta my face
So what's the deal?
Cant' ya see how a nigga feel?
And let me know if you gon' ride tonight
Cause this paper we makin' is real, all day

[Verse]
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
Don't get it twisted with the rap y'all (rap y'all)
Still walk around with the gat y'all (gat y'all)
Don't make me have to point it at y'all (at y'all)
And clap y'all (clap y'all)
That's how I see things goin'
Chains showin', rings glowin', Range Rovin'
And my nigga push ki's like Beethoven
It's gonna stay like that till the pearly gates open

And here we go {overlaps Verse's last line}
Aiyyo, let's get it where it needs to be
Tuned in to the, P-the-D, please believe
I told y'all it's on for life
The only bars I ever be behind is the one's I co-write
Hold it down, hold the crown
What I gotta brag for? Y'all should know by now
Cats talk this and that, so we rip the track
This a fact, it's a wrap, uh!

(Chorus)

[G. Dep]
Yo, yo
Niggas mad at the fact we bad
Man I won't stop like a New York taxicab
If your shit wack, we burn
If you got beef, we come back like a tax return
We get money, hold money, no quotas
We gon' fuck around and do this murder, no motive
Aiyyo, I burn more
Wait till I drop it, then you can learn more (Why?)
Cause you a turn-off

[Poppa Sims]
Numb in my veins
And bought enough to numbin' the brain
Lovin' the brain, let a slob till it's come and arrange
Strollin' the block, honey holdin' the glock
1-9, come on baby, it's crunch time
In a truck blue, yellin' my fuck you's
Doin' a buck-2, circle hoods like Doug Ghouls
Huggin' the piece, ha ha, Sim is the word on the street
Come on, I can make dessert outta beef

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
Intro/Chorus: Ginuwine
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Chorus
Wish it would have happened then (Is this the end?)
Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
Verse One: Puff Daddy
Sayin  ""Why me Lord?""    folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin  but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
Till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Shirt soaked til it's red
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow
Hands
But he's still right behind me
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
Or is it all in confusion? Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holdin' the trigger and his finger's steady chokin' wit
Smoke
Is this the end?
Chorus
Chorus Two: Ginuwine
Just, can't, let, go (Is this the end?)
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then
Verse Two: Puff Daddy, Twista
Did I just hear a tech jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley source man in a Landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the lx?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to? ""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole
I could never watch a soul die, plus you da man and you too fly
(But who are you?) The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
On
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon

So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
Eager for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
So now my sight is gettin dark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
You never know when it's your time to leave
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
But wait, I can't find the keys
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

This is a story about two riders
One's from Chicago
And the other is from New York

[Twista]
Now nigga what? You thinkin' there be no repentance?
But I'm coming back with a vengence
Runnin' like a ant since it was intense
Thought it was the end
Wish every motherfucker's in like sentence
Where they been since?
Let me not go deep in the story
But damn it, I feel the fury when I'm rapping
Got me going off in the zone
Hit eleven niggas and bitches at home
Hear the drama how it happen
Back for one minute
You remember I was grazed in the shoulder
When I plays the beholder
Hit the land like a crusier
But in the Range with the Rov'
Still it feelin' strange to a soldier
Me and Puff trapped in the parking lot
I done found the keys so let's crawl on the floor
Got up beside the ride but we still trapped
But I found my strap, I gotta bust that hoe
P., you gotta drive, problem at the angle of the ride
Blast when you crash through the exit
We still alive but the opposition gotta die
When they go then it's on to the next shit
When the car screeched off, I blast my heat off
Thus crackin' our winshield
That stud shoulda been killed
Kept shootin' 'till I seen his bloody body do a windmill
Started catchin' convulsions that we frozen
Ain't nobody here to hold it
Feelin the escape was kinda golden
Now we dozin'
More niggas have rolled in
They started comin' at us with high-tech shit
It's only so much one mac can do
But you know what we got to do
Don't get in the wind
Is it the end or chapter 2
They coming after you

[1] - [Cheri]
Living my life on the run
With these niggas coming after me
Is this the way that it has to be
I can't tell these dreams from reality
Now I'm not afraid to die
So it really don't matter to me
It just might be my destiny
I hope you niggas is ready for me

[Puffy]
Yeah, yeah
Saw my whole empire crumble into pieces
As the trouble increases
Escape is the thesis when the car speed releases
I'm on the run like Jesus
The first chapter was sadness but this one is madness
Killers on our asses, plus I'm in 'suit, winney badges
Red and blue light flashing
Now, let's see who's the fastest
Slide through the street like a real C
Hit the curb swervin', but I'm still swift
Damn it, ain't no brakes
I feel like a enemy of the state
We on the run like Will Smith
Pumpin' some real shit
Since the car won't slow down
I had to crash through a window
Level shook but now we on foot with the showdown
Didn't know what we was in for
Somehow, someway we gotta get the ammunition for the gun play
Now I hear some bullets ricochet, motherfucker's got to get away
T., let's go this a-way through the ally
Where these niggas can't score me
And max me a building attack me
Headin' straight for Kennedy, they can't catch me
There 20 minutes exactly
Get tickets at the first airline, first flight out
Get set for the hardcore, could you tell where the sky phone
Me and T. On the plane on our way to Chicago
When we landed in O'Hare
A cop yelled out ""Freeze, we sent here to capture you""
Nigga, you know what we got to do
Tell me, is this the end or chapter 2
They comin' after you

[Repeat 1]

[Twista]
People better get goin' for the big clone
Leave our shit blown
Coming at us with a C gun, gotta get calm
Then I pick up on the jet phone
So I could see if my bitch home (hello)
Hope the cop that drop them and took a strap then split
Simply, but we acted quick
Damn, there was a glock
Then we dipped up in the parkin' lot
We saw one Jag' at the Jack-O-V
When we got up on the highway, too smooth
Run away to the hood and we workin' with some new rules
Can't be one who loose
Go to the hideout, make a call for some new tools
And I'm feelin' these fools, we got beef who can die
That want a piece of the pie
But now we got his keys to the shop
And niggas gotta live slow 'till at lesat if they try

[Puffy]
Now we can flip my bitch named Angela
She my weed and my wipe and handler
Branding her with a tattoo with my name on it
Make her feel like I'm the man for her
But she lookin' suspicious
And somebody at the front door
Now she looking scared
Soon as I let out the air saying my bitch
Angie up and shot T. In the leg

[Twista]
Should go through the back door
Feelin' torture and pain
I heard shots in the front
Oh we about to die
Straight Kamakozi and ride
There are two things from the start
You wanna go to war, I'll take you to war
I can't make it that easy to ride for me
And when I saw the enemy, I let it ride
Tell me, is this the end or chapter 3?
They comin' after me

Puff Daddy,It Has Been Said,/p/puff+daddy/it+has+been+said_21030380.html,"It has been, it has been, it has been, it has been

It has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah

It's scary, ain't it? Picture yourself goin' out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us

We watched, so many Biggie backed off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact, it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back

To where we left off on March 9th to come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us to see who can last the longest

And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin'
Or it could just be somebody's horror that just horrifies

And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entourage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B. I. G. Taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin

Vicious, I'm experiencin' the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin', goin' through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes, so there's no limit in them skies

'When Ready To Die' was a sick part of my life
Palmin' that forty-five, plottin' to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican, I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind

Get up out the system, who could give him better signs?
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So, possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B. I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press, who said my house was a mess

Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin'
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin' the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace

This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama, don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave 'cause our friendship's intact

An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin', ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin' that East, West
I seen the game losin', I'm just pressin' the reset

And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem, it'll be instant stardom, nigga"

Jumped in the limo, checked in the suite
Made a few calls, it's time to go
Bust a few rhymes at the studio
You know I don't do it for the love of it
I love it but I do it for the love I get
Big checks, you think the sex is next
When I left the studio
I had to go do a show for the ten with the triple zeros
That's why I never flipped with kilos
Flew up to the bay, then back to Georgia
Had to catch a flight to Tallahassee, Florida
I did a show at the Kapa luau

Is it worth it? I ain't no crook
A hundred thousand dollars might get you a hook
From this nigga right here, I know you know
And you gotta pay extra for the video
So cut the check for the right amount
If not, you can wire it to my account

And ain't nothing wrong with that

Said bitch, said bitch said get your motherfuckin' ass back

Swimmin in women wit they own condominiums
Five plus Fives, who drive Millineums

Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
And swim in European figures
Fuck bein a broke nigga
Verse 2-

Freakin the three-quarter reptiles (ahahah)
Enormous cream, forrest green -- Benz jeep

Don't let the melody intrigue you (uh-uh)
Cause I leave you, I'm only here
For that green paper which lead you
Verse 3-

Lex and Range Rovers dealin weight by Minnesota (uhh)
Avoidin narc's wit camcorders and Chevy Novas (uh-huh)
Stash in the buildin wit this chick named Alona (uh-huh)

Floss in my 6 with the Lex on the wrist
If it's Murder, you know She Wrote it (uh-huh)
German Ruger for your ass bitch, deep throated

Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, playa hatin from the sideline
Get your own shit, why you ridin mine? (uh-huh)
I'm, a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash 380's and Mercedes, Puffy hold me down baby!

(Big: Yeah, yeah, uhh, uhh, uhh!)
Verse 5-

(Notorious B. I. G.)
I been had skills, Cristal spills
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mil to ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be, kickin me
In my asshole, uhhh, undercover, Donni Brascoe
Lent my East coast girl, the Bentley to twirl (uh-huh)
My West coast shorty, push the chrome 740
Rockin Redman and Naughty, all in my kitty-kat
Half a brick of yea, in the bra, where her titties at
And I'm livin that, whole life, we push weight (uh-huh)
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State (c'mon)
Listen close it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the Mac, my left hand spit, right hand
Grip on the whip, for the smooth getaway
Playa haters get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only, to Hell I send thee, all about the Benji's
What??

Ladies

[Mase]
Well, well, well
Now would you be mad if I gave back your girl
Or would it still be a problem with the entire Harlem World
At first you were singing that she was your ex
But you was ready to kill me when you found out we had s**
When I came and told you the deal
You wouldn't admit how you feel
Now you know your girl love me
Why can't you just let it be (just let it be)

Cuz Mase can't take no more of you fuckin' him and his brotha, ut uh
And girl what make you think you could do what you do
And think that we'll be standing here fighting over you, come on

You see if we had more pimps, it wouldn't be no jealous guys
See me, I live by the four pimp rules
Number one, you control the situation
You get in they head before you get in they bed
And number two, girls run like buses, you may miss one
Catch another one every hour on the hour, promptly
And number three, what that girl ain't willin' to do
You got a hundred more girls more than willin'
And number four, is a new rule to the new pimp testament
You can't be a playa and hate the playas
That don't make no sense
I don't wanna see no more jealous guys at the end of this song ya'll
I really don't wanna see no more jealous guys after this song ya'll
So can ya'll sing along with me
I mean put your hands together, sing along ya'll, sing along everybody

Puffy: That's Right
Nas: Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Puffy: Some real niggas You'll never see what I've seen

Puffy:
When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches dead niggas ghost
Feds with toast knockin my door down
Sweat poor down my body roast from the heat
So I soak my sheets, wake up shiverin'
Pull my hoe close to me, she s***
Every night is different pussy, since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminise how I missin starin' in space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' that face
Layin up in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, One hundred and ten shots can stop spirits
If niggas try to rob me, then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks, I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breats
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua
With Ananda, the mtv diva
Nas how do we survive all this mess?
East vs. West, this rap game
Where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Thug tip from Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Chorus- Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time you realized that it's goin' down
You would find yourself going underground
When we see that this life is upon us
We would see that there is no one that we can trust

Beanie Sigel:
You can never see what I see motherfucker

Beanie Sigel the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up, nigga stay deep in court
Reminisin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was pork
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, phat fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I done played dice with Tote
Upstate for cakes, niggas slice your throat
We had boxers in the shower, when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest niggas in the yard get broke
I done took blocks to war, took blocks ruval
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think the 33 and the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, C4 block your doors
Niggas can't stop this war
I show you faggots what the Swatch is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the paper, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
The only reason you switchin up Detroit is cause you keep gettin' robbed

I look that nigga in the eyes before I send him to god
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive

Chorus

Nas:
Aiyo, Aiyo, Gansta, Gansta

The Bible as words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speek all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome, thrown shit at little girls jumpropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats
That was way back, watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggied eye shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penil
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, get gray skin
Made this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, without the housin', we wilin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick buildin, grown ladies, jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga

This goes out to my nigga B. I. G.
Listen to me playboy, check this out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
Pd call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats I'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's whats happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

[Chorus: Kokane]
Sometimes I feel like I'm lonely
And sometimes I feel like I'm lonely

Ey yo C-I-O-F-F-I-E
Q-you-double E-N-Z
Come on ma your riding with me
Leave the lame respect the game
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, extasy when you s** the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop celcius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip
Money, music women son we standin' in it ha!

[Chorus:]

[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted
I did then still do and always ran it
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit... Burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cuz I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of y'all seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

(Why you over there lookin' at me)
You got, you know, the haters
They wanna be tough guys all of the sudden

While my girl standin' here
Why you over there lookin' at me

Hit you with the ice grill, you know
Hehe, cause you boys ain't with you
Little do they know, your girl roll harder than

Now what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors?
How is murder?
P. Diddy name me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy
Niggas on the block know Mase motto
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough
98' Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe
Case I'm every chased by a Donny Brascoe

Yo, I can't get mad cuz you look at me
Cuz on the real, look at me
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear
Dissin' every gear, but they better listen here
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on yo own
Cuz bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus it won't be long till they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone
Why you don't like me?
Cuz I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy yo wifey
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
Cd, tv's, really would I know ya
Now me and blink float in the gold Rover
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
Cuz Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

We was all at the Greek fest, it's hot and sandy
I rent scooters, I'm with my family
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy
But get approached by a girl named Tammy
Who looked good enough to be Miss Miami
But say, since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's
He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like if we have s**, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie
And please no hickies, cuz wifey's with me

Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

2 - All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

Repeat 1

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

I'm glad you got your own dough
You can spend that on me
And why not, we can stack our dough
And buy blocks
If I got you got
Watch, they hope we might slip
But we keep a tight grip
And make hits like this, holla!

[Jennifer Lopez]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love, 
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love, 
When you get hurt by the one you living for, 
Pain can make you wanna love no more, 

[Chorus]
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself, 
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly, 
So many lonely sleepless nights, 
I'm going through hell to convince you love me, 
But never her approval no matter how I try, 
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you, 
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes, 
Momma always told me to respect the woman, 
But what am I to do when her parents do not try, 

So many tears I cried, 
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say, 
Oooooohhh

[Chorus]
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself, 
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself

I've been so dependent on your love for so long, 
Punishment for me is trying to let go, 
Give it from your heart is what you taught me, 
Addiction to pain is what it got me, 
My life, now it's changed, 
My life aint the same as you are, 
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it, 
If I can't have what mean most to me, 

So many tears I cried, 
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say, 

[Chorus]
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself, 
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself

[Drake]
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure

[Chorus]
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself, 
Loving you no more, 
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
I love you more than I love myself"

But now I think back
When nobody cared
And you was there
Just to roll by your man
And came back
Even know what I did
I realize and I'm aware
I know what it is
Put that on everything
Girl you my everything
I don't know where I'd breathe
Cause you the air I be
If lovin' is wrong
Who could be right
I wouldn't know what to do
Without you in my life
You're more to me than the world I pray
The more nights for your heart to ache
Right in the middle of the dawn of day

And throw it away and say

Can you feel it in your soul

Now, who's hot who not
Tell me who rock who sell out in the stores
You tell me who flopped who copped the blue drop
Who jewels got robbed who's mostly Goldie down
To the tube sock, the same ol pimp
Mase, you know ain't nuttin change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales pullin all the love
You don't believe in Harlem World nigga double up
We don't play around it's a bet lay it down
Nigga didn't know me ninety-one bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph. D. Niggaz hold me down, Cooter
Schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble stay low blow like Hootie
True pimp niggaz spend no dough on the booty
And then ya yell there go Mase there go your cutie

Rip all the spots, rock all the rocks
Cop all the drops, I know you thinkin now's
When all the ballin stops, nigga never
Home gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now whatcha gonna do when it's cool
Bag a money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours, violate me
This'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around be D. O. A., be on your way
Cause it ain't enough time here, ain't enough lime here
For you to shine here, deal with many women
But treat dimes fair, and I'm
Bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yeah, yeah yeah

Tap my cell, and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, bein mice to me
Bruise too much, I lose, too much
Step on stage the girls boo too much
I guess it's cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch, never that
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at?
Throw your Rollies in the sky
Wave em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggaz see, B. I. G.
Be flossin jig on the cover of Fortune
Five double oh, here's my phone number
Your man ain't got to know, I got to go
Got the flow down pizat, platinum plus

Ain't no space in the garage, I got a new Buggati

I heard a young nigga had to sell his soul
For a new Bugatti and a ton of gold
Stepping in the crib, I gotta pat you down
So old school, still in my cap and gown
The lawn manicured and it's well lit
Talking whole sale, each 12 6
Order crab legs with the heavy butter
357 perpetrator stumbles
Shots fired, and I fear the worst
Gift wrap his ass, December 1st
Underneath the tree, can a nigga sleep?
Yea I went and spent a hundred G's on a V

One point five for the transport
Car got a letter B all on the asshole
Fuck a Swiss account, I got it all cash
If it's any problem, you can bring 'em all back
Know how a hustler move, do what he gotta do
Fuck the prosecutor, tell him the Bugatti's new
One point five settle all these civil suits
Platinum a million time, record in a silver suit

The whole city screaming where that boy Diddy at
Blue Yankee fitted, boy I brought the city back
I'm a Harlem nigga, I'm a Ciroc boy
Fuck a penthouse, I bought the block boy
Bought a Vacheron in London, costs a million pounds
Fuck a chick all in the shower like I'm trying to drown
Turn my back just like a king, I let her wipe me down
I'm Sean John down to my jeans, how you like me now
Hating ass niggas not my type of crowd
Gotta get a fade before I wear the crown
I hope you brought some money since you talking live
We sipping Blue Dot and we smoking loud
I scoop a new broad just to knock her down
I get a new broad when she not around
Fuck a phone bill, bitch I'm worth a bill
She wanna feel the rush, I give her sugar hill

One point five for the transport
Car got a letter B all on the asshole
Fuck a Swiss account, I got it all cash
If it's any problem, you can bring 'em all back

See a brighter day

Now I'm moving on to get away from all this pain

Assuring me
Believe in all you dream

Period, no question no comma
Your hearing is no vest and no armour
Bring it to cats like Bush to Osama
Sippin on vu, make moves and no scama
Word to my mama
Can't deal with the trama
That why a nigga stay in the Bahamas
Laying in pajamas
Two s*** mamas
Bodyguards, topguns, two extra lamas
I don't want no drama

Yeah yeah uh huh no way out baby.
You can't go nowhere ain't got nowhere to turn
Yeah yeah ain't no way out.
Ugh check this out

[Verse 1 (Puff)]

Ready to call it quits from all this shit
Even resign from the niggas I been ballin' with
I'm second guessing all this negative energy
It's making me realize why niggas really envy me
I feel no sympathy it's tight ill
Plus I get slight chills when I write wills
Tired of looking at these ugly niggas with ice grills
No tellin' what I might feel about my glory
2 sides to every story
That's why I pray to God hoping that He reassure me
The more the pain the more the game come with this territory
I might dispose feelin' like my life been chose
All I know in my life lotta ice and hoes
When it's on
My man there gat in his hand
What you do when you got a master plan
But half done ran
Here's ya chance to prove you love 'em
It's on and subbin'
So hot it's feeling muggy. Really though.

[Chorus:]

No matter how bad it gets. It could be worse. Ain't no way out
I gotta live my life you know. You gave me the ends. No matter
How bad it gets there ain't no way out no way out.

I shoot through pants no chance to pull for ya gun
Man a lot of y'all cats can't stand that 1 on 1
Wind up gettin' embarrassed ain't funny uh huh
Despite the bullshit black still here
Makin' hits down at Chelsea Bea's
Via partaking flicks
No matter what we have to
Come strapped with our gats
We don't want to
But y'all make us act like that
It's a thousand Bad Boy cats ready to blam you
La Familia I steal ya I know how my fam' do
Man handle tracks that be laced by Nas
Rolex watch security straight from the Mosque
Yo I'm all on my own G who should I trust
niggas bust B. I. G. Now it seems they want us
It's like no matter what I do
I can't escape it
Ain't no going around it so
I'ma be a man and just face it

It takes heart just to live in these streets
You niggas lift the heat
Take the bitter with the sweet
They can't hurt me
No more than they already did
They killed Big in my heart he forever lives
There's no way out
Like you got Berrettas to my wig
We were slugged then another blood
Shed my ribs uhh
Now the question is Will I survive?
Nigga gotta make it home I gotta still provide
And I get the vibe niggas wanna live to try
Ain't no tellin' what this Bad Boy feel inside
Blood hate the sweat pain be intensified
I'm feelin' stranded as if I can't hitch a ride
Now I tell my seed minimize the genocide
Plus I'm dangerous so numb I feel painless
And you know what you
Tell them niggas who can't touch you
You grab ya nuts and say muthafuck you!
You invited got dones be indicted
And if you kill me

Spill Louie because, I'm supposed to, none close to

As for your hoe, c*** the rhymes I wrote, murda like shocka
Deem these bitches, stay on the penis
I went from the Vernon, the curve servin', paper earnin'
Got Arabians smugglin' dope in they turban
Sit with two techs in my duplex, bulletproof vest
In the shoot fest with the law
Got it all, want more, future foreseen
Keep the city how for Louie xiv

Uncle Puffy can you read us a bedtime story?
Please huh please?

[Puff Daddy]
Alright check this out right here...

Woke up smoked up broked up
What I had left and rolled up lit it
Had a shorty that I brought home hit it
Sent her on her way I got no time today
With all this work I got no time to play
Cash come and go and I want mine to stay
Alot of these fake cats won't mind the day
I get an unfair play then the stairway
That's why I'm like twa, the airway
Niggas wantin to believe what they heard through hear say
Hopin I'll forget it
Check the mail it's a letter from jail from Hobokken
I opened and I read it it said:

What da deal son?
It's ya nigga Teals in the field in this beel son
I'ma have to feel one
On the run with a gun, can't walk with it down and can't conceal one
What to do?
I don't' know if ya knew
A kid, true, up in 1-2-2 he plottin to get you
Now here's due
You just do what need doin
Let's not forget these niggas be bleedin' too, one

Ok good
Those cats don't keep it real as they should
Heard they don't pay good
Standing around all day wishin they could
But this green fufills they dreams
They ain't a team
Answering machine on screen
Phone rings, it was Alene from Queens
Head was mean
Had a head for skeems
Told her she could head the scene
But she played her hand proper now you can't stop her

Hey yo what up Playboy?
I'm out in Saint Croix
What's up cats say they real, but they toys
I heard ya doin' it though
And you and ya flow
Some niggas wanna ruin ya show?
What up yo?
Whathca wanna rip shop up on his block?
Or I could leave him dead in his bed with his dick robbed

[Puff Daddy]
Na Boo, I'ma show you how I do
Just hit me when you get up top
Or come one through

Now I'm doin inventory
Guns, clips, vest, bullets
So when I pull it it's the end of story
Leavin my men in glory
Then get shorty to hold a pound for me
I know she down for me
Yeah, sneak up on em like a car theif
These niggas mad cause it's my party
And my Benz is wide-bodied
Despise me, like the feds despise Godi
I kill for a hobby and latenly lobby
So try me, go 'head and take a bite
Might as well say good night
Try to put me in the dark, I don't take it light
Now if it's wrong make it right
Not tommarow, tonight
They barkin I know the bite
Jumped in the B-N-Z
Niggas gonna see the E-N-D
Fuckin with me
See I knew he was a snake out the ground
Make me wanna call my man rock and break out the hounds
Take it to the pier where you can't make out the sounds
Thoughts in my head goin 'round
It's goin down
Pull up to his block, I'ma put it to his knock
But, I don't see him, wouldn't wanna be him
Damn, ride around for a minute
Thinkin bout the pain that Hell brings
Interupted by a cell ring
Yeah yeah...

(Hey Boo come and get me I'm here)
(Where?)
(Titaburough)

Give me a few
It was like I flew
Felt kinda strange it was like I knew
Pulled up around 2, late like I do
With the urge to bug, she gave me a nervous hug
And when I heard the slugs
What I saw on the blur was thugs
Tryin to soak my fur with blood
Dropped to the curb and ducked
Pulled out the fifth up behind the car like
""How I'm gon' get out this shit?""
These niggas don't know what they about to get
A one way ticket to Hell my gun dealt
Bust my gun at three and one fell
The other two, waitin' to see what I'ma do

[Men's Voice In Backround]

[Puff Daddy]
Peeped around the car slowly
Then I let 'em have the whole week
Man there's six million ways to die
And you chose me
But I'm an og
And in the distance is police
I'm still bustin tryin to kill something
And I can't hide the fact that I feel something
I feel this thing, like in a minute, I won't feel a thing
The two cats jumped in the blue at
I fired one shot, they fired two back
They murked off in the night
I get them fools back, man they ain't seen the last of me
But I'm bleeding rapidly
Shot up in the stomach and that wasn't how it had to be
Heartbeat failin, car alarm wailin
Couldn't walk straight then the firearm fell
Now I'm thinkin how this bitch played me
Then I faded

[Intro/Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
I've been thinkin, times is hard
'Fore it get worse and fall apart
Maybe you should quit your job.. And do what's right
And make you my partner for life
So we can chill (and have a little fun)
So we can chill (and have some little ones)
So we can chill (until our living's done)

[Diddy - over Foxx]
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's some things I've been meanin to tell you
Some things that have been on my mind
Listen to me baby (let's go)

[Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)
[Diddy] Boo you know what? (What)

[Diddy + (girl)]
The day when I first seen you
You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)
Back then it wasn't oh so fair
You came through like some good clean air
Skin softer than the softest fabrics
You heard about me (I heard about you)
How I ball like the Dallas Mavericks
Sayin, anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)
That's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?
From the first day, we laid eyes on each other
At the office I knew we was gon' be lovers (I remember)
Mark hotel under the covers
You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers
Who used and abused you and took you for granted
See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)
Since you got me all sentimental

[Chorus with Diddy ad libs]

[Diddy] C'mon, don't stop
[Jamie] Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)

[Diddy]
You're so amazin
All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin
Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a
Same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer
'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?
Goin through tough times and knowin the other side was greener
We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin before we lose it?
You remember - it's all words like music
Came at a time I needed soothin, soul body and mind
At times I felt violent, you kept me in line
Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind
Girl, we got a bond no one can break
And I'm sayin, I pray to God every night we make it - pray to God
I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you - c'mon

[Chorus - faded into deep background]

[Diddy talks over Chorus]
Yeah I've been doin a lot of thinkin lately baby, yeah
Now I know I done put you through a lot of shit
I know it's hard fuckin with a nigga like me
Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit
Ridin with a nigga
You know.. You might as well.

[Diddy]
Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments and
The big boats and the cases of whole klicko
I don't ever wanna let you go
It's a certain kind of feelin, you know that feelin you get
When your girl right and you know what's what, uhh
You got me on some lay low stuff
You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff
Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em
Without you around, I can't function
We gon' be together 'til the day we die
And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side
I never had a girl make me feel like you
And every day I wake up, I feel brand new
I live for you and I'll die for you too
I love you girl

[Chorus:]

[Jamie Foxx]
Girl, maybe we should think about it
Oh we could be down for life
Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby
You're beautiful lady
My beautiful, so wonderful
I love you so..

Oh we could be down for life
Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby
You're beautiful lady
Baby let's chill
Baby let's chill
Baby that's real forever [fades out]"

That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear
Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way
Cause I'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be  you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs  they'll spit for me
So if you want what's mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because I'm public enemy number one

[Chorus:]

One, One, One, One, One
One, One, One, One, One

[Puff Daddy]
Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe it's all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think it's a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun
Cause they got me public enemy number one

[Chorus:]

[Puff Daddy]
All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
You know that I'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because I'm public enemy number one

[Chorus:]

[Hurricane G]
Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? And that's just the way the story goes
And that's just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

[Puff Daddy]
You think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?
Haha picture that.... Number one, number one, number one
B-I-G forever... Rock on"

Tongue her and see her hit high notes like the opera
And I don't waste a drop til I taste the spot
Give me chills but I make it hot
Watch; I'ma prove in times, I'ma make ya lose your mind
in a lengua smooth as mine
And I never question what hon' do

Head shots so mother fuckers can't regroup, can't recoup

Sell more joints than me
Steal your faith, take a puff, inhale my name
Smoke on it, shit, choke on it
Bitch nigga, I'mma make a hit nigga
Hot mother fucker down to the skit nigga
Game over playa, and nigga ya scored low
Hit me later young, and I'm at the award show
Bank account ten digits and it's all ""O's""

Might have to change my name to strong arm
You came to get money man?

Have much to do with nigga since Nicolas Bond
Poppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone

Watch him explain ain't nothin' but blood thug crime though
Shots in the spinal, from my rivals
Cross the t's and dot the i's and
Pay the judge, drop the top we'll mess around
Shit, it's the kid rapper's feelin'
You cowards don't know? I'd rather be racketeerin' somewhere
Bustin' shots in the atmosphere and
Not caring, fuckin' the proscecutor at my hearin'
Money laundering, honies wondering
Who me?  I reply casually
Come what God would be if He was a straight G
Tonight too tight out of a big ditch we ride

[Redman]
Yo yo yo, it's your hide
Grab the rope and yell rawhide
Front line is pussy, call off sides
I'm focus but my hand is cross-eyed
I left my gun home, here borrow mine
Pop the nine like a judge ""All rise""
This gun'll knock plants off tall guys
We value-packs, y'all small fries

Yo, but on the floor tied
Don't matter, we'll take up all size
Truly yours doc, then ppp hide, my name is
Since five, I talk jive
In church dressed in cordoroy ties
Now I'm grown up and been married four times
Besides, I'm just a sight for soar eyes
Brick city, known pop the door wide
Stolen Bonneville in New York High

Reversin' the plot
Last come, first one to rot, first in the glot
If I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot

Hot as it gets, from Hell came outta you debts
Buy the cassette, rewind it to death
Alota y'all sweat it, you try to forget
How I rock shit from N. Y. To Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz

Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up

Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor

Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine
Bro making the streets she's the pimper's paradise
Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice

Of the refugees down from the islands
Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends
Sippin' colada every day is a weekend
Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn
And fifteen million place with your total sound scan

Puff Daddy,Santa Baby,/p/puff+daddy/santa+baby_20536050.html,"[Verse 1: Run]

It was December 24 on Hollis after the dark
My man Santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on Hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

[Chorus:]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...

[Verse 3: Ma$e]

Now all Mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
Cause I know
When there's a christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

[Verse 4: Puffy Daddy]

Now to me, pd I had alot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who aint caught me shaking the box
Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

[Verse 5: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Cookies and Milk
Satin and Silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat Red Suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
Bbut here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

[Chorus:]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...

[Verse 6: Salt & Pepa]

Santa Baby, are you really real?
Chris Kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(you better praise him)

[Chorus:]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...

[Verse 7: Fredro Starr]

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo Sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin this

[Verse 8: Sticky Fingaz]

Its the Grinch who stole christmas
Climbin down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

[Verse 9: Keith Murray]

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the (blur) and asked him ""yo what's up with that?""
He said ""there aint no christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with God's Angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That Santa Claus is a black man
Word up

[chorus 2 times]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight..."
Puff Daddy,Satisfy You,/p/puff+daddy/satisfy+you_20112061.html,"[Puffy]
All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

1:
[are. Kelly]
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

[Puffy]
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

Repeat 1

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

Repeat 1

[are. Kelly]
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

[Puffy]
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

Repeat 1 until fade

And they test (uh-huh), but they forget (yeah) how the M-E-F is so Def (let's go)

Yo, uh, come on, come on, now
Big Meth attack soon as the track come on now
Zone out, with Sean Combs and bizzy-bone out (I see you in the club)
And by one, I'm gettin' thrown out
Mami, got her toes out, ain't one army can Blaze Johnny
Like Gwen Stafani, you know there's No Doubt
I'm trill, sick with it, it's like ill
That's the only way to explain these mic skills
On Homicide Hill, anybody asks is real
The more steel, the more bodybags to fill
Can I get, hit of that hydro, nigga
I tried to quit puffin' before, but I'm no quitter
If honey show me her buns, I'll show her my ones
If the bed rockin', keep knockin' and I'mma c**
Want some, take some, I get it crunk
Speak junk, I'll slow up your road with speed bumps

[Chorus: Missy Elliott with P. Diddy doing ad-libs]
When they play this in the club (say what?)
Go and tell that nigga, bump that (say what?)
Throw your hands up, like nigga, what? (say what?)
Ya'll don't really really want that (say what?)
And for whatever muthafucka, don't like it (say what?)
Tell that sucka he can get back (say what?)

Are ya'll ready? Come on, play it back (saw what?)

[Method Man]
You wanna front, what? Step up and get bucked
And if your feelin' lucky, duck, then press ya'll luck
Ya'll got me effed up, over tracks overreact
Once I start, like a bullet, ain't no holdin' me back
I'm all that and two mac's, ya'll fakin' jacks
When I c*** back like Busta Bust and make 'em clap
Here I go again, who blow in like whirlwinds
Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends
Got to get it, and when I'm gone
Ya'll bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home
I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones
Got aim like them kids in Iraq who toss stones
And I got drugs in my system, we thugs in the system
That put slugs in victims, Mr. M-E to F, bomb threat
As long as I ain't no game, there's no contest

[Chorus:]

Ticallion is phatter than your fattest chrome chain
I guess that should explain why I given the dope name
Ain't nothin' free, everything got a fee
How the fuck you got a car and ain't got a pot to pee?
I'ma grown man, so I do grown man things
Why take half, when I can have this whole damn thing?
It's Meth, baby, drop top, navy Mercedes
I'm number one like P. E. Or Tracy Mcgrady
It's all good, everything I spit, all hood
And if ya'll gave me one wish, niggaz, I wish ya'll would
Who John Blaze? Uh, when ya'll gon' learn huh
When I burn son, stick a fork in him he's done
And ladies love to play, like Ladies Love Cool J

Sabes bien que fue un enga~o
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Asi mismo me enga~aste (~ substituted for the spanish n)

Translation: you know well it was a lie
What you did to me was a sin
That's the way you betrayed me....

Verse one: puff daddy

Honey I keep you hot and wet, just flooded with ice
And you can spend all day and chill, all night
Come sleep with the king, peep what I bring
Every few weeks it's a bigger size ring
Carats ain't nuttin when the cabbage ain't nuttin
I got habits like goin to paris I ain't frontin
You can never need for nuttin, only one pipe
Would you like to go to dinner, wit jordan and his wife?
Am I moving fast? It could happen real soon
Thousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms
You know the dress, that got the party impressed
You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine
I try to address it, but you never get the message
You the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert
I never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop
Till I get her cause I need her, my senorita

Chorus: puff daddy (singing)

Mami ven aqui, I wanna be your
Papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito yo aqui
(te necesito yo a ti, te amo)
Baby come to me (2x)

Verse two: puff daddy

Her name is carmen, she live down in spanish harlem
And I think I have the key to her secret garden
When I seen her, I used to want to beg her pardon
But I was scared, I ain't really have the heart
And when she walked by, I would panic, even though
I was cool with her pops lou, the mechanic
Went to school with her brother, that's right
I never could build up the words to express how I loved her
Long hair, pretty face, slim waist
The kind that you marry and take to another place [india sings again]
And exchange vows, spend thous
Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel
She'll be loyal without being spoiled
You can shuck all you want but she's still gonna ignore you
Makes no sense to say mira
Cause bet she won't turn him around, she's my senorita

Chorus

Verse three: puff daddy

I rock regular clothes, as well as gucci too
And if you don't believe me, ask groovy loo
You're beautiful, so I stay true to you
I think you oughta see things like bermuda boo
No cooperation, got me walkin around pacin
Patient, waitin for my day of penetration
Your relationships is bullshit, your man is a prick
With a little bit of bricks and a whip baby
Please, I got plenty of v's
What you want the pink c-2, or the yellow 3-2-5
That's when I opened my eyes
I was dreamin, damn it was all a surprise
But it felt real, I hopped up in a wet chill
Yet still gotta keep this one concealed
Even though I never got a chance to meet her
I still need her, cause she's my senorita

I hold her, at attention with my mannors
And even though I don't roll a camera
She still performs
Like the superstar, she truly are
So, also I think I love her already
Damn, I think I... Already
She must be the one
I look in her eyes and see the sun
Even on rainy days, aint it
Crazy mayne, yeah, that's what I said
She do doughnuts in my head
Over and over, and over
Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick shit like
""I'm on my way from Weezy Baby""
And of course they let her go

It's for the ladies and mercedes
And I know that it's heavy

You need me baby it's hard to break a habit

His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage
Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight shit you get when you Head nigga in charge

Pull off your top make it shake like Jello

Put on the cameras, try it you'll be loving it
And you can bring your girl and we can get on another tit
Me? I'm a Mount Airy fellow
Or down in Florida wit the Maranello
Driving slow watch the mami mouthing 'hello'
Get wit ya man if you want love you better
Trying to get +Dirty+ like +Aguilera+
Yep, he's a skater the kids that's rhyming
But I'm also young and rich wit a big ass diamond

[Bridge:]

[Verse: Loon]
Hey yo my intro's crazy, I'm in a new Mercedes
Rocks the same colors as daisy's
Y'all niggaz is lazy, I'm on my j-o-b
And that's why ya hate on me
But here's the update, Loon ain't got nothing but cake
And power from here to upstate
Y'all sweet as cupcakes
So why niggaz stay wit tough faces?
I stay trying to figure what Loon and Puff make

[Verse: P. Diddy]
Bitch please! You ain't been in a helicopter
Flying 'round Jesus statue wit a mountain in Brazil
Bitch please! You ain't never been to Guatemala
Eating shrimp by the dollar taking flights to Negril
Bitch please! And you ain't been wit Lenny and Pharrell
Me and Loon in the hills giving mami's the chills
Bitch please! And you ain't never seen a hotter nigga in the game
12 years selling records by the mill, c'mon now

[Chorus:]

[P. Diddy]
Let's work (huh yeah), let's work
Let's work (huh yeah), let's work
Show me your soul! C'mon now!
Show me your soul! C'mon now!
Show me your soul! C'mon now!

We wanna see the masses shaking out there
It's getting s*** in here
Alright y'all, alright alright!

C'mon and c'mon now
Everybody c'mon and c'mon now

I remember what you said to me, when you said it to me last night
we was talkin', and you reassured me everythings fine
When I woke up this morning to get some loving from you
I turned to one side, to my suprise, I wasn't layin' next to you(mmmm)
Why don't you get closed to me, I thought it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete(so complete)
Why you handlin' me this way, what was it
you was talkin yesterday, yesterday, I could say,
I seemed to be so complete, so complete

[Chorus]
Went away, you said nothing
you didn't, no kiss, no lovin'
you didn't, it's a shame,
but it brings about the weak in me,
brings about the weak in me
you didn't, spend a lifetime with me
you didn't, share things I wan'na see
you didn't, when ever your around me it's so complete

[Verse 2]
So I waited, and I waited, 'cause I knew you would come
Hours 1, hour 2, hour, 3 hours, not at all
If I'm dreaming, wake me up
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I can not see, how would you ever let this happen to me
I still belive, that it was supposed to be
Me and you, you and me, so complete
So complete, so complete
If you saying that you need to leave, then be a man about it
and step to me, step to me, tell me please
that without me it's so complete, so complete

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3]
Won't you tell me right now what you want from me(what you want from me)
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby(held it in, oh)
Thought you where the one but, you just played me(you know you played me)
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete, yeah

Repeat Chorus (with different variations)

[Verse 4]
Please, give me the responce I need
I want you to complete me, oh baby
Please, give me all the lovin' I need
Promise you'll neva leave me, oh baby

What it is you wanna do

Working your work until you think you find
Who's goin home with you tonight

Let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side (c'mon)
I can feel your heart beating
I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes
Trying to see into your mind
See into your soul
See, no limits to the levels
Me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you
That makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing
And the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it
Not saying a thing
The way you got me going
Got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it
Going in and out of them lanes

I don't want your innocence
I don't want you to stutter

The passion's inside me, it's yours
Now come try me, c'mon

[Christina Aguilera:]
Tell me, what you thinking about
When your hands is all on me
Cause I've been thinking about
All the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
Cause you're sweepin' me off my feet

Boy, I got my eyes on you
Tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it (I know)
So tell me how you want it (Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it (You don't)
Cause baby you're invited (Baby)

I got a selection of the positions of affection
With no pressure

Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe
I got a selection of the positions of affection
With no pressure
So tell me
Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it babe

Puff Daddy,Testimonial (Intro),/p/puff+daddy/testimonial+intro_20559582.html,"[Diddy]
I need y'all to hear me out there
Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh

Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet
Of the almighty, a God to the black child
I told moms I would be somethin
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin
Listen up, I got a story to tell
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone
But nope, I hold my stance in stone
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin
Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto
It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child
Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush
Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push
Thank God for my life I came through the room
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils
I foiled your plans and made you aware
And turned America's dream into a nightmare
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers
The first B. I., ""Ready to Die"" muh'fuckers
So ""Who Shot Ya,"" 9 to 5 muh'fuckers
""Bad Boy for Life,"" is I muh'fuckers
And it's back, better than it ever was
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was
So I deliver the truth uncut
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up
On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?""
For the past ten years, the future is us
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer
The preview is over, now enjoy the feature
Niggaz

I wanna thank y'all for believin in me for so long
Thank y'all for ridin with a nigga
As we continue on!
You are now listenin to the sounds
Of the world famous... You know my name
You know my name"

Can't even count the reasons why (ohhh I)

Lord I do love You

Verse 2:

Y'all gon' love me
Feelin it's about to get ugly

Inject this dose of the future
Tap them veins, grab hold, let me shoot ya
Mainline this new Diddy heroin
The Afro-American dream is too evident
The potential to be the first black President
Itunes, download me in every resident
Early, I skip break-fast
Nigga be on his grind like he need new brake pads
We in the hood like black soap and dollar vans
My cd's in 3-D, holograms
The future, y'all need to holla man
The live show's a hard act to follow man
Bronze my likeness, y'all need to follow him
From now to 3000, I'll be a problem man
The future

Always before you

Always ill

With my demeanor, flip, assemble my own team to
Say fuck fema in case there's another Katrina
And you, laughed at the past, said I was a dreamer
But it's, back to the future, sold out arenas
We, take 'em to the cleaners, calm ya nerves
This is the man who provided more jobs for blacks than armed services
(Let's go) Cut them corners, stay ahead of them sharp curvages
Yeah, ya heard of us, hits stay superflous
Man, I extend credit to a vagabond
Run yo' city, and we not talkin marathons
Bang like chitty chitty here to disturb you
New cd, watch it spread like bird flu
America, fall back, you can't stop me
Got a thing for pigeon-toed chicks who walk knock-kneed
Skin-tight jeans we call that botoxied
I'm desensitized baby, you can't shock me
I'm the future

Always before you

Always ill

I went from, blocks to greater to fortunes rock related
Now my entire crib is voice activated
Television on, Mr. Combs is home
Solar panel rooftop my, kitchen is chrome
Dim the lights to a purple haze then answer the phone
(Hello?) Peep the moon through my retractable dome
What they thought they assassinated was only a clone
We about to venture off into the unknown (let's go)
Where sunrays hook off layers of ozone
Chips inserted in the brain, the new cell phone
The future, fuck with me now
I'm Grammy certified the committee can pick me now
And they all green with envy like Bill Bixby
Bow down, kiss the tip of my cane, I paid sixty thou'
You know the suit stay crispy now
Hands to the sky and get ready if you wit me now
The future

Never seen before, never will
Always before you, always ill

I don't floss no more I drop jewels
Hope we might chill the heights real
Still we got fire that will melt your ice grill
Know the deal once we hit record
Hit the floor
New era this is war
Lord I'm the answer without a question
No evidence no possession

Streets is dark but still I illuminate nigga
I could see the way
Till I see the end to me and BIG meet again yeh

Ain't that I lick when I walk
My some pimping to my stride
Some wit a emphis on my side
Cause I understand niggas out to get I

Starting at guard.. ""

Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my porsche and
So you better use caution, knowin I'm the boss and
I'm sittin on pyramids, flossin
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back livin off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you actin like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, makin my mark on harlem like poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your tv
Or pick up your cd, P. D.

This is gruesome
Niggaz always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you livin an illusion, livin in a used one
While I'm in the limited, cruisin
You ain't really got a crew son
You givin them amusement, fuck what your comic views meant
Youse a smokehead
I've been doin this since this pro-ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped

Run and get your cd and cass-ette

Why niggaz lie like that?  Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't wanna die like that
Have your momma cryin like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it fryin like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, y'all niggaz better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggaz is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is c*** back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

Keep frontin, i'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezin the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
Y'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice

(baby... Baby.. Baby)

[Brandy:]
Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
That hurt so bad inside, I can't even think
Ain't never had nuthin to me
Brinh me down to the core
Till I hit the paint
Here to show you a compromise of heart
For I'm fallin apart
Till there no remains
What had me thinking ya word was your bond
Don't ya know
Didn't have to call it love if you knew that the situation
You wasn't ready 4
I could see if your feelings have changed but damn you slammed the door
Only the one thing you said you put down ya whole life for
I can comprehend the deck of cards you dealt me.
[Brandy:]
How can you turn on me
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

[[Chorus:] Brandy:]
Lessoned learned house can burn were close to heat
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said wen you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that your never gonna let it go

[Diddy:]
The times that you werent there
The times that you left me here
The times that I needed you
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that chall go thru
I been here before
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until it's right at your door
And then you just can't no more
Why does love feel this way
Why does it hurt so bad

[Diddy:]
Can't even look me in the face
Why does love hurt this way

[Brandy:]
How can you turn on me
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

[[Chorus:] Brandy:]
Lessoned learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said when you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that you never gonna let it go

[Diddy:]
The heartache and pain
Sometimes it goes to your brain
Sometimes it makes you insane
Sometimes our joy is our pain
Cuz it tears you apart these affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes you know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day that you come back to me girl
After we both go away it's just to see if it's real
There's no denying the fact it's meant to be
If you let it go and then they come back.
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept,
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault
And of course you lost me with your alibis and all of your talking
And most important I just question my self

[Brandy:]
The pain is taking over I can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll - me

[Diddy:]
I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I aint eat in days, stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well it's all in the healing and that process has got me stressin
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained
I aint thinkin straight I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein my old self
Young wild uncontroled self
I love you grl I don't need no one else

[[Chorus:] Brandy:]
Lessoned learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said, thought you said that you need me
Thought you said, thought you said complete me
Thought you said, thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said, thought you said when you held me
Thought you said, thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said, thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said, thought you said that you never gonna let it go

[Diddy:]
When I look in your eyes you know it kills me inside

[Brandy:]
Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, oo ooo

[Brandy:]
Lesson learned
House can burn
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

[Diddy:]
These affairs of the heart I think I'm strong but I'm not

[Brandy:]
Thought you said thought you said that you love me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me

[Diddy:]
Come back to me girl

[Brandy:]

Rio... Talk to em'

[Mario]
I could tell how you doubted me
I knew my heart was broken
And so empty
Even though my girl was next to me
She didn't see
I do believe
That you wanna come by
Rescue me
If you read my mind
I have set you a place
I wonder if i'll just will be
In time we'll see
She told me

She told me
She showed me
But she hurt me
Yet she loved me the same
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
Could you really love her through the pain?

[Diddy]
... Yeah
Well I don't wanna feel this way (this way)
I got too many bills to pay (to pay)
I'm hanging on patrone all day (aye)
Mind in a maze (maze)
Blowing on shit
I can't function
It gotta be something (go ahead)
That you doing
That got me unconscious (aye)
All this money this fame this fire
How could I feel this empty inside? (talk to 'em)

[Mario]
I've been thinking 'bout giving up (can't give up)
But there's something inside me that's holding on
When we don't know who's right or wrong
We still stay strong
Keep movin' on (don't stop)
And I promise I will never leave
Now would you do the same for me?
I wonder if i'll just will be
In time we'll see
She told me

She told me
She showed me
But she hurt me
Yet she loved me the same
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
Could you really love her through the pain?

[Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fine as hell
Fly chanel (so fly)
But will it last?
Only time will tell (only time)
Love is real
And what I mean is
There's not enough words to explain the meaning (c'mon)
And what I'm saying is
All I need is for you to understand
How beautiful she is (she is)
And all it takes is a little faith
And no matter the situation
Is my heart you'll stay

[Mario]
I'll always be your friend
You'll always be my girl (i'll always love you)
I'll never let it end
For nothing in the world (you'll never stop me)
'cause no one else can do
The things you do (no one else do the things)
You make me feel (you make me feel)
So warm and new
So would you stay with me? (she told me)

She told me (she showed me)
She showed me (but she hurt)
But she hurt me (yet she loved me)
Yet she loved me the same (all the same)
Has anybody ever made you feel that way? (has anybody... Ever made you feel that way?)
Could you really love her through the pain? (could you?)

Thank you for showing me how to love
Thank you for showing me

Girl you mean the world to me
Just a little more than I can see
Breaks us down
We'd stay together
Only we can hustle who ever
Would you come and go with me
To fulfilled our fantasies
Take me by my hand my dear
Promise me you won't have no fear

She told me (she showed me)
She showed me (but she hurt me)
But she hurt me (yet she loved me)
And she loved me the same (all the same)
Has anybody ever made you feel that way? (has anybody... Ever made you feel that way?)
Could you really love her through the pain? (could you?)"

If it's alright with you, we fuckin' (That's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends

[Ashanti]
You must be used to me cryin', cryin'
While you're out bumpin' and grindin' (And another one)
But I'm leavin' you tonight

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you

You must be used to me cryin', cryin' (Uh, and another one)

One one two
Check me out right here yo
Verse One: Puff Daddy
Yo the sun don't shine forever
(Big: You can turn the track up a little bit for me)
Turn me up yo
Can you here me?
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
(Big: All up in my ears)
Better now than never business before pleasure
(Big: The mic is loud but the beats isn't loud)
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
(Big: yeah!)
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin
(Big: yeah! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up)
Our music keeps you movin, what are you provin?
(Big: Turn that shit all the way up, yeah)
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
(Big: Music's gettin louder)
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
(Big: This shit is hot!)
Talkin crazy ain't gonna get you nuthin but choked
(Big: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And big you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a win cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin up facts (uhh) you rakin up plats
Verse Two: Notorious B. I. G.
In a Commision, you ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of satan
They say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rob a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White
Chorus: Busta Rhymes
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?
(repeat all 2X)
Verse Three: Puff Daddy
Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or cd
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be
Verse Four: Notorious B. I. G.
We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaers in the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kiss, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
Placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission
Chorus 2X with Puff talking
Aiyyo, can you hear me out there?
Aiyyo turn me up, nobody can hear me out there
That's good, it's all fucked up now
Y'all know it's all fucked up now right?
What the fuck y'all gonna do now?
What I'ma do now?
Can y'all hear me out there?
Can y'all hear me out there?
[?] fuck y'all niggaz wanna do
It's all fucked up now
What I'ma do now, huh?
What I'ma do now
It's all fucked up now"

Pick a watch, as long as the hands spinnin'
Pick a actress, which one I ain't swim in

Retirement plan, I dropped it on her neck

There's no nigga like you and there'll never be another nigga like you
Put your foot on these motherfuckers necks
Do it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em

[Diddy]
As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint
I can't hide in New York City
I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West
Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast
I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)
Ten years without gettin sweat inside my Yankee fitted
1990-Raw I showed you ice
You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice
When it was (All About the Benjamins) I had two bezels on my arm
Like a Don's supposed to, Sean
Ride with a chaffeur in Gucci loafers
And switch to All Stars without losin focus
These rap niggaz hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks
But I'ma shine for niggaz that ain't know Big

[Chorus: Jack Knight]
Do, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, nowwwww
It feels good to see the sun in the mornin
I'm tired of feelin that the people are talkin
I heard a rumor that things ain't changin
But Lord knows that we gon' make it
Oooooooooooooooooooh

The world famous
As we proceed
To give you what you need
It's been so long
It's been so real
So magnificent, thank you

Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big)
And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)
If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef
Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)
Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief
Other times I put ""Life After Death"" on and peep
We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe
Without my nigga on the passenger side?
And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly
Finish the race, holdin my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm reenergized
(As we proceed) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)
Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)
And the day I die, let a G4 fly
And dump my ashes over N. Y.

[Chorus:]

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name
I told you I was gon' be great ma
I told you I was gon' be somebody!
Ohhh!! Feel so good
Feel so free
Put your fists in the air, aowwww!!

[Diddy]
I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules
And do what I do by any means (c'mon)
Call him necessary, the great visionary
Born extrordinary, a life legendary
Who else put flows out, that put clothes out
Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out
Nine-six Big showed me what to do
But deep in my heart, this is ""No Way Out II"" (let's rock)
I spend absurd money, private bird money
That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)
Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner
New York torch gripper, O. G. Of the floss nigga
I'm seein visions like I did a bag of angel dust
This is life when you black rich and dangerous
I'm with God, I'ma live on forever
Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name
Yeah! You created this monster!
It's so inspirational, it's so real
Bad boy bitch!

Think Big, we just lost a very big jewel

All the cats shined, but you would glow Big
Frank White lyrically, moved niggaz spiritually
Made you wanna get a cup, fill it up with Hennessee
Front in the club and light a dutch where the women be
If you seen the show then I know you felt the energy

We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 8X]

Just to let y'all know, everything is all real
But it's sad when a good fella catch a raw deal
And pain is a part of life that we all feel
Today this whole rap game is getting more ill
It make me look back, to where he took rap
Dude brought the East back, y'all better believe that
He never had a warning, One More Chance
Was right before him everybody must answer when God's callin
I flew B's wit him, I blew trees wit him
Couldn't wait to go on tour across seas wit him
People seem to get lost and, blow things out of proportion
Life is worth more than the coffin
I need answers, and they better be the truth
Hurts like a bad tooth, we losin mad youth
Lyrically there'll never be no one above you
And no matter how they judge you we always gonna love you

We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 4X]

Right now I know you missin it, smokin in peace
After all this bullshit don't cease, huh Big
Right now, you and Pac in harmony, probably huggin
While everybody from Brooklyn to West coast is buggin
All these gang wars, Big, show me a sign
As for your son I'ma raise Shorty like he was mine (no doubt)
It seems that the devil got his stinkin back whooped
And we should pray for Jesus, and ask for forgiveness
I can remember all the studio time, getting twisted
Bottle after bottle, Bacardi Lime, I miss it
We clicked like heels when we first met the
Junior Ma-f-i-a and Big Po-ppa
Nearly broke down four times writin this verse
Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts
But ain't no need to cry, cause right now, where you at
Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at
But it's sad that it takes that for us to unite
The only time you see your family is funeral night
Christopher Wallace, Frank White, holdin it down
I guess you with the real king in New York now
For real

We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 6X]
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa [repeat 2X]
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa, Big Poppa...
(We'll always love you Big)"

After the party it's the waffle house
If you ever been there you know what I'm talkin about
Where people don't dance all they do is this
And after the original you know what it is.

(Jd)
Welcome to atlanta remix it had to go down
I got somethin else to tell you bout the new motown
Where the people don't visit they move out here
And aint no tellin who you might see up in lennox square
I don't know about you but I miss the freaknic
'cause that's where my city use to be real sick
People from other cities use to drive from miles
Just to get a taste of this A. T. L. Style
I'm the M. B. P. Most ballin-ist playa
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night you know things change with time
Magic city back lookin like eighty-nine
All the homies on the southside up in the Ritz
Tuesday night, the Velvet Room same shit
Wednesday Strokers I don't go no mo'
Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
Thursday night, was Plush but we moved to fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk actin a fool
Friday night, at Kaya they still got love
And the Sharkbar we poppin like it's a night club

Tell Flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it
Sunday we layin low in Halo, sippin Cris' and we straight
Monday we go to Bungalo Eight
Tuesday I'm in spa drunk doin the shake
And for the rest of the week we just follow the freaks
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky the state of New York
Hot now, top down at the Rucker game
New coupe, no roof, playa what's my name?
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten
Uptown, what now?! Let's make it happen

If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
We still here!! And we buildin four more new towers!!!

Who say St. Louis ain't hip-hop? Dirty we hop to what's hip

I'm so St. Louis, ask my tatooist
I was like ""The Waterboy,"" now they sayin, ""YOU CAN DO IT!""
I'm Baby Huey, one of the best in the Louis
Sip Louie smoke louie, dressed in Louis
Home of back porches, Chucks and Air Forces
Old school cars be trailblazin like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em gimme girls they always tell me I can have it
All got habits, marijuana ecstatic
Buy two cats and coats with automatics
St. Louis is the +Truth+ like +Sojourner+
Don't need a burna we learn from Ike Turner
I tried to told ya don't cross that bridge
Without permission from them St. Lunatics

[Snoop Dogg]
Palm trees, bad bitches and wannabeez
O. G. 's like me eatin on polyseeds
Now & Laters, jellybeans, and wallabees
Real niggaz from the south I hardly ever seen
Mostly heard, sell a bird off the cizzurb
And when we dip, we hop and then we swizzerve
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzerm
Hair longer than hers, sharp with the fizzur
Doggy dizzog you know I like 'em dizzog
Like Kobe to Shaq, so take that
(Jermaine Dupri: Take that, take that)
Long Beach is on the motherfuckin map
The city by the sea, R.I.P.
J. D., you know about the L. B. C.
My niggaz love the stellas, cold-hearted killers
Real cap pealers, real niggaz feel us
Ain't no squealers, a lot of dope dealers
Bang diggy dang dang dogg pound gangsta crip gang
Yeah we do the damn thang
Home of coroners, scoop, buck, cocaine
Head to the church house to get a little workout
Smoke out, drink up, now put ya bank up

Crank up the beat, raise up the heat
I'm thrownin a block party on two one streets, fo' sho

Puff Daddy,What You Gonna Do?,/p/puff+daddy/what+you+gonna+do_20112078.html,"It's a Hell Up in Harlem fuckit another day
Another dollar wake up to the barking from the Rottweilers
Pull the collars make em sit for the Godfather
Then I holler to Justin my son run the water
For the shower trust fund scholarship sure to give him power
Baby momma call she pick him up in about an hour
Now free to go free to blow with the calicos
And the navajos it's just the way this player knows
Anything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam
Picked me up, in the tan Lex Land
Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?
He ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish
What is this? Three niggaz dressed in black
Roleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat
One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack
Put my finger on the trigger
Then I asked him, ""Whatchu want nigga?""
Chorus: Puff Daddy
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go
Whatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo'
You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go
(repeat 2X)
Verse Two: Puff Daddy
I pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family
Wouldn't take it, when the doctor said, ""He ain't make it""
Mom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief
How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?
Now she got beef with them bitches up the street
All because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese
She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation
On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh
That's why niggaz wanna twist my shit, flip my wig
Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gills
Before they draw, niggaz threw me to the floor
Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket
They wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin heathens
Love to see a nigga stop breathin
I heard a voice sing out, ""Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?
Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads""
G'night Bone
Chorus
Verse Three: Puff Daddy
Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision
Watching my life go down, like Christian
Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis
Spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game
And deuce deuces can't stand the pain
Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard
They just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka
Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers
Three headed for my chest straight, the other two
Came a little late, and just barely missed my face
I'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars
One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars
Shit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid
And own the world, bone all the girlie girls
That's when I finally figured out
That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father
And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions
No more confessions only suggestions
I think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up
From the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there
Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum
Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them
Niggaz didn't even get to peep
Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat
Clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet
Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead
They fled, and they waved, hot lead
If I ain't duck, I'd be on my deathbed
Sucker move, for that they don't get no props
Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots
We in the block, no Land posters just old posters
Of gangsta niggaz I see ghosts of gangsta figures
I'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car
Took me in the saloon and said, ""Puffy, there you are""
Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots
Washin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches
I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth
Happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt
That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin
That's when I heard the bustin, yeah

Ladies and gentlemen
We are gathered here today
To join

Yeah, yeah
One-two, one-two, in the place to be
As you can see
I am the crush groovin'
There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight
The record breaking and the record making
Yeah, yeah, turn this up

From the states to over seas
Every city in between I hit the scene
Catch fire like kerosene
Geting paid for more then a decade
We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the pd invasion
Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?
No one important, just another nigga flossing
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real
You just a clone wit' a production deal
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth
Hottest niggas out
Alot better, the shit's too strong
I'm home now, daddy's been gone too long

1 - [lil' kim]
What you niggas want
Wanna talk slick
Wanna do shit, try shit, new shit
Who you fucking wit'
You and your weak clique
Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit
You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret
Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with
You can't run, you can't hide
Bad boy 'till the day we die

Tell they all like jordan in the fall
On top of the hill like lauren, killing 'em soft'
What you grillin' me for?
Kept my name good, we from the same hood
Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood
Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me
Wanna grind on me
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me
You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping
Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching
At all times, put it all on the line
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares
No one to talk to, don't know who to trust
Got your gun out and don't know who to bust
It get like that though, when you stack that dough
Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close
So put up you guards, keep faith in god
I promise y'all the world'll be ours

Repeat 1

Your games amaze, but a lot of ways, many choices
Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices
Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year
So I listen back cause the street is missing that
What a world we live in
So cold I'm shivering, slipping
Gotta work with what I'm given, shit
Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'
Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'
That's why they hang around you, just to be seen
Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine
No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm
What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?
Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt
In a verse I show the whole earth my work
It got to get better because it can't get no worse

As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the s*** singers that I wanna s**
I'd probably go to jail
For fuckin Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey, kinda scary
Wait a minute what about my honey Mary
The jeans they fittin like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'ma show ya who the boss of intercourse is
S**, I'm takin no losses
Even groups like swv and tlc
Can't see B-I-G with telepathy
The recipe, a picture hardcore with a gun
Pimpin ain't easy but it's always fun
When it comes to nuts, I bust'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun

[Chorus:]

[Mary J. Blige]
Yeah nigga, what makes you better than the next nigga
Seen you last week in your black ass car, freak
You try to play like Mr all of that
But now you wanna come to me with some chit-chat
I don't have no time for no wham-bam thank you mam
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit, then you scram
The same old shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not having it, no I'm not having it
You got to do a lot more of this, that how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't running up in me
I need a man who's looking out for some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we'll see
So if you with it, then rock the 7-digits
And I might just give you a call (Damn)
If you ain't with it then don't waste your time at all
Biggie Smalls, and you don't stop

All my love dreams that I've had
And my dreams are very special
All my life I've looked for you
And you make the dream come true
You make me another you
Love like this is kind of special
Things you seem to do devine
This is ours to combine
I know our love must make a begining
Love is life and life is living

Why his words forever remain
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents

Pray together
Less fight
We better unite
As genocide chemical war
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure

Eve:
It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams
Won't get the chance to chase it

Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life

We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live

From servin' here Rob certain I'm burnin'
On my way from Mt. Vernon
Swervin' a stretch bourbon
Identity of this man I look persian
Hey yo we gotta get him

Or who sent them
First nigga to find them better bend'em
Cuz I just spoke to Polly Fontaine
Shit ain't a game, and Sean feel the same
So y'all niggas betta get on point

[P. Diddy]
Well it seems like our bad boys have theirselves in a bit of a jam
Seems like Bristal got his back up against the wall
Well let's see how Rob B-O handles this one
Bad boys watch ya backs
Watch ya backs bad boys

[Black Rob]
Yo, who the fuck is this pagin' me at eight fourty six

Sense of urgency on the cell
We gon' pick you up, when ya flight land
We in a tight jam
Me and Diddy fam sorta like his right hand
I touch down like two-thirty
If I was on you, your hoe's and them cowards Im'll do dirty
Still a commssion and we all equal
All lethal
Caught'em doin' dirt to the wrong people
It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me Im'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and
And I'm tired in jail
Even though through the riots I prevailed
Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

[Mark Curry]
Yo, uh uh uh, hello
It gotta be the same cats

When they mumble to each other
Like Milan they run for cover
New cuz this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This s***s big, the first thing to catch to where pd is

Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

Yo I ain't really tryin' to duck no strays
So watch what the fuck you say
It's ya mouth that started the shit
Now you actin' all retarted and shit
Dog I came to play my part and that's it
We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln ls Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan
Call Sean tell Sean we gone
We'll meet him in Hong Kong
With two chicks both they thongs on
Mabe Ling and Kim Long
Both of them dead wrong
Two rich bitches the feds on

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, well it seems like brother Loon is out in Hong Kong
He's found his self in a sticky icky icky situation
But you know somethin' I have faith in the bad boys
Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

[Kain]
Heh, I'm bout to do Santa Dimengo
On a horse named Bingo
A fugitive lookin' for Puff switchin' my lingo
Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo
Callin' up mc from a cuatro cinco
The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two s***s
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in ny
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots
Ha yeah!
Suited up ready to dumbs out
Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet
So I keep 'em on his toes, that way he never sleeps
Bigger than the king and the Pope, sling no dope

Want a war, you niggas better bring yo' force
And when I say we won't quit, believe this shit

And when I'm talkin' to a ho, let you meet my bitch
When Puff talk, you niggas take heed to this

Yo, if you down to act, we came to scrap
We beef '89, still watch your back
A nigga smack me, I'mma smack 'em back
If it lead to the guns, then that be that
And lately, niggas that snake me, just make me
Wanna send 'em heat without ac
Thinks I'm sweet, taste me
How much you really want it?
Enough to put a mil' on it or your deal on it?
This year Cancun, guess who I'm going wit
My own niggas, see I pay my own trip
Make my own chips, I copped my own 6
I knock my own shit, like I'm on my own dick
My day be short, need coke, raid the fort
I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court
And though niggas die for, go on the shelf
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt
Me, I always had, so I never go for self
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt
Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down
Kick your door down, surround the block
Where you go now?
Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round
Way I leave the furniture, think it was co-found
Here's the low-down, messin' with Mase gotta go down
What more could I say but hey, guess you niggas know now

Lil' Kim spread like syphilis
You think I'm pussy?
I dare you to stick your dick in this
Chrome 4-4, inconspicuous in the 6-0-0, shit's ridiculous
Speak when you're spoken to and only with permission
Like E. F. Hutton, when I talk, niggas listen
So don't ya'll be mad at me, cuz I'm the Q to the B
To the motherfuckin' E-E
Copped my cd, now all ya'll wanna be me
See me on the tv, beds will dip in 3-D
Peep the cd, chromed out and phoned out
My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out
I gets it on, money keep growin'
Ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone
In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone
Like a splinter I enter
So why should I throw my blows in those
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles
My nigga B. I. G, I'mma ride for
But it ain't too many niggas that I'd die for

Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I should of known one day that you'd be gone
You should of known one day that I'd be gone
You should of known one day that we'd be
[Verse One by Carl Thomas]
Why did you have to be this way
Baby all you had to say
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be
But you planned a great escape
Bright and early before I wake
We both knew we had to break
You could of chose a better way

Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I should of known one day that you'd be gone
You should of known one day that I'd be gone
You should of known one day that we'd be

[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]
It was cold the way you left
Still the pain is in my chest
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me
If you put away your pride
And look deep into my eyes
It would of been to your surprise
That I got up to apologize
But you were gone

[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]
Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head

You should of known one day that we'd be

Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone
It's time to carry on
I thought that you made me happy
But it's this thing that's come between us girl
At one time you were my world
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away

[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]
(Uhh) I dreams filthy
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin ""Bastard!""
Cryin, know my friends is lying
Y'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit, don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

I just got hit by a bus
Shouldn've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I Wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Uh
Give my all you take it from me (from me girl)
And don't even replace it for me (noo)
I wish you just fake it for me (fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I f-cks wit you I needed you (need you)
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you (treated you)
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missing something I wish I was what completed you

I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrero
But for now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman
Bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up
I got my cuban mommy cooking up
We got it all from Heron to Fishscale
New York to Ismail get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Going around the globe, hunnies wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip
Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the feds, catch me if you can
I'm a still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Get there and bury the bricks in the sand
They think I want a tan, I'm sittin' on a hundred grand
So I can hit the boat and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and hide the money in the tower
Stack blocks by the keys

Yeah aight then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount the flows
Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf.
Dot on your head, take all your strength
Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seam while I'm sonning you like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your duel cassette running me
Tryin' to get in front of me playa, but you ain't gettin' none of me
Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming B
When you want it? Now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators
With my mega click, involved in Montega bricks
niggaz is mega sick, and you know we roll mega thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'
All that for frontin', what you gonna do? Nothin'
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write better nationalize
I'm into gettin' money, twistin' hunnies
niggaz is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
pussy wasn't all that, that's why I never called her
It's all about quick whips and fast knicks
Gats with mad clips, tv's in your whips
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I'm tryin' to get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so I'll s***s match
Runnin' around all crazy twistin' hunnies back
And breakin' niggaz that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Your click be like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all

Yo, hard as it is to make a buck I ain't tryin' to get stuck
So I'm a keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect Tek-9's and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with hunnies crushin' grapes
So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Luchion the mayor
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit so the town supports this
(Uh-hun)
My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' rallies, and holdin' parades for the lifers groups
Now what you gon' do?
When they come for you
The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing
And bubble gum chewing (whoooh)
While me and my mans are pursuin'
Who you think the ladies are enhancin'
Rocking Vansons I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how wo lock this

She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana
Dippin'
Big poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggaz named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
vcr's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribean, white sands
Discusing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

You'll see (Don't stop), you'll see"

Uhh check it out uhh
*Singing* I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay bee!
Fuck all that pretty shit
Takin it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggaz know the deal
Niggaz know who the Don is
Live from Bedford Stuyvesant the livest one
Peep game uhh what what
Verse One: Puff Daddy
Out of this world like Mars when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggaz bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers
Chorus:
Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets -- these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality
Verse Two: Jay-Z
Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't she'd
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin of Rome
Reoccuring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggaz study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, onee seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
To the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggaz that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin or clappin have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin, I'm clappin your way
Chorus
Verse Three: Notorious B. I. G.
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
Gs's with bb's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
Than Richie, quickly, niggaz wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggaz represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggaz with punany, like heiny
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggaz call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental..
What? From a, from a young G's perspective.. (repeat 2X)
Chorus 2X to fade"

Phantom Of The Opera,Christine (a New Song Written By Joe Velazquez),/p/phantom+of+the+opera/christine+a+new+song+written+by+joe+velazquez_20560975.html,"To the tune of ""Rosie"" from Bye Bye Byrdie

Raoul. I was never crazy for flowers,
I confess that nothing left me colder;
I could watch a daisy for hours
And I'd feel sev'ral hours older!
Lilacs and lilies, any bloom you please,
Never failed to make my sense freeze.
But now I love each blossom that I see,
For a lovely little rose loves me.
Now my life is crystalline, when I'm with my Christine,
With a girl like Christine,
How could I be blue?
Hand in hand we'll sing
Me and little Christine;
You will be beside me, it'll Just be me and you.
Oh! I once heard a poem that goes: ""A rose is a rose is a rose""
Well I don't agree,
Take it from me,
There's one rose sweeter than any that grows!
And that's my Christine.
You Just wait and see
Life is one sweet beautiful song to me.
Now my life is crystalline,

Christine. Oh, we'll be happy, I know.

Raoul. Since I found my Christine

Christine. Off to the chapel we'll go

Raoul. With a girl like Christine

Christine. So how could we be blue?

Raoul. How could I be blue?

Christine: Oh we'll have us a home out west. A nice little split-level nest. And in ev'ry room roses in bloom...

Raoul: But there's one rose sweeter than all of the rest!
Then that's my Christine

Christine. Hand in hand we'll sing.

Both. Life is one sweet beautiful song
When love is right then
What can be wrong?
Life is one sweet beautiful song
To me!

(Raoul lifts Christine into his arms, they kiss, and he carries her offstage)"
Phantom Of The Opera,Don Juan,/p/phantom+of+the+opera/don+juan_20560974.html,"Chorus:
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat! Here the sacrifical lamb utters one dispairing bleat.

Carlotta and chorus
Poor young maiden! For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets, you will have to pay the bill- tangled in the winding sheets! Serve the meal and serve the maid! Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid Don Juan triumphs once again!

Don juan (Piangi)
Passarino faithful friend, once again recite the plan

Passarino
Your young guest believes I'm you- I, the master, you the man,

Don juan(Piangi)
When you met, you wore my cloak, she could not have seen your face. She believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place! Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what in truth is mine. When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine.

Passarino
You come home! I use your voice- slam the door like crack of doom!

Don juan (Piangi)
I shall say, ""come hide with me! where oh where? of course my room""

Passarino
Poor thing hasn't got a chance

Don juan(Piangi)
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword. Comquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh *laughs*

Aminta(Christine)
""...no thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy. no dreams within her heart, but dreams of love.""

Passarino
Master?

Don juan(Phantom)
(spoken-ish)passarino- go away! For the trap is set and waits for his prey You have come here
In pursuit of your deepest urge In pursuit of that wish which till now Has been (suddenly gets soft)silent Silent. (suddenly loud)I have brought you That our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me, dropped all defenses Completely succumbed to me Now you are here with me No second thoughts (softer)You've decided
Decided."
Phantom Of The Opera,Down Once More/Track This Murderer,/p/phantom+of+the+opera/down+once+moretrack+this+murderer_20560973.html,"Phantom-
Down once more to the dungeons
Of my black despair!
Down we plunge to the prison
Of my mind.
Down that path into darkness
Deep as hell!
(He rounds on her, bitterly)
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
(He hears the offstage voices of the pursuing mob)

Mob-
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!

Phantom (moving off again)-
Hounded out by everyone!
Met with hatred everywhere!
No kind words from anyone!
No compassion anywhere!
Christine, why? Why?

Madame Giry-
Your hand at the level of your eyes.

Raoul-
At the level of your eyes.

Mob-
At the level of your eyes.

Madame Giry-
He lives across the lake, Monsieur. This is as far as I dare go.

Raoul-
Thank you.

Mob-
Track down this murderer he must be found! Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Too long he's preyed on us, but now we know, the phantom of the opera lives down below!

Christine-
Have you gorged yourself at last
In your lust for blood?
(no reply)
Am I now to be prey
To your lust for flesh?

Phantom-
That fate which condemns me
To wallow in blood
Has also denied me
The joys of the flesh.
This face, the infection
Which poisons our love.
This face which earned
A mother's fear and loathing.
A mask,
My first unfeeling
Scrap of clothing.
(he places veil on her head)
Pity comes too late,
Turn around and face your fate.
An eternity of this
Before your eyes!
(they are almost touching, she looks coldly into his face)

Christine-
This haunted face
Holds no horror for me now.
It's in your soul
That the true distortion lies.
(the phantom senses Raoul's presence, behind the portcullis Raoul comes out of water)

Phantom-
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest.
Sir.

Christine-
Raoul!

Phantom (to Raoul)-
This is indeed an unparalleled delight.
I had rather hoped that you would come.
And now my wish comes true.
You have truly made my night.

Raoul (pleading)-
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?

Phantom (to Christine, dryly)-
Your lover makes a passionate plea.

Christine
Please, Raoul, it's useless.

Raoul
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her.
Show some compassion.

Phantom (snarls furiosly at Raoul)
The world showed no compassion to me!

Raoul
Christine, Christine, let me see her.

Phantom
Be my guest, sir.
Monsieur, I bid you welcome.
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay
For the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now
Except perhaps Christine.
Start a new life with me.
Buy his freedom with your love.
Refuse me and you send your lover
To his death!
This is the choice!
This is the point of no return!

Christine
The tears I might have she'd
For your dark fate
Grow cold and turn to tears of Hate!

Raoul
Christine, forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
I did it all for you and all for nothing.

Christine
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend.
We had such hopes.

Phantom
Too late for turning back.

Christine
Now those hopes are shattered.

Phantom
Too late for prayers and pity.

Raoul
Say you love him

Phantom
All hope of cries for help.

Raoul
And my life is over

Phantom
No point in fighting.
For either way you choose you cannot win.

Raoul
But either way you choose he has to win.

Phantom
So do you end your days with me?
Or do you send him to his grave?

Raoul
Why make her lie to you to save me?

Christine
Angel of music.

Phantom
Past the point of no return.

Raoul
Christine, say no!

Christine
Who deserves this?

Raoul
Don't throw your life away for my sake.

Phantom
His life is now the prize

Christine
Why do you curse mercy?

Phantom
Which you must earn,

Raoul
I fought so hard to free you!

Phantom
You've past the point of no return!

Christine
Angel of music
You deceived me.
I gave you my mind blindly.

Phantom
You try my patience.
Make your choice.

Christine
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone.

Mob
Track down this murderer.

Phantom
Take her! Forget me.
Forget all of this.
Leave me alone.
Forget all you've seen.
Go now!
Don't let them find you.
Take the boat. Leave me hear, go now don't wait just take her and go before it's too late... Go... Go now and leave me!

Mob
The phantom of the opera is there
Deep down below.

Phantom
(musical box plays magicaly)
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade.
Masquerade!
Hide your face
So the world will never find you.
Christine, I love you

Christine
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime.

Raoul
Say the word and I will follow you

Christine
Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Phantom
You alone can make my song
Take flight.
It's over now, the music
Of the night!!! (Phantom sits on throne sits on part of his cloak, wraps the rest around him and disappears, Meg picks up his mask in her little hand)"

Monsieur Reyer:
Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing!

Monsieur Lefevre:
Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry...
... Ladies and gentlemen, please, if I could have your attention, thank you. As you know, for some weeks there have been rumors of my imminent retirement. I can now tell you that these are all true...

Carlotta: (interrupting)
Ah-Ha!

Lefevre: (Continued) And it is my pleasure to introduce you to the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire: Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre. I'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the Junk business.

Andre: Scrap metal, actually.

Meg:(Whispering to Christine) They must be rich.

Monsieur Firmin:
And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron,

Monsieur Andre:
The Vicomte de Chagny

Christine: It's Raoul. Before my father died at the house by the sea...I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts. He called me Little Lotte.

Meg: Christine, he's so handsome.

Raoul:
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts, especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire.

Monsieur Lefevre:
Vicomte, gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons.

Voices/Piangi:
Brava! Brava!

Monsieur Lefevre:
Signor Ubaldo Piangi

Raoul:
An honor signor. I believe I am keeping you from your rehearsal. I will be here this evening to share your great triumph. My apologies, monsieur.

Monsieur Reyer:
Thank you, monsieur le Vicomte!
Once more if you please, signor

Carlotta

He love me. He love me. Love me, love me, love me.

Christine

He wouldn't recognize me.

Meg

He didn't see you.

Giry

Madame Giry:
We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet, monsieur

Monsieur Andre:

Madame Giry:
My daughter, Meg Giry

Monsieur Firmin:
And that exceptional beauty
No relation, I trust?

Madame Giry:
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin,
Very promising.

Monsieur Andre:
Daae, did you say?
No relation to the Famous Swedish Violinist?

Madame Giry:
His only child.
Orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories.

Monsieur Firmin:
An orphan, you say?

Monsieur Lefevre:
Well, the Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala.

Carlotta:
I hope he is as excited about dancing girls as your new managers,
Because I will not be singing!

Monsieur Andre:
What do we do?

Monsieur Lefevre:
Grovel
Grovel, grovel.

Monsieur Firmin:
Right.

Monsieur Andre:
Principessa Bella Diva!

Carlotta: Si! Si! Si!

Monsieur Firmin:
Goddess of song!

Monsieur Andre:
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa in Act. 3 of Hannibal?

Monsieur Firmin:
Perhaps the signora--

Carlotta:
Yes, Yes, But, no!
Coz' I 'ave not my costume for Act. 3,
Coz' (shouting at someone) someone not finish it!
And I 'ate my hat
No, that's better (laughs)

I remember there was mist...
Swirling mist upon a vast glassy lake
There were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat
And in the boat there was a man

Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?

[She removes his mask. Phantom covers his face]

[Phantom]
... Damn you
You little prying Pandora
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you, you little lying Delilah
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free
Damn you, curse you...

Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look, or bear to think of me
This loathesome gargoyle
Who burns in hell, But secretly yearns for heaven
Secretly, secretly...
Oh Christine...

Fear can turn to love
You'll learn to see, to find the man behind the monster
This repulsive carcass
Who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty,
Secretly, secretly...
Oh, Christine...

Fair in the city. The gypsies.  I was very young, studying to be a ballerina. One of many living in the dormitories  of the opera house.

In my dark, my heart heard music.

Rise up and reach the world
No one would listen

Seemed to cry ""I hear you;
I hear your fears,
Your torment and your tears. ""

Shared in my emptiness

This is damnable!

(Firmin)
Andre please don't shout!
It's publicity!
And the take is vast
Free publicity!

(Andre)
But we have no cast!

(Firmin)
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Ah, it seems you've got one too

(Andre, reading)
Dear Andre what a charming gala,
Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster, must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime!?!

(Firmin, reading)
Dear, Firmin
Just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the ghost by return of post
P. T. O
No one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed!

(Both)
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain

(Firmin)
These are both signed O. G.

(Andre)
Who the hell is he?

(Both realizing)
Opera Ghost!

(Firmin)
It's nothing short of shocking
(Andre)
He is mocking our position!

(Firmin)
In addition he wants money!

(Andre)
What a funny apparition!

(Both)
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer, he is clearly quite insane!

(Raoul interrupting)
Where is she?

(Firmin)
You mean Carlotta?

(Raoul)
I mean Miss Daae
Where is she?

(Andre)
Well how should we know?

(Raoul)
I want an answer!
I take it that you sent me this note!

(Firmin)
What's all this nonsense?

(Andre)
Of course not!

(Firmin)
Don't look at us!

(Raoul)
She's not with you then?

(Andre)
Of course not!

(Firmin)
We're in the dark!

(Raoul)
Monsieur don't argue!
Isn't this the letter you wrote?

(Firmin)
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote? (realising his mistake)Written!

(Andre, reading)
Do not fear for Miss Daae
The angel of music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again.

(Raoul)
If you didn't write it, then who did?

(Carlotta)
Where is he?

(Firmin)
Ah, welcome back!

(Carlotta)
Your precious patron
Where is he?

(Raoul)
What is it now?

(Carlotta)
I have your letter
A letter which I rather resent

(Firmin)
And did you send it?

(Raoul)
Of course not!

(Andre)
As if he would!

(Carlotta)
You didn't send it?

(Raoul)
Of course not!

(Firmin)
What's going on?

(Carlotta)
You dare to tell me that this is not the letter you sent?

(Raoul)
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?

(Raoul, reading)
Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered
Christine Daae...

Carlotta: Christine Daae!

(Raoul contiues)... Will be singing on your behalf tonight
Be prepared for a great misfortune
Should you attempt to take her place.

(Firmin and Andre)
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name--!

(Madame Giry)
Miss Daae has returned.

(Firmin)
I hope no worse for wear as far as we're concerned

(Andre)
Where precisely is she now?

(Madame Giry)
I thought it best she was alone

(Meg Giry)
She needed rest

(Raoul)
May I see her?

(Madame Giry)
No, Monsieur
She will see no one

(Piangi, Carlotta,)
Will she sing, will she sing?

(Madame Giry)
Here, I have a note

(Andre, Carlotta, Raoul)
Let me see it!

(Firmin, reaching for note)
Please

Gentlemen,
I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature
Detailing how my theatre is to be run
You have not...

(fading to the Phantom's voice)

Followed my instructions
I shall give you one last chance

(Phantom singing)
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent, which makes my casting, in a word, ideal

(Phantom talking)
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five
Which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored
A disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant
O. G.

(Carlotta)
Christine!

(Andre)
Whatever next?

(Carlotta)
It's all a plot to help Christine!

(Firmin)
This is insane...

(Carlotta)
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte -- her lover!

(Raoul)
Indeed?
Can you believe this?

(Andre)
Signora!

(Carlotta)
O traditori!

(Firmin)
This is a joke!

(Andre)
This changes nothing!

(Carlotta)
O menititori!

(Firmin)
Signora!

(Andre)
You are our star!

(Firmin)
And always will be!

(Andre)
Signora...

(Firmin)
This man is mad!

(Andre)
We don't take orders!

(Firmin)
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy -- the silent role...

(Andre/Firmin)

Carlotta will be playing the lead!

(Carlotta)
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!

(Madame Giry)
Who scorn his word, beware to those...

(Carlotta) You have reviled me!

(Madame Giry)
The angel sees, the angel knows...

(Carlotta)
You have rebuked me!

(Andre/Firmin)
Signora, pardon us...

(Carlotta)
You have replaced me!

(Andre/Firmin)
Please, Signora
We beseech you...

(Madame Giry)
This hour shall see your darkest fears

(Meg Giry/Raoul)
I must see her...

(Carlotta)
Abbandonata!
Deseredata!
O, sventurata!

(Madame Giry)
The angel sees, the angel hears...

(Raoul)
Where did she go...?

(Carlotta)
Abbandonata!
Disgraziata!

(Andre/Firmin)
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr...

(Raoul/Madame Giry/Meg Giry)
What new surprises lie in store...?

Phantom Of The Opera,Point Of No Return,/p/phantom+of+the+opera/point+of+no+return_21009871.html,"Past the point of no return, no backward glances
The games we've played, till now are at an end
Past all thought of if or when, no use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend

What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks it's door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?

Past the point of no return, the final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return

You have brought me
To that moment where words run dry
To that moment where speech disappears
Into silence, silence

I have come here, hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you
No second thoughts, I've decided, decided

Past the point of no return, no going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong, one final question
How long should we two wait, before we're one?

When will the blood begin to race

The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?

Past the point of no return, the final threshold
The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you here beside you

Anywhere you go let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of

What is it? What has happened?
Ubaldo! Oh my God! My God! 
We're ruined Andre, ruined! 
Monsieur le Vicomte! 
Come with me! 
Oh my darling, my darling! 
Who has done this to you?
You! Why did you let this happen?

Monsieur le Vicomte
I know where they are
But can I trust you?
You must, but remember
Your hand at the level of your eyes! 
But why, why?
The Punjab lasso, Monsieur
First Buquet, now Piangi

Like this, Monsieur I'll come with you
No, Meg! No, you stay here! 
Come with me, Monsieur
Hurry, or we shall be too late!"

From the 1831 production of Robert le Diable by Meyerbeer. 10 francs for this. 10 thank you. 10 still. 15, thank you. Is I'm bid. Going at 15. Your number sir? Lot 665 ladies and gentlemen.

Auctioneer: Lot 666, then: a chandelier in pieces. Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained. We are told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster. Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light. Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago with a little illumination. Gentlemen!

Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses

Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day.
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light,
And listen to the music of the night.

Close your eyes
And surrender to your darkest dreams.
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before.
Close your eyes,
Let your your spirit start to soar.
And you'll live as you've never lived before.

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind
Start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be.
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night"

Or as unchanging as the sea.
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me.

Think of all the things we've shared and seen,
Don't think about the way things might have been.

Think of me,
Think of me waking, silent and resigned.
Imagine me
Trying too hard to put you from my mind.
Recall those days, look back on all those times,
Think of the things we'll never do.
There will never be a day when I won't think of you!

Can it be Christine?

It seems so long ago,
How young and innocent we were

But I remember her.

Flowers fade, The fruits of summer fade,
They have their seasons, so do we.
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think...

Her father promised her...

You were once my one companion,
You were all that mattered.
You were once a friend and father,
Then my world was shattered.

Wishing you were somehow here again,
Wishing you were somehow near.
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed,
Somehow you would be here.

Wishing I could hear your voice again,
Knowing that I never would.
Dreaming of you won't help me to do,
All that you dreamed I could!

Passing bells and sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions,
You were warm and gentle.

Too many years fighting back tears,
Why can't the past just die!

Wishing you were somehow here again,
Knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!

No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye
Help me say goodbye..."

Abre las puertas de tu alma, pide ayuda, por favor"

Del siglo veintiuno 
No busques mas a un hombre 
Que no queda ninguno 

Después de otro desengaño 
Junte coraje y volví a empezar 
Simpático el divorciado 
Casi me vuelvo a enamorar 
Hay algo que aún no te he dicho 
Una sorpresa te voy a dar 
Y entraron cuatro niñitos 
Gritando juntos ¡Hola Papá!

No creas lo que ves 
No se puede confiar 
Y ahora que voy a hacer? 
A donde iré a buscar? 

Donde están los hombres? 
Donde se han metido? 
Si no están casados 
Son medio raros 
O aburridos 
Donde están los hombres? 
Que yo no los veo!? 
Si no son tramposos 
Son mentirosos 
O tienen miedo 

El día que vi a un soltero 
Me dije no se me va a escapar 
Salimos un mes entero 
todos los días con la mamá 
Si quieres vivir conmigo 
A mi viejita hay que llevar 
Al fin se marchó ofendido 
Cuando la quise envenenar

No creas lo que ves 
No se puede confiar 
Y ahora que voy a hacer? 
A donde iré a buscar? 

Donde están los hombres?

Son mentirosos 
O tienen miedo

Y casi sobre la hora 
Yo conocí al hombre ideal 
Sensible y divertido 
Era mi sueño hecho realidad 
Hoy vine con un amigo 
Vamos a ir todos a bailar 
Bailaron apretaditos 
Toda la noche tal para cual 

No creas lo que ves 
No se puede confiar 
Y ahora que voy a hacer? 
A donde iré a buscar!? 

Donde están los hombres? 
Donde se han metido?

Los sigue y los quiere

Si hay amores que matan, sentimientos que hieren
Me pregunto por qué no se pueden dejar
Y si te dejan te mueres

No tengo con quien hablar, me siento tan lejos de él
No sabe cuando estoy mal, tampoco cuando estoy bien
Igual que un carnaval en donde nadie es quien es
Vivimos con un disfraz que nos ayuda a seguir de pie

En el fondo es tan solo una muestra de cariño
Ya te irás acostumbrando, sólo es gente extrovertida

Ya lo ves, comen todo y después
A sufrir con la dieta otra vez
Pero nunca te dicen que no si les vuelves a ofrecer
Quiero brindar por mi gente sencilla
Por el amor, brindo por la familia

Ya va a comenzar el baile, quiten todo y a la pista
Que otra vez dirá la tía que la nena es una artista
Ves que yo te lo decía, al final se puso bueno
Como dice el abuelo, ""En el fondo nos queremos""

Ya lo ves, esto sigue y son las tres

Bien o mal me quedo aquí

Ya no puedo vivir, no puedo seguir
Ni contigo ni sin ti
Ya no voy a luchar ni tratar de pelear
Si los dos somos así

Discutimos porque siempre
En todo quieres tu tener razón
Nos buscamos y ninguno quiere
Ser primero en pedir perdón

Y seguimos inventando, construyendo
Destrozando, comprendiendo, ocultando
Ofreciendo y quitando y aunque todo
Lo que siento yo por ti es un gran amor

Ya no puedo vivir, no puedo seguir
Ni contigo ni sin ti
Ya no puedo cambiar ni volver hacia atrás
Bien o mal me quedo aquí

Ya no puedo vivir, no puedo seguir
Ni contigo ni sin ti
Ya no voy a luchar ni tratar de pelear
Si los dos somos así

Ya no puedo vivir, no puedo seguir
Ni contigo ni sin ti
Ya no puedo cambiar ni volver hacia atrás
Bien o mal me quedo aquí

Ya no puedo vivir, no puedo seguir
Ni contigo ni sin ti
Ya no voy a luchar ni tratar de pelear

No te confundas conmigo, que no soy lo que parece
Todos tenemos secretos que no se pueden decir
Pero tú nunca te olvides que cuando vas, yo volví

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así aunque lo niegue la gente

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así y el corazón nunca miente

Te veo sólo de noche, es un misterio tu vida
Eres como un fantasma que entra y sale a escondidas
No sé por qué te sorprendes si siempre fuimos así
Siento algo últimamente, algo que nunca sentí

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así aunque lo niegue la gente

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así y el corazón nunca miente

Aquí termina la historia de la mitad de mi vida
Cuando encontré una carta en la que él le decía
Mejor dejemos un tiempo, ella sospecha de mí
Hoy vivo sola y tranquila, tratando de ser feliz

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así aunque lo niegue la gente

Ojos que no ven
Corazón que presiente
Esto es así y el corazón nunca miente"

De un mundo de sensaciones que no encontre
Y al descubrir que era todo una gran fantasia volvi
Porque entendi que queria las cosas que viven en ti

Mirándolo de frente le dije, ""Adiós, mi vida""
Se quedó tan confundido
Que no supo qué hacer

Cuando vi que se callaba como nunca me agrandé
Y le dije en la cara tantas veces, ""¡Márchate!""
Que de los nervios, al poco rato
Me empezó a lavar los platos

Ya lo ven, ya lo ven
Es como dice la gente
Ya lo ven, ya lo ven
Perro que ladra no muerde

Con el orgullo destrozado en mil pedazos
Me fui mirando para atrás por si volvía
Cuando de pronto escuché aquel portazo
Me dije, ""No hagas caso, ya volverá algún día""

La llamé un mes entero y no me quiso responder
Me citó una mañana y mientras iba yo pensé
Debe haberse arrepentido pero cuando al fin llegué
No había nadie, sólo una nota, ""En la calle está tu ropa""

The other side of the moon is not

Maybe some time
They'll make it a ride

Wandering all for her ruby?
One day she'll come in through my window
Yes, she gave me her own true pledge

For what’s missing I'll sacrifice my flesh
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
That's how it's been with Andro Queen

Loving on our bed of flowers
Breathing in the smell of her musk
In a moon of milk she is scared, yes, she is
But she shows me under her silk

Mi aspekti ĉe via mano al vidi la ringo
Kaj ni will promeni kune al via cambro
Nia ami will esti nova

She's off on a silver rocket
Off to the gas and rings of Saturn
Off her head she gave me a lock, yes, she did
For my neck—a rusted locket

About the boy who fell from glory
And how he was a wicked son

This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am with my hand

He took his sister from his head
And then painted her on the sheets
And then rolled her up in grass and trees
And they kissed 'till they were dead

This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am, with my hand

Well sit right down my evil son
And let me tell you a story
About the boy who fell from glory
And how he was a wicked son

This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am, with my hand

This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am, with my hand"

Taht comes from a gun
Named extintion

Could have happened to anyone

And he melted into fluid named extintion
One thousand miles an hour
I'm just like anyone
I want to feel
The road of tar beneath the wheel named extinction
And evolving from the sea
Would no be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something
About a son of a gun
Named extinction."

i forgot about all laws and i forgot about the rain
they were talking on the 9 and all across the amy band
across the road they were turning around and headed south with me
it got so crowded on the road i started driving in the sand
my head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
the desert turned to mud it seems that everybody heard
everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
then i heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
they were getting interviewed by some Goodman whose name was Bill
i'm almost there to Vegas where they're puttin' on a show
they've come so far i've lived this long at least i must just go and say hello"

Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords

The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away but I just had to look
Having read the book, I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Dragged my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Got my way upstairs and had a smoke
Then somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all

Now they know how many holes
It takes to fill the Albert Hall

By that night, news of Palmer's death had traveled back to the camp. Spirits were low and Colonel Forbin felt devastated. Even though he had only been in Gamehendge for one day, he had already developed a deep hatred for Wilson. He wanted desperately to help the revolutionaries, but without Palmer, it seemed hopeless. He wandered slowly through the camp and passed Errand Wolfe, sitting by the fire with Rutherford, who had returned that afternoon. He walked on and soon found himself outside of Tela's hut. Forbin knocked and walked in. Tela sat behind a makeshift desk in the center of a room that was littered with small cages containing spotted stripers, a tiny three-legged breed of animal. The unit monster sat in the corner. The colonel took a step toward Tela and spoke. ""I needed to come here tonight"" he said, ""to tell you that I've fallen in love with you."" He looked to her eyes for approval but her face remained frozen in an expressionless stare. An awkward blanket of silence fell over the room and hung for
a long moment before being shattered by the sound of the door swinging violently open. It was Rutherford the Brave. The ironclad knight rushed across the room and gripped the throats of Tela and the unit monster in each of his mighty hands. They struggled to break free but even the unit monster was no match for Rutherford's power and soon it was over. The bodies fell to the floor in a lifeless heap. Colonel Forbin stepped forward from where he stood in the corner unable to contain his confusion and rage and screamed ""WHY?"" His question was answered by Errand Wolfe who had quietly slipped through the doorway during the confusion. ""She was a spy,"" he said, and explained to Forbin that she had been sending information to Wilson using the spotted stripers as carriers. Roger's death had aroused his suspicion, and Palmer's had confirmed it. The colonel stood in silence in a world that had turned up-side-down so many times that he no longer knew which way was up. It had all seemed so simple when he first arrived. G
Ood versus evil, and of course he had sided with good as he had done all his life. And now, he stood and stared into the eyes of Errand Wolfe and he saw evil. The entire picture began to seem like an enormous puzzle with one piece missing, and the colonel knew what that piece was. ""Within twenty-four hours,"" he said to Errand Wolfe, ""You will have the Helping Friendly Book."" And even as the words were leaving his lips, he found himself running out the door and into the forest, not towards Prussia, but toward the great mountain looming in the distance."

The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care
If you keep your eyes open, you may find yourself there

Such is the promise, such is the curse
You could just live your life better or worse
Knowing the casual dreams up on that hill
Beckons and sways but won't bend to your will

You might find a river under a mountain that
Feeds a remote, subteranian fountain
Drink from this taste just a hint of a dream
That some how leads in to the underground stream

The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care

Moving slowly towards the shore, burdened with uncertainty
I'm gaining power, losing speed, wondering as I near your
Door
Will you hold it open for the tidal wave approaching shore?

You've become an island in the hazy world surrounding me
Offering a vast reward each time I safely cross the sea
All too often I become lost in the fog and haze
Clinging still, against my will, to promises of clearer days

Losing bits and pieces in descent 'til I'm no longer whole

I needed dinner and a place where I could throw my weight around,
I detected faint axilla scent that put me off my appetite,
But mouflon warring where I went renewed in me a need to fight,
Then reveling in mirror mask I soon was lost in foggy ditch,
Without a feather gray or white to tickle that piano witch,
Fearing that I must expose my worm to holographic haze,
My Clinometer error rose and spawned in her new mawkish ways,
I woke the witch with reverence reserved for serpents, snails, and slugs,
I pulled the witch from out the ditch and turned to face the furry thugs,
The sheep they smiled with teeth agleam,
The weapons in their hooves revolved I detected a prostatic ream,
I gulped and felt my loins dissolve!!!!!!!!!"

Never understood what my body was for
That's why I always leave it layin out on the floor

Where different faces fit before

The line I trace begins to weave
A tangled web from wall to wall"

Outside the gate
And the autumn bells are ringing
But they'll just have to wait

Have you seen him around
With his three coned cap
That he wears like a crown?

Have you seen his stripped stockings
And heard his sad tale
About the kids under the carpet
And the purple humpbacked whales

Here come the ambassadors
They show up one by one
Brett is tasting all the soup
To see if it is done

Wendy's on the windowsill
Waiting to be let in
And we're all in the bathtub now
Making bathtub gin

The kings storm the hallway
They've climbed up through the gate
They didn't mean to be impolite
But they just couldn't wait

Here comes the joker
With his silly grin
He carries a martini
Made of bathtub gin

Here comes the joker
We all must laugh
Cause we're all in this together
And we love to take a bath."

Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
Of ritual drumming although at first glance

It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
They hang on emotions they bottle inside
They peck at the ground
And strut out of stride.

They closed,
And I was still asleep.

For when my hand was holding hers
She whispered words and I awoke
And faintly bouncing around the room
The echo of whomever spoke
I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room
The echo of whomever spoke.

The place I saw was far beneath
The surface of the sea
My sight was poor
But I was sure
The sirens sang their songs for me
They dance above me as I sink
I see them through a crystal haze
And hear them bouncing round the room
The never ending coral maze

That time and once again I'm bouncing around the room."

Bring us back good news
But if you've tread in primal soup
Please wipe it from your shoes

Just then a porthole pirate
Scourged the evening with his cry
And sanctuary bugs deprived
The monkey of it's thigh
A dust arose and clogged my nose
Before I could blink twice
Despite the stuff that bubbled up
I gave some last advice:

The flesh from Satan's dogs
Will make the rudiments of gruel

Deduct the carrots from your pay
You worthless swampy fool

Exploding then through fields and fen
And swimming in the mire
The septic maiden's gargoyle tooth
Demented me with fire
I drifted where the current chose
Afloat upon my back
And if perchance a newt slimed by
I'd stuff it in my sack

Soon I felt a bubble form, Somewhere below my skin
But with handy spine of hedgehog
I removed the force within
Suzie then removed her mask
And caused a mighty stir
The angry mob responded
Taking turns at grabbing her

The foggy cavern's musty grime
Appeared within my palm
I snatched Rick's fork to scrape it off
With deadly icy calm

[(original lyrics - from 4.22.90)
The brothel wife then grabbed a knife
And slashed me on the tongue
I turned the blade back on the bitch
And dropped her in the dung]

The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue
And used her like a rag
To mop the slime from where the slug
Had slithered with the bag

In summing up, the moral seems
A little bit obscure...

Give the director a serpent deflector
A mudrat detector, a ribbon reflector
A cushion convector, a pitcher of nectar *
A virile dissector,a hormone collector

* or ""a penile erector"" (4.22.90, 10.31.90), or ""a picture of Nectar""

As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned
And the torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone

And wiped away the beads of sweat
That glistened on his brow
His tired feet were buried in the quagmire
And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him
And fulfillment of his vow


And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root
And pulled his body upwards
To a sea green mossy boulder
And he dragged his weary carcass [or ""shit-ass""] up the mountain


And he climbed so slowly
He climbed so slowly
Ahead
Ahead


Suddenly he heard the crack of thunder
And the rocks began to crumble overhead
And tumble down the mountain to the
Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs
Through which his path had led
And the earth began to quake beneath his feet
And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes
And he stood amidst a sea of dust and rocks and stones
Cascading down the mountain
And a thousand birds were headed for the sky. Oh...


The sacred creed will be yours
And if you wait until tomorrow
The sacred creed will be yours
To devour
Yours
To seize
And to obey
Obey


When the dust had cleared, the colonel lifted up his head
And was driven to his knees by a blazing beam of light
And he saw the silhouette that stood before him
And he bowed in reverence
Trembling in the shadow of the mighty legend's form
Icculus the prophet stood before his eyes
Looking down on Colonel Forbin
Where he shuddered in the puddles and the muck
And he quietly addressed him


And he spoke so slowly
He spoke so slowly
Ahead
He said


Colonel Forbin I know why you've come here
And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack
I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird
To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack
And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow
And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed
But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure
Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice
And greed


The sacred greed will be yours
And if you wait until tomorrow
The sacred creed will be yours
To devour
Yours
To seize
And to obey
And to obey





And the famous mockingbird swooped down out of the sky and landed on Icculus's shoulder, and Icculus whispered into the bird's ear, and it flew off toward Wilson's castle in the valley below."

Hitchin' on a twilight train,
Ain't nothin' here that I care to take along,
Maybe a song to sing when I'm long,
Don't mean to say please, said old man, I'm happy too.

Oh, I love my Rosie child, you got the way to make me happy.
You and me, we go in style.
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store-bought woman,
You make me sing like a guitar hummin.
Hang on to me, girl, our song keeps runnin' on.
Play it now, Play it now, Play it now my lady!

Cracklin Rosie, make me smile.
Darl'in if lasts for an hour well that's alright we got all night
To set the world right.
Find us a dream and don't ask no questions Yea!

Wasting away

But my old man, he's really alright
And I'm still living at home

Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along

I'm dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain

The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt 'em
Mine want me their way

I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll let me stay

Why do I have to be different to them?
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend
But we have the same old row again and again

Why do I have to move with the crowd?
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around
I worked myself to death just to fit in

When Esther first saw the Armenian man
Who groveled toward her and stood by her side
With a bucket that swung in his hand

His grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks
And his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb
And the lights from the rides showed a mischievous sparkle
That flashed in his hollow eyed stare

He said ""Little girl, you can chop off my legs
And then peel off my socks if you want to.
But I'd rather you took this old puppet from me
That I hold in my pail as we speak. ""

And he stood looking down at the innocent girl
And she stared at the bucket bewildered
Til he lifted the doll for the young girl to see
And a giant smile grew on her face
She saw the doll's eyes and she couldn't resist
And she thanked the man quickly and ran to the church
And she burst through the door with puppet held high
And a hush filled the chapel, and the people looked mean

Esther tried in vain to pacify the mob
Quibble grew to spat, to wrangle, then to brawl
The frenzied congregation struggled desperately to fetch
The pretty puppet snugly nestled deep in Esther's leather sack
Through the window of the church a storm began to rage
And Esther knew the time had come to flee

She scurried down the aisle toward the doorway in the distance
And out into the rainstorm where she felt she would be free
But the wind was blowing harder
And her skirt began to billow
Until finally her feet began to lift

And she rose above the houses and the people
And the chimneys
And Esther and the doll were set adrift
Floating higher over the hills, and the valleys and treetops
They'd flutter and glide
Soaring and turning suspended on air
With the earth far below them they'd tumble
And dive through the clouds

And she began to plummet earthward till she
Landed in the nasty part of town

She glanced about the village sure to find the evil men
Who rob and pillage in the darkest hour of night
Nervously she fumbled for the pouch that held the
Puppet on her rump.

Feeling quite outnumbered Esther hid behind
A nearby pile of lumber, where she waited
Till the dawn
Cause it would have been a blunder to
Succumb to a hoodlum on the prowl

When the morning came, she wandered through the streets
Along the chilly lake that lay beside the town
At last a peaceful moment, but she thought she heard a sound
It was an angry mob of joggers coming up to knock her down

As Esther stood and shook her head
The joggers were approaching
And she knew she had no choice left but to swim
As the frosty water sank it's bitter teeth into her hide
She tried to slide the heavy clothing from her skin

Naked now she made her way toward the shore
When suddenly she felt a tiny tugging at her toe.
And the puppet she'd forgotten wrapped it's tiny
Little arms around her ankle and wouldn't let her go.

The waves seemed to open and swallow her whole
As the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep
And the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears
As she drifted away to a tranquil
And motionless sleep."

The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for him.

With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a King."

Phish,Fast Enough For You,/p/phish/fast+enough+for+you_20108421.html,"If time were only part of the equation
Then you could draw the bound'ries of our cage
You wouldn't pile another stone upon me
And I'd be happy just to watch you age

But everything is in it's own dominion
And waiting in the shallows as I do
Appeases me as water slowly trickles out
Which isn't nearly fast enough for you

It isn't nearly fast enough for you
It isn't nearly fast enough for you

I stumble into view
But it isn't nearly fast enough for you

Phish,Fee,/p/phish/fee_20108373.html,"Fee


In the cool shade of the banana tree
On the rugged trail toward the balcony
A child of the twentieth century
A dried up Goliath and a weasel named Fee

Far away in another place
A fading beauty named Milly Grace
A gospal singer with pox on her face
And a bamboo cane to help her keep the pace

Fee was a Buddhist prodigy
Long past the age of maturity
Someday he knew it would set him free
Like it did for Floyd the chimpanzee

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free.
You're racing with the wind
You're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee
And catch your breath

Fee first met Milly in a bar in Peru
His heart was jumping like a kangaroo
Like a beast in a cage in an old Dutch zoo
It was hopping and thumping in wooden shoes

But Floyd was jealous and alone
He wanted Milly for his own
A desperate craving in his bones
""Their love"", he said, ""I will not condone.""

Then one day on a ship to Quebec
Floyd found Fee and Milly on a lover's trek
He picked up a bottle and broke off the neck
It sliced through the air, and Fee hit the deck

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
You want to stay with Milly
Until you're dead
But you just got a bottle
Upside the head

Milly turned and began to scream at Floyd
She said ""You think you're pretty mean""
And though she was as thin as a small string bean
She slammed him in the face with a nectarine

Floyd fell back over the edge of the ship
Till he hung from the rail by his fingertip
Milly said, ""Floyd I'll make you lose your grip
With this tiny piece of paper I can make you slip""

So Milly took that paper and did the deed
Floyd hit the water with astonishing speed
And as the sharks circled and began to feed
Milly knew her weasel was finally free

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
Floyd is dead; he's nothing but a ripple
Cause Milly took that paper
And sliced him on the nipple"
Phish,Fikus,/p/phish/fikus_20108437.html,"Fikus dreamed a dream for me
It cost me nothing it was free
He dreamed of walking in the sand
Of blossoms forming in his hand

Of kitchen cake and cedar shakes
Of waterfalls and yellow snakes
Of earthen dams and hydrofoils
Of watching water 'til it boils

Of holding forth from singing words
Of flying south with flocks of birds
None of this was charged to me
For as I said it was for free"

And we'll be splashing in the sea
I feel no curiosity
I see the path ahead of me
In a minute I'll be free
And we'll be splashing in the sea
We hear a tiny cry
As the ship goes sliding by
Free!
Free!
Free!
I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling I forgot
I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel free!
Free!
Free!
Free!

How I'd get ahead
And never have to worry
I'd call him instead

His answer came in actions
He never spoke a word
Or maybe I laid down the phone
Before he could be heard

I somehow feel forsaken
Like he had closed the door

As much as once before

Expanding exponentially like some recursive virus

To ride on the redundant rail

There's always one to take me back

And through the bedroom door intrude
A fretful frown and spoil the mood

Spoken by Trey [with asides by Fishman]:
Once upon a time Far far away from here
There, in a small town...
A small town...
Small town...
Small...

And on the outskirts of this town
There lived a mean, nasty, furry, ugly hound named Harpua.

Harpua roamed the outskirts of the town every day and he'd walk around looking for a little action.
So of course this day was no different from any other day and here we start the story and we see Harpua walking around on the outskirts of town near the forest kind of at the edge of the forest and he's walking in toward town...
Harpua walked toward the town...
Innocently...
And meanwhile in the town...
In a whole different part of the town
There lived a young boy all alone in a suburban neighborhood
And every day he'd sit in his room
And sit on his little couch [And smoke pot!]...

He'd sit on his little couch and
He'd listen to his stereo...
And he'd lay back and
He'd look down next to him and
He'd pet his favorite little [Dog!]
Furry little...
Oh, he loved his little...
Furry...
Thing that he pet every day while he listened to his stereo
[while sitting on the couch]
He'd pet his furry [thing on the couch] his furry...
And he looked down and he said
""I love to pet you, my little furry...
Thing that I...
I love you so much that I decided to name you
This name that I love and so I named you...
I love you so...

That's why...
That's why I pet you every day...
That's why I named you...
That's why when I first got you and
I knew how much I loved you...

I decided that I'd give you the name of...
The moniker of...
I'd call you...
Your name is...

I decided that your name would have to be...
I'd call you...
Your going to be called...
I think your name...
I call you...
You'd go as... Aaaaaaaagggghhhhhhh!!!!

Poster Nutbag sat on the couch next to Jimmy...
Poster Nutbag, the furry little kitty-cat Jimmy's pet sat next to Jimmy and he looked up at Jimmy...
And on this particular day Poster Nutbag decided to go for a little walk so Poster Nutbag got up and walked toward the door and Jimmy went to the door and he opened up the door and Poster Nutbag went outside and he started walking across the yard..
And he walk onto the sidewalk and he started walking innocently down the street and he walked down the street and suddenly he found himself wandering...
Into a new part of town that he'd never been to...

Let me take you to... Funkytown
Let me take you to... Funkytown
Let me take you to... Funkytown
Let me take you to... Funkytown

And when he got there he was walking along and suddenly he rounded a corner and in front of him he saw...
He saw Harpua...
Harpua, the ugly dog from the beginning of the story...

Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain that rose out of a vast green forest. And in the forest there were birds and lakes and rocks and trees and rivers. The forest was also inhabited by a small group of people called the lizards. The lizards were a simple people and they had lived in the forest undisturbed for thousands of years in utter peace and tranquillity. Once a year when spring came, and the first blossoms began to show, the lizards would gather at the base of the mountain, to give thanks for all that they had. They thanked the birds and they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks and the trees and the rivers; but most importantly, they thanked Icculus. Icculus lived at the top of the mountain, or at least everyone thought so, for no one had actually ever seen him. But they knew he existed, because they had the Helping Friendly Book. Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book to the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift. It contained all of the knowledge inherent in the universe, and had

Enabled the Lizards to exist in harmony with nature for years. And so they lived; until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge.

His name was Wilson and he quickly became intrigued by the Lizards way of life. He asked if he could stay on and live in the forest; and the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider, were happy to oblige. Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years, studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book, and all was well. Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone. Wilson explained that he had hidden the book, knowing that the Lizards had become dependent on it for survival. He declared himself king and enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge. He cut down the trees and built a city, which he called Prussia. And in the center of the city he built a castle, and locked in the highest tower of the castle lay the Helping Friendly Book out of the reach of the Lizards forever. But our story begins at a different time, not in Gamehendge, but on a suburban street in Long Island, and our hero is no king sitting in a castle, he is a retired colonel shaving in his bathroom.

Colonel Forbin looked square in the mirror and dragged the blade across his cold creamed skin. He saw the tired little folds of flesh that lay in a heap beneath his eyes. Fifty-two years of obedient self-restraint, of hiding his tension behind a serene veil of composure. For fifty-two years he had piled it all on the back burner, and for fifty-two years it had boiled, frothing over in a turbulent storm inside of him. It had escaped through his eyes, reacting with the cigarette smoke and the fluorescent lights and slowly accumulating into a sagging mass.

He ran his dripping palm across the stubble on the nape of his neck and thought again about the door. He had discovered the door some months back on one of his ritualistic morning walks with his dog Mcgrupp. It had started out as a typical stroll with Mcgrupp bounding joyously ahead of the preoccupied colonel. As they reached the apex of the hill, he saw it and he knew it had always been there, and felt foolish for overlooking the door for so long. At first, he tried to ignore it, but he soon found that it was impossible, and slowly his newly acquired knowledge transformed his dreary life into a prison from which there was only one escape. And on this morning, Colonel Forbin stepped through the door."

Go Johnny Go Go 
Go Johnny Go Go

Oh sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sittin' in the shade,
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made,
Oh n' people passin' by they would stop and say
'Oh my but that little country boy could play'

His mother told him 'some day you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band

Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin'

But time is a river that flows through the woods
And it led us to place we both understood

But then somebody leaves you and you’re never the same

You seemed to hear it too
Then walked on resolutely like
It wasn't meant for you

But when it came again I stopped
The voice among the trees
Came flowing sweetly louder now
In tones designed to please
Again you pulled upon my arm,
""You have to listen now""
And as you spoke, a chill went through me,
Freezing me somehow

Have asked me to bring people here for this I am well payed
The silent song will capture you, enrapture you and then,
You'll grow roots and bark and leaves, and I'll bring back more men""

I saw your movements move urgently, but words were drowned in song
""You are different though"", she said, ""you have something to say,
It was a big mistake to take you here, let's run away. ""

I tried to run, but couldn't, my head was bathed in sound,
And I looked down and saw my legs two feet beneath the ground.
My toes were roots, my fingers twigs, my skin was scaley bark
And as into an oak I changed, I watched you in the dark
Completing your transaction with the nebulous green crowd,
Of tiny dancing forest people, singing very loud.

A celebration for a tree, and then I understood,
My initial feelings in this melancholy wood
I know I felt the change in you, when we finally kissed,

Phish,Language Instructions,/p/phish/language+instructions_20691741.html,"(There are always two signals in any given ""sign."" The first says, ""Listen up! I'm gonna say something!!"" The second tells what to do. The first is always the same. The second is the variable. In some cases (asshole in the front row) the second actually leads to a third, but this is usually not the case. The first signal is a high pitched trill, usually carried for two measures. Anyone--Trey, Mike or Page may do it (But not Fish: ""Fish talks so much in real life that we don't let him talk here!""--Trey). If the jam is really hectic, the signal is different. It is a one measure figure which sounds like cccc/Bb Bb/Gg/Bb(slash = beat division), although it changes with different keys. This used to be the signal (listen to old bootlegs), but is used only rarely now. The second signal: here is a catalogue of signals based on Trey's intro, and on my own observations:
1) Simpsons theme song (you know!): Everyone goes ""D'OH!!""
2) Music to ""To everything, turn, turn, turn"": Everyone turns around and screams.
3) Four falling notes: a one measure figure, each note is bent down to the next (on the guitar, anyway): everyone falls down. 4) Triplets of a strange sounding altered chord on beats 1, 3, 1, 3 (two measures): point to asshole in the front row. (What do they do after this? Anyone at Portsmouth that can explain the cheering?)
5) One measure figure that sounds like zip zip zip zip! (i. E. Hand slides up the fretboard very quickly 4x): Band immediately plays a four bar waltz stomp.
6) Music to ""it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing"": band cuts immediately to swing beat.
7) scraping sound on the guitar (similar to #5, except that scrapes are lower pitched, and go both down and up the fretboard): everyone shouts, ""AWWW FUCK!""
8) Circus theme (listen to the intro to esther--but note! This is not a signal! It lacks the first part--the attention getter.): everyone sings a random note. That's all I have been able to decipher up to this point, although I suspect the presence of at least two more: One that just says, stop and freeze! One that says, stop and wave your hands up and down wildly (the strobes come on for this one)."

Phish,Lizards,/p/phish/lizards_20108469.html,"Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight
Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor
He was on his way to see the king
Wilson
Wilson
Wilson
He led me through the streets of Prussia talking
As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his bootheel
He said there was a place where we should go
So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which
We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring
The knight grew very quiet as we stood there
Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing

Chorus:

He said I come from the land of darkness
I said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
'Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died

He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct
From doing things smart people don't do
He said that he was once a Lizard too
His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save
His people from the fate that lay before them.
Their clumsy end was perilously near
The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened
By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book
In all of Prussia only one existed
And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook

[Chorus:]

The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets
Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor
The trick was to surrender to the flow
We walked along beneath the moon
He lead us through the bush 'till soon
We saw before our eyes a raging river
He said that we could swim it if we tried
And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms
Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk
And as his body disappeared before me
I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk

[Chorus:]

But Rutherford and Forbin weren't alone. And suddenly an unexpected movement caught his eye. On the far side of the river he saw a shaggy creature standing in the weeds who stared across at Forbin with an unrelenting gaze. A gigantic mass of muscles and claws. The hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in the water and swam toward the region where Rutherford lay. And in a flash, the beast was gone, underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while Forbin, bewildered, waited alone. The seconds dragged by in what seemed like hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream. Defeated, he bowed his head then turned to go. Suddenly with a roar, the creature emerged before him and held the brave knight's body to the sky. And the creature laid the knight upon the shore. And the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer that he'd survive. And Rutherford, brave Rutherford was alive.

Forbin and the unit monster were crouched over the soggy knight carefully removing his bulky helmet when the colonel heard a sound behind him. He turned around and came face to face with an enormous shaggy horse-like creature covered from head to tail with alternating blotches of brown and white. It was a two-toned multi-beast, and atop the multi-beast sat the most beautiful woman the colonel had ever seen. After fifty-two years of undaunted bachelorhood, the colonel felt a feeling rush over him as he had never felt before."

Words and Music: Brian Robbins

Well once upon a time in 1776,
Thomas Jefferson signed his name on a piece of marijuana,
And this document was a symbol of freedom and of liberty,
At least for the rich, white gentry.

As time marched along,
This plant that I refer to has been used for everything,
From medicine to the American flag.
And now it seems to me
That somewhere along the way,
Things got messed up, yeah, messed up.

Oh marijuana.
A gift of God to my brothers and me.
Oh marijuana
Now the government wants to test me when I pee.

Well some say a conspiracy
Of the petro-chemical and pulp-paper industries combined
Ha to kill the compitition.
Government hysteria, monopoly and conflict of interest,
With total impunity.

Yeah, so, if you don't buy the conspiracy,
Just look at the reality
That your tax dollars go
To spray poison on the fields of a farmer in South America.
And as an added bonus,
Your neighbor might be the proud recipions of that poison weed.

Oh marijuana
Now the government wants to test me when I pee.
Oh marijuana
A gift of god to my brothers and me.
Oh marijuana
You can't legislate your own morality.
Oh marijuana
The government wants to test me when I pee

Reefer madness, chronic sadness,
What is the half-life of bad propaganda?
Policies fail, denied bail,
You made him a demon now pay for his trip to prison.
Hired to promote the status quo,
But what is the shelf life of bad legislation.
The hypocrite smirks, it's a moral disgrace
As he reads from a law that was written
About the same time that he had
His last original thought.

Well the men said he was dying,
And the nausea and the pain left him wasting away
And unable to keep a meal down.
So he tried everything a prescription could obtain
But to no avail.
The side effects were worse than the pain.
So now he breaks the law
To use the one thing that seems to help him out.
And the people say, Oh he's just getting' high.
But not to change the subject but,
Didn't you ever wonder why getting' high's a crime,
Yeah a crime.

Oh marijuana, a gift to god to my brothers and me.
Oh marijuana, now the government wants to test me when I pee.
Oh marijuana, the government wants to test me when I pee.
Oh marijuana, the government wants to test me when I pee.
Oh marijuana, the government wants to test me when I pee.

Embarrassed with failure, I try to reverse
The course that my tread had already traversed
So doing the trauma engulfing my dream
Invaded through what was an unguarded seam
The torrent of helplessness swept me away
To the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay

While on frozen warthogs
With its poison in our minds

Are encased in orange rinds

And at last till he realized he'd circled back around
Round a back circle, round a back realized

Ice is all he was made of
The bitter blue, it swallowed him through

It takes me out a walkin' when I'd rather stay at home
Takes me out to parties when I'd rather be alone
My mind's got a mind of its own

I've been doing things I thought I'd never do
I've been getting into trouble without ever meaning to
I'd as soon settle down but I'm right back up again
I feel just like a leaf out in the wind.

[Chorus:]

I seem to forget half the things I start
I try to build a house and then I tear the place apart
I freeze myself on fire and then I burn myself on ice
I can't count to one without thinking twice

[Chorus:]

I tell myself to do the things I should
And then I get to thinkin' that them things ain't any good.
I tell myself the truth but know I'm lying like a snake

Out on the western plain

She was living in a lonely cabin
With a son by another man
Five years she had waited for him

As long as a woman can
As long as a woman can

I don't know what changed my mind
Til then I was the ramblin' kind
The kind of love I can't explain

That I had for Nellie Kane
She took me on to work that day
To help her till the land
In the afternoon we planted seeds

In the evening we held hands
In the evening we held hands

Her blue eyes told me everything
A man could want to know
And it was then I realized
I would never goi would never go

And her son has grown up tall
I became a father to him
And she became my all

Dread even more.

Look back on those days when my life was a haze, gelatin lay on a runcated sleigh.
Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank, from a freemasons cranked to the overflow tank.
Bane of the weasel for biting is fun, jump on the turnstile and watch me go round.
Swim with the cactus and float with the stone, I try to convey what you strive to condone.

Shiny smooth streams and unclimbable cliffs
I see you there ever so slowly being drawn to the sea

Your hand is extended but then you rescind
And you like my thoughts are borne off by the wind."

In the hollow where I was born
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
And the fox hunter blows his horn

I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottsville
And worked in a sawmill or two

Chorus
What have they done to the old home place?
Why did they tear it down?
And why did I leave the plow in the field
And look for a job in the town?

Well the girl ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away

Now the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I've lost my love and I've lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead"

Pebbles and marbles, like things on my mind
Seem to get lost and harder to find
When I am alone, I am inclined
If I find a pebble in the sand
To think that it fell from my hand

She gave me ideas, planted the seed
But she never stopped to reflect
The course that she's on, wherever it leads
I never would redirect

Pebbles and marbles, like words from a friend
Make us hold tight, but are lost in the end
When we're alone, we all seem to tend
If we find a marble in the dust
To wish someone left it for us

Spent three long months on the open seas
Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more
When my ship hit ground on Prussia's shores

How was I to know that day
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way?
'Cause soon towards me from the East
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beasts

Well it seems he didn't like my face
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip(ple)

Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack
And told me not to worry 'cause they'd soon be back
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed

Singing ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye""

When Wilson knew that I was loose
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree
So angrily I paddled to the open sea

But the sea was eager to beat me back
And the waves grew huge and deadly black
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead

When the morning came and the storm had passed
And the dismal fog began at last
To open up before my eyes
And there I saw to my surprise

Chains and specks of islands curved
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved
And I parked my kayak on a stone
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne

I said ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye
Wilson, kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye"""

And glared back at me one last look of dismay

And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge

Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said, “Danny boy, this is a showdown”
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

The doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, “Rocky, you've met your match
And Rocky said, “Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, doc, as soon as I am able”

To all the glances and the glares

And I think of you unheeding
All the times I raise my cup
It's now I know that you knew that
I'd soon end up end up

I wheeled around because I
Didn't hear what you had said
And saw you dancing with Elihu
Up on Leemor's bed
And I was foggy, rather groggy
You helped me to my car
The binding belt enclosing me
A sample in a jar

You tricked me like the others

And now I don't belong

The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong"

The pistol from the hand
Then I would not be able to
Equate my life with sand

Flowing through the hourglass
Pushing through the funnel
Turn once more while racing
All your siblings for the tunnel

Slide and let the silicone
Embrace you as you fall
Then bounce and land you let
Your brothers crush you to the wall

I would choose my own religion
And worship my own spirit
But if he ever preached to me
I wouldn't want to hear it

I'd drop him, a forgotten god,
Languishing in shame
And then if I hit stormy seas
I'd have myself to blame"

Was riding in style
When suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard's breaking
Kity felt laser beams being fired at her head
She said, ""I hate laser beams
And you never done see me askin'
For a ufo
In Tomahawk County""

Well she kicked the mule
And it walked the path
And the aliens fired from behind
Till she stopped the mule
And she kicked the rump
And the big old mule took a big old dump

Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game
Or you'll smell my mule

She felt the fire against her neck
And it saddened her to feel it burn
When suddenly, like the sound of a breeding Holstein
Kitty said, ""Stop, we ain't lookin' for fightin'
In Tomahawk County. ""

A little guy from the ufo
Came on out and said his name was Joe
She said, ""Come on over for some lemonade
Just follow me now with the whole brigade""

Chorus

They walked into her cabin shack
They had never seen a southern home
And they liked it, better than their ufo
They liked it, they really liked it
They said, ""Here's a place of elegance
Here we shower ourselves in lightness""

The wsinds would lift you up into the sky above

A rainbow record of the thoughts and moments you've enjoyed

My mother got drunk on stout
My dad couldn't stand on two feet
As he lectured about morality

So now, I guess the families complete
With me hanging 'round on the street
Or here on the beach

The girl I love
Is a perfect dresser
Wears every fashion
Gets it to the tee

Heavens above
I have to match her
She knows just how
She wants her man to be
Leave it to me

My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet

I see her dancing
Across the ballroom
UV light making star shine
Of her smile

I am the face
She has to know it
I'm dressed up better than anyone
In a mile

So how come the other kids look much better?
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter
How come the girls come on, oh, so cool
Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?

Come sleep on the beach
Keep within my reach
I just want to die with you here
I'm feeling so high with you near

I'm wet and I'm cold
But thank God I ain't old
I should have split home at fifteen

The resounding echoes grow
Till once again I bask in morning stillness, I love so

The target that I shoot for seems to move with every breath
I tighten all my arteries and make one last request
Divine creation hears me, and he squashes me with fear

Colonel Forbin stared at the fourteen bars that stood at the end of the cell. He ran his hand across the cold, damp dungeon wall and thought again about the door. He had traveled through the door out of necessity. Once he knew it existed, he simply couldn't leave it alone. Just like Wilson. Just like Tela. Just like Errand Wolfe. And he sat in the dungeon, and he realized that he was back again through the door. And through the tiny window in the corner of his cell, he heard the distant strains.

Centuries now fall away

When I wonder if you're near
When I don't know how to break free
You're always there to rescue me

I wonder if I'll make it through this darkest night
I need to know your strength in me gonna win this fight
I'm reaching out wont you take my hand show me to the light
I know you're by my side

It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down
Its taken so long but now there's one thing that I've found

When everyting starts crashing down
When all I know falls to the ground
When darkness comes and I can't see
You're always there to rescue me
When all my strength has turned to fear
When I wonder if you're near
When I don't know how to break free
You're always there to rescue me
You're always there to rescue me
You're always there to rescue me
You're always there to rescue me
You're always there to rescue me"
