Ang awitin kung ito
Na handa akung magbago para lamang saiyo

Lahat ay aking gagawin
Wag ka lang mawalay sa akin
At ang puso't isip ko sana'y iyo din angkinin... 

At maramdaman muh sana ang pag-ibig saiyo... 
Di sasayangin ang pag-ibig na inalay mo... 

At handa ko pung baguhin ang lahat lahat sa akin... 
Bhie mahalin mo lang ako yun lang ang tangi kung hiling

Aking pagmamahal sana nama'y maramdaman
At malaman mo lang na ikaw lang ang siyang laman
Ang isang tulad ko na umiibig sa iyo
Sana'y dinggin ang mga panalangin at awitin kong ito... 

Aking pagmamahal, sana nama'y masuklian... 
At ang nais ko lang sana iyong maramdaman
Ang isang tulad ko na umiibig sa iyo
Sana'y dinggin ang mga panalangin at awitin kong to... 

At ngaun alam kuh na tibok ng puso muh sinta, 
At ikaw lang ang babae sakin nagpapasaya
Sana'y malaman ng pag-ibig na inalay ko sayo... 
At ikaw ang dahilan kaya ako ay nagbabago... 

Tanging hiling sa maykapal na tau pa ay magtagal
Pangako kuh sau mahal ihaharap ka sa altar... 
At salamat nga pala sa mga kaibigan ko na nagpapasaya sa akin pag pinapaluha mu... 

Aking pagmamahal sana nama'y maramdaman

Aking pagmamahal,, sana nama'y masuklian

Kay sarap naman isipin na pang habang buhay na
Ang samahan nating dalawa
Na palagi kang masaya
At ikaw lang at ako ang tutupad sa pangarap mo
Dingin muh sana ang pag-ibig na inalay ko sayo

Lahat ay aking gagawin
Mahalin lang ang katulad ko
At kung maskatan ka, sana na ako'y handang magbago... 
At lahat lahat ng to'y nagawa koh para sa iyo at ikaw ang dahilan kaya ako'y nagsusumamo... 

Aking pagmamahal sana nama'y maramdaman

At ang nais ko lang sana iyong maramdaman
Ang isang tulad ko na umiibig sa iyo
Sana'y dinggin ang mga panalangin at awitin kong ito... oohhh..."
Repablikan,All Star,/r/repablikan/all+star_20769763.html,"Verse I:

Ako nang unang bibira para mabomba ang bara
Kaya kong mag ihaw ng taba gamit ang lampara
Pinto ko'y di ko sasara mananatili tong bukas
Para sa mga ungas na susubok saking lakas
Tanging sandigan ay taas matindi pa ko sa batas
At nung ako ay lumabas mga pulgas nagsikalas
Ang isang makatang taga manda ang pangalan ay pangaso
Di ko binanggit ang pangalan mo wala kang kaso
Tinrangkaso ang mga tangang makatang puro yabang
Sarap isargo ng pangang pangharang ng malamang
Ako si lirico payat na malaki noo
Pakinggan mo awit nato para sayo to ginoo

Verse I I:

Ang paglapag ko sa isang laro kung san ka bagay
Kung papalag ka pa bano tignan kung san ka bagay
Pag ako ang bumuga mas malupit pa sa mayon
Pabangisan palupitan sakin magkasama yon
Wag ka na magtangka pa na umepal dahil baka mangalaska
Wala akong pakialam kahit na magaling ka pa mang alaska
At hindi usapan kung tayo ay di magkasingtanda
Ito ay paalala sa mga di nagsipagtanda
Binalasa ko mga kalaban ko't pinagtabuyan
Binalasa ko bangis ng letra ko't pinagsabuyan
Akin ng pasasabugin ang galit sa sindikato
Oh eto ang bomba pare pakisindi nga to

Verse I I I:

Tawagin na ngayon lahat lahat ng pwede mong tawagin
Pag ako na ang bumanat di mo na pwedeng awatin
At sukatin ang libingan lampas anim na dipa
Kung pinalad ka noon ngayon samin na iba
Kaya mikropono ay akin at aking wawasakin na
Kalaban napa sakin na diploma at stamina
Basahin mo ang pahina ilan na ang nagpahinga
Korona na sa amin na ilan na ba ang biktima
Ang dami na mula andromida ating pagitan
Sumulat ka man ng maganda o kahit pangitan
Hindi ka mananalo sa pakikipagdigma
Saking talentong di pantao batang laging sa gitna
Marami saking nabigla ng hinawakan ang mikropono
Natalo mo ako sa duwelo sino ang niloko mo
Istupido si kupido man di ka papanain
Sa laban natin kailanma'y di ka papalarin

Verse iv:

Kapag nag umpisang bumanat entablado'y mawawasak
Pulidong mga barang na sa utak mo'y tatarak
Sulidong mga letra na inyong matatamasa
Sa mga magpipilit ako'y makikipag sagupa
Ako ay isang paham na nakikipag tagisan
Wala kong magawa kaya ika'y pagbabalingan
Ng aking oras parang posas at di ka makakatakas
Tampalasang na katulad mo ako ay paghihimas
Sapagkat mga banat mo ay kulang sa pagsusuri
Siguro kahit na langgam ay di ka mapupuri
Wag mo kaming daanin sa iyong pagmamalabis
Slim at siobal d ngayon sayo ang maglilitis

Verse V:

Simulan mo na maghanap ng pwedeng saking itumbas
Maghakot pa ng kasama punuin ang pitong bus
O higit sampu basta ung pedeng maipangsanggalang
Simple lang ang paraan para maibagsak kalang
Kasi ako ung tipo na di kayang ilampaso
Ng mga dapat pang mag aral mag bilang ng ilang pasko
Ngayon ay lalabas ko ang pasensya sa dibdib
At sayo ihahampas ko ang prisensya ng bibig
At sa pagtitig ng mata nakataas parin ang kilay
Tumindig man ng madapa bakas parin ang pagkapilay
Hindi na malaman umano ang dapat na ihakbang
Nang di tawanan umano ng mga itinakdang
Ipwesto sa pinakamataas na libel
Kaya alisto sa pinakamalakas na baril
Na sing laki ng kanyon kailangan ng higanting bala
Katumbas nyan ay ang lupet ni numerious ginantimpala

Verse vi:

Makinig sa letrang kayang magkamada ng bigas
Kami ang repablikan ang armada ng tigas
Ang mga nangyari sa mga kalaban pagkapalo ko
Ng mga salita nakatikim ng pagkatalo
Kung nakalingat ako nagsikalat ang mga bobo
Pagbwelta ko parang nagsikalasang mga lobo
Na walang pag asa pagkat pagtapon ng mga buhay
Dapat sa demonyong yan ipakapon ang mga sungay
Di na susukat ang iyong galing sa bilang ng patalo
Ngayon makinig ka sa mga dilang makabago
Flict g ang anim na tugma ay akin ng hinanay
Pag narinig mo to para ka lamang inanay

Verse vii:

Nagtakbuhan ang mga puta ng lusubin ko sa kuta
Parang mga tupang nagsikalat ng ako na ang nanguna
Sa digmaan at bakbakan ang lakas tinatapakan
At kung sino mang umentra ay aking tinatapalan
Ng mga letra kong nagtatalsikan parang laway
Ako si cocky na dumudurog ng kaaway
Walang patawad at sindikatong isinilang
Dala ko ang kargadang di mahaba maiksi lang
Pero kayang tapusin kahit na gano kadami
Bilang ng tinaob ko pare ay napakarami
Uubusin ko lahat kayo mga mapagbalat kayo
Kahit ilan pa man kayo durog lahat sa pagbayo

Verse viii:

Isang __ ng __ puro mga alanganin
Bawat bibitawan ko siguradong di mo kakayanin
Bakit? Wag mo ng subukang magtanong
Dahil lahat ng pilit humarang isa isang pinagulong
Parang basahan na aking pinamunas sa
Mga nangangarap na basurerong maaangas sa
Mga maeepal na mahihilig magpanggap
Di mo matanggap panis kayong lahat
Makinig kayo sa bawat dikta ko
Lahat ng yabang mo lalamunin mo
Ngaun itanim mo sa walang lamang kukote niyo
Masta plan pangalan ko
Galing pa ko ng cavite
Repablikan southside

Verse ix:

Para muling nasa eksena at makikipagtagisan
Layunin ay durugin ang mga nagsisipagtigasan
Sa larangan ng tula sige subukang kalabanin
Pag ako katunggali mo ang lagay mo alanganin
Kaya wag mo ng balaking sumabay ng palupitan
Di ka mananalo samin kaya wag ng ipagpilitan
Ang katulad mong tanga sa ami'y hindi nababagay
Magpakabihasa na muna bago ka samin humanay
Malumanay man ang banat ko pero pulido
Letra ko na bibitawan sin tigas pa ng kungkreto
Sa kukote mo ipasok kailan may di mo kaya
Kahit anung gawin mo style ko di mo magagaya

Verse X:

Hindi kana makakabangon pag ako ang kinalaban
Lahat ng aking dadaanan siguradong kakabagan
Dadapa ang lahat sakin ay haharang
Pupuksain kita na parang isang mambabarang
Na parang harang na aking gigibain
Ang buhay mo ay siguradong aking kikikilen
Hindi mo kakayanin kahit ilan pa ang
Iyong tawagin parang bumangga ka lang
Sa pinakamatibay at walang makakasabay
Ako ang sindikato na walang makakapantay
Sa kahusayan lahat ng ***** basura
Ang nararapat sa inyo ay ***** na mura

Verse xi:

Kami'y sinilang at sa microphone ngayon sumalang
Talino na dala lumalagpas at di masalang
Sinuyod na namin ang iba't ibang lugar
Sa mga mapang api kami'y depensang militar
At tinahak ng utak ang masukal na lagusan
Ang pinamalas namin ay hindi matatawaran
Marami ngang humarang ngunit lahat paralisado
Kapag pamilya repablikan ang nasa entablado
Ganyan kabagsik parang legitate ng gatilyo
At mas maikli pa to kesa sa hampas ng martilyo
Mga walang respeto magmumumog ng dugo
Papel na pinunas sa tumbong ang syang panyo"
Repablikan,Babala,/r/repablikan/babala_21050731.html,"Sige na halika pakinggan ang mga salitang binibitawan ng isang makatang di

Uuwi sa kamatayan na hindi namamalayan kung paano ko to hinatid na mga

Mong hamakan aking mga salita na para bang ako mitsa napakaraming patalim
Tiyakin mo lamang na kaya mo kung sabayan pag nagsimula ng dumilim ang
Aking paningin simulan mo nang bilangin aking mga salita at kung ilang mga
Kalaban ko pinataob para di ka na magulat pag ikaw ay napabilang sa king
Mga biktima walang samaan ng loob ilang taon na ba ang dumaan mula ng
Binitawan ko ang mga susunod na kataga na para bang sakit na di mo malaman
Kung bakit ba hanggang ngayon sa isipan mo tumataga

Repablikan, hindi mo malaman kung malalampasan ang mga kataga, mga salitang
Binibitawan ko sa harapan mo na parang isang babala kaya mo na ba tagalan
Sabayan ang mga buga ng aking mga salita wala ka ng magagawa sa 'kin ba 'to

Repablikan,Baby Girl,/r/repablikan/baby+girl_20917820.html,"Baby girl why don't you come back to me
Why don't you love me anymore
Baby girl you know I still care for you
You know I will love you forevermore

Pagnakikita ko ang larawan
Na iyong iniwan ako'y nasasaktan
Naalala nung ikaw pay kapiling
Kaya ang magbalik ka yan ang laging hiling

Pag naiisip kong nakaraan
Nung tayo pay nagmamahalan
Ngunit bakit ko pa ito sayo nagawa
Sinaktan ka't iniwan mo ako ngayon
Hanap ka sinta

Baby girl why don't you come back to me
Why don't you love me anymore
Baby girl you know I still care for you
You know I will love you forevermore

Masaki tang ginawa mong paglisan
Ng di nagpapaalam kaya ngayon luhaan
Nagsisisi sa mga maling nagawa
Patawarin ako oh sinta magbalik ka na

Pag naiisip kong nakaraan
Nung tayo pay nagmamahalan
Ngunit bakit ko pa ito sayo nagawa
Sinaktan ka't iniwan mo ako ngayon
Hanap ka sinta

Baby girl why don't you come back to me
Why don't you love me anymore
Baby girl you know I still care for you
You know I will love you forevermore

Ang muli mong pagbalik
Yan ang aking pangarap
Ang makatabi't makayakap ka ay hinahanap
Alam kong kulang ang respeto na aking binigay
Kaya di mo naiwasan na sa iba'y bumigay
Pero kung babalik ka sakin akin titiyakin
Na hinding hindi na kita muling paluluhain
Ako ay patawarin kung nasaktan kita noon
Pangako ko sayo di ko na gagawin yan ngayon
At kung sakali na ako ay muli mong tanggapin
Kaya mo kayang gawin dating pagmamahal sakin
Hangad ko lang naman sa iyo ay makabawi
Sa aking kakulangan kung mapapasakin kang muli
Di na mapakali puso'y ang lakas ng pintig
Ang salitang mahal mo ko
Yan ang gustong marinig
Sana'y mapatawad yan ang sigaw ng puso
At ang bulong naman ay
Mahalin mo ulit ako

Baby girl why don't you come back to me
Why don't you love me anymore

You know I will love you forevermore (3X)"
Repablikan,Bintana,/r/repablikan/bintana_20851477.html,"Sa pagpikit ko ng mga mata handa ng managinip
Kasabay sa paglipad ng aking diwa ang pag-ihip
Ng hangin patungo sa lugar na kung saan maari
Kang hawakan at yakapin, 'kaw ang reyna, ako ang hari
Ng kahariaan na sa pagdilat ko'y nawawala
Pilitin mang pigilin 'to wala akong nagagawa
Upang ang 'sang katulad mo na sa bintana sinisilip
Makasama, makausap ng hindi na pinipilit
Dahil sa alam ko na mundo natin magkaiba 
Sinusundo kana ng boyfriend mong ang kotse ay lima
At nagiba ang mundo ko mula nang di sinasadya
Magkabanggaan at nahulog kwintas mong pinasadya
Pa at kabibigay pa lamang ng boyfriend mong mayaman
Ngunit sa 'yong mata ay may lungkot na di malaman
Na pilit tinatago ng iyong mga ngiti
Sana hindi lang sa bintana makikita kang muli

CHORUS:
Hirap at sakit ay di alintana
Masilayan ka lang dun sa bintana
Lahat ay gagawin upang iyong malaman
Ang pagibig ko'y tunay, walang alinlangan

Tila yata kapalaran na ang sa 'kin tumutulong
Nang hindi sinasadyang muli tayong magkasalubong
At labis kong kinagulat ng ako ay kausapin
Tila ang lahat ng tao'y nakatingin sa akin
Tayo'y naging magkaibigan, sumbungan at sandalan
Ngunit lahat pala ng mga bagay may hangganan
Nang ikaw ay magpaalam na d'on na maninirahan
Kung saan ang pagbalik mo ay malabo nang asahan
Gusto man kitang pigilan, wala 'kong nagawa
Tila ang lahat ng sa 'kin ay biglaang nawala
At mula n'on sayo ay di na nagkaroon ng balita
Sana'y muli kang makita kahit man lang sa bintana

Mula nang nakilala ka
Hindi kana naalis sa aking isipan
Sana'y malaman mo ang tunay
Na nadarama ng puso ko para sa 'yo... 

{Repeat chorus}

Alam mo bang ikaw lang ang aking mahal
Lahat ay gagawin upang iyong malaman
Nang ikaw ay dumating sa buhay kong ito
Muling umiikot ang aking mundo
Sa puso kong ito ikaw ang kailangan
Ang pagibig mo dahil minamahal kita...

Napahanga ako sa taglay mong bait
Ikaw ang guest ko sa twing birthday
Pati sa room ko ikaw ang display
Di kana nawala sa alaala
Ikaw lang talaga at walang gagaya
Ikaw ang gusto ng mga friends ko
At di ko alam pati parents ko
Ano ba ang meron ka na wala sa iba
At napapangiti 'pag nakita kana
Sa mga poster at maging sa T. V.
Inaabangan ang iyong movie
Bata pa ako noon nung marandaman ko 'to
Ayoko ng iba ikaw ang gusto ko
At sa aaminin ko maniwala ka
Mas gusto kita ke'sa kay darna

Oh why Oh why bakit ganito
Gusto ko ikaw lang nasa tabi ko
Mga poster mo at mga magazine
Sa buhay ko hindi kita kayang alisin
So pati sa cellphone at mga gamit
Ikaw ang nakalagay sa aking bed sheet
Ako ay nalungkot nang ika'y nawala
Ano ba ang mali na aking nagawa
Paki-usap naman kahit na sandali
Para lang mapawi ang mga pighati
At muling ngumiti at 'di na umiyak
Magpakita ka lang gusto kong matiyak
Na buhay ka parin at ika'y malakas
Gumawa ka ulit ng mga palabas
At kapag bumalik ngingiti ng kusa
At hinding-hindi ako magmamahal ng pusa
Repeat choruz]

Lumipas ang mga taon nananatili kang pangarap
Nais kong libutin ang mundo para ka lang mahanap
Sapagkat hindi sapat makita ka lang sa larawan
Gusto ko ay makasama ka handa ko nang iwanan
Ang lahat ng kayamanan pati gf ko
Sabihin mo magkano ba ang tf mo
At aking ibibigay tanggapin mo lang ako
Ok lang sa akin kahit alipinin mo ako
Sabi ng ama ko nabubuang ako
Sabi ng ina ko 'di ka raw totoo
Isa kang kwentong binigyan ng buhay
Pero sa mundong ito 'di ka raw tunay
Isa kang nilikha para lang sa bata
Kaya pala ikaw ay 'di tumatanda
Pero kahit ganito sana ay tandaan
Gusto kong maging katulad mo batman

Yeah yeah...
You will always be inside my heart

I hope that I have a place in your heart too

Ay puno ng alaala
Na hindi malilimutan
Lalo na ng makilala
Ang babaeng
Nagbigay sakin ng inspirasyon
Na gumawa ng homework
At makinig sa leksyon
Kaya nag-aral ng mabuti
Para sa'king future life
At lalong lalo na
Para sa aking future wife
At kapag break time
Lagi tayong magkasabay
Kinikilig ako
Pag hawak ko ang iyong kamay
Habang tayo ay naglalakad
Pag tayo'y pauwi
Lalo akong tinatamaan
Pag ika'y ngumingiti
Ang lahat ng pighati
Ikaw ang nagtatanggal
Dahil sa iyo
Kaya pasado sa periodical
Buhay ko ay nag-iba
Binigyan mo ng sigla
Tumaas na din ang grades ko
Sa matemateka
Ikaw lang ang dahilan
Para to sayo mahal
Inaalay ko sayo
Ang natanggap kong medal

Araw-araw at gabi gabi akong nagdarasal
Na sana'y ikaw na nga
Ang inilaan sa akin
Makasama ko sa buhay
Upang aking mahalin
Nang ako ay iyong sagutin
Muntikan na kong ma-drop
Pero dahil sa iyo
Naabot ko pa ang ulap
Ngunit ang kapalit
Bakit ka biglang nagbago
Lagi kang tulala
At parang lagi kang kabado
Hindi ka pumapasok
San ka nagpupunta
Bumababa na ang mga grado mo
Ano ba ang problema?
Nang kausapin ka
Bigla kang napaiyak
Mabigat ang iyong dala-dala
Yan ang natiyak
Nang ikaw ay tinanong
Hindi mo ko sinagot
Tumakbo ka paalis
Na para bang ika'y takot na takot
Bakit?

Na mayron daw trahedya

Labis kong ikinagulat
Pagkat ikaw ang biktimang
Kanilang buhat-buhat
Ikaw ay nagtapat
Sa sulat mo sa dingding
Ikaw ay ginagahasa

Ay para bang nawala
Gusto kong sumigaw
Gusto kong magwala
Hindi makapaniwala
Hindi to totoo
Hindi na ba kita makakasama sa kolehiyo
Ba't ngayon mo lang sinabi

Ang kasiyahang dulot ng pagmamahalang kay tamis
Di na matiis ang bawat pag hindi pag naiisip ka
Lumulundag ang aking puso at walang kasing saya
Sayo lang nakalaan ang bawat pagtibok ng puso
Sana di na magbago sumpaan at ating pangako
Pinangako sa sarili na walang ibang iibigin
At sa diyos na may kapal ikaw lang ang tanging dalangin
Sana na makasama ka hanggang sa pagtanda
Ikaw lang ang mahal at sa bato iyong itaga
Pag-asa ka sa bawat pagsikat ng araw sa umaga
At sana pag-gising ko mga pangamba ko'y wala na
Kung ako'y papipiliin gusto ko ay ikaw

Na maka-isang araw ay bigla na lang gumuho
Napana na ang pag-ibig natin na ating tinayo

Dito sa aking puso ikaw lang ang laman

At kahit gaano karami man ang inumin ay patuloy sa pagsinok
At di ko malaman kung panu ko sisimulan na sabihin sayo ang mga
Nais sabihin na mahal kita, kahit na magpalasenggo ka ng tanga
Sa pagnanais ko na mapadama ang pag-ibig na nais sayong ibigay
Gagawin ko ang lahat kahit na ang sarili sa putikan pa malagay
Wag ka lang makita na may lumbay, at makita ang may luha sa mata
Handa 'kong gawin ang lahat kahit na pasabugin man ang dalawa 'kong paa
Sa akin sinta ay wag kang mangamba sapagkat ang pag-ibig ko'y para sayo
Pinapanalangin ang araw't-gabi na pag kinasal ako sana sayo
Na sana wag mang ipangarap na lang pagmamahalang aking inaasam
Sana pakinggan ang awitin at ang dahilan ay para lamang ipaalam
Na kahit ngayon meron ka nang iba sabihin man na sa kanya masaya
Sakali man nasaktan ka nandidito ako mahal ko yayakapin kita

Hindi na nga mag-iisip ng kung anu-ano pa
Basta't minamahal kita yan lang pangako sinta
Di ka na mag-iisa palagi kang aalalayan
At kahit anong mangyari di kita pababayaan
Ikaw lang ang mahal at wala nang iba
Paniwalaan mo sana ang ginawa kong kanta
Na para lamang sayo sana nama'y dinggin mo
Upang malaman mo na ikaw ay minamahal ko
Ngunit pano ko mahahagilap ang pag-ibig na hinahanap
Kung hindi kita makamit at lagi ko na lang pinapangarap
Na makasama kahit kelan kahit man lang saglit
Sa puso at isipan kung hindi ito mawawaglit
Alam mo naman na ikaw lang ang mahal
Palagi ko na dalangin sa may kapal na sana na tayong dalawa ay magtagal
Upang ako'y hindi na umaatungal
Ako'y sumugal palagi nang sa isip na ako'y iyong minamahal
Ngunit hindi ko naisip na sayo'y maging hangal

Sa aking isipan hindi ako nangangamba
Ikaw lang ang mahal at wala na ngang iba
Sa aking isipan hindi ako nangangamba
Ikaw lang ang mahal at wala na ngang iba

Sa aking isipan hindi ako nangangamba
Ikaw lang ang mahal at wala na ngang iba

Repablikan,Kahit Di Na Tayo,/r/repablikan/kahit+di+na+tayo_20786783.html,"Lumalalim na ang gabi, ngunit wala ka sa 'king tabi
Pilit kong nilalabanan ang nakaraan,
Ngunit di manalo dahil wala ang pag-ibig mo,
Giliw ko kung naririnig mo
Ang pagsamo ko sanay pakingan mo

Kahit di na tayo sana'y maalala mo,
Kahit di na tayo sana'y pakingan mo,
Ang tibok ng puso ko ay pangalan mo,

Alam kong hindi tama pero walang magagawa
Baguhin man ang tadhana sa 'ting dalawa
Limutin ka nga ay hindi ko kaya at hindi ko magawa
Giliw ko, mahal ko pakingan mo.
Ang tibok ng puso ko ay pangalan mo

Kahit di na tayo sana'y maalala mo,
Kahit di na tayo sana'y pakingan mo,
Ang awiting kong ito na para lang sayo,

At saking pagtulog, ang panaginip ko'y ikaw.
Pati saking pag gising, ikaw ang sinisigaw.
At kung tayo'y magbalik, ayaw ko ng bumitaw,
Yayakapin ka, at muling isasayaw.
Pagkat ikaw ang gustong makasama buong araw

Kahit di na tayo sana'y maalala mo,
Kahit di na tayo sana'y pakingan mo,
Ang awiting kong ito na para lang sayo

Kahit di na tayo sana'y maalala mo,
Kahit di na tayo sana'y pakingan mo,
Ang awiting kong ito na para lang sayo"
Repablikan,Kulang Na Kulang Ba (Repablikan Version),/r/repablikan/kulang+na+kulang+ba+repablikan+version_20872183.html,"Intro
(Verse 1):
Nung minahal kita alam mo kung gaano to kawagas
Nang magtanong mga dasal ngunit pano to nagwakas
Bigla na lang di nagpakita saan ka ba nagpunta?
May nagsabi sakin sa cebu ay nandoon ka
Bakit hindi ka nagpaalam?
Ano ba ang aking nagawat biglang iniwan
Ang akiy pusong nagdurugo dahil sayo
Hindi ko malaman kung bakit nagkaganito
Inibig kita ng tapat ang lahat naman ay ginawa
Ngunit hindi ko maipaliwanag kung bakit ba bigla ka na lang nawala
Biglang pumatak sa pag iyak ang aking luha
Na hindi na matiyak kung makukuha ko pa bang makapangiti
Sabihin mo kulang pa ba ang mga sandali
Ikay kasama habang kayakap sa magdamag
Ngayon iniwan mo akong nag iisa

Chorus:
Kulang na kulang ba
Hindi pa ba sapat inubos kong lahat panahon ko sayo
Anong gagawin di mo pinapansin hetong damdamin
Aking paglalambing

(Verse 2):
Salubong na naman ang kilay mo ano ba na naman nagawa ko
Lahat naman ng pinangako ko sayo ay nagawa ko
Dahil ayoko na magalit ka at akoy bitawan
Ng mga salita na masakit pagkatapos babasagan
Pakinggan mo naman sasabihin ko wag mo kong sabayan
Kung ganyan ka ng ganyan sakin pano ko sisimulan
Pano mo maiintindihan kung palagi ka nalang mainit
Minura mo na at nakapanakit tapos sasabayan pa ng lait
Oo may kulang ako hindi ba pwede ka magpasensya
Sa ginagawa mo saking hindi ka pa ba nakonsensya
Puro pasa na ang inabot ko siguro mga trenta
Pano ako makakapalag kung may nakatutok na lanseta
Grabe ka... mahal ba talaga ang turing mo sakin
Bat pag nagagalit ka muka ko gusto mong wasakin
Kung alam ko lang ang buhay ko sayoy parang sinumpa
Edi sana nag aral na ako ng boxing noon pa

(Repeat chorus)

(Last verse):

Bakit ba hanggang ngayon ay nasa isip pa kita
Kahit na ikaw mahal ay di ko na nakikita
Nang magising ako na wala ka na sa 'king tabi
Halos di na ko makatulog tuwing sasapit ang gabi
Tila wala na kong silbi nang simula kang mawala
Wala na rin akong pangarap at palaging tulala
At ngumiti man ako'y laging may kahalong pighati
Ano ba aking kasalanan bakit ba 'ko nasawi
Sa pag-ibig na inakala ko magiging maligaya
Pagsasama natin ngunit mahal bakit nawala ka
Sa piling ko at ang puso ko ay iyong sinugatan
Iniwan mo man ako ay di ka makalimutan
Di ko na rin magawa na magmahal pa ng iba
Dahil sa puso ko sinta ikaw lamang nagiisa
Ikaw ang una at huli yan ang aking pinangako
At kahit kailanman pag-ibig ko'y di maglalaho

Coda:

Ginagawa ko naman ang lahat
Upang malaman mong ako'y tapat
Tunay bang karapat-dapat sa isa't isa
Ngunit bakit ba ngayon ika'y ibang-iba... 
Umaasa
Kahit ang puso'y nagdurusa
Tila ba ang mundo ko'y puro parusa
Ngayon nag-iisa walang kasama
At ang mga pangako mo ngayon ay nasaan na

Di na mabilang ang mga luha na ipinatak sa lupa
At ang pag-ibig na inaasam ay hindi ko na makuha
Ngunit bakit ganito na lang ang pag-ibig ko sayo
Ginagawa ko naman ang lahat ngunit ako'y niloko mo
Nasan na ba ang mga salita na noon ay tayo pa
Tunay bang tinalikuran mo na ang pag-ibig sa iyo sinta
Walang iba... 
Alam mo namang ika'y mahal
Akala ko pa naman na tayong dalawa ay magtatagal

(Repeat chorus 2x)"
Repablikan,Kung Alam Mo Lang,/r/repablikan/kung+alam+mo+lang_20604545.html,"Di ko malaman kung pano ko ba sasabihin sayo na mahal na kita
Na tiyak ko na nga ang nadarama ko katulad ng ibigin ng aking ama
Ang aking ina at dahil doon sila ay nagkaroon ng anak na walo
Pang ikapito isinilang ako ang dalangin ko sana ay para sayo
Ang kapanganakan ko at kapalaran ko sana maging tayo ngang dalawa
Isa sa mga bagay kung bakit isinilang ako para pakasalan ka
Paglingkuran ka alayan ang pagmamahal na tanging sayo lang nilaan
Hayaan mo na awitan ka habang suot ko ang bagong damit kong nilabhan
At may dala pa kong mga bulaklak pero sana naman walang humalakhak
Pakinggan mo lang sanang awitin kong ito di mo na kailangan na pumalakpak
Makita ka lamang na nakangiti habang nakatingin sa king mga mata
Napapalundag ang puso kong ito papalakpak pati aking mga paa
Mahal na kita, at yan ang mga salitang nais ko sanang ipaabot
Handang ibaba ang mga bituin wag mo lamang sana sakin ipagdamot
Ang pagibig mo na walang katumbas kahit na anumang kayaman sa lupa
Makasama ka lang kahit anung pagsubok ay handa ko nang makasagupa

Chorus
Kung alam mo lang ang tunay kong nadarama sayo
Nais kong malaman mong ikaw lang ang iniibig ko
Sana pag nalaman mo, mahalin mo rin ako
Kung alam mo lang ang pag ibig kong ito...
Kung alam mo lang

At tuloy ko na ngang itinatago ang laman ng aking puso
Pinipilit ko na wag sabihin kahit pa na maging tuso
Ang kamay sa katuturo kung saan ang direksyon
Para lang masabe ko sayo ang aking reaksyon
Binubulong na lang sa hangin ang itulak ng bibig
Kahit na anung mangyari may kaba sa king dibdib
Sapagkat kapag kasama ka walang hanggan aking ligaya
At kasabay ng paglunok kapag ikay aking kasama
Dahil hindi ko na nga masabe ang aking nadarama
Ang pagibig ko para sayo hindi mapadama
Natatakot na sabihin na gusto kang mahalin
Baka kase kapag nalaman mo ako ay sampalin
At sabihin mo sa akin na hindi kita mahal
Patawarin mo na lang kung ako may naging hangal
Labis kang minamahal ay yan ay kung alam mo lang
Sanay ipagpatawad mo dahil akoy mahirap lang

Repeat chorus

Kung kaya ko lang abutin ang mga bituin matagal ko nang binigay to
Sa isang babae na siyang dahilan kung bat nagawa kong awiting ito
Para lamang sayo kung bawat oras at panahon gusto ko lamang ikay katabe
Abutin man ng magdamag umaga tanghali hapon man o mapagabe
Walang tulugan noon pa mahal na kita di mo pa ba natutunugan
Sa puso ko ikaw ang laman at niregaluhan ko ng bagay na di hulugan
Mula paanan sayo ko nakita gusto kong ugaling wala sa iba
Maganda na ang katawan pati kalooban kung alam mo mahal na kita
Handa na ko sumunod sa mga gusto mo alpinin mo man o ano
Handa ko na rin ibigay ang lahat maliban sa ngipin at katawan ko
At para naman makita mo kung gano kita kamahal at wala ng iba
Handa kitang pakasalan sa mga simbahan kahit pari pa natin lima
Basta marinig ko lang na ako lang wala ng iba ang yong mamahalin
Lahat ng sakin iyong iyo ay sakin ang ina ko ina mo na rin
Kung alam mo lang kung ano ang nadarama ko pag ikaw ay aking katabe
Lubos na ang aking saya pag kasama kita pag wala ka di mapakali

Mahal ko ng inamin na mahal kita alam mo yan
Pero mas mahal mo siya kesa saking alam ko yan
Hindi sapat na dahilan na sawa ka na sa kanya
Para pinantakip mo ako sa butas na gawa nya
Hindi ako perpekto, oo may mali rin ako
Pero lahat ng mga yon nagawa ko dahil sayo
Pagkat ikaw lang ang babae na minahal ko ng ganito
Pati kaligtasan ng mahal mo pinag darasal ko

Hindi ko balak manakit, gusto ko lang linawin
Para maiktang mong lahat ginagawa mo sakin
At kung ano ka sakin, alam yan ng lahat ng tao

Sa mga nagawa mo sakin kaylan man hindi ako nagalait
Ako ang dapat sisihin dahil ako ang nagpagamit

Sisikapin kong lahat kahit mag suot ng mascot
Makit ka lang nakangiti, ako ay kuntento na
Gagawin ko ang lahat mahal, kaso huli na

Napakahirap para sakn na ika'y isuko
Kasabay palagi ang ulan sa tuwing luhay tutulo
Laging kinakausap ang hangin habang umiiyak ang damdamin
Pero ang muling ligawan ka malaman dina balakin
Kahit, lagging itnitibok ng puso ay ikaw
Titiisin na lang ang sakit habang ika'y natatanaw
Ayoko mang umayaw, pero walang magagawa
Kundi kalimutan ka nalang kahit di ko ikatuwa
Ang mangulila man ang tulad ko wala kang kasalanan
Tama na minsan umukit sa puso ko ang pangalan
Na hindi ko inasahang mag dudulot ng kirot
Sakit na mga naranasan may kahalo pang lungkot
Sa aking utak na walang ibang inisip kundi
Ang mahalin ako ng tulad mo kahit kaunti
Hindi man ako nagwagi, nauwi man sa wala
Sa awa ng diyos durog kong puso ay tumitibok pa

Ngumiti na lang kahit nasaktan, apihin man ako tanggap ko yan.

Na mahal kita, yan lang naman ang tanging ninanais ko,
Alam ko naman na 'di ako bagay sa iyong kagandahan,

Yo! Hindi naman ako sikat para mapansin mo ako,
Hindi naman ako perpekto kasi tao lang ako,
Hindi kagaya mo, langit ang naaabot
Samantalang ako, lupa sa akin ang nakabalot
Sa tuwing madadatnan na ako'y na papanganga,
Hindi mabigkas bigkas salitang na iipit sa dila,
Tila ba'y nagpapahiwatig, ""wag ka nang umasa pa""
Dahil isang katulad niya, ay bihirang makasama
Oh diyos ko, patawarin kung ang sarili pinipilit,
Nag babakasali na siya rin sa akin ay maakit,
Alam naman natin, ""walang imposible sa mundong ibabaw""
Baka maly natin, maging kami rin balang araw (balang araw)

And the world was a carpet laid before me
The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange
And it seemed about a hundred years ago

Mary and I, we would sit upon a gate
Just gazin' at some dragon in the sky
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Well, it seemed about a hundred years ago

Now all my friends are wearing worried smiles
Living out a dream of what they was
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?

Wend out walkin' through the wood the other day
Can't you see the furrows in my forehead?
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Now it seems about a hundred years ago

Now if you see me drinkin' bad red wine
Don't worry 'bout this man that you love
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?

You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, yeah, I warn you
You're gonna kiss and say good-bye, yeah, I warn you

Owes a million dollars tax

When you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind

I tried so hard to rearrange your mind

You were disarranging mine

'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch""

I was drinking in love, gulping it down
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud
But after awhile I stopped to rebel
I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

We'd been living together for over a year
The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear
But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray
The little things big, that's what they say

I acted impatient, I acted unkind
I took her for granted, I played with her mind
She didn't deserve it but it was too late
I walked out the door and left her to her fate

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

(WhoooWhooo Whooo....)

Now I'm down in a slump and I'm eating alone
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone
I never go out, I'm becoming a grouch
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch

But if love comes again, I'll be really surprised
I'll grab it real fast, keep it right in my sights

Well I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life"

And poor Mark Antony's
Senses were drowned
And his future was doomed

He was blinded by love

The Philistines paid
For Samson's blind rage
The secrets that two lovers share
Should never have been betrayed

He was blinded by love
He was blinded by love

Now it's no use crying or weeping
You better lock up your soul for safe keeping
Promise me

The poor Prince of Wales
He gave up his crown
All for the trivial pursuit of
A parvenu second-hand lady
So lovers beware

Careful now, don't lose your mind
Don't mortgage your soul to a stranger

The last star for my lady is pinning

In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their lovers call

Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Throug the woods of steel and glass

You're gonna be the first to go!
You just drive on just like there ain't nothin' happenin'""

And he said: ""when you get to that red light
I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right""

Ah ah, not that alley, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times

It's today that's the day of the plunge
Oh the gal I'm to marry
Is a bow-legged sow
I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge

As she plied me with bourbon so sour
Pull your socks up, put your suit on
Comb your long hair down,
For you will be wed in the hour

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
I'm sleepin, it's a beatin'
Can't ya please take it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

I was tremblin', as I put on my jacket
It had creases as sharp as a knife
I put the ring in my pocket
But there was a note
And my heart it jumped into my mouth

It read, ""Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you.
But I have no courage to speak to your face.
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
There be no wedding today.""

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
You can put back my heart in it's hole
Oh mama, I'm cryin'
Tears of relief
And my pulse is now under control"

The Rolling Stones,Far Away Eyes,/r/rolling+stones/far+away+eyes_20118211.html,"I was drivin' home early Sunday morning
Through Bakersfield,
Listening to gospel music on the coloured radio station,
And the preacher said: ""You know you always have the lord by your side""
And I was so pleased to be informed of this
That I ran twenty red lights in his honour,
Thank you Jesus, thank you lord

I had an arrangement to met a girl, and I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off,
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
Much to my surprise there she was sittin' in a corner
Little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes
Well I tell you

So if you're down on you're luck, and you can't harmonize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
Well

Well the preacher kept right on saying
That all I had to do was send ten dollars
To the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus,
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, and next week I got a prayer for the girl
Well you know what kind of eyes she got,
Well I tell you

So if you're down on you're luck, I know you all sympathize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
So if you're down on you're luck, I know you all sympathize
Get a girl with far away eyes"

And said you're in love

I said I couldn't that be so
I'm not passion with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

Shot up a horde of zombies

And aaaaall is darkness in my room

Baby won't you dance with meeeeee

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors
Hear a funky noise
That's the tightening of the screeeeews

Sitting in the dirt
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom

Would you think the boy is strange? ain't he strange?

A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart

Suicide right on stage

And feeds them to his geese

In between the sheets?

Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three
Come on now, honey
Don't you wanna live with me?

And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century
Well they queue up for the bathroom
Round about 7: 35
Doncha think we need a womans touch to make it come alive?

Youd look good pram pushing
Down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you wanna live with me?

Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door
The maid, she's french, she's got no sense
Shes wild for crazy horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footmans eyes get crossed

And singing angels are?

The Wise Men left their country
To journey morn by morn,
With gold and frankincense and myrrh,

God sent a star to guide them,
And sent a dream to warn.

Their star is like God's book.

With heav'n-ward heart and look:
But shall I give no gifts to God?
What precious gifts they took.

Lord, I will give my love to Thee,
Than gold much costlier.
Sweeter to Thee than frankincense,
More prized than the choicest myrrh,
Lord, make me dearer day by day,
Day by day holier; (Day by day holier.)

Nearer and dearer day by day,
Till I my voice unite
And sing ""Glory, glory""
With angels clad in white;
All ""Glory, glory"" given to Thee,
All ""Glory, glory"" given to Thee.

And I knew in my heart
He was the answer to my prayers.

Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you and me in our darkest hour
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with a light of love.

When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand

And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.
Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you and me in our darkest hour
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with a light of love.

They wear so many faces
Show up in the strangest places
To guide us with their mercy
In our time of need.

Doth in a manger lie. ""

The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land.
A home within the wilderness, 
A rest upon the way, 
From the burning of the noontide heat,

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me.
And from my stricken
Heart with tears, 
Two wonders I confess, 
The wonders of redeeming love
And my unworthiness.

I take, O cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place.
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face.
Content to let the world go by, 
To know no gain nor loss.
My sinful self my only shame, 
My glory all the cross."

Whose arm those crimson trophies won which now His brow adorn;
Fruit of the mystic rose, as of that rose the stem;
The root whence mercy ever flows, the Babe of Bethlehem.

Crown Him the Son of God, before the worlds began,
And ye who tread where He hath trod, crown Him the Son of Man;
Who every grief hath known that wrings the human breast,
And takes and bears them for His own, that all in Him may rest.

Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed over the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save.
His glories now we sing, Who died, and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise.
His reign shall know no end, and round His piercиd feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side,
Those wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of Heaven, enthroned in worlds above,
Crown Him the King to Whom is given the wondrous name of Love.
Crown Him with many crowns, as thrones before Him fall;
Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, for He is King of all.

Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign,
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain,
Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing
Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.

Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou has died for me;

As I look back on what I thought was living
I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay
And to think I ignored what really mattered
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great
But when I finally reached the point of giving in
I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive.

Chorus:

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For it's not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

Verse 2:

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose
That holds be to the cross yet sets me free
I will glory in the power of the cross
The things I thought were gain I count as loss
And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

[Chorus:]

Bridge:

And I will offer all I have
So that His cross is not in vain
For I found to live is Christ
And to die is truly gain

Be to the lost Salvation;
Death, his relentless tyrant, stay,

Freely I give Myself to thee,
Thy life with Mine defending;
For I am thine and thou art Mine,
And where I am there thou shalt shine,
The foe shall never reach us.”

“To heaven again I rise from hence,
High to my Father soaring,
The Master there to be, and thence
My Spirit on thee pouring;
In every grief to comfort thee,
And teach thee more and more of Me,
Into all truth still guiding.”

“What I have done and taught on earth,
Do Thou, and teach, none dreading;
That so God's kingdom may go forth,
And His high praise be spreading;
And guard thee from the words of men,
Lest the great joy be lost again:
This my last charge I leave thee.”"

Throw Thy radiance o'er them, guide them on their way.
Those who never knew Thee, those who've wandered far, 
Guide them by the brightness of Thy guiding star.

Light of life that shineth ere the worlds began, 
Draw Thou near, and lighten every heart of man.

Onward through the darkness of the lonely night, 
Shining still before them with Thy kindly light.
Guide them, Jew and Gentile, homeward from afar, 
Young and old together, by Thy guiding Star.

Refrain:
Light of life that shineth ere the worlds began, 
Draw Thou near, and lighten every heart of man.

Until every nation, whether bond or free, 
'Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus, follows Thee.
O'er the distant mountains to that heavenly home, 
Where nor sin nor sorrow evermore shall come.

Light of life that shineth ere the worlds began,

Such a Babe in such a place, 
Can he be the saviour?
Ask the saved of all the race
Who have found His favour.

Angels sang about His birth, 
Wise men sought and found Him; 
Heaven's star shone brightly forth
Glory all around Him.
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight, 
Heard the angels singing; 
All the plains were lit that night, 
All the hills were ringing.

Gentle Mary laid her Child
Lowly in a manger; 
He is still the undefiled, 
But no more a Stranger.

Beautiful the story; 
Praise His Name in all the earth, 
Hail! the King of Glory!"

To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

In Bethlehem, in Israel, 
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came; 
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy.

""Let nothing you affright, 
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright, 
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""

Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind, 
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay, 
They found Him in a manger, 
Where oxen feed on hay; 
His Mother Mary kneeling down, 
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,

And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;

All other doth deface.

Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,

Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

Why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and home?
When Jesus is my portion, my constant Friend is He, 
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me.
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy; 
I sing because I'm free; 
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.

Let not your heart be troubled; these tender words I hear; 
And resting on his goodness I lose my doubts and fears; 
For by the path He leadeth but one step I may see; 
His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy; 
I sing because I'm free;

When songs give place to sighing; when hope within me dies; 
I draw the closer to Him; from care He sets me free;

Religious Music,Holes In The Floor Of Heaven,/r/religious+music/holes+in+the+floor+of+heaven_20887348.html,"One day shy of eight years old,
When grandma passed away.
I was a broken hearted little boy,
Blowing out that birthday cake.

How I cried when the sky let go,
With a cold lonesome rain.
My mom smiled, said: ""Don't be sad child.
""Grandma's watching you today.""

""cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.

""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Seasons come and seasons go,
Nothing stays the same.
I grew up, fell in love,
Met a girl who took my name.

Year by year, we made a life,
In this sleepy little town.
I thought we'd grow old together,
Lord, I sure do miss her now.

But there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
And her tears are pouring down.
That's how I know she's watching,
Wishing she could be here now.

An' sometimes when I'm lonely,
I remember she can see.
There's holes in the floor of Heaven,
And she's watching over you and me.

Well my little girl is 23,
I walk her down the aisle.
It's a shame her Mom can't be here now,
To see her lovely smile.

They throw the rice, I catch her eye,
As the rain starts coming down.
She takes my hand; says: ""Daddy don't be sad,
Cause I know Mama's watching now. ""

""And there's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.

""An' sometimes when I'm lonely,
""I just remember she can see.
""Yes, there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me..."

Above earth's lamentations, 
I hear the real, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation.

Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear it's music ringing, 
It sounds an echo in my soul.
How can I keep from singing?

While though the tempest loudly roars, 
I hear the truth, it liveth.
And though the darkness 'round me close, 
Songs in the night it giveth.

No storm can shake my inmost calm, 
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing, 
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging, 
When friends by shame are undefiled
How can I keep from singing?"

To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

""Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed, 
For I am thy God and will still give thee aid; 
I'll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

""When through the deep waters I call thee to go, 
The rivers of woe shall not thee overflow; 
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

""When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie, 
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply; 
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

""The soul that on Jesus still leans for repose, 
I will not, I will not desert to it's foes; 
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, 
I'll never, no never, no never forsake.""

""Even down to old age all my people shall prove
My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love; 
And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn, 
Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.""

In poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth; 
At home and abroad, on the land, on the sea, 
As thy days may demand, shall thy strength every be."

I saw the mighty Jordan row,
As in the days of yore.

Where all alone he prayed.

They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er it's Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! The days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace, their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing."

The stony hills recall...
Around her heart my city carries
A lonely ancient wall.

Yerushalaim all of gold
Yerushalaim, bronze and light
Within my heart I shall treasure
Your song and sight.

Alas, the dry wells and fountains,
Forgotten market-day
The sound of horn from Temple's mountain
No longer calls to pray.

The rocky caves at night are haunted
By sounds of long ago
When we were going to the Jordan
By way of Jericho.

Yerushalaim all of gold
Yerushalaim, bronze and light
Within my heart I shall treasure
Your song and sight.

But when I come to count your praises
And sing Hallel to you
With pretty rhymes I dare not crown you
As other poets do.

Upon my lips is always burning
Your name, so dear, so old:
If I forget Yerushalaim
Of bronze and light and gold...

Yerushalaim all of gold
Yerushalaim, bronze and light
Within my heart I shall treasure
Your song and sight.

Back to the wells and to the fountains
Within the ancient walls
The sound of horn from Temple's mountain
Again so loudly calls,

From rocky caves, this very morning
A thousand suns will glow
And we shall go down to the Jordan
By way of Jericho.

Yerushalaim all of gold
Yerushalaim, bronze and light
Within my heart I shall treasure
Your song and sight.

Other refuge have I none, hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! Leave me not alone, still support and comfort me.

Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of Thy wing.

Wilt Thou not regard my call? Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?
Lo! I sink, I faint, I fall - Lo! On Thee I cast my care;
Reach me out Thy gracious hand! While I of Thy strength receive,
Hoping against hope I stand, dying, and behold, I live.

Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy Name, I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am; Thou art full of truth and grace.

My gracious Redeemer, My Savior art Thou;

I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now.

I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say, when the death-dew lies cold on my brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now.

In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;

Jehovah is His Name;
In pastures fresh He makes me feed,
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wandering spirit back
When I forsake His ways,
And leads me, for His mercy's sake,
In paths of truth and grace.

When I walk through the shades of death
His presence is my stay;
One word of His supporting grace
Drives all my fears away.
His hand, in sight of all my foes,
Doth still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
His oil anoints my head.

The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may Thy house be my abode,
And all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest,
While others go and come;
No more a stranger, nor a guest,
But like a child at home."

Tho' like a wanderer,
The sun gone down, darkness be over me,
My rest a stone, yet in my dreams I'd be,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Then let the way appear, steps up to heaven;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given; angels to beckon me,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Then, with my waking thoughts, bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs, Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Or, if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon and stars forgot, upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be,

I would tell you how
He changed my life completely; 
He did something no other friend could do.

No one ever cared for me like Jesus; 
There's no other friend so kind as He.
No one else could take the sin
And darkness from me; 
O how much He cared for me.

All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me; 
All my heart was full of misery and woe, 
Jesus placed His strong arms about me
And He led me in the way I ought to go.

No one ever cared for me like Jesus; 
There's no other friend so kind as He.
No one else could take the sin
And darkness from me; 
O how much He cared for me.

Ev'ry day He comes to me with new assurance; 
More and more I understand His word of love.
But I'll never know just why He came to save me, 
Till someday I see His blessed face above.

Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.

Now the darkness gathers,
Stars begin to peep,
Birds and beasts and flowers
Soon will be asleep.

Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tend'rest blessing
May mine eyelids close.

Grant to little children
Visions bright of Thee;
Guard the sailors tossing
On the deep blue-sea.

Comfort every sufferer
Watching late in pain;
Those who plan some evil
From their sin restrain.

Through the long night-watches
May Thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
Watching round my bed.

When the morning wakens,
Then may I arise
Pure and fresh and sinless
In Thy holy eyes.

Glory to the Son,

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

Let all within us praise His holy name.

The silent stars go by; 
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light; 
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary; 
And gathered all above, 
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth! 
And praises sing to God the King, 
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently, 
The wondrous gift is given! 
So God imparts to human hears
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming, 
But in this world of sin, 
Where meek souls will receive him, 
Still the dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child, 
Where misery cries out to thee, 
Son of the Mother mild; 
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door, 
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks, 
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem, 
Descend to us, we pray; 
Cast out our sin and enter in, 
Be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell; 
O come to us, abide with us, 
Our Lord Emmanuel!"

Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch

So confused when I asked ask you if you love me

Maybe I've been California dreaming

But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (no)

Didn't know just what you had boy, now it's just too bad boy,
After all is said and done,
You're a cheater and a liar, went to play with fire,
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun,
'cause you could've been the one.

There's nothing left to say
You could've been the one (could've been, could've been, baby)

[2nd verse]
My momma didn't raise no fool,
She said ""you play with fire, you get burned"",
You laughed at me, I laughed at you (hehehe),
Now it seems the table's turned.

I must admit I really thought you had potenial
But I cannot have been more wrong
I need somebody that can trust that's essential
You had your chance but now I'm gone

[Chorus:]
You could've been the one (could've been the one),
That I would give it all to, catch you when you fall too
Should've been the one (should've been the one baby),
Didn't know just what you had boy, now it's just too bad boy,
After all is said and done,
You're a cheater and a liar, went to play with fire,
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun,
'cause you could've been the one.

Could've been the one baby,
You could've been the one,

[...]
You played yourself boy and there is no denying,
... It's just the way the story goes,
You made your bet boy, you better go lying,
.... You'll be lying there alone.

You could've been the one

[Chorus:]
You could've been the one (could've good boy),
That I would give it all to, catch you when you fall too
Should've been the one (should've been the one),
Didn't know just what you had boy, now it's just too bad boy,
After all is said and done (after all is said and done),
You're a cheater and a liar, went to play with fire,

'cause you could've been the one.

I know what it is
I've seen this before
Got caught for a million
I know that I'm nervous
Cause it really ain't a thing
Natural about it
Water into wine please
She seem like America
I know that's impossible

Say you love me (oooh)

Like the greys of the ones before you
For you

Everything fake like a movie script
Everything I got public so
You already know how the groupies get
Pulled up in the fakest city
With my Lambo sitting in my rambo with me
Plus I got a bitch so bad
With a rep so cold big ass big titties
Stuck in a fairy tale lifestyle
Snow White rolling with the gold diggers
Nigga say how much for that one
Shit, I ain't even know she was a hoe nigga
I meet these hoes everyday
Try to turn love like every way
Hundred dollars bills run the color of red
So I am counting my dough in a private place

Shoulda been on time but you showed up late
Had a little feeling but it's gone a-way
Gave you a piece, you want a whole damn plate
Wanna play, wanna ball
Wanna have your cake and eat it all
Now I gotta new one outta state
So them ratchets gonna hate, but they hated Jesus man
Runnin around sayin you don't need a man
You know you gonna miss them private flights
Everything high with young Khalifa man
Everything paid for
Is taken it's course so much back and forth
It's a everyday thing now (wooh)
So I'm skatin
Heading straight for your replacement
Cause your story I couldn't take it
Had holes in it like Jason
But I stuck around and stayed patient
Momma called me up basin
Father called me up pacing
All your friends were all basic
Now I see right through you
What a thought a nigga had lasic
Extra cash, spent that so my car look like a spaceship
Wanna leave me that's cool
I was thinkin bout leavin you
Walked out the door like poof
Made it look like the King of Doo

And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life

But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I shoulda never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Gotta figure out how you stole my heart

On my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much I can't resist
Falling into your arms

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
You know I'm drunk on love

You couldve been a apart of a
Masterpiece
Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leak

Where I'm going
I don't need my breaks

When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

But baby no
Doesn't have to be
Microwavin' a medal tragedy
Watching it burning
It's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful
And it's through
It's the other half of me

I didn't do it
You lit the match from me
Now were flying
From the blast, baby

They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazin'

The lovers need to clear the road

I don't have the right way and it will take the bus driver just got invited
Help me find a way to the gym today and it was the best thing about living room
Really fun to use the term of office of a sudden it was the best player
I'm at a time when you are so much for a long way in hell of an eye out for me
I just got to go home now I'm just like a baby I can be found at least a dozen

With my time with you guys should have the right way and it will take the lead
Isn't that the two sides to the gym today I am a big fan and the first half of them
To the first place for me I was the only way you want a boyfriend is so good
Looking for me I was a little too hard and it will not have the right thing to do

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Why are people in this country to get my money and time consuming but it
It would have the right thing and the fact is the most recent version and the fact
I'm so tired and hungry for me and the first place I have no clue who I want
The fact that you are so much for a long way in hell is going on with a few years
And it will not have the right way too long for a few years and it will take place

I give you my love life in a while and the other side is a trademark infringement
I'm at the same thing as the most beautiful thing is just like easy for first place
I don't think that the first place I don't have the right way too long for a freshman

The first place in my room for a few weeks and I'm so excited about it will not

The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips touchin me
Couldn't resist
The first, the first, the first

The first time you kissed my lips
First time your finger tips touchin me
Couldn't resist I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you knew I was meant for you

[Fabolous ~ Verse 1:]
Now my first time checkin you, only took a second to
Start inspecting you without disrespecting you
Wasn't expecting you to sayin it was affecting you
What you wearing got me staring like you butt naked boo
It may seem, like I don't even reckon you
But I day dream bout kissin on the neck of you
Style is unpecable, smile is incrediable
Aint nuttin like yah and babie I done met a few
The way I feel, is almost like a crush
My heart beats faster it's almost like a rush
And that's just when you enter in a room
I can tell when ur around by the scent of ur perfume
I can see why the puttin r&b songs together
I feel like Mariah, 'we belong together'
It's my pleasure, I treasure that I met ya
Betcha I can getcha, on the first time

[Chorus:]
The first time you kissed my lips
First time your finger tips touchin me
Couldn't resist I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you knew I was meant for you

[Verse 2:]
Now I remember datin'
The first time was intimidatin'
No rush though, I spent the whole November waitin'
Come on, look at the patience that I'm demonstratin'
After a week or two I usually start eliminatin'
But we got thru the convo on the phone
Now we finally chillin' in the condo all alone
I tried to be the expressive, without bein' aggressive
Just bein suggestive, a lil more impressive
And I'm a good playa, I listen to the coach
He showed me the playbook and said ""this is the approach"",
If you ever wanna score
Cuz some players rush there shot, and that's why they never on the floor
And that's why, we both feel comfortable
Like long time friends only been a month or two
I got moves, and I know when to make em
But, I only give em if I know you can take em (uh-oh!)

[Chorus:]
The first time you kissed my lips
First time your finger tips touchin me
Couldn't resist I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you knew I was meant for you

[Verse 3:]
Now before the first time we layed down in the bed
You aint know the kind of things that played 'round in my head
I aint playin around when I said ""you gon' remember this""
Might even turn your cell phone when you reminisce
Our first time we were like virgins with experience
A lil shy, but I urged you to experiment
Things got wetter oh, I mean better
Oh I'm gettin numb
I'm about to Cu-Cu-Cu-Cu-Come on now not yet, boo slow down
We just stepped in the ring, need a few more rounds
That's the first time it felt like that
Now you know why Fabolous is spelt like that

[Chorus:] [2x]
The first time you kissed my lips
First time your finger tips touchin me
Couldn't resist I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you knew I was meant for you"

I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly

Uh yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

You opened and shut the same door. 
Not gonna be your doormat, 
Not gonna linger,

You're barking up the wrong tree, 
I'll shake you, Coz I won't take you, 
This is how it was meant to be. 
I didn't know how to tell you, 
I'm not in love anymore, 
Even though it was a mistake, 
Telling me to walk out the door, 
And now you're wanting me back, 
I won't comply, You text me saying ""I love you"", 
You know I won't reply. 
Not gonna be your doormat, Not gonna linger,

Because I'm happier the way I am, 
And I'm doing fine, 
I feel like your obsession, 
Like you want me day and night, 
You shouldn't have let me go, Or at least put up a fight. No, No no, Not
Gonna run to you, No no. 
Your game's over. Not gonna be your doormat, 
Not gonna linger, It just ain't like that, 
Don't you click your fingers,

We gone forever

Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere

And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets

Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight

I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more

[Chorus]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try

Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

With a little bit too much to say"

I knew that you would wait for me, but I was wrong
But I was wrong

Why, leaving me tonight
I pray it's only a while 'til she'll be back again
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said
Tonight alone again, why

You came, the days grew dim for me
I knew we would be, but I thought we would see it out
For what we had was stronger than the things they knew
We knew

Why, leaving me tonight
I pray it's only a while 'til she'll be back again
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said
Tonight alone again

Righteous, righteous
Leaving me tonight
Righteous, righteous
Don't leave me
No, don't go tonight

You'll see me walking away, I see you wanting to say
I pray that you would see me for me, don't walk away

And I will know that you are so true
To all that I am, finding you

And I want to get right, 'cause I don't walk around
And I want to see tonight, and I know your sound
It's like I've got to know, and I don't walk around
If I could only get right, this time I know I could

Why, leaving me tonight
I know it's only a while 'til she'll be back again
No, it's only in my head, it's everything you said
Tonight alone again, why

Righteous, righteous
Leaving me tonight
Righteous, righteous
Don't leave me tonight

Right, right, right
Righteous now, we pray"

Never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paid the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wasting days away, now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protйgй, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way
Some say they sold ya and no they couldn't even work on Labor day

It ain't that they black or white, their hands in areas the shades of gray
I'm west side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away
Like I once made them spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thugging all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You would rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate,
Immaculately polished
With the spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit,
Impartial to the politics.
Articulate
But still would grab a nigga
By the collar quick.
Whoever had problems,
They reconciled
They just holla tip.
If that don't work
And just fails,
Then turn around and follow tip.
I got love for the game
But hey
I'm not in love with all of it.
I do without the fame
And the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin',
Back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know,
What you make
And what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important
With the positive.
And checks
Until your bank account,
And you're about poverted.
Your values is a disarrayed,
Prioritized are horribly.
Unhappy with the riches
Cause you piss-poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice
And fore warning.
And we might be
Full of ourselves
All of a sudden aren't we?

You're gonna be

With fancy clothes,
And fancy car-ars.

Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm living if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not going away

And keep on climbing
And look in the mirror and keep on shining
Till the game ends, till the clock stops

Somebody told me how to mend a broken heart this old
In love we all we fall but we fell a little harder

Asked you, how do you do.

It turned real personal.
And with me, became a sensation.

I found in you.
Something oh so true.
I knew at the time.
I wanted you as mine.
I asked you to date.
And you said that would be oh so great.
From there we went somewhere.
And love was in the air.

You grew to be mine.
I did not want to lose you.
I did not want to screw you.
I found in you a love so true.
I want to keep it forever.
You and me always together.

One day after some time.
I would ask you a most precious line.
I asked you to marry me.
You said, I agree.
And together, we went off to be married.

It is pure, and white.
Something true in my heart.

Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction

So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills, 
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts

Only want the truth, but I
Know that I will never get, the love that I had if knew what you were doing wrong
Cause this love never felt so strong, but at the same time it feels so weak oh

You know that you're hurting me, baby can't you see
That your love is all I need, that your love is all I feel
But I wonder is it still that real
And every time that I put a smile on my face
It's because I don't wanna loose you,
It's because I know it will kill you
I look into the mirror and say

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

So I, open up my eyes, open up this healing, that I've been feeling
Don't know where it's taking me, don't know if it's you or me oho
So I, just cried a river of emotions deeper then the ocean
Baby cause I know that I never wanna go
Never wanna leave your side

I love the way you lie when you do it,
Makes me wanna puke and get sick of the things that you're making up
And I'm so caught up in this love song,
Do you really know what I long for
I'm addicted to you, yes it is true
Baby cause I want you to stay
I hurt myself every day
I look into the mirror and say

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pa pum
Man down
Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pa pum
Man down

Mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh why, oh why
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

I just shot a man down
In central station

Look, I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, oh gosh
What ever happened to me
Ever happened to me, ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a niggas life so soon
When me pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do

Rum pa pa pum

Rum pa pa pum
Me say wah man down (A weh me say)
Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pa pum
When me went downtown

'Cause now I am a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh lord have mercy now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please give me minimal
Run out of town,
None of them can see me now, see me now

Oh, mama, mama, mama

Rihanna,Million Miles Away,/r/rihanna/a+million+miles+away_20409533.html,"[Verse 1]
Here we lay, face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto ""could have been's"" that we should be letting go

[Chorus]
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away

[Verse 2]
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
What we were is like a season, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

[Chorus]
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away

[Bridge]
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

[Chorus]
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears

Inscribed to the sad and lonely

And if you had told me, the clock was gonna fall
If you had shown me, some affection
I would have believed you

Don't tell me the moon is blue

And you can't find your blue moon
It's over, ooh tonight it's over

And yeah you been bad
So why did I still want you to hold me?
My tears of broken glass thinkin' ho wlong

The blade was a sharp one
That cut me both ways and tore my world apart
Now I could have healed that wound so deep
But you wouldn't understand

Don't tell me the moon is blue,

The words might come out better

To the story of me and you

Still not over you you

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain since you been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always something right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or something on the T. V.
Boy it ain't easy
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
Turn back the hands of time

Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oh no...
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget

The fact that you went around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
And baby I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
(When I was your girl)
This land is a better land
(When you're in my world)
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely he, he, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got is nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you
You, you,
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart...

(Will. I. Am)
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma's sofa
Girl I got this lovey dovey in my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin... Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking s***, oh no
Girl why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't you be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't you be the one?

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
You, you,
Is nothing without you
You, you
Is nothing without you
All I've got, All I've got, is nothing without...

All I've got

To add suspense
To all the games
Of discontent.

Fear is real
But not self-taught
You let others
Be the cause.

There we go racing towards the sun, 
Ignoring all the noise, 
Striving for the grace of man.
People play this great charade, 
And always miss the point.
Never fall for prophecies.

You say it draws near, 
That it will be clear.
You act so convinced, 
A fortress you've built.
Remember the doubt
By which I now stand.
You write the book
On the way it all ends.

Tear down
Those mighty walls.
Reinvent
The way you talk.

Look ahead, 
Now down below, 
Or high above, 
Where angels flow.There we go racing towards the sun, 
Ignoring all the noise, 
Striving for the grace of man.
People play this great charade, 
And always miss the point.
Never fall for prophecies.

Waiting to see
Our kind disagree.
You draw the line
And stick to your pride.
Remember the doubt
By which I now stand.
You write the book
On the way... 

It ends.

You say it draws near
That it will be clear.
You act so convinced, 
A fortress you've built.

By which I now stand.

Your fingertips leave me hypnotized
And when it hits my lips I am paralysed! 
Cause we come too far, and it feels so right
So put up a fight, just enjoy the ride! 
No wrong or right, just want the light!

And undo my skirt, Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece, Sorrow decrease
Pressure released, I put in work
Did more than called upon, More than deserved
When it was over, Did I wind up hurt (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit, Can I endure somemore
Just as I'm given, Question Existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit, Can I endure somemore
Just as I'm given, Question Existing

Take off my cool, show them that
Under here, I'm just like you
Through the mistakes, I may make me a fool
Or a human with clause, and if that I'm lost
Round of applause, Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose is

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit, Can I endure somemore
Just as I'm given, Question Existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit, Can I endure somemore
Just as I'm given, Question Existing

Dear Diary,
And to all them
Entertaining is something I do for a living
It's not who I am, I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal,
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think
Guys suck sometimes,
But when you're in the spotlight,
Everything seems good,
Sometimes I feel like I have it worse cause I have to always keep my guard up,
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am,
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am,

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit, Can I endure somemore
Just as I'm given, Question Existing
Who am I living for?

You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving

So just pull the trigger

Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
And I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test

I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

Rihanna,Same Ol' Mistakes,/r/rihanna/same+ol+mistakes_21106235.html,"[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
I'm thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
But I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe this story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking You're the only option was)
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
So how will I know that it's right?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)"

My heart is working overtime to mend what's broke inside
And it's hard for me to see the light
Cause I'm stuck
At least that's what it feels like

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
(Don't wanna feel)
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel
(Right away)
But it don't happen that way, never

It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
So I'm slower to heal

Verse 2:
It's like I'm in a traffic jam
(A traffic jam)
Being pulled out of quicksand
(Outta quicksand)
It's like a newly planted tree
I wish that you could find it in yourself to be patient with me

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
(Don't wanna feel)
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel
(Right away)
But it don't happen that way, never

It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
(Don't wanna feel)
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel
(Right away)
But it don't happen that way, never

I'm slower to heal
Slower to heal
Don't wanna feel the way I feel
(Don't wanna feel)
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel
(Right away)
But it don't happen that way, never

It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight

A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said show me something
He said, if you dare come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can’t live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It’s not much of a life you’re living
It’s not just something you take, it’s given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can’t live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Ohhh the reason I hold on
Ohhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I’m the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the lights it’s hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can’t live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohhh"

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size 10
In my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right

So I made it
Even though Katy
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right

Don't understand it
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

Is you idiot
(Such an idiot)
That's what my friends
Are calling me when
They see me yelling
Into my
Phone

They tell me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it
Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you
Waste your time
You know he aint right

Telling me this
I don't wanna listen
But you insist
On repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid
I still love you
But I just can't do this
I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid

Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep
Holding on
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you lost
And you wont realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us
Is really dumb

Ooh
No
No
No
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me

What if you wasted love and all of our time disappeared

But I'd do it again
Holding hands with my friend again

Maybe we gave our all 
A song they'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it 
Maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearin' it when it's gone

Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon'be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn.

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way... I win!

Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I bet a pitcher took a chance on love
Baby love... The time is now
And now-The wait is ova!

The wait is ova (4x)
Just wait your turn
The wait is ova (4x)
Just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here...
But babe... The wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova

Fumble don't't you fumble

Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait

I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha hada a lot a game, and he open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I don't care who is hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but everytime that he's around
My hearts on lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud

Got lost in a promise
Of a love I never know
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold

I still swear that we can reign

Rihanna,Unfaithful,/r/rihanna/unfaithful_20409443.html,"Story of my life,
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me.
Sorrow in my soul,
Because it seems that wrong,
Really loves my company.

He's more than a man,
And this is more than love,
The reason that the sky is blue.
The clouds are rolling in,
Because I'm gone again,
And to him I just can't be true.

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful,
And it kills him inside,
To know that I am happy,
With some other guy.
I can see him dying.

I don't wanna do this anymore,
I don't wanna be the reason why,
Everytime I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside.
I don't wanna hurt him anymore,
I don't wanna take away his life.
I don't wanna be...
A murderer.

I feel it in the air,
As I'm doing my hair,
Preparing for another date.
A kiss upon my cheek,
As he reluctantly,
Asks if I'm gonna be out late.
I say I won't be long,
Just hanging with the girls,
A lie I didn't have to tell.
Because we both know,
Where I'm about to go,
And we know it very well.

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful,
And it kills him inside,
To know that I am happy,
With some other guy.
I can see him dying.

I don't wanna do this anymore,
I don't wanna be the reason why,
Everytime I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside.
I don't wanna hurt him anymore,
I don't wanna take away his life.
I don't wanna be...
A murderer.

Our love,
His trust,
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head,
Get it over with.
I don't wanna do this,
Anymore, ooooooh, anymore.

I don't wanna do this anymore,
I don't wanna be the reason why,
And everytime I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore,
I don't wanna take away his life.
I don't wanna be...
A murderer.

And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you said

Boy...

[Chorus:]
When ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that you die
We used to say
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

When ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 2:]
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Make me feel like I'm floating yeah
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody
Better than us

Yeah...

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why you said

Mmmm...

[Chorus:]
When ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that you die
We used to say
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

We ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that you die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 3:]
I guess it's over
Indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy
To let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Hey...
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby
This is where the game ends now
Some How
Wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

Oh oh...
Yeah...

[Chorus:]
When ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that you die
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make me say
Boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Boy
You forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away
But I remember
What you used to say
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Chorus:]
When ride when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that you die
We used to say
When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

When ride when we ride we ride

Rihanna,What Now,/r/rihanna/what+now_21050295.html,"I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger, now what, so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Whoa, what now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is, it feels like
It's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Somebody tell me

When your friends start to trip
And you're loosin your grip
And you cant find your way back home

And you know that your all alone
When you just can deal, and you need something real
Someone that'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?

You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school
Memories when you were tryin' so hard to play cool
I don't mind I know that you gotta go through your changes
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it

Said he idolized me
If you don't know why
Then it's time to watch me
A young papi with the confidence
Of Rocky in a boxing match
Early mornings practicing my rhymes
13 rocking a stocking cap
Skinny nigga told my reflection I'll never settle
Said if I gain some weight
Then I would one day try to wrestle
Wanted to play ball and be a UNLV rebel
When I let my talent go to waste
Cause I couldn't keep up my grades
What a shame
Now I'm living out my second dream
Grown into some shit you've never seen
Now I'm onto better things
It just goes to show
When you travel a lot and you be on the road
We all thriving to be comfortable and happy
But in life we go the distance
A major part in life is
Building the life you wanna live with
I know we lack patience
But you gotta stay consistent
Only you can slow you down
Turn your dreams into commitments
Making sense with a sentence
Golden Age and I'm vintage
1990 to now what we doing they did it
You could be fooled in a minute
I'm just tryna talk that shit until I'm finished
The lost soul that's protected by my religion
I represent World Peace

Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace yo, yo
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace

[Verse 2]
I'm extremely excited without it hiding
Niggers see me smiling
But y'all niggers don't know the half of it
I'm talking bout a kid that grew up without having shit
And sorted out a plan
And then turned into a man
Y'all understand the fans
And how fans follow the artist
But what if some man
Give ‘em something other than trends?
What you recommend
What you stepping in?
Who you follow?
What you represent?
Nigger what set you in?
Man we all started from the bottom
Started with a problem
Before I was ever crawling
I was born into my miseries
Came out with my hidden talents
Now the rest is history
Riding but if you ain't providing
That don't mean shit to me
You could be the hardest nigga walking
But the hardest niggers working is the bosses
Keep it authentic
Cause the image got you confused
Anybody would tell you it's a lose, lose
Nigga do you?

[Chorus]
Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace yo, yo
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace

[Verse 3]
I just wanna give you
Something you can keep in mind
Be strong don't let nothing
Disturb yo peace of mind
Read between the lines
Teaching men to rhyme
You can't change overnight
We all need some time
Homey don't act like I ain't out here
On my ones and twos
Yo fundamentals was rented
And it's a bunch of you
Me I been the same
Since my momma was buying lunch-ables
Grew through some functions
Respected cause I'm lovable
Think good thoughts
Speak good words
Take good actions
Yeah that's what the world deserves
A man in power
That's gonna empower the people first
In Howard College they listen
Came all the way from the dirt
Agree to disagree just because
I'd rather have them legalize
A plant then feed the people nicotine
Sell the devil's juice and
They gonna support it by any means
On they TV screens nigga please
I represent World Peace

[Chorus]
Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace yo, yo
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace"

Have to go and throw it all in my face?

Rush,2112,/r/rush/2112_20119899.html,"'i lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging
Into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as
They trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here,
Just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple
Paper in the evening.

'My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer
Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under
The Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.
I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy. Then I found
Something that changed it all... '

[I. Overture]

And the meek shall inherit the earth...

[Ii. Temples of Syrinx]

... 'The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city. I
Have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated
And directed from within! Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by
The benevolent wisdom of the priests... '

We've taken care of everything
The words you hear, the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes
It's one for all and all for one
We work together, common sons
Never need to wonder how or why

We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

Look around at this world we've made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
Oh, what a nice, contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand

We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls

[Iii. Discovery]

'... Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I
Found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in
My hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful... '

'... I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound
Differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds
And soon my own music! How different it could be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait
To tell the priests about it!... '

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out it's pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see it's light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night

[Iv. Presentation]

'... In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim,
Expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed
Throughout the silent Temple Hall... '

'... Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection!
Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground
My precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet... '

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Yes, we know, it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan

I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Don't annoy us further!
We have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the Plan!

[V. Oracle: The Dream]

'... I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see
The beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase... '

'... I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man
Revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and
Understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed
By the Federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of
All these things... '

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days
I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down...
Home to change!

[Vi. Soliloquy]

'... I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total
Despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live
Under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is
That with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last. '

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams...

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood...
... Spills over...

On the path of least resistance

Fear and lies
Withered hearts
And cruel tormented eyes
Scheming demons
Dressed in kingly guise
Beating down the multitude
And scoffing at the wise

The hypocrites are slandering
The sacred halls of Truth
Ancient nobles showering
Their bitterness on youth
Can't we find
The minds that made us stong
Can't we learn
To feel what's right and wrong

The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Raise the art to resistance
Danger dare to be grand
Pride reduced to humble pie
Diamonds down to sand

Take heart from earth and weather
The brightness of new birth
Take heart from the harvest
Shave the harvest from the earth

Reasoning is partly insane
Image just an eyeless game
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Miracles will have their claimers
More will bow to rome
He and she are in the house
But there's only me at home

Rose is a rose of splendor
Posed to respond in the end
Lonely things like nights,
I find, end finer with a friend

I hear in the rate of her heart
A tear in the heat of the art

The night turns thin
The saint turns to sin"

In a world of curiosity beyond the imagination

When the entire planet prepares for destruction
Connecting their minds with others through telepathy
In the common sense of human curiosity
Destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere

Look out for everywhere under the sun
Look out for the annihilation gun
Look here, there and everywhere

Of hypothetical secrets
In most cases, sometimes he or she confess why they regret
In my opinion, gubernatorial fear is far from over
The conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest self-destructive endeavor
More and more human beings make connections
And it's part of an all-out worldwide chain reaction
Keep staring at the annihilation gun before it's too late
One year from now, the entire world's about to detonate

Look out for the annihilation gun
Look out for everywhere under the sun
Look out for the annihilation gun
Look here, there and everywhere

All nations will self-destruct, according to research scientists
The bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist
Search for the enemy within your secret human desire
Stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire
Stare at the anti-terrorsts standing higher
Look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand
Nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand
Find one or more anti-terrorism activist fighting for freedom
Be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom

Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
We marvel after those who sought
New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,
Wonders in the world they wrought.

Live for yourself -- there's no one else

Begging hands and bleeding hearts will
Only cry out for more

Our better natures seek elevation
A refuge for the coming night
No one gets to their heaven without a fight

We hold beliefs as a consolation
A way to take us out of ourselves
Meditation or medication
A comfort, or a promised reward

Sometimes the spirit is too strong
Or the flesh is too weak
Sometimes the need is just too great
For the solace we seek
The suit of shining armor
Becomes a keen and bloody sword

A refuge for the coming night
A future of eternal light
No one gets to their heaven without a fight

Confused alarms of struggle and flight
Blood is drained of color
By the flashes of artillery light
No one gets to their heaven without a fight
The battle flags are flown
At the feet of a god unknown
No one gets to their heaven without a fight

What should have been our armor
Becomes a sharp and burning sword"

Play of light
A photograph
The way I used to be
Some half-forgotten stranger
Doesn't mean that much to me

Trick of light
Moving picture
Moments caught in flight
Make the shadows darker
Or the colors shine too bright

Oh the light can carry
All the visions of the sea
Oh the light can carry
All the images to me

Run to light from shadow
Sun gives me no rest
Promise offered in the east
Broken in the west

Tame the trackless waste, no virgin land left chaste
All shining eyes, but never seeing

Beneath the noble birth
Between the proudest words
Behind the beauty, cracks appear
Once, with heads held high
They sang out to the sky
Why do their shadows bow in fear?

Watch the cities rise
Another ship arrives
Earths melting pot and ever growing
Fantastic dreams come true
Inventing something new

Holding the good time -- Holding on to yesterdays...

Going under your speeding wheels
Bright images flashing by
Like windshields towards a fly
Frozen in the fatal climb -- but the wheels of time --
Just pass you by...

Wheels can take you around
Wheels can cut you down

We can go from boom to bust
From dreams to a bowl of dust
We can fall from rockets' red glare
Down to ""Brother can you spare --""
Another war -- another waste land --
And another lost generation...

It slips between your hands like water
This living in real time
A dizzying lifetime
Reeling by on celluloid

Struck between the eyes
By the big-time world
Walking uneasy streets --
Hiding beneath the sheets --
Got to try and fill the void..."

I don't understand these boundaries'

You know how complex women are'

I'll be around

I'll be around
If you don't let me down

It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said, 'Sure, I'll be your partner
But don't make too many demands'
I said, 'If love has these conditions
I don't understand those songs you love'
She said, 'This is not a love song
This isn't fantasyland'

Don't go too far
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea is a cold fire
Don't cross the line
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor is a cold fire
Don't let me down
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond is a cold fire
Don't break the spell
The look in your eyes as you head for the door is a cold fire

The sky is still dark, nearing dawn
On the Florida coastline

Circling choppers slash the night
With roving searchlight beams
This magic day when super-science
Mingles with the bright stuff of dreams

Floodlit in the hazy distance
The star of this unearthly show
Venting vapours, like the breath
Of a sleeping white dragon

Crackling speakers, voices tense
Resume the final count
All systems check, T minus nine
As the sun and the drama start to mount

The air is charged -- a humid, motionless mass
The crowds and the cameras,
The cars full of spectators pass
Excitement so thick -- you could cut it with a knife
Technology -- high, on the leading edge of life

The earth beneath us starts to tremble
With the spreading of a low black cloud
A thunderous roar shakes the air
Like the whole world exploding

Scorching blast of golden fire
As it slowly leaves the ground
Tears away with a mighty force
The air is shattered by the awesome sound

Like a pillar of cloud, the smoke lingers
High in the air
In fascination -- with the eyes of the world
We stare..."

Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by

Standin' at the crossroads, risin' sun goin' down
Standin' at the crossroads baby, the risin' sun goin' down

A bearing on magnetic north
Growing farther away all the time

I guess that's just a chance I'm prepared to take
A danger I'm prepared to face

It is the rocket that ignites itself
And launches it's way to the stars
A driver on a busy freeway
Racing the oblivious cars

It's the motor of the western world
Spinning off to every extreme
Pure as a lover's desire
Evil as a murderer's dream

Young enough not to care too much
About the way things used to be
I'm young enough to remember the future
The past has no claim on me

I'm old enough not to care too much
About what you think of me

Prologue

In the constellation of Cygnus
There lurks a mysterious, invisible force
The Black Hole
Of Cygnus X-1

Six Stars of the Northern Cross
In mourning for their sister's loss
In a final flash of glory
Nevermore to grace the night...

Invisible
To telescopic eye
Infinity
The star that would not die

All who dare
To cross her course
Are swallowed by
A fearsome force

Through the void
To be destroyed
Or is there something more?
Atomized --- at the core
Or through the Astral Door ---
To soar...

2

I set a course just east of Lyra
And northwest of Pegasus
Flew into the light of Deneb
Sailed across the Milky Way

On my ship, the 'Rocinante'
Wheeling through the galaxies,
Headed for the heart of Cygnus
Headlong into mystery

The x-ray is her siren song
My ship cannot resist her long
Nearer to my deadly goal
Until the Black Hole ---
Gains control...

Spinning, whirling,
Still descending
Like a spiral sea,
Unending

Sound and fury
Drowns my heart
Every nerve
Is torn apart...."
Rush,Cygnus X-1 Book II,/r/rush/cygnus+x+1+book+ii_20803542.html,"When our weary world was young
The struggle of the ancients first began
The Gods of love and reason
Sought alone to rule the fate of man

They battled through the ages
But still neither force would yield
The people were divided
Every soul a battlefield
Every soul a battlefield

I bring truth and understanding
I bring wit and wisdom fair
Precious gifts beyond compare

We can build a world of wonder
I can make you all aware
I will find you food and shelter
Show you fire to keep you warm
Through the endless winter storm

You can live in grace and comfort
In the world that you transform

The people were delighted
Coming forth to claim their prize
They ran to build their cities
And converse among the wise

But one day the streets fell silent
Yet they knew not what was wrong
They urge to build these fine things
Seemed not to be so strong

The wise men were consulted
And the bridge of death was crossed
In quest of Dionysus
To find out what they had lost

I bring love to give you solace
In the darkness of the night
In the heart's eternal light

You need only trust your feelings
Only love can steer you right

I bring laughter, I bring music
I bring joy and I bring tears
I will soothe your primal fears

Throw off those chains of reason
And your prison disappears

The cities were abandoned
And the forests echoed song
They danced and lived as brothers
They knew love could not be wrong

Food and wine they had aplenty
And they slept beneath the stars
The people were contented
And the Gods watched from afar

But the winter fell upon them
And it caught them unprepared
Bringing wolves and cold starvation
And the hearts of men despaired

The universe divided
As the heart and mind collided
With the people left unguided
For so many troubled years
In a cloud of doubts and fears
Their world was torn asunder
Into hollow hemispheres

Some fought themselves, some fought each other
Most just followed one another
Lost aimless like their brothers
For their hearts were so unclear
And the truth could not appear
Their spirits were divided
Into blinded hemispheres

Some who did not fight
Brought tales of old to light
My Rocinante sailed by night
On her final flight

To the heart of Cygnus fearsome force
We set our course
Spiraled through that timeless space
To this immortal race

I have memory and awareness
But I have no shape or form
As a disembodied spirit
I am dead and yet unborn
I have passed into Olympus
As was told in tales of old
To the city of immortals
Marble white and purest gold

I see the Gods in battle rage on high
Thunderbolts across the sky
I cannot move, I cannot hide
I feel a silent scream begin inside

Then all at once the chaos ceased
A stillness fell, a sudden peace
The warriors felt my silent cry
And stayed their struggle mystified

Apollo was astonished
Dionysus thought me mad
But they heard my story further
And they wondered and were sad

Looking down from Olympus
On a world of doubt and fear
It's surface splintered
Into sorry hemispheres

They sat a while in silence
Then they turned at last to me
(We will call you Cygnus)
(The God of balance you shall be)

We can walk our road together
If our goals are all the same
We can run alone and free
If we pursue a different aim

Let the truth of love be lighted
Let the love of truth shine clear sensibility
Armed with sense and liberty
With the heart and mind united
In a single, perfect, sphere"

Come to watch him fall?

Giant killers at the call?

Too much complication and confusion.
Peel away the mystery,
Here's a clue to some real motivation.

All there really is,
The two of us,
And we both know why we've come along.
Nothing to explain,
It's a part of us
To be found within a song.

What happened to our innocence,
Did it go out of style?
Along with our naivete',
No longer a child.
Different eyes see different things,
Different hearts beat on different strings.

For you and me, when all such things agree."

He's been a long while in Babylon
He'd like a lover's wings to fly on
To a tropic isle of Avalon

Subdivided and synthetic
His reliance on the giants
In the science of the day

He's adept at adaptation

In a dog's life
A year is really more like seven
And all too soon a canine
Will be chasing cars in doggie heaven

It seems to me
As we make our own few circles 'round the sun
We get it backwards
And our seven years go by like one

Dog years --- it's the season of the itch
Dog years --- with every scratch it reappears

In the dog days
People look to sirius
Dogs cry for the moon
But these connections are mysterious

It seems to me
While it's true that every dog will have his day
When all the bones are buried
There is barely time to go outside and play

Dog years --- it's the season of the itch
Dog years --- with every scratch it reappears
Dog years --- for every sad son of a bitch
Dog years --- with his tail between his ears

I'd rather be a tortoise from galapagos
Or a span of geological time
Than be living in these dog years

In a dog's brain
A constant buzz of low-level static
One sniff at the hydrant
And the answer is automatic

As well make our own few circles 'round the block
We've lost our senses
For the higher-level static of talk"

Alone and yet together,

The differences we sometimes fear to show.
Just between us,

The spaces in between
Leave room for you and I to grow.

We are strangers to each other,
Full of sliding panels,
An illusion show.
Acting well-rehearsed routines
Or playing from the heart?

Chorus:
Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night goodbye my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

Moon rise, thoughtful eyes
Staring back at me from the window beside
No fright or hindsight
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside

Start a new chapter
Find what I'm after
It's changing every day
The change of a season
Is enough of a reason
To want to get away

The other part:
Quiet and pensive
My thoughts apprehensive
The hours drift away
Leaving my homeland
Playing a lone hand
My life begins today"

There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, now, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, children, what's that sound

Flow in and out like the tide

We can hit and miss like pride

We can circle around like hurricanes

Attack the day like birds of prey
Or scavengers under cover

Look in -- to the eye of the storm
Look out -- for the force without form
Look around -- at the sight and the sound
Look in look out look around --

We can move with savage grace
To the rhythms of the night
Cool and remote like dancing girls
In the heat of the beat and the lights

We can wear the rose of romance
An air of joie de vivre
Too-tender hearts upon our sleeves
Or skin as thick as thieves'

Rising falling at force ten
We twist the world and ride the wind

Look out -- to the sea and the sky
Look around -- at the sight and the sound

Soon it will be christmas day

Blink a bright red and green

Blame is better to give than receive.

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice.
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill;
I will choose a path that's clear-
I will choose Free Will.

There are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand,
The cards were stacked against them- they weren't born in lotus-land.

All preordained-
A prisoner in chains-
A victim of venomous fate.
Kicked in the face,
You can't pray for a place
In heaven's unearthly estate.

You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill;

With uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet."

It takes some time and trouble to separate from the stock
You sometimes have to listen to a lot of useless talk

Shapes and forms against the norms --
Against the run of the mill
Swimming against the stream
Life in two dimensions is a mass production scheme

So much poison in power, the principles get left out
So much mind on the matter, the spirit gets forgotten about
Like a righteous inspiration overlooked in haste
Like a teardrop in the ocean, a diamond in the waste

Wait for the postman and the telephone
Lost in a world of my own

Hand over hand
Is the strength of the common touch

You talk as we walk along
You never imagined I could be so wrong
Humming your favorite song
You know I've hated that song for so long

How can we ever agree?
Like the rest of the world
We grow farther apart
I swear you don't listen to me
Holding my hand to my heart
Holding my fist to my racing heart

Take a walk outside myself
In some exotic land
Greet a passing stranger
Fell the strength in his hand
Feel the world expand

I feel my spirit resist

Lay hand over hand over

That it's cool to be so tough

A world of indifference
Heads and hearts too full
Careless of the consequence
Of constant push and pull

Anger got bare knuckles
Anger play the fool
Anger wear a crown of thorns
Reverse the golden rule
Then you learn the lesson
That it's tough to be so cool

Handle with kid gloves
Handle with kid gloves
Then you learn the weapons
And the ways of hard-knock school
Put on your kid gloves
Put on your kid gloves
Then you learn the lesson
That it's tough to be so cool"

Merry-go-round wheezing same old melody.
A thousand ten-cent wonders, who could ask for more.
A pocketful of silver, the key to heaven's door.

Lakeside Park, willows in the breeze.
Lakeside Park, so many memories.
Laughing rides, midway lights,
Shining stars on summer nights.

Days of barefoot freedom, racing with the waves,
Nights of starlit secrets, crackling driftwood flames,
Drinking by the lighthouse, smoking on the pier,
Still, we saw the magic was fading every year.

Everyone would gather on the twenty fourth of May,
Sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display.
Dancing fires on the beach, singing songs together,
Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever."

Some live behind iron gates, while others see only the worst.

Some are blessed and some are cursed, the Golden One or scarred from birth.
While others only see the worst, such a lot of pain on the earth.

Such a lot of pain on this earth, it's somehow so badly arranged.

Approaches the unreal

In touch with some reality

Cast in this unlikely role,
Ill-equipped to act,
With insufficient tact,
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact.

Living in the Limelight,
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem.
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation,
Get on with the fascination,
The real relation,
The underlying theme.

Living in a fisheye lens,
Caught in the camera eye.
I have no heart to lie,
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend.

All the world's indeed a stage,
And we are merely players,
Performers and portrayers,
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage."

With a primitive design
Behind the finer feelings
This civilized veneer
The heart of a lonely hunter
Guards a dangerous frontier

The balance can sometimes fail
Strong emotions can tip the scale

Don't want to silence a desperate voice
For the sake of security
No one wants to make a terrible choice
On the price of being free
I don't want to face the killer instinct
Face it in you or me
So we keep it under lock and key

It's not a matter of mercy
It's not a matter of laws
Plenty of people will kill you
For some fanatical cause
It's not a matter of conscience
A search for probable cause
It's just a matter of instinct
A matter of fatal flaws

No reward for resistance
No assistance, no applause

Don't want to silence a desperate voice
For the sake of security
No one wants to make a terrible choice
On the price of being free
I don't want to face the killer instinct
Face it in you or me

So we lock up the killer instinct

The flooding through her memory,
The echoes of old applause.

She limps across the floor
And closes her bedroom door...

Defies the empty page
His beard is white, his face is lined
And streaked with tears of rage.

Thirty years ago, how the words would flow
With passion and precision,
But now his mind is dark and dulled
By sickness and indecision

And he stares out the kitchen door
Where the sun will rise no more...

No reason to be sad

Just keep smilin', move onward ev'ry day
And try to keep our thoughts away from home
We're trav'lin' around, no time to settle down

In each nation -- always eager to explore
To build the best big stick
To turn the winning trick --
But this was something more...

The big bang -- took and shook the world
Shot down the rising sun
The end was begun -- it would hit everyone
When the chain reaction was done
The big shots -- try to hold it back
Fools try to wish it away
The hopeful depend on a world without end
Whatever the hopeless may say

Imagine a place where it all began
They gathered from across the land
To work in the secrecy of the desert sand
All of the brightest boys
To play with the biggest toys --
More than they bargained for...

One moment's high, and glory rolls on by
Like a streak of lightening that flashes and fades
In the summer sky

Your meters may overload
You can rest at the side of the road
You can miss a stride
But nobody gets a free ride

More than high performance
More than just a spark
More than just the bottom line
Or a lucky shot in the dark --
In the long run...

If you don't burn out too fast
You can make the most of the distance

The salesman turned to close the blinds

Another day as drab as today

Dreams flow across the heartland
Feeding on the fires
Dreams transport desires
Drive you when you're down --
Dreams transport the ones who need to get out of town

The boy walks with his best friend
Through the fields of early May
They walk awhile in silence
One close -- one far away
But he'd be climbing on that bus
Just him and his guitar
To blaze across the heavens
Like a brilliant shooting star

The middle-aged madonna
Calls her neighbour on the phone
Day by day the seasons pass
And leave her life alone
But she'll go walking out that door
On some bright afternoon
To go and paint big cities
From a lonely attic room

It's understood
By every single person
Who'd be elsewhere if they could
So far so good
And life's not unpleasant
In their little neighbourhood

Read the words that touch my heart
I gaze at their feverish pictures
The secrets that set them apart

When I feel the powerful visions
Their fire has made alive
I wish I had that instinct -- I wish I had that drive

Spirits fly on dangerous missions
Imaginations on fire
Focused high on soaring ambitions
Consumed in a single desire

In the grip of a nameless possession --
A slave to the drive of obsession --
A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission...

I watch their images flicker
Bringing light to a lifeless screen
I walk through their beautiful buildings
And I wish I had their dreams

But dreams don't need to have motion
To keep their spark alive
Obsession has to have action --
Pride turns on the drive

It's cold comfort
To the ones without it
To know how they struggled --
How they suffered about it

If their lives were exotic and strange
They would likely have gladly exchanged them
For something a little more plain
Maybe something a little more sane

We each pay a fabulous price
For our visions of paradise
But a spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission..."

I had a dream that you had a different face
I heard a scream of a desperate kind
I've got a feeling that you're going love what
You'll find

Where the money grows on trees
Where the beer is free

For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said you're strange, but don't change, and I let her

In a while, will the smile on my face turn to plaster
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change I don't know, why don't you ask her [4x]"

Soaring through lost altitudes
Without wonder, without fear

Symbols on a field of visions
Behind the curtain of sleeping eyes
On the instant of waking
Another world of dreams appears

Dream - temporary madness
Dream - a walk in the wilderness
Dream - unconscious recreation
The morning says the answer is yes"

A certain degree of imagination
A measure of make-believe

A certain degree of surrender
To the forces of light and heat
A shot of satisfaction
In a willingness to risk defeat

Celebrate the moment
As it turns into one more
Another chance at victory
Another chance to score

The measure of the moment
In a difference of degree
Just one little victory
A spirit breaking free
One little victory
The greatest act can be
One little victory

A certain measure of righteousness
A certain amount of force
A certain degree of determination
Daring on a different course

A certain amount of resistance
To the forces of the light and love
A certain measure of tolerance
A willingness to rise above"

I should have looked at your face instead

It went right by me --
Just another wall
There should have been a moment
When we let our barriers fall
I never meant what you're thinking --
That is not what I meant at all...

Well I guess we all have these feelings
We can't leave unreconciled
Some of them burned on our ceilings
Some of them learned as a child

The things that we're concealing
Will never let us grow
Time will do it's healing
You've got to let it go

Closed for my protection --
Open to your scorn
Between these two directions
My heart is sometimes torn

I lie awake with my secrets
Spinning around my head
Something that somehow escaped me --
Something you shouldn't have said
I was looking out the window
I should have looked at your face instead...

I find no absolution
In my rational point of view
Maybe some things are instinctive
But there's one thing you could do
You could try to understand me --
I could try to understand you..."

The breath of love is electricity
Maybe time is bird in flight

Here we come out of the cradle
Endlessly rocking

It's a motion

Oh let me touch your fragile face
Enchantment falls around me
And I know I cannot leave
Here's a meaning for my life

A shelter from the storm
Pacify my troubles with
Her body, soft and warm
Naked in our unity
A smile for every tear

Gentle hands that promise me
Comfort through the years
Yet I know I must be gone
Before the light of dawn

My heart will lie beside you
And my wandering body grieves"

Knight of Wands against the hour
Swords against the kingdom
Time against the tower

All this time we're shuffling and laying out all our cards
While a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards
All this time we're hoping and praying we all might learn
While a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn

Dream of a peaceable kingdom
Dream of a time without war
The ones we wish would hear us
Have heard it all before

The hermit against the lovers
Or the devil against the fool
Swords against the kingdom

Over constellations of light
I look down into a million houses
And wonder what you're doing tonight

If I could wave my magic wand
I'd make everything all right

I'm not one to believe in magic
But I sometimes have a second-sight
I'm not one with a sense of proportion
When my heart still changes overnight

I had a dream of a winter garden
A midnight rendezvous
Silver, blue, and frozen silence
What a fool I was for you

I had a dream of the open water
I was swimming away out to sea
So deep I could never touch bottom
What a fool I used to be

If I could wave my magic wand
I'd set everybody free

I'm not one to believe in magic
Though my memory has a second-sight
I'm not one to go pointing my finger
When I radiate more heat than light

Don't ask me
I'm just improvising
My illusion of careless flight
Can't you see
My temperature's rising
I radiate more heat than light

That no one knows about.
He says it used to be a farm,
Before the Motor Law.
And on Sundays I elude the Eyes,
And hop the Turbine Freight
To far outside the Wire,
Where my white-haired uncle waits.

Jump to the ground
As the Turbo slows to cross the Borderline.
Run like the wind,
As excitement shivers up and down my spine.
Down in his barn,
My uncle preserved for me an old machine,
For fifty-odd years.
To keep it as new has been his dearest dream.

I strip away the old debris
That hides a shining car.
A brilliant red Barchetta
From a better, vanished time.
I fire up the willing engine,
Responding with a roar.
Tires spitting gravel,
I commit my weekly crime...

Wind-
In my hair-
Shifting and drifting-
Mechanical music-
Adrenalin surge...

Well-weathered leather,
Hot metal and oil,
The scented country air.
Sunlight on chrome,
The blur of the landscape,
Every nerve aware.

Suddenly ahead of me,
Across the mountainside,
A gleaming alloy air-car
Shoots towards me, two lanes wide.
I spin around with shrieking tires,
To run the deadly race,
Go screaming through the valley
As another joins the chase.

Drive like the wind,
Straining the limits of machine and man.
Laughing out loud
With fear and hope, I've got a desperate plan.
At the one-lane bridge
I leave the giants stranded at the riverside.
Race back to the farm, to dream with my uncle at the fireside"

The battle lost -- or won
The flash to fashion
And the pulse to passion --

Inside my head
And truth is often bitter --
Left unsaid
Said red red
Thinking about the overhead --
The underfed

We've got mars on the horizon
Says the national midnight star
(it's true)
What you believe is what you are
A pair of dancing shoes --
The soviets are the blues --
The reds
Under your bed
Lying --
In the darkness
Dead ahead

And the mercury is rising
Barometer starts to fall

And the rain that is burning --

Shouting guards and smoking guns

A wound that will not heal -- a heart that cannot feel --
Hoping that the horror will recede
Hoping that tomorrow, we'll all be freed

Sickness to insanity
Prayer to profanity
Days and weeks and months go by
Don't feel the hunger -- too weak to cry

Nowhere we can rest

An uninvited guest

Deadline approaches
For the weary land

Quiet rebellion leads to open war
Bring a sea-change to the factory floor
As the red tide covers the shore

Snow falls deep around my house
And holds the winter light
I've heard the lions hunting
In the Serengeti night

Forests turned to factories
And river, sea, and sky
Hungry child in the desert

Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone

Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

Subdivisions --
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
Subdivisions --
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

Drawn like moths we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight

Somewhere out of a memory of lighted streets on quiet nights...

The primitive took hold

I stood at the top of the mountain

You will live a hundred years

The patterns of the landscape
Reaching to the eastern sea

While their invaders dream of lands they've left behind
Better people -- better food -- and better beer
Why move around the world when Eden was so near?

And if that wasn't evil enough
We get the drunken and passionate pride
Of the citizens along for the ride

Going for broke, going for another chance
Hoping for heaven -- hoping for a fine romance

I am me.
I am new.
I am free.

Look at me;
I am young.
Sight unseen;
Life unsung.

My eyes have just been opened,
And they're open very wide.
Images around me
Don't identify inside.

Just one blur I recognize,
The one that soothes and feeds.
My way of life is easy,
And as simple are my needs.

Yet my eyes are drawn toward
The mountain in the east.
Fascinates and captivates;
Gives my heart no peace.

The mountain holds the sunrise
In the prison of the night,
Till bursting forth from rocky chains,
The valley floods with light.

Living one long sunrise,
For to me all things are new.
I've never watched the sky grow
Pale, or strolled through fields of dew.

I do not know of dust to dust.
I live from breath to breath.
I live to climb that mountain
To the Fountain of Lamneth.

The coldness grips my skin.

And drawn by shrieking winds.

Seaspray blurs my vision.
Waves roll by so fast.
Save my ship of freedom.
I'm lashed, helpless, to the mast.

Remembering when first I held
The wheel in my own hands,
I took the helm so eagerly
And sailed for distant lands.

But now the sea's too heavy.
And I just don't understand,
Why must my crew desert me
When I need a guiding hand?

Call out for direction
And there's no one there to steer.
Shout out for salvation
But there's no one there to hear.

Cry out supplication
For the maelstrom is near.
Scream out desperation
But no one cares to hear.

Is unfolding from my mind.
I stare around in wonder.
Have I left my life behind.

And turn my head, surprised.
My gaze is caught and held and I
Am helpless, mesmerized.

Panacea, liquid grace.
Oh, let me touch your gentle face.
Enchantment falls arond me
And I know I cannot leave.

Here's a meaning for my life,
A shelter from the storm.
Pacify my troubles with
Her body, soft and warm.

Naked in our unity,
A smile for ev'ry tear.
Gentle hands that promise me
Comfort through the years.

Yet I know I must be gone
Before the light of dawn.

Panacea, passion pure.
I can't resist your gentle lure.
My heart will lie beside you,
And my wandering body grieve.

Silhouettes of grey.
Another glass of wine.
Drink with eyes that shine.

To days
Without that chill at morning.
Long nights,
Time out of mind.

Draw another goblet
From the cask of forty-three.
Crimson, misty mem'ry,
Hazy glimpse of me.

Give me back my wonder.
I've something more to give.
I guess it doesn't matter.
There's not much more to,
Not much more to live.

Another foggy dawn.
The mountain almost gone.
Another doubtful fear.
The road is not so clear.

My soul
Grows ever weary,
And the end
Is ever near.

Look the mist is rising,
And the sun is peaking through.
See the steps grow lighter
As I reach their final few.

Hear the dancing waters;
I must be drawing near.
Feel, my heart is pounding
With embattled hope and fear.

The key, the end, the answer,
Stripped of their disguise.
Still it's al confusion,
And tears spring to my eyes.

Though I've reached a signpost;
It's really not the end.
Like old Sol behind the mountain,
I'll be coming up again.

Now at last I fall before
The Fountain of Lamneth.
I thought I would be singing,
But I'm tired, out of breath.

Many journeys end here,
But the secret's told the same.
Life is just the candle,
And a dream must give it flame.

I'm in motion.
I am still.
I am crying.
I am still.
I'm together.
I'm apart.
I'm forever
At the start.
Still, I am."

From labyrinths below.

Shadows through the sky;
Another land to darken
With evil prism eye."

Fording the River Dawn, they turn south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the Necromancer. Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, weakening the body and saddening the heart. Ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres, stripped of will and soul. Only their thirst for freedom gives them hunger for vengeance

Raging at unreachable glory
Straining at invisible chains

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Can't face life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars
Turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back
And slam the door on me

It's not as if this barricade
Blocks the only road
It's not as if you're all alone
In wanting to explode

Someone set a bad example
Made surrender seem all right
The act of a noble warrior
Who lost the will to fight

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Done with life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

No daring in your escape
No salutes for your surrender
Nothing noble in your fate

Aware of some reality
Outside your world

You almost can't stand it

Distracted from ourselves
You can't help but wonder

In a crowded universe

One day carried away in storms

Can still be open-hearted.
Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question
Of your honesty, yeah, your honesty.

We can only bow to the here and now
In our elemental war

We can only grow the way the wind blows
We can only bow to the here and now
Or be broken down blow by blow

While evil spirits haunt their sleep
While shepherds bless and count their sheep

He's a little bit afraid of dying
But he's a lot more afraid of your lying
And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him
Can any part of life be larger than life?
Even love must be limited by time
And those who push us down that they might climb
Is any killer worth more than his crime?
Like a steely blade in a silken sheath

A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Close my eyes
Let my defenses down
All those wounds
That I can't get unwound.

No time to pause
If  I could slow it all down

Whose ship runs aground
I can wait until the tide
Comes around.

Old friends growing older

Catch the mystery, catch the drift.

And the space he invades
He gets by on you.

A stillness fell, of sound and peace.
The warriors felt my silent cry
And stayed their struggle, mystified.

Apollo was atonished;
Dionysus thought me mad.
But they heard my story further,

Turn around and say goodbye 

People who judge without a measure of mercy 
All the victims who will never learn 
Even the lost ones, you can only give up on 
Even the ones who make you burn 

The ones who've done you wrong 
The ones who pretended to be so strong 
The grudges you've held for so long 
It's not worth singing that same sad song 

Even though you're going through hell 
Just keep on going 
Let the demons dwell 

Just wish them well"
Rush,Witch Hunt,/r/rush/witch+hunt_20120003.html,"The night is black, without a moon.
The air is thick and still.
The vigilantes gather on
The lonely torchlit hill.

Features distorted in the flickering light,
Faces are twisted and grotesque.
Silent and stern in the sweltering night,
The mob moves like demons possesed.
Quiet in conscience, calm in their right,
Confident their ways are best.

The righteous rise
With burning eyes
Of hatred and ill-will.
Madmen fed on fear and lies
To beat and burn and kill.

They say there are strangers who threaten us,
Our immigrants and infidels.
They say there is strangeness to danger us
In our theatres and bookstore shelves,
That those who know what's best for us
Must rise and save us from ourselves.

Quick to judge,
Quick to anger,
Slow to understand
Ignorance and prejudice
And fear walk hand in hand."

History recedes in my rear-view mirror
Carried away on a wave of music down a desert road
Memory humming at the heart of a factory town

All my life
I've been workin' them angels overtime
Riding and driving and living
So close to the edge
Workin' them angels...
Workin' them angels...
Workin' them angels overtime

Riding through the Range of Light to the wounded city
Filling my spirit with the wildest wish to fly
Taking the high road, taking that high road to the wounded city
Memory strumming at the heart of a moving picture

All this time
I've been workin' them angels overtime
Riding and diving and flying
Just over the edge
Workin' them angels...
Workin' them angels...
Workin' them angels overtime

Driving down the razor's edge 'tween the past and the future
Oh, turn up the music and smile
Get carried away on the songs and stories of vanished times
Memory drumming at the heart of an English winter
Memories beating at the heart of an African village

All my life
I've been workin' them angels overtime
Riding and driving and living
So close to the edge
Workin' them angels... (workin' them angels...)

To break my fast on honey dew

Of immortality
The deepest mystery
From an ancient book.  I took a clue
I scaled the frozen mountain tops
Of eastern lands unknown
Time and Man alone
Searching for the lost --- Xanadu

Xanadu --- To stand within The Pleasure Dome
Decreed by Kubla Khan
To taste anew the fruits of life
The last immortal man
To find the sacred river Alph
To walk the caves of ice
Oh, I will dine on honey dew
And drink the milks of Paradise

A thousand years have come and gone
But time has passed me by
Stars stopped in the sky
Frozen in an everlasting view
Waiting for the world to end
Weary of the night
Praying for the light
Prison of the lost --- Xanadu

Xanadu --- Held within The Pleasure Dome
Decreed by Kubla Khan
To taste my bitter triumph
As a mad immortal man
Nevermore shall I return
Escape these caves of ice
For I have dined on honey dew
And drunk the milk of Paradise"

Mil ja kahin
O oo O
Mil ja kahin Samay se pare
Samay se pare
Mil ka kahin

Tu bhi aankhiyon se kabhi meri aankhiyon ki sun
Surili aanhkiyon wale
Suna hai teri aankhiyon se

Jane tu kahan hai
Udti hawa pe tere
Pairo ki nishan dekhe

Jane tu kahan hai
Udti hawa pe tere
Pairo ki nishan dekhe

Dhondha hai zameen pe
Jana hai falak pe
Sare aasmaan dekhe
Mil ja kahin Samay se pare
Samay se pare

Mil ka kahin
Tu bhi aankhiyon se kabhi meri aankhiyon ki sun
Surili aanhkiyon wale
Suna hai teri aankhiyon se
Everytime I looking to ur eyes
I see my paradise
These stars are shining were up in the sky
Painting world of desire
You are the one I wating for
Everytime I looking to ur eyes
I see my paradise
These stars are shining were up in the sky
Painting world of desire

Ooth mein chupke
Dekh rahe the
Chand ke peeche peeche the

Ooth mein chupke
Dekh rahe the
Chand ke peeche peeche the
Sara jahan dekha
Dekha na aankhon mein
Palkon ke neeche the
Aa chal kahin
Samay se pare
Samay se pare
Chal de kahin
Tu bhi aankhiyon se kabhi meri aankhiyon ki sun

Surili aanhkiyon wale
Suna hai teri aankhiyon se

Suna de zara aankhiyon se

ओह.. तेरी ये राजाएं तो है कातिलाना

पहली ही बार हुआ इस दिल को
ना तो इनकार हुआ
ना ही इकरार हुआ
जाने क्या यार हुआ इस दिल को

तेरे बिना मैं तन्हा था हरदम
होठों पे हरदम थी तिश्नगी
मकसद नहीं था सपने नहीं थे
थी ज़िन्दगी में आवारगी
तू मेरा रहनुमा है
मंजिल है रास्ता है
ओ मेरे लिए तू तो जैसे
रब का है नजराना

तेरा दीदार हुआ पहला सा प्यार हुआ
पहली ही बार हुआ इस दिल को
ना तो इनकार हुआ
ना ही इकरार हुआ
जाने क्या यार हुआ इस दिल को

यूँ तेरा मुस्कुराना और आके चले जाना

रख हिम्मत बस चल दे

मोड़ता मरोड़ता है हौसला रे

जब होगा अँधेरा, तब पायेगा दर मेरा
उस दर पे फिर होगी तेरी सुबह

kahan chala re

modhta marodta
hai hausla re
toh khud tere khwabon ke rang mein
tu apne jahan ko bhi rang de
ke chalta hoon mein tere sang mein
ho shaam bhi toh kya
jab hoga andhera
tab paayega dar mera
uss dar pe phir hogi teri subah

And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peacable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek
American ghost dance...

A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

Mopping up the pain and
I'm a little older

At the animal bar

No it won't be long

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 lets break this)
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta a feeling of worth
(1, 2, 3 forsake this)

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat

Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find it's day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 lets break this)
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 forsake this)
In between the sky and every piece of earth

That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw

I saw a bird walkin' down the block,

I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock

Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She likes the looks of me and my willy

So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosie

I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I like better

Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard

Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky ass meters
She has one of those built in heaters

I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I like better

Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it

Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night

And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea

An island flying through the sky

And if you son should be a girl

And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication

To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war your waging

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderon's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population everybody's been there
And
I don't mean on vacation

But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication

To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest
There is no test
But this is what you're craving

Knocked out but boy you better come to

Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty million answers.

The tears I've dropped
To be part of
The way you can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you

To be part of

Come and tell me when it's time to

So smart she's leading me to ozone

Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna to be a close one
Smoke rings I know your gonna blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Why I need somebody new just like you

Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Fear no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary

Comin' from a space to teach you of the Pleiades

And now he stands outside
and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries oh girl you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had
Against the door he leans and start a scene
and his tears fall and burn the garden green
And so castles made of sand
fall in the sea
eventually
A little Indian brave who before he was ten
played wargames in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
he would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong
until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
and fight his first battle
but something went wrong
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
And so castles made of sand
fall in the sea
eventually
There was a young girl
whose heart was a frown
'cause she was crippled for life
and she couldn't speak a sound
and she wished and prayed
she could stop livin'
so she decide to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
and to her legs she smiled
You won't hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going
And so castles made of sand
slips into the sea

Did I leave it better even though we look to be his

But I see your eyes spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away

Well that’s me looking for weed
Turn the corner and…
Find the world and show command
Playing the hand

Red Hot Chili Peppers,Deep Kick,/r/red+hot+chili+peppers/deep+kick_20114793.html,"It started when we were little kids.
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents.
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find,
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraving hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe.
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it.
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves,
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals,
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind.
Still, the brothersbloodcomradespartnerfamilycuzz was impenetrable
And we lived inside it
Laughing with no clothes, and everything experimental 'till death was upon us.
In our face, mortality.
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us,
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us,
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around.
Nothing is the same.
So we keep moving.
So we keep moving.

Went off and got some hair cuts
Lookin wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a Bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The mothersfuckers woke us up

Two young brothers on a hover craft
Telepathetic love and bellylaughs

Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kind and do the no no

Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathics love and belly laughs

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L. A. Proper
Two boys in L. A. Proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the Starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good

I remember...
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the butthole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
We were young
And we were looking
Looki-i-ing
Looking for that deep kick...
Seen 'em come, seen 'em go...

Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies

The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown

Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can

I'm a lonely lad

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you

She moves in a rapture
That her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning
Head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar

You can smell the purple light
Comin' from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher
'Cause that's what you are
I wanna be your pet

And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk

He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, ""Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead""

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, ""Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead""

So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from park ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politican
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talking about t hat freedom
Fight like a brave

Fight like a brave
Don't be a slave
No one can tell you
You've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick'n'tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give your self a break
Get it through your head
Get if off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission

A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
There should be no slaves in the land of lands
It's a hollywood jam

You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
Here's a one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme

If you dont believe me you can ask john doe
cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
Hell tell you in a minute about the men he knows
Hell tell you bout the band called fire hose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
Were the best of the west and the west is ours
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea"

Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl

In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time

Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight

Favor Some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life

Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you

Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder

Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo story

Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat

Suicide is never going to save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this"

Like an expiration date.

Red Hot Chili Peppers,Green Heaven,/r/red+hot+chili+peppers/green+heaven_20114808.html,"About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend, foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow

Here above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a glidin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's a teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm goin' to meet you

Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin', apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?"

I will stone you, stone you
Wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you
My little halo

I'm the man, I'm the king
I'm the one that's broken from giving
Everday, everyway
I swear just one last try
Killing me with the death to be
Something that's so right

I met a girl who wants to save the world, save the world
Make it safe for someone else to find their faith

I’m away I’m away... Hanalei

A simple song and it made me cry
I really don’t want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemmingway
The revolution in your blood creates the wave

Looked a lot like a mother earth

To find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging
Like a dirty little sleuth

The truth is I have never
Felt half this alive
Now it’s time to dance
Upon the grave called 45

Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth

Gentle as a storm
Inside your mental health
I wanna find the answer
But I just can’t find myself

I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let’s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

Later I would look for love
Inside a woman’s dorm
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm

Ophelia was the girl
That I was feeling for
Come to realize
It was me who was the whore

A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more

Drunken sailors
Seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things
That they really didn’t wanna know

I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let’s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday

A devil’s growl and cat’s meow
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun

A juggernaut of comedy
And blasphemy
I wanna stop the madness
But I think it has to be

I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let’s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

Would never let me stay

Cause had to pay your Paul
And when you find that's not enough
He'll break your fall

Get off the carousel

I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side...

Centurys are what it meant to me
A cemetary where I marry the sea
A stranger thing that never changed my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
I gotta take it on take it on...

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtrays full and I'm spilling my gut
She wanna know am I still a s***
I gotta take it on the other side...

A scarlet startlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for the soul mate bled
Push the trigger and I pull the thread
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on...

Burn me out, leave me on the other side

Could feel so good while losing

And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino

Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in

Curl up with lover we
Could lie out on the blanket

Take the time to thank it

In love dying

Someone’s sighing
There’s a virgin road
Waiting to be strode
Rope’s untying
This power I could not withhold

Satisfying
What do we contain
Can’t stop crying
These tears of change
Remain the same

My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead

In love dying
Does it go two ways
In love dying
This body I can not detain

Wake up flying
She the solar shores
Passers buying
The memories we readorn

In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling thru
The halls of fame

In love dying
Loss becomes the gain
In love dying

So I may sustain"

His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano

Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan

Take the throne

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
I didn't know I was looking for love

Oh I wonder, could I say how I felt and not be misunderstood?
A thousand stars came into my system,
I never knew how much I have missed them.
Slap, on the lap, of my heart you landed,
I was coy, but you made me candid,
And now the planets circle around you,

In the world of tears, one conselation
Now you're here and there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
But if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless, boundless, I surround you

In the zaniest of... Directions
My love protection. My love erection
You better get some... Of my affection

My love can hide behind a grain of sand
My love for life is fuelled by the love for my band
I love his mother and the silly mixed-up man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad

My love is death to Apartheid rule
My love is the deepest depths, the ocean blues

My love is the Zulu groove
My love is the coop-a-loop move
My love is the lightning's blues
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is the skin of my flute
My love, my love

My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thunb
My love for a fresh set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a bunch of knuckleheads
My love for the sqeuaks in the bed
My love for the legs that I spread
My love for the fat natty dread
My love, my love

My love, is my toes in the sand
My love, is my dick in my hand

Spins the yarn and no one ever checks it out to see if it was real
Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall
All along it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love

What more do you want
How much more can you take
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

All in all it's just the call of something wild beyond your room
There's a changing of the major chord
Your minor thread will do, love

My gun misfired, shot myself instead
I guess I always knew I'd be the one to lose
Light screen door slams, time to make a move

Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers
Of suffering succotash

Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation

Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Just in case
You never knew
I miss you slim
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Well I'm cryin'

Well I'm cryin'
My lovely man
I'll see you later

There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughing at the blues

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just wanna play

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it"

You are, you are the star within
The far, the far, the far away
The law that caused it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do
I thought I done it all, I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked as clear as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
But Never is a long time
Now I share this feeling in my yang
Stolen good time, always give away
A never that will always wonder what the star will say
From far, from far, from far away
The law that caused it all to stay by you, by you
By you, by you
A baby cla&#7767; ping on your dress, will always have a place I guess, by
You, by you
I'm in love, and we could bless the pleasure of my child's best
Lonely books and tenderness, to rescue me from emptiness

I came unglued

Get the last laugh

Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
To give and give

The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost,
A sullen cost

So we were down in Brazil and, man, that place is wild
We were in Rio de Janeiro, and uh, we had this, this sort of, uh, security-guard type guy and he was supposed to take us around
I said ""Hey, could, you know, could you take us to the, the favelas and show us the prostitution, and the drug deals, and the night fights, and the you know, the street life of your town?""
And he said ""Sure."" So we, we pull up to this hooker and she's wearing some kind of a, a bright green miniskirt, and it turns out it's a transsexual
And he says ""Get over here!"" And she comes over and she thinks she's busted, but she's not busted. Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say, ""Hey, what's up, girl?""

[Chorus]
Get out of bed and I clear up my head and
I don't want to go but I do it instead
We are dreams within a dream
Get into bed and I turn off my head
And I﻿ started to float, was it something she said?
We're all dreams within a dream

[Verse 2]
So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Datsun painted green, and...
Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter. The rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights
And, well, you know, we'd smoke weed and we'd go up in the hills, and we'd listen to progressive rock music, and just kind of trip out and... Well, we would dream, you know. We would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music. And, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star, and I didn't even know what that was. I was like, ""Whatever you want to do, man, I'm coming with you, I'm right with you my friend.""

Get out of bed and I clear up my head and

Why in the world would you want it to be?
Why would you want to take it so, so literally?
All these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head, make you stop and wonder why, ah!
Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me? I don't think so
I reach out to my family and I say, ""It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky with a punishing hand, oh, it's about heaven in your heart.""
Now when can we start?
I wanna choose love instead of fear, won't you come right now, over here, and be a part of my, ah...

Push the trigger and pull the thread

Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He wore a cold paisley jacket and a hellified ass
And between his legs was a cock suckin' lass

And he swore to fear that he'd fuck 'em all

By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a FOP!

Fop outside, then I came in doors

Far away, but we both know it's somewhere.

The driftwood in your eyes had nothing short of love for pay.
I know you from another picture,

Fool around and pull some capers.
Not today,
I send a message to her.

I rest my face on your bed.
I've got you ten times over
I'll chase you down
'Till you're dead.

What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker.
Someone ought to situate her,
Find a way to educate her.
All the way, time to come and find you.
You can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do.

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed.
I'll chase you down

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me strip

Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
Shes too free and I'm the patient

Black and white a red and blue are
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Lets get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread

Black and white a red and blue are
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
Its way out there but I don't care
Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Its way out there
But I don't care
Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger bang is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Lets Sleep weeping willow

Black and white a red and blue are
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
Its way out there but I don't care
Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Its way out there
But I don't care
Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood"

Lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind did a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terra-bulb is a soul

From winter to the spring

That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong

National crash into the big lampoon
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon

Losing ground true sounds of liberty
The forest of the north might hold the key
Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band
Black flag wave on on my truck my man
Blasting for jones and the great unknowns

And then she throws the fight

The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It's time to get your fingers wet
Your hustle's busted when
You can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming ""handle it""

Knock the world right off it's feet
And straight onto it's head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend

It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine

It's understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your
Kitty at the discotheque
I put my lovin' in your oven
Not a head to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming ""resurrect""

Knock the world right off it's feet
And straight onto it's head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed

*Awesome guitar playing* :)
*I just want to say amen,
That is some kick ass geetar
Playin*

And straight onto it's head

Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you

In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Into my life you were injected
Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold show me your soul

Chorus
Sentimental Gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul

Verse 2
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Yes, I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You, my friend, need not be kneeling
Open up and start revealing
Trust in me my heart is sole
I need to see, show me your soul

Chorus

Verse 3
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be
Is just like you: A human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please, my friend, show me your soul

California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

A portrait she was bound to portray"

In my automobile

And then she tried to cop a feel

Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you

I said ""what's up?"" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped ""ooh that's tight""
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you

Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap ""snap""

The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here

We are all in favor of the open air

Receive it and believe it
And it's moaning and creating love

Tender titilations

I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes

Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off.

You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten

Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, lookout

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A.
The double D. A

Walk on your tip toes, don't try ""no doz""
You better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, and an eye on the plain clothes
'Cause you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid

Looks to me like you did
A little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid
Look out, kid

Chillin'em, thrillin'em, and red hot killin'em
Killin'em, I said killin' em

Come on, come on

Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, jump back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail

But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hang around the theatres
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters

Open up your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds i'll paint your brain
For in this song i do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip you'll ride for free
As we leave our trailer spots, outer space is not some pot
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
Space is king or so i sing, subway to venus
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw be my quest inside my grove
Cause what i've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

Do the dog on the ground

Head lights flash
Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open
Because i can not fall

No not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

Busted in two
Like a brittle stick
I can not drink
Because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth
I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream
I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk
I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive

All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give

Say it now because you never know

Devil may cry, devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage

Got room to spare
This is my time

I kissed her and hugged her
And I said good-bye

He was a cartoon long forsaken by the public eye
The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first
The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled: ""God's consolation prize!""

Everything you say comes back to you boomerang.

I ended up in jail, you wouldn't pay the bail.
I bit down all my nails. Remember what it could've been.
And now I'm on the street, got blisters on my feet. Got bugs in my hair. All because you didn't care.

A puppet of a string, I gave you everything.

You really screwed my mind. You wasted all my time. (Chorus)"

Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

I sprinkled cocaine on the floor
When no one was watching
I closed my eyes and I let myself sleep
Creeps and dirty bastards,
Demons waitin' by my bed
There's no choice or difference,
No one seems to notice

Sometimes I feel like screamin
Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

On automatic it's guaranteed hit

Mosquitoes are happy tonight

Even if just for one night

Troublemakers who attack
Mercenary, fight for anyone
Fight for money, fight for fun

Lisa got a haircut
Another one today
She stuck a pair of scissors up her butt
And now she cries all day

From a mohawk to a mullet
From shaved head to a bullet
She chops off her hair
But I don't really care
She had hair down to her underwear
She even grew a beard
But most guys weren't impressed with that
They all thought that was weird

She started changing colour
A new one everyday
Last week she had it purple
All the kids thought that was lame

And the guys in the front will always call her witty
But when you've got a hair cut that really looks that shitty
Its no doubt they'd probably spit on both your mittys

Spend my time in a cold jail cell.
Shootin' up poison, and livin' in hell.
And I never care what people think,
My history's written on me in tattoed ink.

And still life goes on;
Tracks on my arms.
And the number thirteen

What happens to me is my own affair.
If you don't like me, I really don't care.

And I don't do what people want me to do.

Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.

Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up.
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday.

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart,
A poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart... Yeah!

You know that life really takes it's toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much damn confusion before my eyes,
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives.

Be on Death Row, counting the days
They say the answers are blowin' in the wind
And to take yourself out would really be a sin
You just have to cope and start over again

Little child cries in his sleep
And life makes promises it can't keep
And then you had, had enough
You realize somehow, someway

And neon lights always gow hot.

Just give me all the strength
You've got"".

The North side of my town faced East and the east was facing South.

And now you dare to look me in the eye.
Those crocodile tears are what you cry.
It's a genuine problem you won't try
To work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by.

Substitute my Coke for gin.
Substitute you for my Mum,
At least I'll get my washing done.

I've seen it all, I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness in one little spark.
I've seen what I chose and I've seen what I need,
And that is enough, to want more would be greed.
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!

You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen
The light and the dark, the big and the small
Just keep in mind - you need no more at all
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
You've seen it all - there is no more to see!"

I slept with who I like

Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis

Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in devon

So skinned alive.

Life had been so unkind

You came along to claim it

Till your kiss helped me to name it
Now i'm no longer doubtful of what i'm living for
But if i make you happy i don't need to do more

Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway
I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad
Thinking I'm gay
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort
(of a guy)

But there's one thing I'm lacking
It's sexual experience
So I ask you, my sweetheart
Save me from this wilderness

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this

Where I come from, love is
Just a hole in the wall
And the steel mills ring out and generations
Heed the call
And the rain never stops and the skies are grey
And the chance of romance
Slim as a bright sunny day

This is partly the reason
I'm so overwhelmed and shy
Because your beauty, by contrast
Is gonna make a young man cry

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this
You don't know what it means to a boy from
A suburban home
To be left with a woman like you
Completely alone

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this

Nice place you've got here, babe
Never seen a house like this
Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch
All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke
(than me)

So here we are, the record's
Gotten stuck in the groove
My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this
I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey
Of a night like this

Rod Stewart,A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square,/r/rod+stewart/a+nightingale+sang+in+berkeley+square_10242778.html,"When two lovers meet in Mayfair, so the legends tell,
Songbirds sing; winter turns to spring.
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell.
I know such enchantment can be, ''cause it happened one evening to me:
That certain night, the night we met,
There was magic abroad in the air,
There were angels dining at the Ritz,
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
I may be right, I may be wrong,
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
The moon that lingered over London town,
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars;
It was such a romantic affair.
And, as we kissed and said 'goodnight',
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendezvous,
I still remember how you smiled and said,
""Was that a dream or was it true?""
Our homeward step was just as light
As the tap-dancing feet of Astaire
And, like an echo far away,
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
I know ''cause I was there,
That night in Berkeley Square."

Ran like the wind

Kinda dangerous, almost illegal

(Herman Hupfield)

This day and age we're living in
Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like third dimension

Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's theory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss,
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

(Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?

Oh, I'm singing it to you right now
Cause we're talking about
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date

Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory

And color tv, honestly
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy

She doesn't have to be a movie star
Cover of a magazine
She can work in a garage all day
In the evening some canteen

I'm tired of blind dates making silly mistakes
It's embarrassing
(Attractive female wanted)
I've had no complaints
But obviously you've guessed
No compliments
(Attractive female wanted)

Won't someone please answer my prayers
Before I'm old and grey
(Attractive female wanted)
I've been lonely too long
All of my family think I'm gay

She doesn't have to be a movie star
Cover of magazine
She can work in a garage all day
In the evening some canteen

Attractive female wanted
Active female wanted
I may get drunk stink like a skunk
But she'll look after me
(Attractive female wanted)
Put me to bed ease my aching head
And made fuss of me
You know what I gonna do
Think I'll write a letter
To Mr. Hugh Heffner confidentially
Dear Sir
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy"

I knew you when you had no one to talk to
Now you're moving in high society
Don't forget I know secrets about you
I used to think you were on my side
But now I'm no longer sure
I wish I knew what I know now before

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever

Baby jane don't it make you feel sad
Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
I've said goodbye so many times
The situation aint all that new
Optimisms my best defense
Ill get through without you

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
I wont be that dumb again
I know it's gotta last forever
When I fall in love again
I know it's gonna last forever

Baby jane I've said all I want to say
Go your own way don't think twice about me
Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own
So long darlin I'll miss you believe me
The lesson learned was so hard to swallow
But I know that I'll survive
I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
When I fall in love next time
I know it's gonna last forever

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some music on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ahh, but it's cold outside

C'mon baby

I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before

I've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that old out
Ahh, but it's cold outside

Baby it's cold outside

Brr its cold...
It's cold out there
Can't you stay awhile longer baby
Well... I really shouldn't... Alright

Make it worth your while baby
Ahh, do that again..."

That you're mine all mine
Take me to your river honey

Anywhere you go

Any words you talk

I won't let you down

And do today and there's gotta be a winner

Still had hair on a true to fear

Tonight I felt like suicide
Roll them dice and pour the wine
Shuffle them cards and deal them fine
Got nobody to kiss tonight
Nothing to lose but my appetite

Wanna be silly and sing and shout
Gotta get legless and fall about
Turn the music up nice and loud
Cheer me up don't bring me down
Gonna lose my job next week
Getting replaced by a silicone chip

I might have been a hero
But I chose to stay in bed
I might have been prime minister
but right now honey I'm better off dead

I might have been a hero
But I chose to stay in bed
I might have been prime minister
but right now honey I'm better off dead

Don't like the scenery don't like the set
Tear it all down and start again
Man keeps talking on the radio
Telling me what I don't wanna know
Radiation wars and layatril
If tax don't get ya then cancer will

I was born and raised the only son of a lawyer
till I was approximately the age of four or perhaps five
I lost both my mother and my father
Killed in a fire way up on the fourteenth floor
Struck down by the time I was ten by an illness
which robbed me of the sight of the morning sun
And that ain't all

A homeless child for the next five years
with my dog Clown by my side and my only friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I fought my way through school
Sound and touch the thing on which I could depend
And you know what the, the, the kids
down my street weren't too playful
And right then it seemed like the whole world picked on me
And ah yeah

I worked my fingers to the bone
Stretchin' hide for a boot man in Jersey Town
But then, but then I lost the last thing I had
When fate reared its ugly head and took my dog Clown
I wandered way up north found a girl that loved like a woman
Sixteen years old and felt like a woman
But, but, but, but, but what I'm trying to say is
God please don't take her away from me

I lost everything that I ever had
you kicked my name into the dirt
Tread my name into the dirt yeah

I lost everything that I ever had
you kicked my name into the dirt
What could I do

I never knew how much love could hurt me
But it never ever come my way before
No, no, no, no, no
I never knew how much love could hurt me
Good God it ain't never come my way before
Oh but, but you know what I'm trying to say
really what I'm trying to say is
God please don't take her away from me

Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me

So we fell in love and I tuned your heart
With my out of tune guitar
You were wonderful, you were mystical
And the envy of all of my friends
Seems like only yesterday
Under the stars on brighton beach

Oh what a time it was
What a time to be alive
Remember Janice and Jimmy
Kennedy and King
How they cried

I sang to you the songs of Lamb and Jack
You were Greta Garbo and I was Cadillac
And we played so hard and we loved so hard
Seemed we never ever slept
There were crazy days, there were wonderful days
And I loved you with all of my heart
Seems like only yesterday
Under the stars on brighton beach

Your daddy had plans that did not include me
And he won't stay away from your door
And I dreamed how I dreamed I could steal you away
To some far distant shore

Then early one morning
I awoke to find you gone
You wrote 'i love you baby
But it's time for me to move on'
And so my teenage heart laid scattered on the floor
I swear to God I could not have loved you anymore

And as I sit here the night, playing with my kids
Wondering where you are in this world
Did you find your man, are you happy now?
Do you ever stop and think about me

How I long for yesterday

She came to the party
In a leather number wrapped in chains
Investigation found
She was very fond of dropping names
So I signed her book
And drove her to her home
And she looked so hot
Started to come on strong
Then she said so candidly
As I was gettin' down on my knees
""I don't really mean to tease
But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy""
Camouflage
That's nothin' but camouflage

He was totally handsome
With a winning personality
Natural born leader
With connections in society
But late at night
Alone with just his wealth
He would stare in the mirror
And never see himself
He had a cadillac thirty foot long
He had a hit with every song
Sounded like something's wrong
Why, why, why, why, why

Camouflage
It ain't nothin' but camouflage
Camouflage
Ain't nothing but, nothin' but
Nothin' but camouflage

They were so well suited
With an ambience you can't ignore
But nobody realized
What went on behind closed doors
He had many affairs
But never felt fulfilled
She would hide her sadness
In alcohol and pills
She bottled everything up inside
He was too busy with his best friend's wife
They couldn't look each other in the eyes
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies

Camouflage
Just camouflage
Everywhere you go it's called camouflage
Some people hide behind camouflage

C-A-M-O-you-F-L-A-G-E

I signed her book, drove her to her home
But I didn't know what was goin' on

He had a cadillac thirty foot long
Had hits with every song

He had many affairs but never felt fulfilled
She was hidin' herself in some little purple pills

Why, why, why, why
Shy, shy, shy, shy
Lies, lies, lies, lies
Lies, lies, lies, lies

Camouflage, camouflage
Talkin' 'bout camouflage
Camouflage, bring it down

Sometimes I worry about you darlin'
You wear too much mascara
Too much eyeliner
Too much rouge, and it worries me
Camouflage, camouflage
Camouflage, talkin' 'bout camouflage"

We can't play this game anymore
But can we still be friends
Things just can't go on like before
But can we still be friends

We had something to learn
Now it's time for the wheel to turn
Grains of sand one by one
Before you know it it's all gone

Let's admit we made a mistake
But can we still be friends
Heartbreak's never easy to take
But can we still be friends
It's a strange sad affair
Sometimes seems like we just don't care
Don't waste time feeling hurt
We've been through hell together

Where do we go from here

We can't play this game anymore
But can we still be friends
Things just can't go on like before
But can we still be friends

We awoke from our dream
Things are not what they always seem
Memories linger on
It's like a sweet, sad, old song

Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here

I can't play this game anymore
Can we still be friends
Things just can't go on like before

And now I just wanna be friends

Called the record and company man

I was young and I was keen
With the devil in my stream
As I hollowed at an old blues tune

We can't sign your sign
'Cause we're doper than the mole
That you had on your nose and your clothes
I should thank you gentleman
For this life that you brought me
Now move on down the road

I remember how I used to say

They can't stop me now
The world is waiting
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd
They can't stop me now
The tide is turning
I'm gonna make you proud

Well nothing was tough
But I couldn't get enough
Out this rhythm and blues I crave

I was singing in the parks
Singing in the clubs
Then along came agony

All the things he said to me
And all the things I heard
I had a point to prove

I will climb this mountain
With this god given gift
If it's the last thing that I do

And I remember thinking

[Chorus:] x2
They can't stop me now
The world is waiting
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd
They can't stop me now
The tide is turning
I'm gonna make you proud

[Bridge:]
Born to ramble
Born to sing
In a new world of rock n roll
Woman in particular
Feel my heart will cry
And if I hold my song

Thanks for the faith
Thanks for the patience
Thanks for the helping hand
Thanks for the love
Thanks for the guidance
Thanks for the talk and pride

They can't stop me now
The world is waiting
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd
They can't stop me now

See, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one room shack and slept 10 other children
Beside me, we hardly had enough food or room to sleep

It was hard times, I needed some thing
To ease my troubled mind

Listen, my father didn't know the meaning of work
He disrespected mama and treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job that I never did find
Depressed and down hearted, I took to cloud nine

I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine
Listen one more time, I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine

Folks down there tell me
They say, ""Give your self a chance
Son, don't let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race""

Where only the strongly survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie
It ain't even safe no more to walk the streets
At night, I'm doin' fine on cloud nine

Let me tell you about cloud nine, cloud nine
You can be what you want to be

You ain't got no responsibilities
And every man, every man is free

You're a million miles from reality, reality
I wanna say upper, higher, upper, up, up and away
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine

With one of them Walkman's on her head.

And I said to myself
She's destined to be mine

In rush hour or subway, in a grocery store

She lives in one of those brown-stones with the guard outside
And the limousines and the Rolls Royces coming and going

When a cowgirl passed my sights
And I took a look in the mirror
To make sure that my head was screwed on
I was feeling rejected
But I wasn't going home
In a moment of a rash decision
I threw myself right on the floor
I did a backflip and somersault

Everyday I get up
And drag myself out of bed
While you're still sleeping
On your tummy
With your long legs spread
Call me a copy cat
Dressed
Kiss you good-bye
I'm like a lion in winter
I don't want to say good-bye
I'm trying to pull
On my socks
You get me horny and hot, darling
That's why I'm late on the job

(1) You're delicious
You're delicious, babe
You're delicious

Just keep on doing
What you are doing
Doing
Doing to me
Ah, yeah

You're like a cold beer, darling
On a long-hot summer's day
Yes, you are
You're the words I'm planning
Five part Chekov play
You make a rich man poor
And make a blind man see again
You're......
As hard as diesel train
And while I'm driving to work
You spill all over my shirt
You're just a wonderful flirt

[Repeat (1)]

""The Old man"" line ain't gonna
Take you from my side

I've had the new caviar
Fort Wall and pink champagne
I've seen the Mona Lisa
Drank the wine in France and Spain
I've smelled the rose of Finnland
Tulips of Amsterdam
I've heard the crew line coal train
The bells of Notre dame
But you know what honey
You fill me up
With desire
You've set my soul aflying
Lifted me down to the wire

Gimme one time

Please, bass guitar

There are times to remember
And times that I wish to forget
Our time together was tinged with love and regret
Oh, my girl
My sweet, sweet little girl

[Chorus]
Didn't I try to tell ya that life was for living?
Oh, didn't I?
And wasn't I the guy who said 'stay away from that tribe'?
Oh, wasn't I?
And didn't I try to tell you 'that's stuffs gonna kill ya'?
Oh, didn't I?
But you thought it was cool and I was just an old fool
Oh, look at ya

[Verse 2]
You left home for the city with Hollywood stars in your eyes
Now your mother, God bless her, cries herself to sleep every night
Oh my girl, my sweet innocent girl

[Chorus]
Didn't I search the streets for the beggars, pimps and cheats?
Oh, didn't I?
And didn't I try to guide you to a baptism of fire?
Oh, didn't I?
And didn't I try to warn ya 'bout that folk in California?
Oh, didn't I?
But you said 'daddy, please don't worry, I got friends out there who love me'
Now look at ya

[Bridge: Bridget Cady]
Oh baby, come back home, we can work this out
There is no blame
I wanna hold you close and stroke your hair and share your pain

[Chorus]
Didn't I do the best for you, try to make you stay in school?
Didn't I?
Once I was your hero but I went from ten to zero
Oh, didn't I? Now listen
For a roll on the dice you nearly paid the ultimate price
Oh, didn't ya?
Now I stand by your bedside, watching you fight for you life

[Outro]
Where's the innocence? (Where's the innocence? )
Where's the future? (Where is the future?)
Where the beauty? (Ooo)
Where's the promise? (Where is the promise?)

And times that I wish to forget"

Found my love by the gaswork croft
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I heard a siren from the dock
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the sulfured wind
Dirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old town

We're goin' to take a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
And we'll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town

You phone the airlines I'll call a cab

Just tell your mother that you're staying with friends
Cuz I know that you're my best friend's girl
But it's the weekend I don't give a hell

I'll bring the red wine you bring the ludes
Your mother's doctor must be quite a dude
We'll hang the 'Don't Disturb' outside our door
I'm gonna rock you till your pussy's sore

Oh my sweet Diana I can't wait for the manana
There's a hotel down in Mexico just made for two
But I don't think you trust me and I can't say I blame you
My reputation precedes me you ain't never gonna leave me

Soon as we get there I'll go check in
Mr and Mrs Smith of Abilene
You get naked honey I'll get down
I'm gonna chase you around
And 'round and 'round and 'round
You say you can't stand monotony
I say what happened to fidelity
Dirty weekend made for two
Just me and you honey
I wanna love that can last for ages

Don't want to make your two big brothers brothers annoyed

The sun's shining on my back and it hurts (child)
The fm station plays another bad 45
And it's been so long since I had a good time
It's been so long since I had a good time

Never wrecked my head on a bandstand
In the trombone or clarinet line
When I come in heat on Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras
When those for a cryin' just stay behind in the bar
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time
Yeah it's been so long since I had a good time

I'm gonna lose control of my powers
I might even lose my trousers
Smash some glass, act like trash if I want
Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time
This prodigal man from Dixieland needs a good time
Right now, show me a good time right now

You better take it while you can
You gotta get it while you can

And when the Man Upstairs he calls me
He'll say ""It's your turn son to come""
Don't play the blues down in old Toulouse for me
Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street
And tell all of my friends that I had a good time
Open up the sky won't you ride me high
Let's have a good time
And if I'm late at heaven's gate blame a good time
And when the angels sing I will join in
Let's have a good time really

I took my luck, I didn't give a fuck, I had a good time
Tell all my friends only all my best to have a good time
Goodbye"

And when I see them boys
You know their two-tone suits
They're all unimportants

And we talk all night
About our wealth situation
At a rock'n' Roll dive
We don't reach no conclusion
So the conversation turns to wise girls
And more pearls

And I painted it black
There's five in the front seat
And the rest in the back
Cruise up and down Sunset
And watch all the jailbait roll by

Hangin' round my neck

Put me on a train
In the pouring rain
Say farewell but don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind

How I miss her now
In my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

And well drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the emerald isle

And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Spent some time feelin inferior
Standing in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways
But I came out looking just the same

Daddy said, son, you better see the world
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing don't lose your head
To a woman thatll spend your bread
So I got out

Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the left bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peacful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused
I moved on

Down in rome I wasn't getting enough
Of the things that keeps a young man alive
My body stunk but I kept my funk
At a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate indeed I was
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear I better get out of here
For the vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no no

I moved right out east yeah!
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shangai lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just aint natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people I was glad I found her
Oh yeah I was glad I found her

I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats
Cause it's all been said before
Make the best out of the bad just laugh it off
You didn't have to come here anyway
So remember, every picture tells a story don't it"

It's not time to make a change,
Just relax, take it easy.

There's so much you have to know.
Find a girl, settle down,
If you want you can marry.
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy,
To be calm when you've found something going on.
But take your time, think a lot,
Why, think of everything you've got.
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not.

How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again.
It's always been the same, same old story.
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.
I know I have to go.

It's not time to make a change,
Just sit down, take it slowly.
You're still young, that's your fault,
There's so much you have to go through.
Find a girl, settle down,
If you want you can marry.
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.

All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it.

By the time you read this letter
I'll be outta your life
Gone forever more
But guess I'll survive
I'm gonna leave my records
And a forwarding address
Ain't you glad honey
That I'm offa your chest

You said you wanted Paris
Rome 'n' St. Tropez
Perfume by Chanel
And a ring by Cartier
But I gave you headaches
With my old fashioned ways
But that's all irrelevant
To what I'm tryin' to say
I'm a fool for you baby
Pride won't let me stay
I'm a fool for you honey
And I'll come back any day
Guess I'll always love you all my life

You can keep your Streisands
Bardots and Lorens
You're my everything
But now you're my end
It may be over
But just before I go
I can make a new start
But I can't mend a broken heart

So when I read about you
In all the national press
On the arm of so and so
I may get depressed
Cause I tried to love you
But didn't fit in
I came on the dust
I'll leave on the wind

I'm a fool for you baby
My pride won't let me stay
I'm a fool for you honey
I'll come back any day
I'm a fool for you baby
I don't care what your friends say
I'm a fool for you honey
And that's the way I'll stay
I guess I'll always love you all my life"

Can I introduce myself
I'm a man of panache and wealth
Sound in mind, body, soul and health
Why I wanna kill my wife
I have the urge to take her life

Been planing for years to get rid of her
Not divorce I really do mean to kill her
She's so full of useless information and trivia
That's why I wanna kill my wife
I have a duty to take her life

Her stupid friends get right up my nose
They all wear annoyingly sensible clothes
They're all so bleeding grandiose,
You know why I should kill her friends
They're all driving Mercedes Benz.

He'll escape down into Mexico
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
He'll laugh and sing and he won't work anymore.

Should I string her up or strangle her in bed
Suffocate that little venomous head
Or perhaps I'll just whip her to death
Listen do me a favor kill my wife

Do it for mankind take her life
Or should I act quite cold and deliberate
Or maybe blow out her brains with a bullet
They'll think suicide they won't know who done it
I'm gonna kill my wife I'm really gonna take her life.

He'll escape down into Mexico
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
He'll laugh and sing and he won't work anymore

The moment of truth has come
I'm at the point of no return
I've got my hands locked round her throat
I'm about to kill my wife
Don't stop me now I'm gonna take her life

Can't help myself I'm gonna take her life

Should I stray to the house on the hill

Remember me to the one who lives there
She was once a true love of mine

And if you're goin' when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling wind

Would you see for me that her hair's hanging long
That it rolls and flows all down her breasts
See for me that her hair's hanging long
'Cause that's the way I remember her best

But I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So if you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline

And she'll always be a true love of mine
And I never, never, never, never give her up"

Amanda, for a drive
She was only seventeen
He just lived to see her smile
Their commitment to each other
Burned like a forest fire

Otis on the radio singing ""Stand By Me""
As a trooper pulled them over
And said Jimmy where you been
Someone matching your description
Has just robbed the liquor store
Amanda said ""He's been with me""
But they weren't listening anymore

Down at Precinct Number Five
They questioned Jimmy through the night
The sheriff said ""He's gotta stand trial""
Armed robbery is the charge
Amanda said ""This cannot be""
Gonna stay right here until you set him free

And I love him
Here to eternity
Forever
Unto eternity
Oh God gave me something
I must hold on to
Gonna hold on him
No matter what you do

The old courthouse was crowded
As the judge reviewed the case
In a year of re-election
He was desperate to impress
Innocent or guilty
He saw an opportunity
To send Jimmy down for life
To the Penitentiary

Disbelief and anger
As they dragged him away
In a cell below the courthouse
They beat him like a slave
But his use of martial arts
Struck a blow for liberty
Felled a guard with a fist of iron
And killed him instantly

All the press surrounded Amanda
Coming down the courthouse steps
Pleading for her young man's life
And in a moment seen by millions
She bowed her head and cried
Show my man some mercy
He's the father of my child

I love him
Here to eternity
Forever
Unto eternity
Oh God gave me something
I must hold on to
Gonna hold on him
No matter what you do
I love him
Here to eternity

Jimmy Doyle appeared again
In a second public trail
For the murder of a prison guard
They sentenced him to die
But Amanda with her long red hair
Made one last plea
As the court fell into silence
She cried out desperately

This man of mine is innocent
As one day I shall prove
It's an open case of self defense
All this circumstantial evidence
You place before your court
Has robbed me of my husband
Forget I will not

I love him
Here to eternity
Forever
Unto eternity
Oh goodbye my Jimmy
'Til we meet again
In a better world than this
I swear I'll clear your name
Cause I love you
Here to eternity"

I could feet the whole world turn round.

Burning with desire growing higher and higher.
Like on a funny fair big wheel stopping when you are to topping,
The you feel it dropping
Rising and heaven falling down.
And I could feet the whole world turn round underneath me.
I could feet the whole world turn round.
I took my breath as though I've been running.
Quite completely stunning, holy, overcoming.
And in a funny way it seemed frightening.
Tension and a hardening
Thunder and the lightning
And I've grown the singer who wrote that song.

I messed around with all the rules

I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had it sussed
Valentinos all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But boy we broke some hearts
In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb blank faces stare back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of the night
Creeping home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
and blamed it on the wine

Chorus:

I was only joking my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I
I could never win

Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
are slowly wearing thin
Susy baby you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

(Chorus)

Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone
'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity
For the whole damn world to see

Quietly now while I turn a page
Act one is over without costume change
The principal would like to leave the stage
The crowd don't understand"

To cool you in some leafy glade

But I wonder if I'll remember these few precious things

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Your love is fading I can feel your love fading
Woman it's fading away from me
'cause your personal touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I fooled myself long as I can
I can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Oh honey I'm losing you
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere
Oh I'm losing you

I can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be up and gone
Ooh I'm losing you
It's all over your face someone's takin' my place
Could it be that I'm losing you

When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see
Oh lord I'm losing you
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried girl
'cause that face doesn't belong to me

Your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin'
Oh away from me
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere
Ooh I'm losing you

I don't wanna lose you
But I know I'm gonna groove you
Oh lord I'm losing you, and I'm a losin' you

How I won you I should never ever know

When you came into view

All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh

That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you care
For a cunning cottage that we could share
The world will pardon my mush

Couldn't even see the floor

If not for you, baby, I'd lay awake all night
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through
But it will not be new if not for you.

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
And you know it's true.

If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine, feelin fine
Waitin here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am.

In the days between the hours
Ivory towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads in to the air
I don't care if I ever know
There I go

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds wont leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
Did someone bow their head?
Did someone break the bread?
Good people are in bed
Before nine oclock.

On the pad before my eyes
Paper cries, tellin lies
The promises you gave
From the grave of a broken heart
Hmm

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin wine, feelin fine
Waitin here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am. Oh.

I sit here in my lonely room

Don't push your love too far
You know your wounds wont even leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
And don't you forget what I say

Hoo, hoo"

There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain
Oh these places had their meanings
With lovers and friends, I still recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one, compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love, as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I've loved you more"

Is coloured blue on blue
We wanted more than we could give
We couldn't see it through

You won't believe these words from me
But still they're mine to say
I will always love you
In my own crazy way

I tried to keep my sanity
By being someone else
Someone that you could hold on to
I only fooled myself

I knew the part, but in my heart
The role I couldn't play
But I will always love you
In my own crazy way

I know I didn't do the little things
That could make a woman's heart sing
forgive me
And darling if I brought you any pain
I'm trying to explain
In my heart, I was always true

The memories of you and me
Are written on the wind
And sometimes, girl, I'd give the world
To do it all again

And if you need to call me
I won't be far away
I will always love you
In my own crazy way"

Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Did you think I'd take it sitting down
And let you walk all over me
Thought you knew me much better than that
I keep much better company

With your lawyers and your two timing friends
I guess you know who I mean
Your detectives and your private eyes
Could never win me back again

Just where did it get ya
What satisfaction was had
You kicked the shit right in my face
Is that all the thanks I get

You said we made such a pretty pair
Living in harmony
I'm sorry honey but I disagree
It seemed more like a comedy

Just look how you lied girl
That judas right by your side
He hung you up so you cut me right down
Is that all the thanks I get

Guess I'll find me a brand new girl
That wont take too very long
There's so many floatin round this town
Waitin by the telephone
And if you want me I'll be in the bar
Back into my usual ways
Or on the corner with the rest of the boys
You and I were just a breath away
It was great while it lasted
But oh lord it turned nasty
You didn't give me one chance to explain
Well is that all the thanks I get

I can't forget you

I know your profile and I know the way you kiss
Just the thing I miss
On a night like this
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation
With all my heart my heart is here for you to take
Why should I quake
I'm not awake

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around, and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen, might never be mean
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

I felt the light before but I let it slip away,
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day.

Its not the spotlight, it's not the camra light,
Its not the street lights of some old street of dreams.
It aint the moonlight, not even the sunlight,
But I've seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean.

Some times I try to tell myself the light was never real,
Just a fantasy that used to be, the way I used to feel.
But you and I know better, even though it's been so long,
If your memory really serves you well, you'll never tell me no wrong.

Its not the spotlight, it's not the camra light,
Its not the streetlights of some old street of dreams.
It aint the moonlight, not even the sunlight,
But I've seen it shining in your eyes you know what I mean.

So if I ever feel the light again shining down on me,
I don't have to tell you what a welcome it would be.
I felt the light before but I let it slip away,
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day.

Its not the spotlight, it's not the camra light,
Its not the streetlights of some old street of dreams.
It aint the moonlight, not even the sunlight,
But I've seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean."
Rod Stewart,It's Over,/r/rod+stewart/its+over_21059258.html,"The congregation sang
We knelt and prayed
As we stood before god
On that beautiful day
The church bells rang
And the champagne flowed
As our friends gather round
For the wedding photo
But here we are barely I've years on
An' our whole world fallin' apart

All the plans we we had together
Up in smoke and gone for ever
Poisoned by the lawyer's letter
It's over
I don't want our kids to suffer
Can we talk to one together
You were once my light, my lover

Inseparable were we
With a beezer in our sails
Now I feel a chill wind
On the marriage that fell
As I pray as I divided
They've taken their sides
Now they'll all sit back
And watch the circus arrive
I don't stand here tryin'to focus the blame
But I'm hurtin' deep down in inside

All the pain an' all all the grievin'
When did we stop believin'
Too late now to stop the bleedin'
It's over
What's the sense in pointin' fingers
Who the saint an' who the sinner
They're ain't gonna be a winner
It's over
Oh my dear, what happened to us?
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?

What's the use in keep on fightin'?
All the tears, all the cryin'
Why did you keep denyin'?
It's over
In all the time I throught I knew ya
Don't forget our children's future
I would do whatever suits ya
Oh ye-ah!

I was dreaming of a mobile
That couldn't be mine not without lyin'
Was I feeling kind a silly
When I stepped in soakin' beer down the cola machine
Oh, stayin' seventeen
Well she claimed she was a killer
And she owned a flood lit villa
A little aways from the main highway
Oh take me way down yonder

She was tall, thin and tarty
And she drove a Maserati
Faster than sound
I was heaven bound
Although I must have looked a creep
In my army surplus jeep
Was I being too bold
Before the night could get old
No, no, no, no
She proved me so wrong

Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits
In front of your eyes, just to get you tied
Ah but not my little Bella 'cause I did not have to tell her
I'd rather you go with the morning sun, she made me so tired

She took me way, way, away down yonder
Till I was gone with the morning sun on my back
Gotta get on back there soon as I can
Take me there
And I miss the girl so bad
She broke my heart
Gotta get on back there soon as I can
I miss the girl, I miss the girl, I miss the girl so bad
I was a lot better off"

You bore my child then I left you aside
I don't expect you to forgive

But fade it may Jo I can say

Here's a song I sing for you about a girl that I once knew
Julia
She lived in a great big house with golden gates where servants bowed
For Julia

[Verse 2]
Unashamed I'd sit outside and wait for hours
Hoping that she'd climb down from her ivory towers
This beautiful girl as pretty as any flower had a hold on me

[Chorus]
Upstairs in my lonely room I would dream of being cool
With Julia
I lived in obsessive bliss carefully planning my first kiss
Off Julia

[Verse 3]
One day I was feeling awfully brave and asked her
If she'd like to come on a date, I just had to
She bent down and gently kissed my face and said oh someday
Oh my god how I loved this girl
But no one ever said that love could burn

[Chorus]
Waiting by the phone for days for a call that never came
From Julia
But love is cruel and has no wings but I still hear angels sing
For my Julia

[Verse 4]
I remember being overwhelmed by her prettiness
If only she would look my way I might be in business
To tell the truth she didn't even know I existed, Julia

[Chorus]
Summer took her pretty clothes, winter came in grey and snow
Oh Julia
And I found out she'd moved away, her best friend said to the north country
Julia

[Verse 5]
Now all this happened many years ago my friend
Regrettably there is no happy end, oh no
She was 14, I was only 10, oh my Julia"

Nobody feels any pain,
Tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Ev'rybody knows
That baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman,
She makes love just like a woman,
And she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend,
Oh I believe that I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess
That baby can't be blessed
Till she finds out she's like all the rest,
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls.

She aches just like a woman, yes she does
She takes just like a woman, yes she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes she does
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long time curse a' hurts,
But you know honey what's worse
Is this pain in here,
I can't stay in here,
Ain't it clear.

Oh I just don't fit,
I believe that it's time for us to quit.
When we meet again
And introduced as friends
Please don't let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.

You fake just like a woman, yes she does
And make love just like a woman, yes she does
Then you ache just like a woman, yes she does
But you break just just like a little girl, break like a girl

And bring your shine right wisdom
Darlin' over here
Your Gaelic humor
And your pious smile

Make us all rich healthy and fine

And a horse that wins all the time

Kind of makes you wonder

Hot jamaican sand beneath our feet

I said I did impersonations would you like to see
Turned around to buy her one more round

Then suddenly she disappeared
Like I feared with another guy
Love always seems to let me down
Can be found anywhere around

The carnival had passed
And my heart was beating fast
All these married women, it aint fair
Nervously I said would you like to come to bed
A cold silence pierced the evening air
Instantly she recognized my insecurities
Changing subjects quickly I agreed

Then suddenly she disappeared
Like I feared with another guy, oo baby

Can be found anywhere around
Nowhere around

The tourist had all gone, winters coming on
The hotel chambermaid didn't seem to care
Sharing a pina colada we broke into laughter
Ill never know how we made it up the stairs
We spent the night together
And she woke up in my arms
Kissed me tenderly and said goodbye

When’s that boy of yours gonna be coming home
And when I hear the bells ringing down at the school yard
Kinda reminds me of when you were young

You know you gotta polarize your concentration
I know that girl of yours gonna understand
Never underestimate the power of affection
When you got the world in the palm of your hands

Don’t go looking for the pot of gold
Or the light miracle mile
Hundred has lost in your home backyard
Be talking it could take a while

Walk down the aisle, with that big old smile
Collect your diploma with your head up high
Study with your soul, 10 weeks left on
We’ll always remember, let the good times roll

Try and see the sunset in the far away land
Tell her you love her don’t be afraid
And keep every promise that you ever made
And love the life you live

Love the life you live
Live the life you love

You gotta love it
You gotta love it
Make the most of it
You only got one chance

Love the life you live..."
Rod Stewart,Long Ago And Far Away,/r/rod+stewart/long+ago+and+far+away_20692073.html,"(Music by Jerome Kern / Lyrics by Ira Gershwin)

Dreary days are over
Life's a four-leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for
Long ago comes true

Long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast but now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Chills run up and down my spine, Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you"

Come on

[Verse 1]
See the line    all around the block
Watch all the pretty girls    lookin' vogueishly hot
Right on time, here come all the dudes
They work the room and validate their cool
(Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
It's not submission; it's just the look in her eyes
There's no decision; it's just the look in her eyes

[Verse 2]
The joint is jumping;   the DJ's settin' 'em free
Johnny from Brooklyn meets Marianne from Queens
They hit it off, he has all the moves
She's fascinated, but leaves him lookin' for clues

[Chorus]
She's not pretending; it's just the look in her eyes
She's not suggesting; it's just the look in her eyes

[Bridge]
He leads her by the hand
He says, ""Dance, little sister, dance""
Is it one of those nights where the stars and the moon collide?
(Oh yeah)
Don't be fooled by the look in her eyes
Take your time

[Verse 3]
The sun is rising, he says, ""I'll walk you home""
He's got the sweet talk,   she's in her comfort zone
He's so smooth, he always gets the girl
But she ain't fooled, her mother taught her well

[Chorus]
It's not submission; it's just the look in her eyes
There's no decision; it's just the look in her eyes
She's not pretending; it's just the look in her eyes
She's not suggesting; it's just the look in her eyes"

Hey baby
You've Been On My Mind Tonight
I'm So lonely
I just had to sit down and write
I spent all yesterday
Trying to figure out what I'm gonna say
A letter from the heart
Is so hard to start baby
How's your mama, how's the wheather
How's that son of mine, yeah.

Hey baby
Been a long time since we made love
I'm stone cold, the bed's hard
And the work is tough
I'm never gonna leave you again
This job ain't worth the pain
No money in the world
Ain't worth being away from you
Ooh baby I don't sleep
Without you by my side, listen

I'm in love with you woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
And it's so much more than that
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

Hey baby
You don't know what you've done for me
I'm so happy
As any man can deserve to be
I was living in a life of sin
God knows what a mess I was in
So glad you found me
I ain't getting any younger
Hey baby I just hope
It ain't all a dream

I'm in love with you woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
And it's so much more than that
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you

I miss you baby
I miss you too

I miss your laughing eyes
I miss our baby crying
I wanna lay you out
And kiss you all over
I'm coming home real soon
Be ready cause when I do
I'm gonna make love to you
Like fifteen men.

I'm lost in you and I love it
I'm lost in you and I love it
I'm lost in, I'm lost in
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in, I'm lost in
I'm lost in you
And I just love it

Darling I hate to tell you but I think I'm catching a cold
Put another chair on the fire bring the bottle over here
I feel I'm getting old
I like your laugh and a hot romance
and your orn'ry sense of humor
but if it rains again like it did today
I'm gonna have to leave a little bit sooner

Got to get me some South America sun

Honey don't even ask me if you can come along
Down at the border you need to be older
and you sure don't look like my daughter
Your ridiculous age, start a state outrage
and I'll end up in a Mexican jail
Darling please don't cry you know I wouldn't tell you no lie

Look over there
Oh my God don't look now
but it appears to be raining again
Get upstairs pack my book of prayers
Honey hurry I'm catching pneumonia
I gotta move while I'm in the mood
or I'll disappear into that wall
Darling please don't curse
it really couldn't be any worse
Say I'm a sun fanatic but it's dark in your attic
and your cat sleeps over my head

I know I'm not a football star
but I wanna little better than that
So I'm much obliged for the pure white ride
and a cup of tea every morning
I'll say goodbye, look your man in the eye
you know I wouldn't tell you no lie

So after all, I'll see you in the fall
on a brand new day, brand new way
Goodbye honey, goodbye honey
Goodbye honey, it ain't funny
Goodbye honey, I know it ain't funny"

I’ve had bad dreams
Too many times
To think that they
Don’t mean much anymore

The fine times have gone
And left my sad home
And the friends who once cared
Just walk out my door

Love has no pride
When I call out your name
Love has no pride
When there’s no one left to blame
And I would give anything
To see you again

I’ve been alone
Too many nights
To think that you
Could come back again

But I’ve heard you talk
He’s crazy to stay
But this love hurts me so
I don’t care what they say

Love has no pride
When I call out your name
Love has no pride
When there’s no one left to blame
And I would give anything
To see you again

[Bridge:]
And if I could buy your love I’d truly try my friend
And if I could pray by prayers would never never end
But if you want me to beg I’ll fall down on my knees
Asking for you to come back I’d be pleading for you to come back
Begging for you to come back to me once again

[Chorus:]
Love has no pride
When I call out your name
Love has no pride
When there’s no one left to blame
And I would give anything
To see you again

Holds a lot of rain

You are young, I know, but even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I really learned a lot, I really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts... Ooh, ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

And find somewhere to hide
Can't I knock down your door
And drag myself inside
Ill light your candles baby
And maybe I'll light your life

You come to every night
This ever changing love
Is pushing me too far
I feel the need to reach you
Right now wherever you are

Wake up maggie I think I got something to say to you
Its late september and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddys cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin hand
Oh maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Oh my little darling you’re the rock on which I stand
You’re my strength and wisdom, the soul behind a man

Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks,
That's what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year, oh maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

Yeah, she sits alone,
Most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he's busy,
But she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her."" ""No way""

I say, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Right, right into jail.""
Oh, no, I'd better keep her. I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee.
Than makin' whoopee
Then makin' whoopee
Then makin' whoopee

Except of course my steel guitar

Noticing your face was thin and pale

Could never, never change your mind

What is known as old Manhattan

Right here in town!

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through
The zoo!

It's very fancy
On old Delancy
Street you know.
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro.

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.

The great big city's a wonderous toy
Just made for a girl and boy.
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy!

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the whiles
And starve together dear, in Chiles

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show they say
We both may see it close, some day

The city's glamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy!"

Tonight

I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile

There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you,
No matter what my friend's missing

And if I can't bridge this distance,
Stop this heartbreak Overload

Here is a story that is bound to amuse ya
(about a fine young couple startin' out in life)
A dedicated husband and a real fine worker
(who lived for his children and his beautiful wife)
But one night in Dallas at a computer convention
(he got so loaded he could hardly stand)
Woke up with a heavy head and a strange girl beside him
(returned home a worried guilty man)
But inside his coat his wife found a note
It said ""Thanks for the good time Can I see you again""
She asked him ""Why oh why"" Tears rollin' down her eyes
""would you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory

Packed up all her bags and returned to her mother
(Two small children clinging to her dress)
Hurt and disillusioned but never down hearted
(she picked up the pieces of her broken life)
And meanwhile back in Boston the culprit lie thinkin'
(trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine)
Fired from his job and missing his children
(he didn't care one way if he lived or died)
Oh what a crying shame nobody else to blame
For one night of pleasure he had given her pain
Oh how it was so hard to climb so far to give it all up
For a moment of glory, glory

As the months rolled by and accusations fly
The bloodsuckin' lawyers know they're in for a kill
The gold war begins she's takin' off her rings
Close friends take sides while the waters are still

Phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment
(it was his little boy Johnny and his sister Beth)
They said ""Daddy we miss you would you talk to Mommy""
(a line of communication he had sadly missed)
She said ""Now don't get me wrong this is where you belong""

It's obvious darlin'
you've become allergic to me
Are my trousers to wide
Do I drink and get mean
Is my demeanor that embarrassing
Are my jokes obsolete
Or is it my sweat that's no longer sweet
I work hard in the factory
to keep you in luxury
to which you've grown accustomed and you love
Lately you don't light my fuse
Is my fan belt coming loose
Punch me in the Bible baby please
Move me, move me, move me when I'm home
Why don't you move me, move me
move me when I'm home

Sometimes baby I awake in the night
I reach out to touch you
but I'm scared you might bite
A little emotion wouldn't be out of place
Wake up and love me put a smile on my face
Otis Redding said it best ""try a little tenderness""
Aretha wanted more ""Respect""
Give me just a little touch
that ain't really asking much
your dog gets more attention than I do
Move me, move me, move me when I'm home
Come on and move me, move me, move me when I'm home

Sometimes I wonder if you'll miss me at all
emotionally independent, as hard as a wall
You're so wrapped up in your own little world
your old time religion is your lunch with the girls
When I'm standing next to you even in a crowd
I might as well be on another planet
Tell me what I've done to you to justify this ridicule
if it's over why don't we forget it
Move me, soothe me, move me, rock me
move me when I'm home
Why don't you move me, love me, move me, rock me
move me when I'm home
Why don't you rock me, move me, love me, soothe me

Why don't you rock me, rock me, move me, soothe me

Oh, yeah, I know, I know, I know

I remember
When I was only seventeen
The bohemian poet
And dosciple of the streets
Or was I just a little kid
Searching for identity in '63

Heard it on the radio
On a cold December night
It came burning down the air waves
Like a savior's shinin' light
All the way from the you. S. A.
Across the Atlantic far away
The magic came

The house began to rock
With Cupid and his bow
The hootchy kootchy man's
Lonely harp began to blow
Little did I know that
Nothing in my life
Would ever be the same

Stayed up all night
Playin' every 45
Tryin' to sound like you
Strummed my guitar in bed
Till my fingers bled
Tryin' to play like you

(1) Thank you, Sam, thank you, Otis
Thank you Muddy
For the sounds you made
Thank you, Sam, thank you, Otis
Thank you, Muddy
For the times we shared
And they carry on

I saw Otis back in 1965
Tears in my eyes
As he sung ""These Arms Of mine""
But angels needed a soul man
For the celestial blues band
They took him home (took you home)

Oh, what I'd give to see
That red mohair suit and hear
""Dock Of The Bay""
Or Sam in his two tone
Singin' ""Bring It On Back Home""
What a show that would be

[Repeat (1)]

If I sound sentimental
It's because this blue-eyed soul boys
Got so much respect
My gratitude to you
Runs deep, proud and true
I will never forget

For the sounds you made
Thank you, Sam, thank you, Otis

Much more than I deserve
And I don't wanna ever let her go

Everything she says
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups and all her downs

She's every breath I take
She's got a hold on me

Saying come out on the town

And I tell them I say
Without her by my side

And I don't care if it shows

My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Told me so well you knew

To never give up on a dream.

No force on earth could stop you run.

Never never give up on a dream.

Shadows fall, daylight dies,
Freedom never got a place to hide.
Search forever photo finish line
But never give up on your dream.

Crazy notions fill your head,
You gotta break all the records set.
Push yourself until the end
But don't you ever give up on your dream.

To be free, to be free, to be free.

You, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
Day and night, night and day, why is it so

That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

A friend of mine called up said ""I finally had some luck
Could I have a minute of your time
I met a girl last night and try as I might
I can't get her off of my mind
She walked through the room and right then I knew
I finally found somebody for me
But to tell you the truth I don't know what to do
should I go ahead or wait and see""

I said ""Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
than to never love at all""

Now I'm the kind of guy who's normally quite shy
On romance I don't know a thing
But when she led me to the floor I'd never danced before
Suddenly my feet had wings
I know that she wants me I want her too
but I'm so confused I can't think straight
I feel so alive but on the other side
should I go ahead or should I wait

I said ""Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
than to never love at all""

So when the music starts to flow from your hearts
like the coming of an early spring
when the river starts to flow between you soul to soul
may no man ever come between
Die in her arms if she wants you to
Be thankful for each passing day
When your eyes collide let your spirits fly
and pray to God it's here to stay

And I said ""Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all""

Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all

than to never, never love at all
Ain't it better to lose in love than never love at all"

Got a fear of death that creeps on every night.
I know I won't die soon, but then again I might,
Water down the drain, I'm wasting away.
Doctors can't help the ghost of a man that's me

Water down the drain goes to the sea,
The pattern of my life keeps a-haunting me.
Moisture from the ocean fills the sky,
Come on down to the ground as the time goes by
I never found out the reason why
My parents had to lie
About the place that I was born
Or from my hometown I was torn
At the tender age of four
I was livin' by homemade law"

You read it when the wardens had a second laugh

Or crushed in the path of a moving elevator, elevator

Had a dream just as plain as you and I
Saw the morning sun on a woodland in the spring
Still hear the echo crashing through the trees
Oh when I saw you down I fell upon my knees
You and I we were wearing Southern Grey
I called to you but I used another name
I beat the ground and I cried out in your pain
Through a scarlet door I watched you slipping away
And your brother's helpless prayers were all in vain

Across the mountains and valleys,
Back home to the one that I love so happily.

Five years for being hungry tired and poor

On and on

Was invited by a skinny girl
Into her high class world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

[Chorus:]
I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here
I'll have me a real good time

(repeat)

Dancing madly round the room, yeah
Singing loudly and sorta' out of tune
Was escorted by a friendly slag
'round the bedroom and back
Wandered across to the door
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead.

[Chorus:]

The skinny girl made it clear
That she only came here for the beer
The vicar simply reeked of gin
On my way home I happened to fall off my bicycle
(good party)
I was glad to come, but I was also glad to get home"

Leave a message with the porter
Or leave it at the gate

Spent all my money playing her fast game

That I would kick if I was given the chance
Never was amused by the kindness I used

Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm

Written all over his face

Not forgetting the one in detroit.
They said, ""we like you boy and we think you're sweet,
But can't you lose your suit? ""
I said, ""no, you can't do that to me""

And the fold in my trousers it ain't straight.

And get myself a smooth outfit.

Then someone buys another round
And with every drink or three

Baby's begged me not to go
So many times before
She said love and happiness
Can't live behind those swinging doors
Now she's gone and I'm to blame

Its late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I shouldn't have tried any more

You lured me away from home just to save me from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

Morning sun when its in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
Laughed at all of your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore

You lured me away from home, just to save me from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
I was blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
Get on back home one of these days

Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face"

Bubblar till farvдl
Dina glitter цgon
Dom skjuter mig igen
Och fast jag har haft tеlamod
Och цppnat mig fцare dig
Sе sдger du att jag ljuger
Och du litar inte mer pе mig

Jag hatar dig
Du дare underbar
Ingenting finns kvar
Allting har fцrlorat
Nu packar jag och drar
Och om vi trдffas nеgon gеng
Dе kanske du fцrstеare
Att jag var den du borde
Men aldrig kunde lite pе

Nu vet jag vad det дare att дlska
Och att sдga adjц
Det kдnns som att fцdas
Samtidigt som det kдnns som om man... Man ska dц"

And critize my Plastic Truth.

Doing all these things to you
But we can't go on
With everybody running wild

Make one big plastic rule, for you to
Follow, my little lovely human child

Och jag skulle få sova hos dig Annabell.

Jag tänkte, Det blir inge sova inatt.
Jag blåste, Jag slet, Jag blev rödaktigt gräll..
När jag skulle få sova hos dig Annabell.
Madrassen var sladdrig, Jag slet som en slav..
Och varje gång jag la mig ner så halka jag av..
Jag trodde du mena under samma fäll..
När jag skulle få sova hos dig Annabell.
Jag låg och höll fast mig alldeles slut..
Då lossnade proppen och luften pös ut.
Jag suckade, ""Äh, Lägg av med ditt gnäll""
Sa du då och somnade om Annabell.
Det var alldeles mörkt, Jag såg ingenting
Proppen var borta när jag kröp omkring..
Rakt på ett stolsben och fick mig en smäll..
När jag skulle få sova hos dig Annabell.
Så jag bet om ventilen för att täppa till..
Jag ska aldrig äta madrass en gång till.
Det drog ikring golvet och allt kändes fel..
När jag bad om en plats bredvid dig Annabell.
""Äh, Lägg dig på golvet låt mig va ifred""
""Bussigt""hörredu, Jag ska tänka på de..
Jag kände mig blåst du va inte snäll..
När jag skulle få sova hos dig Annabell
Nej, Jag ska aldrig glömma din gummimadrass..
En blå variant som var alldeles kass.
Du gav den till mig när vi kom hem en kväll..
Och jag skulle få sova hos..
Ja, Jag skulle få sova hos dig Annabell!"

Och vakna varje morgon - med dig...

Men det är lättare att reda ut en fnurra,
På trå'n...

En omöjlighet ja jag vet... 
Men kanske att den,
Drömmen en gång kan bli verklighet.
Det bor - hos mig en stor längtan att få:

Vakna varje morgon - somna varje natt
Och vakna varje morgon - hos dig-Waooowaaawaaa... 

Saknaden - har också sin njutning.
Men störst av allt är ändå dessa,
Uppvaknanden,
I nära sammanslutning... 

Vakna varje morgon med dig, 

En omöjlig dröm men jag bär den, 
Inom mig - överallt... 

Oavsett var sängen står i hela världen... 
Så fick - du om det gick, Gärna:

Vakna varje morgon - somna varje natt,
Och va - med mig..

Dag och natt - genom gråt och skratt.
Jag tror att livet vore enklare att leva..

Från en båt:

Så följdes vi åt till Karlberg,
Medan stan av morgonsolen fick rosa färg.

Vatten, stan äare full av vatten.
Vatten, lite grann I hatten.
Om man tar en helikopter rakt upp,
Så ser man alla öarna mesamma.
Dom sprider sig ut mot horisonten,
Inifrån brospann och hamnar...
Man sen på en sightseeingtur
Så säger allihop, näare dom kliver ur att:

Vatten, och bakom ratten,
Kan man sitta på en liten kutter.
Mellan kanaler och holmar,

Kan man paddla, segla, surfa, gå... Eller ro!

Med tofflor på och sa -Fy skam!

Ja, Det där får ni väl i alla fall,
Göra hemma, Det förstår ni väl!

Så vi satte oss uti en park,
Jag skar ditt namn i trädens bark.
Men då kom där en parkvakt fram,
I uniform och skrek -Fy skam!

Ja, Men det där är väl för hemmabruk, va?

Men vi har ingen lägenhet,
Fast vi stått i evighet.
Uti bostadskön, ni vet,
Så visa oss barmhärtighet!

Ja, Ja, Det spelar ingen roll,
- Ge er härifrån nu bara!

Så vi gick och såg en kärleksfilm,
Du la din arm runt midjan min.
Men då kom där en bänkvakt fram,
Med ficklampan, Och sa -Fy skam!

Ja, Vad håller ni på med här då, va?
Ja, Ja, Men det där kan ni inte göra, Det förstår ni väl?
Seså, Det där får ni klara av hemma,
Ge er härifrån bara..

Så vi satte oss uti en bil,
I gammal välkänd raggarstil.
En lapplisa kom genast fram,
Med böteslapp, Och skrev.. Fy skam..
På lappen med sin penna:

""Det där får ni göra hemma""..

Men vi har ingen lägenhet...

Ja, Ja, Det spelar ingen roll,
Ni har redan stått tio sekunder för länge,
På den här parkeringsplatsen..

Då reste vi ett campingtält,
På Humlegårdens gröna fält.
Då kom en konstapel fram..
Rev vårt tält och skrek -Fy skam!
Med hög och mäktig stämma:

-Vad gör ni!?
-Kom med här nu!'

Vi ställdes framför domaren,
I slutet utav sommaren.
Så tog han häktningorden fram,
Och rodnade och sa -Fy skam!

Som kör sej häst-lyd-bäst mot Stönland.

Från Halkaranda feldelas att låren är på väg.

På dikestanten, Och fullt av snömjöl smyger i luften.

Och i Bråkio i Rapan är det full sprinter.
För att inte skvala om San Franskridsko,
Där man uppmätt grinus själva grader i muggan.

Klockan var ju bara fem.
Jag mörda väckarklockan,
Och så la vi på en rem.
Ner till receptionen föare att hänga med,
En bussresa till Kairo fåare du se.

Öken.
Öken.
Fan, ja va ju knappast vöken.
Det va öken!

Ja.

Vi hade bara rullat nåra tusen meter,
Blev vi stoppade av en sånn kontroll man skulle tala om vad man heter.
Vad man har föare hårfärg och vad man har föare skor,
Var morsans fasters brorsa bor.

Fan, det e ju öken!
De e öken!
Som nån jävla skolklass vilsen med sin fröken.
Det e ju öken!

Hur det va så kom vi iväg då,
Och först så va det berg sen va det ännu mera berg.
Och alltihopp hade en sån häare skitbrun färg.
Sand, sand, sand, sand, grus och stoft, vilket jävla land!

Det e ju öken!
Fan det e öken!
Jag tänkte: det blir väl bättre runt kröken,
Men det var ännu mera öken!

Så körde vi plötsligt in I nån jävla dimma,
Chauffören spydde och guiden svimma.
Behövde man bajsa, då fanns det en mugg,
Men ingenting fundera man såg inte ett dugg.

Det va öken!
Fan vilken öken! Va?
Men gissa om det lukta möken,
Det va öken!

Jag tänkte: Hur många drome'dar skulle det häare hålla på?
Föare jag börjar nämligen lite konstigt må.
Jag såg några märkliga figurer på ett krön,
Be-du-in sista bön.

Det va öken!
Öken!
Jag drömde mardrömmar och dansade med spöken,
Ja det va öken!

Allright,
Lets go!

Du vet, resans mål de va ju Tutan Kamon,
Guiden ropade comon', comon' comon!
14 tusen busslaster samtidigt på språng,
Kön va ju föare fan elva resor lång!

Det va öken!
Vilken öken!
Och det säger jag, av nån jävla tutte såg jag fan inte röken,
Det va öken!

Så börja guiden plötsligt förhöra oss av Mecka,
Då tänkte jag: Nu fåare det väl förfan räcka!
Sitta I Sahara, och inte kunna svara,
Tillbakaflyttad till kvarsittarnas skara!

Det e ju öken!
Ja visst fan e det öken!
Tänk dig själv, jag menar, vilket fotfel kännertäcknar Göken?
Det e ju öken! Va?

Allt detta hände ju femtusen före krist,
Javisst, javisst, javisst.
Men vad fan har vi föare glädje av det häare och nu,
Näare man sitter häare och käkar nån slags wokad gnu?

Det e ju öken!
Öken!
Dom ska ju ha så jävla märkvärdigt kök men,
Det e öken!

Allright,
Lets Go!

Jag satt däare och drömde mig tillbaks till min egna förlossning,
Jag tänkte: Nu ska det bli skoj och hoppa ut och ropa mossning'!
Genast va de nån däare som slet och drog,
Jag skrek ju förfan så morsan nästan dog!

De va öken!
Jag kommer ihåg: Det va öken!
Jag tänkte: Kan inte farsan ha haft kondom på Löken?
De va...

Nä! Nej men den häare ska inte va med häare.
Ej, den bara slank in.

Nu ska vi se...

Rätt som det var kom vi ner I nån katakomb,
Hade jag kunnat hade jag släptt en bomb!
Javisst, fan, syret tog s***,
Jag fick klaustrofobi och kunde inte komma ut!

Det e ju öken!
I öken!
Jag tänkte: Ni som livets mening söken,
Försök I en öken!

Nej, ni förståare säkert att jag skojar bara, jo,
Det äare underbart att I en öken fara-o!
Men Neffra titta, så pyramidal
Byggnadskonsten äare häare vid Nilens dal!

I öknen!
Öken!
Man måste verkligen beundra alla odödlighetsförsöken,
Häare ute I öken!

En sak äare säker, timglasen som ståare däare I Sina-i,
Dom kommer sanden aldrig att sina I!
Och sen vinka vi åt Spfinxen ajöken,
Däare ute I öken!

Okej,
Bye-Bye!

Ja, då har vi rest färdigt, då har vi kommit hem igen,
Och det sägs att man fåare perspektiv på sitt liv näare man kommer hem, med alla sina vykort osorterade.
Näare ens dotter kommer in och säger: Jag vill ut och leka,
Stannar hon vid sandlådan och börjar peka!

Öken!

Aldrig har jag sårats,
Som jag gjorts av dig.
Du är helt otrolig,
När du sopar till!
Åh! Du klyver mig på mitten,
Vad ska jag ta mig till?

Känner mig så ensam,
När du ej är här.
Jag gräver i ditt skitsnack,
Och håller dig så kär.
Svartsjuk som ett åskmoln,
Kokar jag av hat.
Och du som är min glädje,
Du sviker mig så klart!

Dina sköna lockar,
Bubblar till farväl.
Dina glitter ögon,
Dom skjuter mig ihjäl.
Och fast jag har haft tålamod,
Och öppnat mig för dig!
Så säger du att jag ljuger,
Och du litar inte mer på mig!

Åhh vad ska jag göra?
Den man älskar så,
Vill man inte slå och banka..
Gul och blå.
Och fast jag är tillintetgjord,
Så håller jag mig lugn.
Och du ditt vackra helvete
Kan inte hålla mun!

Fy fan vad du snackar!
En jävla massa skit.
Jag skulle svika dig, Jo jag tackar!
Vad blev det av vårt slit?
Nu är jag trött som bara helvete,
På all din misstänksamhet.
Du går miste om någon som älskar dig du.
Bara så du vet!

Jag hatar dig!
Du underbara,
Ingenting finns kvar,
Allting är förlorat,
Nu packar jag och drar.
Och om vi träffas någon gång,
Så kanske du förstår!
Att jag var den du borde,
Men aldrig kunde lita på!

Nu vet jag vad det är att älska,
Och att säga adjö.
Det känns som att födas....
Samtidigt som det känns.... som om man ska dö."
Rage Against The Machine,Ashes In The Fall,/r/rage+against+the+machine/ashes+in+the+fall_20113418.html,"A mass of hands press on the market window
Ghosts of progress
Dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger
And glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Are buried for drinking
The river's water
While shackled to the line
At the empty well

This is the new sound
Just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound
Over the new ground

Listen to the fascist sing
""Take hope here
War is elsewhere
You were chosen
This is god's land
Soon we'll be free
Of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our
Forefather's hand""

A mass of promises
Begin to rupture
Like the pockets
Of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs
In Appalachia
It's the priests that fuck you
As they whisper holy things
A mass of tears have transformed to stones now
Sharpened on suffering
And woven into slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

This is the new sound
Just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound
Over the new ground

Ain't it funny how the factory doors close
Round the time that the school doors close
Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper

I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn - I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...
It occured to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun - to be another one
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime - never the less
They could not understand that I'm a black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize - what it's a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust - yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all

Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, i'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a c-o
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent -
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with oliver's neck
I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nuthin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 c-os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman c-o to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 c-os, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious - call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose - yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up
Blew up, who shot...
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the s1ws
Secured my getaway, so I just gotaway
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
'cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone"

Hand out some beat-downs
Cold runna train on punk hos that
Think they run the game

Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag

And the businesses that burned us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough
I call the bluff
For manifest destiny

Dispute the suits I ignite

Safe from the screams
Of the children born as ghosts
Gates, guns and alarms
Shape the calm of the dawn
Peering down into the basin
Where death lives on
Where young run foaming at the mouth with hate
Where burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Their walls deny the terror facedby the children born as ghosts

One book and forty odd
Stuffed in a room
Ah, the school as a tomb
Where home is a wasteland
Taste the razor wire

And thought is locked in the womb
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(myth of the dream, myth of the dream)

A mall and a loan a child dead at birth
There's a widow pig parrot
A rebel to tame

Feel tha critical mass approach horizon
Tha pulse of tha condemned
Sound off America's demise

Hope lies in tha smoldering rubble of empires
Back through tha shanties and tha cities remains
Tha same bodies buried hungry

These vultures rob everyone
Leave nothing but chains
Pick a point here at home
And tha picture's tha same

Some corn and some debit
There's a ditch full of bodies

There's a tap, tha phone, tha silence of stone

A prison to fill
A country's soul that reads post no bills
A strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill

You fill my mind with a false sense of history

Environment
The environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconciousness

What does the billboard say
Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement

Spoken quietly: anger is a gift

No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured
Silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The cameras eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the fistagons the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks
Who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above fuck it cut the cord

It had to be loud mouthed on the comedy hour
It had to be announced over loud speakers

The cia and the Mafia are in cahoots

It had to be said in old ladies' language
It had to be said in American headlines
Kennedy stretched and smiled and got double crossed by lowlife goons and agents
Rich bankers with criminal connections
Dope pushers in cia working with dope pushers from Cuba working with a
Big time syndicate from Tampa, Florida
And it had to be said with a big mouth

It had to be moaned over factory foghorns
It had to be chattered on car radio news broadcasts
It had to be screamed in the kitchen
It had to be yelled in the basement where uncles were fighting

It had to be howled on the streets by newsboys to bus conductors
It had to be foghorned into New York harbor
It had to echo onto hard hats
It had to turn up the volume in university ballrooms

It had to be written in library books, footnoted
It had to be in the headlines of the Times and Le Monde
It had to be barked on tv
It had to be heard in alleys through ballroom doors

It had to be played on wire services

Comedians stopped dead in the middle of a joke in Las Vegas

It had to be fbi chief J. Edgar Hoover and Frank Costello syndicate
Mouthpiece meeting in Central Park, New York weekends,
Reported Time magazine

It had to be the Mafia and the cia together starting war on Cuba,
Bay of Pigs and poison assassination headlines

It had to be dope cops in the Mafia
Who sold all their heroin in America

It had to be the fbi and organized crime working together
In cahoots against the commies

It had to be ringing on multinational cash registers
A world-wide laundry for organized criminal money

It had to be the cia and the Mafia and the fbi together
They were bigger than Nixon
And they were bigger than war

It had to be a large room full of murder
It had to be a mounted ass- a solid mass of rage
A red hot pen
A scream in the back of the throat

It had to be a kid that can breathe
It had to be in Rockefellers' mouth
It had to be central intelligence, the family, allofthis, the agency Mafia
It had to be organized crime

One big set of gangs working together in cahoots

Hitmen
Murderers everywhere

The secret
The drunk
The brutal
The dirty and rich

On top of a slag heap of prisons
Industrial cancer
Plutonium smog
Garbage cities

Grandmas' bed soft from fathers' resentment

It had to be the rulers
They wanted law and order
And they got rich on wanting protection for the status quo

They wanted junkies
They wanted Attica
They wanted Kent State
They wanted war in Indochina

Yeah

It had to be the cia and the Mafia and the fbi

Multinational capitalists
Strong armed squads
Private detective agencies for the oh so very rich
And their armies and navies and their air force bombing planes

It had to be capitalism
The vortex of this rage
This competition
Man to man

The horses head in a capitalists' bed
The Cuban turf
It rumbles in hitmen
And gang wars across oceans

Bombing Cambodia settled the score when Soviet pilots
Manned Egyptian fighter planes

Chiles' red democracy
Bumped off with White House pots and pans

A warning to Mediterranean governments

The secret police have been embraced for decades

The nkpd and cia keep each other's secrets
The ogbu and dia never hit their own
The kgb and the fbi are one mind

Brute force and full of money
Brute force, world-wide, and full of money
Brute force, world-wide, and full of money
Brute force, world-wide, and full of money

They had to murder in Chile
They had to murder in Russia

You're missing the hootah of the funky buddah,
Eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it,
Cause we're like outlaws sridding while suckers are hiding,
Jump behind the bush when you see me driving by'
Hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some negros
Acting kind of loco I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid for my vocals.
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

I be doing all the dumb shit yo
Cause nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming
Humming coming at ya! Then you know I had to gat ya!
Time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
In to your sattle light shining a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example just a little sample:
How could I just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on. Take cover son or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way, young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To lite my spliff ignite you with insite so if you ain't down
Bullshit. Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the rolemmodel?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya!
Yeah you know I'm going to gat ya. How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been, understand where I'm coming from. While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a faster ducket,
Just to stay alive yo I got to say fuck it.
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.

I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn - I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...
It occured to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun - to be another one
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all
To criticize me for some crime - never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran

She stuffed ten to a truckbed
She clutches her cross
Here come tha exhaust
And it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to tha pasture
Like cattle shell cross
Degree 106
Sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates
Upon the memories of home
Of yanqui guns for blood debts on the loans
Of smoldering fields, rape, rubble and bones
Of graves hidden trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates
And through historys rivers of blood she regenerates
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is nearnever conquered but here

To tear away at the mask

And now she got a quota
Tha needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across tha new line
Of mason dixon
Rippin through denim
Tha point an inch from her vein
Tha foreman approach
His steps now pound in her brain
His presence it terrifies
And eclipses her days
No minutes to rest
No moments to pray
And with a whisper
He whips her
Soul changed to his will
My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill
Her arm jerks
Tha sisters gather round her and scream
As if in a dream
Eyes on the crimson stream

I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates and through historys rivers of blood she regenerates
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear
Maria
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

Away at the mask

No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minutes to rest

Just a moment to pray

To tear away at the mask, huh

With the cold hands of executioners
Execute
Executive decisions
Determined to destroy
What 1 million women, children, and men
1910
Died, drowning in the rage of battle.
Mothers, half naked
Infants clutching thier necks
Running frantically
Tripping over the bodies of their sons
Teeth gnashing
Swinging machete
Spitting blood and mud, and screaming:
Land, and liberty!
Were erased.
Buried and burned
Along with the memory of the dead
Along with the ejido.
With the smooth stroke of a pen
And with the ghost of nixon present in their eyes
They smiled.
And pronounced the omnipitence
Of the free market
The profits of profit
Extending the scurge of columbus and pizarro
The freedom to buy things you can never afford
The freedom for indians to buy corn that once flourished overgrown in their backyards
The freedom to die of curable disease
The freedom to watch their children's stomachs swell and burst
The freedom to starve and die
Without land
Or liberty
But ramona, with eyes of obsidian
Peering through her blood and sweat drenched mask
Darding, unseen
Changing direction with the swiftness of a bird
Through the shanty's of the canyon
With every coyote, every insect, every phylum of life
Urging her, propelling her forward.
The leaves and branches of the forest
Part for miles, clearing her path
The voices and screams of the dead beneathe her feet
Echo in the deepest chasm of her soul
Hurling her, toward the city
History surging through her veins
Pulsing through her fingers
Hurling her, towards the city
She caresses her trigger
And the words of magome fulfil her being
And with each shot she fires, she affirms her movement
Saying:
Enough! Enough!
No!
I will see my own blood flow
Before you take my land... Or my liberty"

I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream

Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "" yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab... Without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To this the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of... An addiction,
Magnatized by the mixing

You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the reanamator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone.
Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one

Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family
But I slipped

To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name

Read my writing on the wall
No-ones here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side.... Suicide!

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage
But it's one that I can recognise
Having never seen the colour of my fathers eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family
But I slipped

To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name

Read my writing on the wall
No-ones here to catch me when I fall
Caught between my culture and the system.... Genocide!

Read my writing on the wall
No-ones here to catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss, then knock the smile off my face
Yeah!

That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!

[Verse One:]

Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya"" Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two:]

Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

Bring that shit in! Uggh!
Yeah, the movements in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out... Uggh!
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and write

So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge
And bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Heres the plan
Motherfuck uncle sam
Get back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change
And to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

The present curriculum
I put my fist in em
Eurocentric every last one of em
See right through the red, white and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting
To hold us back
We got to take it back
Cause holes in our spirit causin tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Whos inferior?
Yea, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that is why
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

Hey yo check, were gonna have to break it, break it, break it down
Awww shit!
Uggh!
And like this... Uggh!
Come on, yeah! Bring it back the other way!
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The students eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school

Europe aint my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it
Yet we hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
That's why we gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

No more lies (8 times, building to a crescendo)
Uggh!
Yeah!
Take it back yall
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back yall, come on!
Take it back yall

The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, no rest!

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad

Guitar Solo

Now Tom Said; ""Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me! (repeat 8 times)

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes

Randy Newman,A Few Words,/r/randy+newman/a+few+words_20752682.html,"I'd like to say a few words
In defense of our country
Whose people aren't bad nor are they mean
Now the leaders we have
While they're the worst that we've had
Are hardly the worst this poor world has seen

Let's turn history's pages, shall we?

Take the Caesars for example
Why within the first few of them
They were sleeping with their sister
Stashing little boys in swimming pools
And burning down the City
And one of 'em, one of 'em
Appointed his own horse Consul of the Empire
That's like vice president or something

That's not a very good example, is it?

But wait, here's one, the Spanish Inquisition
They put people in a terrible position
I don't even like to think about it

Well, sometimes I like to think about it

Just a few words in defense of our country
Whose time at the top
Could be coming to an end
Now we don't want their love
And respect at this point
Is pretty much out of the question
But in times like these
We sure could use a friend

Hitler. Stalin.
Men who need no introduction

King Leopold of Belgium. That's right.
Everyone thinks he's so great
Well he owned The Congo
He tore it up too
He took the diamonds, he took the gold
He took the silver
Know what he left them with?

Malaria

A President once said,
""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself""
Now it seems like we're supposed to be afraid
It's patriotic in fact and color coded
And what are we supposed to be afraid of?
Why, of being afraid
That's what terror means, doesn't it?
That's what it used to mean

[To the first eight bars of
""Columbia The Gem Of The Ocean""]

You know it pisses me off a little
That this Supreme Court is gonna outlive me
A couple of young Italian fellas
And a brother on the Court now too
But I defy you, anywhere in the world
To find me two Italians as tightass
As the two Italians we got

And as for the brother
Well, Pluto's not a planet anymore either

The end of an empire is messy at best
And this empire is ending
Like all the rest
Like the Spanish Armada adrift on the sea
We're adrift in the land of the brave
And the home of the free

Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye."

And no one cares and no one understands

Never another spring for you,
Never a robin to sing for you,
You're out there on your own

Who stalks through our forest at dawn

I have the strength to carry on

Today we will be married
And all the freaks that she knows will be there
And all the people from the village will be there

My brother's a machinist in a textile mill
And he makes more money than you ever will
He just got married to a Polish girl
With a space between her teeth

My sister's a dancer up in Baltimore
At a small cafe on Main
But she ran off with a Negro from the Eastern Shore
Dr., she didn't even know his name

Chorus
Get me back on my feet again
Back on my feet again
Open the door and set me free
Get me back on my feet again

He took her down to Mobile in a railroad train
He said, ""Driver, take me to the Hotel Paree.""
He went into the washroom
Washed his face and hands
Dr., when he come out he was white as you and me

He said, ""Girl, I'm not a Negro I'm a millionaire
As you can plainly see
So many women love my money
But you have proved that you love only me.

""I'm going to teach you to play polo and how to water ski
And you won't have to dance no more
And I no longer must pretend to be
A Negro from the Eastern Shore. ""

How 'bout letting me out today?

I can hear the choir

I remember the night she left
I drove to the station in the pouring rain
Sat all night behind my big iron desk
The oil on the water made a rainbow

At the end of this bone-white gravel road
They both lie sleeping on a feather bed
And her hair is black as the sky at night

But won't let you go

And tells you so
Over and over and over
If this happens to you
You'd be better off dead

You might be surprised to learn how often it can happen
In a love affair
(And boy does it hurt)
You fall in love with someone for whom you really care
And they treat you just like dirt
They make you feel kind of dirty and flirty
Hey I'm talking to you
Didn't you hear what I said?

Better off dead
Than living with someone
Whose every word's like a knife cuts through you
Better off dead
Than living with someone
Who just doesn't give a shit what happens to you
You know that's wrong
But you go on and on
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead

When you fall in love with someone
Who doesn't love you
You better run for daylight
Just as fast you can (Little man)
Forget your foolish dreams and schermes that things will
work out in the end
Put some real mileage between yourself and the object of
you love my friend
Or become what you see
Yes, a loser like me
Someone who'd be
Better off dead
Better off dead







Musically, this one has a sort of overblown, heavenly quality to it. But lyrically, it's another story of a guy getting himself into a bad relationship that he can't get out of. He says, ""When you fall in love with someone who doesn't love you/ Someone who treats you so badly it ramifies your head/ Someone who doesn't want you but won't let you go/ Someone who thinks you're crazy and tells you so, over and over and over/ If this happens to you, you're better off dead."" It's exaggerated, but there's a kernel of truth there for so many people. You don't know what bad is until you feel that. I know what I'm talking about because I was once a woman who loved too much.

I know some critic is going to think I don't know what the word ramify means, or how to use it. made up an alternate verb form of it here, like a made-up R&B word, like the ""puppetudes"" of love. wanted to say how there would be ramifications from something that happens to your head in this kind of a relationship. I should've said ""blamifies"" or something to make it really obvious I was playing with the word, but I just didn't give a fuck."

Randy Newman,Faust (act 1),/r/randy+newman/faust+act+1_20558794.html,"It is 4004 B. C., and the Lord has just created the Universe. He and His Original Angels celebrate the Lord's great acheivement (Glory Train). Lucifer, the Lord's favorite, and the best looking angel by far, makes a little mistake, as will happen at parties, and is banished from Heaven forthwith and forever.

The centuries fly by. Lucifer, the Devil, now reigns in Hell where to the surprise of many, he has proven to be an effective administrator -- harsh to be sure, vicious, even sadistic, ruthless when necessary but always fair. His life has not been an easy one however, and he longs to return to Heaven where they now have golf, roller coasters and Hawaiian music. He promises revenge (Can't Keep A Good Man Down).

The Devil visits the Lord in Heaven. He notices the Lord seems bored, and even for Him, a little irritable (note unfortunate reference to Buddhists and lack of modesty in How Great Our Lord). He senses that the Lord may have lost a step or two, and decides to take advantage of it. The Devil contends that the Lord made a mistake when He created Mankind. The Lord says he doesn't make mistakes. Knowing Him and His little, not weaknesses exactly, idiosyncrasies perhaps, better than anyone, the Devil goads the Lord into making a bet -- a representative specimen of Human life on Earth is to be selected, the Devil will try to corrupt the selectee. After negotiating a bit, even at one point considering a Canadian (Northern Boy), they agree on Henry Faust, a schizophrenic student from Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana (Bless The Children). Should the Devil win, he would be permitted to move back up to Heaven. If the Lord wins, he would get Faust's soul which proves to be so tiny as to be almost invisible, but it is important to the Lord as are we all. The two old adversaries part amicably and get on with the rest of the show.

The Devil makes himself known to the boy and proffers a contract which Henry signs without reading. The Devil is astonished. Henry explains he doesn't like to read on his own time. The Devil dislikes Henry at sight; he's a bad boy alright, but in such an unimaginitive, illmannered, uncultured way (The Man)that the Devil, though sure of victory, is desheartened by the company he must keep. In any case, the Devil is certain that Henry will come through for him, and that he will once again abide with the Lord in Heaven. Right next door if possible. In addition, the Devil happens to know that an important member of the Lord's staff, an English Angel, is angry about the Lord's inexplicably cavalier treatment of his country, which did, after all, win those two Big Wars thereby saving the world (Little Island).

After spending some hard time with Henry, the Devil zips up to Heaven to pass a few quiet hours in the best place he knows. He unexpectedly encounters the Lord and some Angel Children. The Devil complains about having to deal with a barbarian like Henry. The Lord sympathizes, not liking the kid any better than the Devil does, and incidentally, genuinely worried about the viability of his bet -- the Devil in Heaven would be intolerable.
He'd ruin everything and probably would want to come over all the time and ""do things"" like they did as boys. The Lord loads up and with the help of the children, fires off an inspirational song at the Devil (Relax, Enjoy Yourself)."
Randy Newman,Faust (act 2),/r/randy+newman/faust+act+2_20558793.html,"Faust has never been in love except with himself. The Lord decides to send down Cupid to shoot Faust to get a love thing going for the boy. The Lord's personnel resources are staggeringly comprehensive. Cupid shoots Faust at a big St. Patricks Day Easter Bunny festival in South Bend on Easter Sunday. Henry falls in love with Margaret, the poorest, nicest and most beautiful girl in South Bend (Gainsville). The Devil, raging inwardly at the Lord's perfidy (Cupid is after all a mythological figure from a pagan culture), notices Margaret has a friend with her, Martha, the most sophisticated girl in Indiana (Life Has Been Good), and one who has seen action not only at Arlington Park, but at Belmont, Aqueduct and Bay Meadows. The Devil falls for Martha hard; as only a middle-aged man can fall for a beautiful heartless young girl. Believe me. It's the truth. He's headed for trouble (I Gotta Be Your Man). Martha seems to reciprocate his feelings for her (Feels Like Home). It's a trick. Too late. Martha Dumps the Devil (Bleeding All Over The Place). Meanwhile, Margaret, against her better judgment, falls in love with Faust (My Hero). Faust poisons her mother so he can be alone with her, sleeps with Margaret, impregnates her, and with the Devil's help kills Maraget's brother, Valentine, who sees Faust leave his sister's humble little sleep chamber. Henry and the Devil are forced to skip town. They head for a cabin the Devil keeps on Lake Superior near Duluth. They bring their own water and stay a year.

In South Bend, Margaret has Henry's child, and crazed with grief and shame, drowns it in a creek. This is the comic high point of Goethe's original play, and one of the most delightfully urbane moments in all of German literature. In a hilarious courtroom sequence, Margaret is convicted of murder and sentenced to die at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. She sings a lullaby (Sandman's Coming) though her baby is, of course, dead. She sings to a blanket!

Henry attempts to rescue Margaret who is already in the spirit world in spirit but because she was so good in life, the Angels come down and take her off to Heaven even before she is dead. Henry is impressed. He asks the Lord for forgiveness and takes some of the poison he gave Margaret's mother. The Devil laughs, his own move to Heaven seems imminent; he says he's going home to pack. Henry, expiring noisily, with neither dignity nor courage (he tries to induce vomiting to rid himself of the poison) asks again for forgiveness. The Devil laughs, but Lo! The Angels decend. The Lord's voice booms down ""he is saved."" Henry ascends to Heaven, favoring the Devil with a little wave as he goes. At this point, the impartial observer, if one such could be found, might agree that the Devil has been denied the victory to which he was entitled. Predictably, he is angry, very angry. Then after rage, depression, deep depression. He stands alone inthe cell. Head down, beaten. Even the Lord, watching from above, feels sorry for him.

A wind begins to blow, a warm, dry wind. The Devil's hair is ruffled as the breeze freshens. His cape billows to the east. He wags his tail. He thinks of something that makes him very, very happy (Happy Ending)."

He shook hands with some indians and soon they all were dead
They got tb and typhoid and athletes foot, diptheria and the flu
'scuse me great nations comin through

Balboa found the pacific and on the trail one day
He met some friendly indians whom he was told were gay
Soooooooooooooo
He had them torn apart by dogs on religious grounds they say
The great nations of europe were quite holy in their way

Now they're gone, they're gone, they're really gone
You never seen anyone so gone
Some bones hidden in a canyon some paintings in a cave
They're no use tryin to save them, there's nothin left to save

Hide your wives and daughters, hide your sons as well
With the great nations of europe you never can tell

Where you and I are standing at the end of a century
Europes have sprung up everywhere as even I can see
But there on the horizon is the possiblity
That some bug from out of africa might come for you and me
Destroying everything in it's path from sea to shining sea
Like the great nations of europe in the 16th century"
Randy Newman,Guilty,/r/randy+newman/guilty_20114108.html,"Yes, baby, I been drinkin'
And I shouldn't come by I know
But I found myself in trouble
And I had nowhere else to go

Got some whisky from the barman
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on movin'
Til I was back in your arms again

Guilty, baby I'm guilty
And I'll be guilty the rest of my life
How come I never do what I'm supposed to do
How come nothin' that I try to do ever turns out right?

You know, you know how it is with me baby
You know, I just can't stand myself
And it takes a whole lot of medicine
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else

On the corner of the street
He waved his hanky at me
As I went rolling by
I pulled the truck up on the sidewalk
And I climbed down from the cab
With my tire-chain and my knife
As I approached him
He was trembling like a bird
I raised the chain above my head
He said, ""Please, before you kill me
Might I have one final word?""
And this is what he said:
""I am but Half A Man,
Half A Man I'd like to be a dancer
But I'm much too large
Half A Man, Half A Man
I'm an object for your pity
Not your rage""
Oh, the strangest feeling's sweeping over me
Both my speech and manner have become much more refined
I said, ""Oh, what is this feeling?
What is wrong with me?""
She said, ""Girl, it happens all the time ""
And you are Half A Man,
Half A Man Look,
You're walking and you're talking Like a fag.""

I feel my confidence growin' and I know I'm gonna be alright

I see the volcanoes 'rupting and erupting, red walls of fire
I got corruption, seduction, destruction, reproduction
I got Las Vegas in my mind, seem like it's stuck up in there
Like it's been up there for all times

You can take your desert
Goddamn it, give me mine
'Cause I got Las Vegas in my mind

Through these portals, pass the rich and the famous
Through these portals, pass the very best at what they do
Man, they're the greatest, it's the land of giant women
But the little man is king, here in Las Vegas
Man, they got ev'rything, run with it

They got English girls with legs so long
You gotta use a stepladder to lick their love thing
It's a family place too now, so bring the kids along
They're gonna have a real good time here

They got wild women from Borneo
Playin' the piano in your bungalow
They got monkey women from the Amazon

Randy Newman,Harps & Angels,/r/randy+newman/harps+angels_20752687.html,"Hasn't anyody seen me lately
I'll tell you why
Hasn't anybody seen me lately
I'll tell you why
I caught something made me so sick
That I thought that I would die
And I almost did too

First me knees begin to tremble
My heart begin to pound
First my knees begin to tremble
My heart begin to pound
It was arrhythmic and out of tune
I lost my equilibrium
And fell face down upon the ground

As I lay there on that cold pavement
A tear ran down my face
'Cause I thought I was dying
You boys know I'm not a religious man
But I sent a prayer out just in case
You never know
Lo and behold almost immediately
I had reason to believe my prayer had
Been heard in a very special place
'Cause I heard this sound

Ooooh
Yes
Oooh
Yes, it was harps and angels
Harps and angels coming near
I was to sick to roll over and see them
But I could hear them singin ever so beautifully
In my ear

Then the sound began to subside
And they sounded like background singers
And a voice come down from the heavens above
It was a voice full of anger from the Old Testament
And a voice full of love from the New One
And the street lit up
Like it was the middle of the day
And I lay there quiet and listened to what that
Voice had to say

He said, ""You ain't ben a good man
You ain't been a bad man
But you've been pretty bad
Lucky for you this ain't your time
Someone very dear to me has made another
Clerical error
And we're here on a bit of a wild goose chase
But I want to tell you a few things
That'll hold you in good stead
When it is your time
So you better listen close
I'm only going to say this once

When they lay you on the table
Better keep your bussines clean
'Fore they lay you on the table
Better keep your business clean
Don't want no back stabbing, ass grabbing
You know exactly what I mean
Alright girls - we're outta here""

Ooooh

""Encore. Encore.""
Ooooh
(He spoke French)
""Tres bien
Encore""
And off they went into the night

Almost immediately I felt better
And I come round to see you boys
'Cause you know we ain't living right
And while it was fresh
I wanted to tell you what he told me

He said, ""When the lay you on the table
Better keep your business clean
When they lay you on the table
Better keep your business clean
Else there won't be no harps and angels
Coming for you
It'll be trombones, kettle drums, pitchforks,
And tambourines. ""

Sing it like they did for me one time
Ooooh - yes
Ooooh - beautiful
Wish I spoke French

So actually the main thing about
This story is for me
There really is an afterlife
And I hope to see all of you there

Let's go get a drink"

Why doncha lie down for a couple years. I'll look after things.""

Carrying their babies around in a sack on their back
Moving careful and slow

[Chorus:]
It's money that matters
Hear what I say
It's money that matters
In the usa

All of these people are much brighter than I
In any fair system they would flourish and thrive
But they barely survive
They eke out a living and they barely survive

When I was a young boy, maybe thirteen
I took a hard look around me and asked what does it mean?
So I talked to my father, and he didn't know
And I talked to my friend and he didn't know
And I talked to my brother and he didn't know
And I talked to everybody that I knew

[Chorus:]
It's money that matters
Now you know that it's true
It's money that matters
Whatever you do

Then I talked to a man lived up on the county line
I was washing his car with a friend of mine
He was a little fat guy in a red jumpsuit
I said ""You look kind of funny""
He said ""I know that I do""

""But I got a great big house on the hill here
And a great big blonde wife inside it
And a great big pool in my backyard and another great big pool
Beside it
Sonny it's money that matters, hear what I say
It's money that matters in the usa
It's money that matters
Now you know that it's true
It's money that matters whatever you do"""

She's gone off somewhere
Unexpectedly
If she wanders in here, babe
Tell her I'm lookin' for her
I ain't mad or nothing
I just wanna talk

You know, Mikey
We've been friends for a long time
You tell me all your troubles
And I've always told you mine
North Beach has changed though
Since we were grown up
Didn't used to be any spades here, now you got 'em
Didn't used to be any Mexicans here, now you got 'em
Didn't used to be any Chinamen here
Didn't used to be this ugly music playing all the time
Where are we, on the moon?
Whatever happened to the old songs, Mikey?
Like the Duke of Earl
Mikey, whatever happened to the fucking Duke of Earl?

Your grace and your charm

I'm just a punky little eyeball
With an ugly little optic nerve

You know sometimes I get a little blue
Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you

Randy Newman,My Country,/r/randy+newman/my+country_20114089.html,"Let's go back to yesterday,
When a phone call cost a dime.
In New Orleans, just a nickel.
Turn back the hands of time.
Turn back the hands of time.

Picture a room with a window,
A sofa and some chairs,
A television turned on for the night.

Picture a woman,
Two children seated,
A man lying there,
Their faces softly glowing in the light.

This is my country,
These are my people.
This is the world I understand.
This is my country,
These are my people.
And I know 'em like the back of my own hand.

If we had something to say we'd bounce it off the screen
We were watching and we couldn't look away.
We all know what we look like, you know what I mean?
We wouldn't have had it any other way.
We got comedy, tragedy.
Ev'rything from A to B,
Watching other people living,
Seeing other people play.
Having other people's voices fill our minds.
Thank you, Jesus.

Feelings might go unexpressed.
I think that's prob'ly for the best.
Dig too deep, who knows what you will find.

This is my country, those were my people.
Theirs was the world I understand.

Picture a room, no window,
A door that leads outside,
A man lying on a blanket on the floor.
Picture his three grown boys behind him,
Bouncing words off of a screen,
Of a television big as all outdoors.

Now your children are your children,
Even when they're grown.
When they speak to you,
You got to listen to what they have to say.
But they all live alone now,
They have tvs of their own
But they keep on coming over anyway.
And much as I love them,
I'm always kind of glad when they go away.

This is my country,
These are my people.
This is the world I understand.
This is my country,
These are my people.
And I know 'em like the back of my own hand.
I know 'em like the back of my own hand."

Seein' that all my fuckin' friends were assembled here to greet me
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
I'm gonna tell you all the story of my life
I'm gonna tell you all the story of my life

My daddy knew Dixie Howell,
He used to cut his hair
Daddy had a shop in Tuscaloosa,
And Howell was on a team up there
When I was born, Daddy put a football in my cradle
Later on, he put a football helmet in my bed
So when he died I put a razor in his coffin
And poured Vaseline all over his head.
Magnolias, magnolias, magnolias they had
The people come from mile around
To follow Daddy's coffin to the graveyard
And put poor Daddy's body in the ground
Magnolias, you should have smelled the magnolias, Daddy
Don't you wish it was me layin' there instead?
But tomorrow I will be sober, Daddy,
And you will still be dead"

I believe that in the sky there shines a star for me
Clean and bright and shining like the sun shines
And when it seemed that life was hard
Impossible to find your way
I thought about my star and kept on

Listen to your heart, it will tell you everything
Follow it wherever it would go

I believe that in the sky there shines a star, my special star
But I like this boy and I hope that he likes me

Shufflin' uptown against the wind

And looked back to see where she had been

Old lady stand on the corner
With a purse in her hand
She does not know but in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man

Chorus

Old lady lean against a lamppost
Starin' down at the ground on which she stand
She look up and scream
For the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous Naked Man

He say, ""They found out about my sister
And kicked me out of the Navy,
They would have strung me up if they could.
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could. ""

He faked to the left and he faked to the right
And he snatched the purse fromere hand
""Someone stop me,"" he cried,
As he faded from sight,
""Won't nobody help a naked man?""
""Won't nobody help a naked man?""

But I been told
We used to live on Willow near the Garden District
Next to the Sugar Bowl
Momma used to wheel me past an ice cream wagon
One side for White and one side for Colored
I remember trash cans floatin' down Canal Street
It rained every day one summer
Momma used to take me to Audubon Park
Show me the ways of the world
She said, ""here comes a white boy, there goes a black one,
That one's an octoroon
This little cookie here's a macaroon, that big round thing's
A red balloon
And the paper down here's called the Picayune
And here's a New Orleans tune""

In 1948 my Daddy came to the city
Told the people that they'd won the war
Maybe they'd heard it, maybe not
Probably they'd heard it and just forgot
'Cause they built him a platform there in Jackson Square
And the people came to hear him from everywhere
They started to party and they partied some more
'Cause New Orleans had won the war
(We knew we'd do it, we done whipped the Yankees)

Daddy said, ""I'm gonna get this boy out of this place
Bound to sap his strength
People have fun here, and I think that they should
But nobody from here every come to no good
They're gonna pickle him in brandy and tell him he's saved
Then throw fireworks all 'round his grave""

So he took us down to the airport, and flew us back to L. A.
That was the end of my baby days
Blue blue morning, blue blue day
All your bad dreams drift away
It's a blue blue morning, of a blue blue day
Lose those bad dreams
Those gray clouds above you, what you want them around
With you for?
You got someone to love you
Who could ask for more?

All your bad dreams drift away"

I remember my father
My brother of course
I remember my mother
I spoke of her earlier
And I remember that
I remember the smell
Of cut grass
And going off to play ball
In the morning
Funny story about that

Now I used to pitch
I could get the ball
Over the plate
But anyway, this one time
I must of thrown a football
Around or something
The day before
I walked about fourteen kids
In a row
Cried
Walked off the mound
Handed the ball
To the third baseman
And just left the field

Anyway,
Many years later
I brought the woman
Who was to become my
Second wife
God bless her
To meet my father
For the first time
They exchanged pleasantries
I left the room for a moment
It was the first time
He had met her you understand
When I came back
He was telling her the story
Right off the bat
About how
I had walked fourteen kids
Cried and left the mound
Next time he met her
Told her the same

It's only a glorious game
There's fruit trees growin' in an open field
And wild roses bloomin' down a country lane
Look around, old chum
Slow it down, old chum
For you never will succeed
You never will succeed
Relax, enjoy yourself
It's all just a wonderful game
There are rivers and forests, and mountains high
There's the deep green ocean and the pale blue sky
Let it go, and then,
You will know, old friend
That you never will succeed
You never will succeed"

""You got to, got to, got to heal the sick""
I say we ain't gotta do nothin' for nobody

They just gonna have to roll with the punches, yes they will
Gonna have to roll with them
They gonna have to roll with the punches, yes they will

You won't get nowhere putting down
The old Red, White and Blue

Look at those little shorts he's got on, ladies and gentlemen
You can see all the way to Argentina
Get it
So pretty

Let 'em go to Belgium, let 'em go to France
Let 'em go to Russia
Well at least they ought to have the chance to go there
We have talked about the red, we have talked about the blue
Now we gonna talk about the white
That's what we're gonna do
Now we had to roll with the punches, yes we did
We had to roll with 'em

'call you up at midnight sometimes, I must admit,
When I find you're not at home.
My head heats up like a furnace,
My heart grows colder than a stone.
So what's the good of all this money I got, girl?
If every night, I'm left here all alone?
It's a gun that I need.

Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.
I ain't shame of nothing.
Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.
I don't know what you talking about.

All right, let's talk a little business.
You know what I'm saying?
A man of my experience of life,
Don't expect a beautiful young woman like yourself
To come on over here everyday.
Have some old dude bangin' on her
Like a gypsy on a tambourine.
That's not what I'm talkin' 'bout.
That's not what I'm talkin' 'bout.
That's not what I'm talkin' 'bout.
But I will say this.
I've been all over the world.
I've seen some wonderful things.
I haven't been well lately,
I have no one to share my plans,
My dreams, my hopes, my schemes, my...

'could be right.
I've sunk pretty low this time.
Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame.
These are truly desperate times.

Saw your little sandals, baby,
Out behind the wishing well.
Down here in the cool depths of the Quarter,
Where the rich folk dwell.
They picture you in diamonds,
Satins and pearls.
Come on back to Daddy!
Daddy miss his baby girl.
Now, my father, he was an angry man.
You cross him; he made you pay.
I, myself, am no longer an angry man.
Don't make me beg you, ...don't make me beg.

You know what it feels like,
Wake up in the mornin'?
Have every joint in your body aching, goddamit.
You know what it feels like,
Have to get up in the middle of the night?
Sit down, to take a piss?
You do know? So you say.
I have my doubts missy.
Do you know what it feels like,
To have to beg a little bum like you for love?
Goddamn you, you little bitch!
I'd kill you, if I didn't love you so much!

Shame, shame, shame, shame...
Shut up!
Oh, forgive me.
...my unfocused words.
I was flyin' blind, I, I lost my mind.
If ya find it in your heart, if you got one,
To forgive me. Be ever so grateful.
Shame, shame, shame.
Would you stop that please?
Shame, shame, shame.
Would you stop that please?
I'm trying to talk to someone.
Shame.
Thank you.

Had my hair hangin' free down my back
It used to shine in the sun like gold.

Went eight years of grade school
Four years of high school
I was never sick one day
And the kids that were with you in the first grade
Were with you all the way

We'd go over to Augusta for a ball game
We'd all go down to Daytona for the race
We'd go over to the drive-in every Friday
Shining in the sun like gold

Some cold winter morning, outside the school
And the bell hadn't rung just yet
We stand outside the gate, smoke a cigarette
Brushin' the snow off our clothes, and lean against the wall
Shining

And there wasn't no baby cryin'
And there wasn't no laundry waitin' for me on the line
If I didn't want to be alone, I didn't have to be alone
All I had to do was shine
Shining
Shining

Lord it just don't seem right
To cook the same breakfast for the same man every morning
Sleep with the same man every night
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life"

Goin' peep, peep, peep

Merely trying to survive
Took my knapsack in my hand
Caught a train for switzerland

America, america
God she'd his grace on thee
You have whipped the philipino
Now you rule the western sea

Americans dream of gypsies, I have found
Gypsy knives and gypsy thighs
That pound and pound and pound and pound
And african appendages that almost reach the ground
And little boys playing baseball in the rain

Step out into the light
Youre the best dream man has ever dreamed
And may all your christmases be white"

And to say a few words on behalf of the leadership

And sit for a while with you

Why you fine young men had to be blown apart
To defend this mud hole

Now our country, boys
Though it's quite far away
Found itself jeopardized
Endangered, boys
By these very gooks
Who lie here beside you
Forever near

Our deep admiration
For your courage under fire
And your willingness to die
For your country, boys

Why, he's taken off his jacket and he's runnin' free
He's taken off his jacket and he's catchin' me.""

Now there's a moral to this story
For crazy rabbits with dreams of glory
Any rabbit think a dog wear a jacket
Should get out of the rabbit racket.
One dog's brother is another dog's child
And no one likes to see a rabbit smile."
Randy Newman,The One You Love,/r/randy+newman/the+one+you+love_20114091.html,"You've got to learn to get to know the one you love.
To anticipate her ev'ry move,
You got to know exactly what she's thinking of.
She may be hungry but she won't say.
You better get a burger or something in her right away.
If you don't, you're gonna pay
At the hand of the one you love.
(The one you love, the one you love.)

Young man, you're running free, you're running wild.
You fall in love, you become nothing but a little baby child.
She can hurt you with the sound of her voice.
You can leave her but you got no choice.
You can't leave her, man, you're just a pris'ner of the one you love.
(The one you love, the one you love.)

True love never runs smooth, you know.
Sometimes there'll be sunny days,
Sometimes there'll be sleet and snow.
When true love calls you, man, you gotta go.
And when you gotta go, you gotta go.

You got to know the one you love.
You got to know the one you love.
(The one you love, the one you love.
The one you love, the one you love.)

Once, a great man's heart was captured by a lovely chest.
He told himself it was her mind he loved,
But he was blind like all the rest.
Twenty hard years went by
Till another chest will catch his eye.
He just hung his head and cried
And said, ""Sorry dear, you're too late.
I've already ruined my life. ""

You've got to know the one you love.
She may be gentle, she may be kind,
She may not know exactly what's on her mind.
But you better know,
Or you're gonna find you lose the one you love.
(The one you love, the one you love.)
The one you love.
(The one you love, the one you love.)
The one you love
(The one you love, the one you love.)

He took a hard look around
He saw people were starving all over the place
While others were painting the town
The public spirited boy
Became a public spirited man
So he worked very hard and he read everything
Until he came up with a plan

There'll be no exploitation
Of the worker or his kin
No discrimination 'cause of the color of your
Skin
No more private property
It would not be allowed
No one could rise too high
No one could sink too low
Or go under completely like some we all know

If Marx were living today
He'd be rolling around in his grave
And if I had him here in my mansion on the hill
I'd tell him a story t'would give his old heart
A chill

It's something that happened to me
I'd say, Karl I recently stumbled
Into a new family
With two little children in school
Where all little children should be
I went to the orientation
All the young mommies were there
Karl, you never have seen such a glorious sight
As these beautiful women arrayed for the night
Just like countesses, empresses, movie stars and
Queens
And they'd come there with men much like me
Froggish men, unpleasant to see
Were you to kiss one, Karl
Nary a prince would there be

Oh Karl the world isn't fair
It isn't and never will be
They tried out your plan
It brought misery instead
If you'd seen how they worked it
You'd be glad you were dead
Just like I'm glad I'm living in the land of the
Free
Where the rich just get richer
And the poor you don't ever have to see
It would depress us, Karl
Because we care
That the world still isn't fair"

I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
When she'd say I will always love you

From her eye
Looked back to see where she had been

But in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man

Beware, beware, beware of the naked man

Old lady lean against a lamppost, staring down at the ground on which she stand
She look up and screamed
In the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous naked man

They would have strung me up if they could.
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could.

Well he faked to the left and he faked to the right
And the purse was snatched from her hand

In my neighbourhood
We don't live so good
The rooms are small
And the buildings made of wood

I hear the neighbours talking 'bout you and me
I guess I heard it all
'Cause the talk is loud
And the walls are much too thin

He don't really love her
That's what I heard them say
He sure wasn't thinking of her today, oh no
(He wasn't thinking of her today)

I saw them in the front yard
Said the boy in room 149
He was talking to a girl I've never seen before
And standing there together, oh they looked so good

I don't want to hear it anymore
(I don't want to hear it)
I don't want to hear it anymore
(Anymore)
'Cause the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins
The talk is so loud
And the walls are much too thin

Ain't it sad, said the woman down the hall
That when a nice girl falls in love
Ain't it just too bad that she had to fall
For a boy who doesn't care for her at all?
(It's so sad)
I don't want to hear it anymore
(I don't want to hear it)
I just can't stand to hear it anymore
(Anymore)
'Cause the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins
The talk is so loud
And the walls are much too thin

I don't want to hear it anymore
(Can't stand to hear it)
(Don't want to hear it)
I just can't stand to hear it anymore
(Don't talk about it)
(Can't stand to hear it)
Oh, baby, baby
I just can't stand"

Broken windows
In empty hallways
Pale dead moon
And the sky streaked with grey
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to keep love away
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
I think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend

Right before me
The signs implore me
Help the needy
And show them the way
Human kindness, it's overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on it's knees
Being worshiped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn

Listen if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes
I can see is being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feelings should not be rebuffed

It's great to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be defied when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle if he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

All the same it's pretty clear
The scoundrels don't keep much up here
They must have zillions under lock and key
But gods can force then to unleash
Enough to make us nouveau riche
Beyond our wildest dreams so follow me

Can't you see I won't relax
If religious maniacs
Tell me I'm all-powerful and sublime
How can I be their belief
When I'm lying through my teeth
Why don't we just say some other time

It's tough to be a god
But if you get the people's nod
Count your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice
Be nirvana, be salvation
Be all things to all men
Butter up your congregation
Every Sunday score a ten
The alternative is dire
Simply frying pan to fire
So sign on two new gods for paradise"

Will draw you like a flame

The colors that surround you there will be the shade of lavender
Shadows dancing everywhere
Like flowers in the rain
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to lavender
With words you never spoke before
And will not speak again

Oh sweet lavender I understand you perfectly
There is no way that I can see
You living by yourself
Oh sweet lavendar I must be with you constantly
Your presence means so much to me
Much more that life itself

Oh sweet lavender as fragrant as the name you bear
Please cast away the clothes you wear
And give your love to me
Oh sweet lavender your smile is like the golden sun
I'd love to see you laugh and run
As naked as the sea

If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching lavender

They jangle and dangle
While the old guitar rings

Not too wise but oh so free
He'll talk of life out on the street
He'll play it sad and say it sweet
Look into his shining face
Of lonelines you'll always find a trace
Just like me and you
He's tryin' to get into things
More happy than blue

A minstrel of the changin' tide
He'll ask for nothing but his pride
Just sit him down upon that chair
Go fetch some wine and set it there

And follow the fingers where they go
Listen to the strings
They jangle and dangle
While the old guitar rings

A minstrel of the dawn is near
Just like a step 'n fetchit here
He's like an old time troubador
Just wanting life and nothing more
Look into his shining eyes
And if you see a ghost don't be surprised
Like me and you
He's tryin' to get into things
More happy than blue

The minstrel boy will understand
He holds a promise in his hand
He talks of better days ahead
And by his words your fortune's read

Across the room into your mind they go
Listen to the strings
They jangle and dangle
While the old guitar rings

I see that I was wrong
Baby please come home
Well I can't stand to be alone

Somebody somewhere hear my plea
Send my baby home to me
It would make me so glad
Cause no one ever hurt this bad

Sit by my window watch the rain
I hear it beatin' on my window pane
Sit by my window watch the rain
I hear it beatin' on my window pane"

© 1994 Randy Newman Music (ASCAP)

Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life

If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done

Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from

Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light

If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much

Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from

Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

Randy Newman,Sail Away,/l/linda+ronstadt/sail+away_20251027.html,"Written by Randy Newman

In America you get food to eat
Don't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet
You just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day
It's great to be an American

Ain't no lions or tigers
Ain't no mamba snake
Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake
Everybody is as happy as a man can be
So climb aboard little wog and sail away with me

Sail away
Sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay
Sail away
Sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay

In America every man is free
To take care of his home and his family
You'll be as happy as a monkey in a monkey tree
You're all gonna be an American

Sail away
Sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay
Sail away
Sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into Charleston Bay"

Yeah, you've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me

If you've got troubles, I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and can see it through
Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do, it's me and you

Boy, and as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny

Waitin' for a train
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk
Sleepin' in the rain

And they hide their faces
And they hide their eyes
'Cause the city's dyin'
And they don't know why

Buy a big old wagon
Gonna haul us all away

Sarah mc lachlan

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy, so was I, when she loved me.

Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all
Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me.

So the years went by, I stayed the same
And she began to drift away, I was left alone
Still I waited for the day, when she'd say ""i will always love you.""

Lonely and forgotten, never thought she'd look my way,
She smiled at me and held me, just like she used to do,
Like she loved me, when she loved me

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful,
Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
When she loved me."

Don't nobody seem to know me

Fell down on my knee

Sinking, sinking down"

Well, I'm goin' to beat my man until I get satisfied

He says I don't do him right
That I dog him around
Well, babe, you know you ain't treating me right
He says I don't do him right
That I dog him around
Well, it must be this old evil spirit
So deep down within the ground

You may bury my body down by the highway side
... Oh, babe I don't care what you do with my body
You may bury my body down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit can catch a Greyhound bus and ride

* My original transcription used ""friend boy"", after viewing some sheet music I changed it to ""friend poor"". This is a common transcription of Eric's rendition, however after listening closely on the remastered ""Those Were the Days"" it is definitely ""friend-boy"" as in Johnson's take 2 version (which I'm listening to as I write this as I have at last purchased ""The Complete Recordings"" box set). The confusion is caused by Eric mimicing Johnson's accent on the ""boy"". Friend-boy is a dialectic substitute for boyfriend and Willie Brown was a very generous teacher of the blues to Robert.
It is also interesting how Eric has substantially reworked the lyrics, a traditional blues activity shown by the variation in Johnson's own consecutive takes. The ""Going down to Rosedale"" verse is actually lifted from Johnson's musically related ""Traveling Riverside Blues"" and Eric's riff also seems to be partly derived from that song.

Cross Road Blues
By Robert Johnson (rec 27/11/1936, San Antonio, Texas)

I went down to the crossroad, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroad, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above ""Have mercy, save poor Bob, if you please.""

Mmmmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride
Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by

Mmm, the sun goin' down, boy, dark gon' catch me here
Oooo, ooee, eee boy, dark gon' catch me here
I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care

You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.
You can run, tell my friend-boy, Willie Brown.
Lord, that I'm standin' at the crossroad, babe, I believe I'm sinking down."

From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
I believe to my soul that your daddy's Gulfport bound.
From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
You know she won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down.
A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through it's drawers.
A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through it's drawers.
She cause so many men to wear an apron overall.
When I leave this town I will bid you fair farewell.

Well that good girl's leaving,

Took her last nickel from her notion sack

To love and care for me.

Now, you Saturday night women's, you love to ape and clown,
You won't do nothin' but tear good man (i. E Jack White) reputation down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo,

Out of the seed and into the light *
A being pushes me to go
For the same thing and the old sorrow
It catches my tears with laughter
And on the mat a young body rots
Where fate directs it's puppets
For the same thing and the old sorrow
I know at last that nothing is given away here

Out of the seed and into the nothingness
Everyone knows what remains at the end
The same thing and the old sorrow
It drives me slowly to insanity
And the same war rages on the mat
It still always scorches my heart
The same thing and the old sorrow
I know at last...

I want to fuck

Never again, the old sorrow

* The word ""Bohne"" actually means bean. The two lines that begin the two verses that contain it are referring to life growing out of a bean (and into the light or nothingness). Seed sounds much better in English though."

The wave comes and lies down wearily
With a fan every day
The old one makes the water smooth

I throw the stone for fun
The water moves in circles
The old one looks sadly at me
And swept it smooth again

In the white sand, the old man
Trembling, smokes his pipe
Only the water and I know
Why he needs this fan

The idea sleeps like a volcano
Hesitating, I asked him then
His head bent, it seemed he slept
He said before he died

The water shall be your mirror
If it is smooth you will see
How many fairy tales remain for you
And you will plead for your redemption

The fan pressed against his body
The hand stiffens with rigor mortis
They had to break his fingers
The fan remains back in the sand

I call the old one every day
He would like to redeem me
I remain back in the midday's wind
And I can read in the fan

The water shall be your mirror
If it is smooth you will see
How many fairy tales remain for you
And you will plead for your redemption"

Caught between your teeth

It holds me tightly with a thousand arms
And drags me into it's love nest
It devours me completely
And retches me back out after many years

* When Till is just saying ""Du hast,"" it sounds as if he could either be saying ""Du hast"" (you have) or ""Du hasst"" (you hate). This is to give the song a double meaning, even though the official lyrics say ""Du hast.""

** There is another sort of double meaning here. If the line is read as ""Tod der Scheide"" it would be ""until the death of the vagina"" and not ""until death, which would seperate"" (""Tod, der scheide""). The whole song is a play on German wedding vows (Wollen Sie einander lieben und achten und die Treue halten bis dass der Tod euch scheidet? - Do you want to love and respect each other and to remain faithful, until death seperates you?). Instead of answering with ""Ja,"" Till says ""Nein,"" finally answering the question he said nothing to in the beginning."

Where the sea ends

And kissed him on the forehead
She carries the evening in her chest
And knows that she must wither away
She lays her head in his lap
And asks for a last kiss

Where the sea ends
Her lips, delicate and pale

The last kiss was so long ago
The last kiss
He does not remember it anymore"

An army marches through his bowel
The intestines become warm slowly
Nothing is for you
Nothing was for you
Nothing remains for you
Forever

Violins burn with shrieking
Harps cut the flesh
He has opened his eyes
But he is not awake

Nothing was for you
Nothing remains for you

Back into a secret crevice

Searching sand from just last year

Then down it sinks into the sea
Hunger has no mercy"

I have no navel on my stomach
Mother
I was not allowed to lick any nipples
And there was no fold to hide in
No one gave me a name
Fathered in haste and without sperm
For the mother who never gave birth to me
I have sworn tonight
I will send her a sickness
And afterwards make her sink in the river
Mother
An eel lives in her lungs
On my forehead, a birthmark
Remove it with the kiss of a knife
Even if it causes me to die
Mother
An eel lives in her lungs
On my forehead, a birthmark
Remove it with the kiss of a knife
Even if it causes me to bleed to death
Mother
Oh give me strength"
Rammstein,Music Box,/r/rammstein/music+box_20619512.html,"(Translation To: Spieluhr)

A small human only pretends to die
It wanted to be completely alone
The small heart stood still for hours
So they decided it was dead
It is being buried in wet sand
With a music box in its hand

The first snow covers the grave
It woke the child very softly
In a cold winter night
The small heart is awakened

As the frost flew into the child
It wound up the music box
A melody in the wind
And the child sings from the ground

Up and down, rider!
And no angel climbs down
My heart does not beat anymore
Only the rain cries on the grave
Up and down, rider
A melody in the wind
My heart does not beat anymore
And the child sings from the ground

The cold moon, in full magnificence
It hears the cries in the night
And no angel climbs down
Only the rain cries on the grave

Between hard oak boards
It will play with the music box
A melody in the wind
And the child sings from the ground

Up and down, rider!
And no angel climbs down
My heart does not beat anymore
Only the rain cries on the grave
Up and down, rider
A melody in the wind
My heart does not beat anymore
And the child sings from the ground

Up and down, rider!
My heart does not beat anymore

On Dead Sunday they heard
This melody from the graveyard
Then they unearthed it
They saved the small heart in the child

Up and down, rider!
A melody in the wind
My heart does not beat anymore
And the child sings on the ground

Up and down, rider!
And no angel climbs down
My heart does not beat anymore
Only the rain cries on the grave"

With this heart I have the power
To blackmail the eyelids

They come to you in the night
Demons, ghosts, black fairies
They creep out of the cellar shaft
And will look under your bedding
Now, dear children, pay attention
I am the voice from the pillow
I have brought you something
A bright light on the heavens
My heart burns
They come to you in the night
And steal your small hot tears
They wait until the moon awakes
And put them in my cold veins

A bright light on the heavens
My heart burns

Então ele deve ficar perto deles
Durante suas noites, quieto e sem palavras
Uma figura do Senhor
Ele vagarosamente se vira

Ele ajeita suas mãos para rezar

Ele viveu sem uma esposa

O ninho de pecado acima das pernas
Então ele felizmente ajuda a exorcizá-lo

Stop screaming and don't resist

The fish gives to her himself
It shed's it's skin in front of empty testicles
The old skin falls on the floor
He loves his sister
And from the back
Eats it's way through to the mouth
The gills bloody still from sucking
At the red large eyes

It is spawntime
He loves the dog
Oh god, from above
The fish now kisses with the tongue
Spits dead milk into your face
You don't dare to touch him

The sisters don't have time

Stone by stone, I build you in
Stone by stone, I will always be with you

Without clothes, without shoes, you watch me at my work
With feet in cement you improve the appearance of the foundation
There will be a garden outside and nobody hears you screaming

Stone by stone, I build you in
Stone by stone, I will always be with you

What a beating, what a hammering outdoors it catches in to dawn
All nails stand to attention if I put them in your body, wood ramming

Drops them, all the covers

Tensions his imagination to the bow

Paints his colors in her picture

With a sun in his hand

Deep in the water - you don't cross
But my desire - laughs at the wings
Wild wine - like a dove
Wild wine - so wet and hot
Wild wine - before this darkness

A sightless child who creeps and crawls
As it smells it's mother's call
I'll follow you
The scent is fresh and at the crossing
Dripping sweat like virgin blood
I cannot see
(I) can only smell (you). I taste (it) you
As hunger drives a beast of prey
I can sense you miles away
You smell so good
You smell so good
I'll stalk you everywhere
You smell so good

So good, so good

Stop all your crying you can't resist

There is an old tadition,
A game we all can play.
You start by getting liquored up
And sharpening your blade.

You take a shot of whiskey,
You grab your knife and pray
And spread apart your fingers,
And that is what you say:

[pre-refrain]:
Oh!
I have all my fingers,
The knife goes chop! Chop! Chop!
If I miss the spaces in between
My fingers will come off!

And if I hit my fingers,
Blood will soon come out.
But all the same I play this game
Cause that's what it's all about.

[strophe 2]
No, you can't use a pencil!
You can not use a pen!
The only way is with a knife,
When danger is your friend.

And some may call it stupid,
Some may call it dumb.
But all the same we play this game
Because it's so damn fun!

[pre-refrain]:
Oh!
I have all my fingers,
The knife goes chop! Chop! Chop!
If I miss the spaces in between
My fingers will come off!

And if I hit my fingers,
The blood will soon come out.
But all the same I play this game
Cause that's what it's all about.

Then my hand will start to bleed!"

With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

'Frosty the snowman' is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around, oh

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say, he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, “Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away”

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin', “Catch me if you can”

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop or

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', “Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day”

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump

Raffi,Joshua Giraffe,/r/raffi/joshua+giraffe_21364169.html,"Joshua Giraffe was born in a zoo
He lived there, too, for two years
And a half he hasn't had a bath
My mommy doesn't lick me
Even when I'm sticky from
Candy floss, candy apples, popcorn
Soft drinks, jelly beans and gumdrops
And there must be something better
Than living in this cage
But I'm really not too sure
Because I'm rather short of age

Joshua Giraffe was feeling kind of sad
Things were going bad
How little of life he had
Wasting away with no room to play
Trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo
So he went next door to the elephant
And asked him what to do
I'm wasting away with no room to play
I'm trapped in a zoo, with buffalo poo
The elephant was very old and gray
And he had a huge balloon bottom
He said, Never fear Joshua
A vision will appear

That night a dream came to Joshua and
Joshua saw animals, like crazy monkeys
And a whole pile of
Hippypotostropasuses
And flitty moths, frogs size twelve
And sleazy lizards
And a tribe of nasty saviars
But Joshua wasn't afraid
Because he sang himself this song

Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo

Even in his dream he knew
He'd never get away
Not even for a day
Then a peanut hit him on the nose
Joshua Giraffe was back in the zoo
What could he do
Awakened from his dream
He'd never be the same
Because of things he'd seen
He'd seen
Alligators, crocodiles, tree sloths
Anacondas, cobras and
Large winged moths
Orangutans, baboons eating grapes
Gibbons, rude mandrills and just plain apes

But Joshua was lucky
He had some special friends
And that day they went to the zoo
But he was up tight so they waited till the night
And they chopped his cage in two
He discovered he could fly and
He soared into the sky with them
Wrapped around his neck
And they haven't come back yet
So if you see them get a net

That's right, they haven't come back yet
But when they do, they say they are
Going to free all the animals from their cages
No matter how new or modern
Even some pets, too
So if on your way home today
You happen to find

A baboon basking in the balcony
Or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby
Or a python perched in the pantry
A wildebeest in the W.C
With a turtle twirling in your tub
Don't be afraid, just say you're a friend
Of their friend

In love's crazy game

If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I’d be a legend in my time

And there’s no praise or fame
For a heart that’s been broken
Over love that’s in vain

And I when I think of you
I fall in love again

As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill

Do you remember when we parted?
The story to me, you revealed
You said, you could live without love, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years, love
To give you a heart, true and real
'Cos I know you are living in sorrow

The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill"

So bright, for a new star of love is born between the earth and sky
For you and I, there's a new star

The moon was dull, the sky was cold and gray
There were no stars to light my lonely way
And then I traced the love light in your eyes
To a new star twinkling in the sky burning bright, day and night

Now I'm alright, now we're together, lovers forever
A new star, a new star to light our way
There's a new star burning for us, there's a new world turning for us
There's a new star sparkling in the sky

There's a new star shining somewhere
And we know the reason why
There's a new star way up there for a true love
A new star for our love will never die"

She tip toed and kissed his cheek
For this was a true love goodbye

With words so true, they both said, ""I love you""

Then they parted both broken hearted
But they'll meet again some day some way

Before you could draw your gun from the holster
You would surely die

He got word in tucson about his brother john
They heard him say as he left that day
"" I've got to hunt him down
Then i'll throw my gun away""

Lonely night on the trail
He'd listen to the coyotes wail
And sympathise with the cry
For one more man must die

The fastest gun alive is what they say
He caught that man shot him down
Turned and walked away
Yes, he threw his gun away

Blackie dalton was a gun fighter
But he turned his back on the life that he had led
A man remembered from kansas city
Didn't have any pity
He shot blackie dead
Yes he shot blackie dead

Lonely nights on the trail
The cowboys tell a different tale
Blackie didn't really die
No, blackie didn't really die

It's been so long since you dropped by the store
You're still as pretty as you were before
You've still got personality and poise
You were always such a hit with me and the boys

What - you need some candy
A magazine, some toys
To take back home
To bobby and the boys

Yes I remember bobby
Mr. Popularity
Do you ever tell him
How it was with you and me?

Here, take the candy
There'll be no charge for the toys
And give my best
To bobby and the boys

As I lock up, there my baby goes
How much I love that girl, nobody knows
Guess i'll go out to bright lights and noise
While she goes home to bobby and the boys
While she goes home to bobby and the boys"

That beauty is often hidden from another's eyes
But in a quiet moment, her beauty starts to shine
And every night I'm thankful that she's mine
Oh, oh, that she is mine

And she was born to love me in her gentle way
Born to love me each and everyday
Born to love me born to hold me tight
Born to love me every night, every night

I've learned it doesn't matter what other people see
It's what I feel for her and what she feels for me
She's made my life worth living because she understood
That love is made for giving, she's so good
Oh, oh, she's so good

And she was born to love me in her gentle way
Born to love me each and everyday
Born to love me born to hold me tight
Born to love me every night, every night

Borne on the wind, borne on the wind
You are still with me it seems
A life to live, a love to give
And you will live in my dreams

You don't love me
But your love for me, to be in love with you
You led me on, lured me on
But when I fell you were gone

Borne on the wind, borne on the wind
Now a song in my heart
A soft refrain you will remain
To live again and again

When you walk by
I nearly die
What can I say

Things were fine
You were mine
Just yesterday
Now were apart
Breaking up is
Breaking my heart

I find myself
Alone at night
And then I cry
No tenderness
My happiness
Just said goodbye

Now you're gone
I'm alone
I wonder why
We had to part

Breaking up is
Breaking my heart
Baby, breaking up
Is breaking my heart

The love affair
We used to share
Is cold, and still
I loved you then
I love you now
I always will

The day that you
Found someone new
My lonely world
Just fell apart

Out of your arms
Drives me out of my mind
Baby, breaking up
Is breaking my heart
Baby, breaking up
Is breaking my heart

Breaking up
Is breaking my heart

That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

She had the world in the palm of her hand 
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match 
To get brown eyed handsome man 
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Rounding third he was headed for home

With our troubles behind us, tonight 
Go where no one can find us tonight 
With no city to blind us tonight

As the feeling just sweeps over me 
Takes me into the night floating free 
In a skyward direction 
My soul has been freed by your love and affection 

Can't wait till we get back together

I had the world with you
I'd be there
Still be there
In your arms

Careless heart
You'd still be loving me
If not for my

You'd still be mine
I wouldn't haave this hurt inside
I wouldn't have these tears to cry
If not for my
Careless heart
If not for my
Careless heart
I had my chances
I took advantage
I took it all  too far
So now you're gone
And I'm all alone
Alone with my  lonely heart
I let it fall apart
I didn't care enough
I lost your precious love
You'd be here
You'd be here
In my arms
If not for my
Careless heart
You'd still be loving me
If not for my

You'd still be mine

So many changes, changes in the how
Too many changes, changes when you cry

Time brings changes, right or wrong

Maybe someday love
Will come but who can say

What kind of changes come my way

Too many changes, leaving me alone
So many changes now that you are gone"

And afraid of what I ain't

I've no inspiration
I'm kinda yellow...

Creeping toward tomorrow, tomorrow starts it over
Over all the lovin', lovin' and the good times

'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye 
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow 
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow 
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow 
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so 

But if he come and all the roses dying 
And I am dead, as dead I well may be 
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying 
And kneel and say an ava there for me 

And I shall feel, oh soft you tread above me 
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be 
For you will bend and tell me that you love me 
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me"

But how can I hold shadows in my arms?

I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wastin time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin on you  to carry me through

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin blue
The guitars comin through to soothe me

Talking till dawn 
Yet we go on

Don't understand where we begin 
Just drifting apart

Feeling alone
Drifting away 

We can't seem to work it out 
Drifting from day to day
What is it all about
Drifting away
Drifting away
Drifting away
Losing the feeling
And now the music of this song is almost done
And we used to play
From sweet surrender
To drifting away
Drifting

Two lovers lost 
Two rivers crossed 
Drifting,
Two bridges burned
No lessons learned
Drifting

Lonely together
Hurting each other 
Still we can't say that it is over
Can't we bring back yesterday

Will we will be forever
Forever drifting away
Drifting

Youll be mine through laughter or through tears

Evergreen through all the years

And as I sank into her bbaby blues

Tonight at midnight you came by
I shook my head, tried not to cry
Halfway weeping, halfway sleeping
Tossing, turning, trembling, burning
Here it comes, heartache

You wore your hair down
I love it that way
You reached out and touched me
And then you faded away

Its unreal, the way I feel
Its almost dawn and you are gone
Here it comes, heartache

Heartache of heartache
Deeper than blue
Teardrop on teardrop
I'm still in love with you

What a way to start a day
Here it comes, heartache over you
Heartache for you
Everytime you walk through my mind
I get that old heartache

1974 version

At night I try not to cry
Each tomorrow brings more sorrow
All the time you're on my mind
My heart just aches, it almost breaks
Its almost dawn, heartache

I know it's over
But I don't know why
You reached out and touched me
And then you said goodbye

Oh it's unreal, the way I feel
Its almost dawn the nights too long
My dream is gone
I'm all alone with heartache

Heartache of heartache
Deeper than blue
Teardrop on teardrop
I'm still in love with you

Only make a move or two, I was just a young fool
Never been to night school, didn't know enough to be cool

So she found another lover, they went undercover
The way she stole our love was a crime
In order to keep the peace, callin' out the police
Find her before I lose my mind

The woman I love has gone and left me alone
She got a big bad record on the heartbreak radio

A complete investigation, what's her destination
Did she leave a trace at all?
Book her on suspicion, just look at my condition
She left me here to take the fall

That girl can surely play it rough, she oughta be in handcuffs
Make her wear a ball n' chain, she's just a heart stealer
Sweetest kind'a love dealer, she knows how to fix a game

The woman I love has gone and left me alone
She got a big bad record on the heartbreak radio

Lonely hearts in distress, calling out an sos
All across the you. S of A, come on back and serve your time
Right here in these arms of mine, gotta have you home today
Fbi, cid, help me, help me, help me please

Oh, the woman I love has gone and left me alone
She got a big bad record on the heartbreak radio

I miss your caress
I reach out to hold you
But you're not there
Its just my blue blue mood.

Maybe, someday, yeah love will come
And stay, and things will turn
How bright, oh oh oh but for tonight

He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome, I could cry
I'm so lonesome, I could cry"

And I know that I'm the man on Susie's mind

I'm the pretty dress she buys
I'm the little bug she drives
I'm the picture that she shows
To everybody that she knows

I'm the wiggle in her walk
I'm the giggle in her talk
I'm the happy little song she sings
She wears my love for all to see

Sail on by silver moon
I won't follow you this time
I've got heaven in my arms tonight

I'm the stops on her way home
I'm the dime in the telephone
I'm the honey that she talks about
I'm old meanie when she pouts

I'm the carpet beneath her feet
Every night before she sleeps
I'm the pillow where she lays her head
I'm the last word that she said

A candy-colored clown they call the sandman
Tiptoes to my room every night
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper:
""Go to sleep, everything is alright""

I close my eyes
Then I drift away
Into the magic night
I softly say
A silent prayer
Like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep
To dream my dreams of you

In dreams... I walk with you
In dreams... I talk to you
In dreams... Your mine

All of the time
We're together
In dreams... In dreams

But just before the dawn
I awake and find you gone
I can't help it... I can't help it
If I cry
I remember
That you said goodbye
To end all these things
And I'll be happy in my dreams
Only in dreams
In beautiful dreams"

The way that you used everything that god gave you 
I gave you my heart like a child, one moment you took me to heaven 
Took me back to earth and then before I woke up to the fact I was small you took me back to heaven again 

And I remember the Indian summer how you held me, how you loved me (Loved me loved me) 
The world may give me a million reasons but reasons don't make it wrong 
Every lesson I learned has a price in return I was lost in my youth and to tell you the truth 
I was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die 
Just to hear you that sees me through, oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you 

So many hearts have been broken (Dum dumb dumb dumb-by Do Wah) 
You had no trouble with mine like a fool I was there for the taking (but then) 
It was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing 
Just knowing you've already paid but you can't live alone in an Indian Summer at 110 in the shade 

And I remember (and I remember) The Indian Summer 
How you held me in the moonlight 

We were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head 
and if I'd known I'd lose you the moment I found you I'd love you all over again 

'cause I'm still empty (I'm still empty) Come fill me ( Come fill me) 
With a fire of love your flame will follow flame 'cause it's all I want to do 

Oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you

Yellow hand brought her a golden feather
White sands said a prayer for good weather
The ceremonial dance grew loud and strong
Then yellow hand began their wedding song

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tonight, tonight, we will be one
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun
Oh white sands, come hold my lonely hand

Then they left the warmth of the raging fire
And rode into the hills climbing higher
And suddenly the snow came swirling down
They were lost the trail could not be found

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh
Tonight, tonight we will be one
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun
Oh white sands, come hold my lonely hand

They never returned from Paradise
They went to their places in the sky
And the old ones still say when the snowflakes fly
If you'll listen close you'll hear him cry

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Tonight, tonight we will be one
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun
Oh white sands, come hold my lonely hand"

The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk

Because his heart was made of knotty pine

Is it any wonder that his face is red?

Kaw-liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair

So she could never answer, yes or no

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?

Then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away but old kaw-liga stayed

And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee.

Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee.

Yes, oh, yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge. I'll pay.
But which loved one is calling me? I did not hear you say.
Both are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie.
It's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee.

Oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know.
Surely you have not forgot how much I love you so.
If you would remember, dear, and sometimes talk to me.
Maybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee.

Last time I saw you, just before I had to leave.
You didn't want to see me off, and promised not to grieve.
My heart was torn apart, as I looked back at Marie.
And there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee.

I Guess I should stop talking, after all, you placed the call.
But any way that I can help. you know I'll help you all.

When you my friend are wrong. 
Not to do what you want to 
Just because it's wrong. 

Well then my friend in passing. 
We've been friends too long. 
And I my friend must tell you, 
Leave that woman alone. 

Your little girls might not understand, 
And you know the baby would cry. 
And what would you do if their mommy knew, 
And she told you ""goodbye""? 

Let it end my friend say it's over, 
And thank the stars above. 
That you've got a home to run to, 
And a sweet sweet woman to love. 
I must say my friend if you stay my friend. 
Leave that woman alone.leave my woman alone."
Roy Orbison,My Prayer,/r/roy+orbison/my+prayer_20119074.html,"Words and music by jimmy kennedy and georges boulanger

When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With the world far away and your lips close to mine

Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know

My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer"
Roy Orbison,Mystery Girl,/r/roy+orbison/mystery+girl_20119286.html,"Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land where all but love is gray
Where time just slips away without her as my guide

Night falls, I'm cast beneath here spell
Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally?

She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

In the night of love, words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear, a love so sharp it cuts
Like a switchblade to my heart, words tearing me apart

She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries then I just melt away

She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl, she's a mystery girl

Haunted by her side the darkness in her eyes
But that so enslaves me, if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see, she's a mystery to me

Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally?

She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl

Never again
To be lonely again

Heartaches have left me now forever

I've burned the old love letters that you wrote to me
Discovered love, I thought could never be
A love as sweet as wine, keeps you off my mind
I said goodbye to my misery

Memories will never bother me again
And when I think of things that might have been
I just pledge my love to my new love
And then we kiss again

And oh, what a feeling just to know
That never again, never again, never again
I've found a love to last forever

Tennessee, trying to make a livin's going to
Be the death of me

Doing my best to catch my breath
'Til I hit the road again the only thing I know
How to do is keep on rambling on
I guess I won't be home 'till I'm dead and gone

Go find another fella if you want to, I won't say

And now it's clear that she is what - I should have held onto.

They say hindsight's 20-20 but I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
It's that same old lost love story - it's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine in Nineteen-Eighty-Two.

Postman can you sell me - a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her, now I know - how long my love will last.

From the smoke it's hard to tell
What's coming down the line
We heard you were a fast train
Coming out of Caroline
We wondered what you were haulin'
When you rolled into to town
Say it's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

You must have felt that same old feeling
More than once or twice
Guitars pressed against our hearts
Under the neon lights
I've got to say that feeling is the best that I have found
Lord it's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

There's a lot of truth you know
In our kind of songs
About the life you're living
And how love's done you wrong
As long as there's a jukebox
And a honky tonk in town
It's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around

It's good to know there's still
A few ol' country boys around"

There in your mother's arms
An angel told me always you will be
A gift of love from God to me

Though your road is long
I'll be right by your side
Through changes you'll see always you will be
A gift of love from God to me

Love took flight the day you came into my life
There is magic in the way I feel
Hearts opened wide gazing into your eyes
I'll be there for you
As long as I am alive

I have never loved
More than I love you
A gift for free always you will be
A gift of love from God to me"

This ole heart of mine
Is now showing signs
From the wear and tear of times
You have taken it and crushed it
Then came close to throwing it away
Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do
Always hits right where it hurts
It's a heartache in the works

Looking through my tears
It's hard to see you care
When I know that you don't hear
When I lie away beside you
And cry til I see the light of day

Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do
Always hits right where it hurts
It's a heartache in the works

It's hard to keep surviving
When love is slowly dying
And all the pain without keeps building up

Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do
Always hits right where it hurts
It's a heartache in the works

Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do
Always hits right where it hurts
It's a heartache in the works

Shattered inside and scattered around
Were pieces of her broken heart
I gathered her up, the pieces I found
I put her back together like a busted guitar
But osme glue holds and some glue don't In spite of everything I tried
Somebody's stole my darlin'
Right before my very eyes

He didn't walk, talk or push his way in
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playin' no harp
As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart

Copin' with hone and hoping i'm wrong
But I sure see a definite change
There's look in her eyes that's sayin' goodbye
And her snuggle when I hold her don't feel the same
The way her heart bests for that sneaky theif
You would picture him dark and tall
But the feller that stole my darlin'
Lord, he'd have to be very small

He didn't walk, talk or push his way in
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playin' no harp
As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart

As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart
Lord, he must've craweled through
A little bitty crack in her heart"

I talk to the man up there in the moon
I know I may sound like somebody gone insane
I'm a fool about you baby but my heart can't explain

It's a little left of center
By heavenly design
Love gets carried away
And goes wild at times
When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart

It leaps like a frog when you touch my hand
It means like a drum in a marching band
Can't help what it does I just follow where it leads
How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me

It's a little left of center
By heavenly design
Love gets carried away
And goes wild at times

Stronger than an old oak tree
But all you ever wanted was the one thing
I never let you see -
The tender side of me
I tried to be a mountain, solid and strong
All it took was your leaving to know I was wrong

A man aint made of stone
A man aint made of steel
The way I feel right now
I thought I'd never feel
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know
A man aint made of stone

In this world of mine
There was no room for weakness
I covered every crack in the wall
But there aint no way that I can keep this secret
Cos when you go like jerico I fall
You thought I wouldn't shatter
Would I even care?
But there's more to what I'm made of
Than this broken heart can bare

A man aint made of steel

Bright shining as the sun.

And is there or isn't there angels on earth

Well you can take that for what it's worth
If it's something I can see or something I can touch
Well I might believe in all that stuff
So I just had to say to him

Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by?
No robe of white
No halo in site
Well you missed the most obvious thing
Man, are you blind?
Just look in your mothers eyes

And then I said who went through the pain
And smiled through the tears on the day of your birth?
She counted your fingers and toes and thank god you were whole
Son you outta know who loved you first, that's right
And who always came running everytime you cried out
And how many more things have you forgotten about
And who tried their best to teach you wrong from right
And how many nights did she leave on the light
While she waited and prayed that you came in
And who'd be there for you right up to the end
Think about it tonight

Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel?
Never felt the presence of one standing by?
No robe of white
No halo in site
Well you missed the most obvious thing

Just look in your mothers eyes

Can't fly away like flies on a hog
We're really just along for the ride like ants on a log

He plays a game
Can't win it
He's got a mold
Tries to fit everybody else in it
When's he gonna learn he's bangin his head on the wall?
He ain't gonna change
And he looks at me strange when I tell him

We yella t the cars and the traffic

Lookin down at us and laughin

And the world tips over

Up with the new.
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth.

Cradled up in the arms of the Lord

There was Glory in the air,
There was dinner on the ground.
And my sins, which were many,
Were washed away and gone,
Along with the Buffalo Nickle,
I forgot to leave at home.

But, that seemed like such a small, small price to pay,
For the blessed peace of mind,
That came to me that day.

Singing weird melodies

Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note

I need somebody's help

I am a young man growin' wild across this land
Come see about me

Come see about me
I'm somebody's children alone and forsaken, a wave
That's lost at sea
I'm right here behind you, I'm all around you,
So slow down
Turn around and you will see

I'm your mother, your sister and your brother
Come see about me

Come see about me

Way back in the sticks.

And burn their hide
And there ain't no rough string
He can't ride
But cuttin' the rug is how he
Gets his kicks.

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way

Come a ti-i youpy, youpy yi I youpy, youpy ya.

So it's adios to his old payoose
And down the road to turn it loose
At an old dance hall
He cuts a gal now straight
Spins her sideways through the herd
He's buckin' like he's being spurred
Twistin' and rockin' like a bronc
Comin' outta the gate.

Clouds roll in
And cover the sun
A new day begins

And it already feels like forever
It's over and done
So what can I do?
Day one
Of putting my life back together
Day one
Of learning to live without you

Gold ring
There on the bed
Oh my God
She meant what she said
No place to hide
No where to run
Just dying inside

Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
But that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew

My love is deeper that the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill

From the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper that the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill

They might as well go on and tell us both good-bye
Because you've come to be, my heart and soul
The air I breathe or reason there's life in these bones
So I've made up my mind, girl if it's your time

They can dig two graves, just carve one stone
Because without you here, I won't last long
Your love's the blood, running through these vines
So if he calls you home, they can dig two graves
Sure let the good lord one ask me to be that strong
Because is kills me just to think about you being gone

They can dig two graves, just carve one stone

Always took his share of the blame
Had a heart big enough to fill a valley up
But hard enough to stop a train
He said only fight when you have to
'Cause there's always a faster gun
And you'll know a hero from a coward
When you see which way they run

To ease this pain and take my pride

Laid open wide

Of all I have to do

Cracker crumbs and a little shot glass
I was starvin' to death 'cause I didn't know Jesus yet
But I was saved by a month-old Twinkie in my corduroy coat
When every head bowed, every eye closed

Amazing Grace don't make a sound
Or Momma's gonna wear that backside out while shoutin' hallelujah
If you raised your hand or came on down
To repent of your sins there'd be little kid starin' a hole right through ya
But I wasn't no angel so I wasn't gonna throw no stones
When every head bowed, every eye closed

Pass the plate and altar call
Every verse of ""I Surrender All""
Squirming in my seat tummy growlin' like a grizzly bear
We'd hit the door when the service closed
Hopped in the car, burned up the road
Straight to kfc 'cause we're gonna beat the Catholics there
While they're still confessing we were blessing our mashed potatoes
When every head bowed, every eye closed

While Daddy says grace put that fork back down
Or Momma's gonna wear that backside out while shoutin' hallelujah
I could have sworn I lost 15 pounds
Lust for finger-lickin' greasy fried chicken burns a hole right through ya
Daddy's still prayin' everybody's dinner's done got cold

Guess he thought it was a pretty good show

I don't have faith in technology,

All this stuff just breaks down anyway,
And you can never get it fixed.

I don't have faith in politics,
But I do believe in the will of the people.
I don't know much about big time religion
But I believe in the cross on the steeple.
And I do have faith in you.

[Bridge:]

And after all this time the lie becomes the truth
We traded in our innocence and sacrificed our youth.
But you give me your love the one thing I can't lose
You believe in me,
And I still have faith in you.

[Interlude:]

The more I search for my significance,
Seems the more I disappear.
And I wonder, have I made a difference in anybody's life
Since I've been here.
And I can hear your laughter it's the sweetest sound I've ever known.
I don't know how love happens,
But I know I'm not alone.
And I do have faith in you.

[Bridge:]

And after all this time sometimes I see the truth
And I'm touched by your innocence and
Now I'm not confused.
You give my your love, the one thing I can't lose.
You believe in me,
And I still have faith in...

Randy Travis,Feet On The Rock,/r/randy+travis/feet+on+the+rock_20202090.html,"Well I wanna talk to you for a minute,
About an old man I met,
He said, Boy, you look in trouble,
And I bet your life's a mess,
He said, I used to have the same problem too,
I was way out of control,
You know the only thing that set it right for me,
Was a little good old rock and roll,

(Chorus 1)
I put my feet on the rock,
And my name on the roll,
When it's called up yonder,
I won't worry 'bout my soul,
I know my home is waiting,
And it's something to behold,
I put my feet on the rock,
And my name on the roll,

[Verse 2:]
I'd never heard the gosple,
Spread like that before,
I guess the message comes in many ways,
Those simple words of wisdom,
Can open heaven's door,
So every time I get the chance I say,

(Chorus 2)
Come on, put your feet on the rock,
And your name on the roll,
When it's called up yonder,
You won't worry 'bout your soul,
You know your home is waiting,
And it's something to behold,
So put your feet on the rock,
And your name on the roll,

This love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray

I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out
Well I'd love you anyway

Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see
It's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you
Oh darling

I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen

Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife.
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need,

Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Here I am, ring on my finger:
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up.
I found my rock and I plan to keep her.
I wish they were here to see the two of us.
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

With the highway twice as wide,
And the farmland sub-divided.
It's good to know that some things never change.
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin',
By those simple words of wisdom:
Life an' love come down to just four things.

My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him,
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life.
And each day, I count my blessings,
To have that kind of love here by my side.
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Yeah, we've got everything that we need,
Between the two of us:

No hammer was swingin' cause cheatin' and drinkin'
Don't need no help wreckin' a home
Ah, but when he came back through the dust and the rubble
Of what he had once called his life
He dropped to his knees in sheer disbelief of the total destruction inside

There were empty closets and empty drawers
And a tearstained note on the kitchen floor
And burning memories in the fireplace
He waited too late to say he was wrong
His house was still standing but his home was gone
Brother, you would not believe
What you can see from your knees

Right then and there in an old sinner's prayer
He told things he'd kept in the dark
There was no use in lying cause the man who was listening
Could see every room in his heart
Ah, he took empty whisky bottles, little black book and all
To the fire she left on the grate
Ah, sometimes a man will change on his own
But sometimes I tell you it takes

Empty closets and empty drawers
And a tearstained note on the kitchen floor
And burning memories in the fireplace
He waited to late to say he was wrong
His house was still standing he'd fight for his home

And if I can see you're in good hands
Maybe I can make it without you

You look so happy by his side
And I'm sure you'll make a lovely bride
And he loves you, any fool can plainly see

And I determined not to let her down
Deserted by the man she loved and left to raise four children
We were the local gossip of the town.

I promised her that I'd live right and not be like the others
But I wound up in jail on Chrismas day
I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers
When I got home my mom had passed away

And I hear tell the road to hell is paved with good intentions
And mama my intentions were the best
There's lotsa things in my life I just as soon not mention
Looks like I've turned out like all the rest
But mama my intentions were the best

A little boy with big blue eyes a-beggin' to go fishing
I promised him but never took the time
Now they won't let me see him and I sit here a-wishing
Wishin' I could hold him one more time

And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart

It's foundation is on solid ground
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down

He said he was a cowboy when he was young.
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,--
And I thought that he walked on water.

Chorus

If the story's told,  only heaven knows.
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo.
And although his wings,  they were never seen.
I thought that he walked on water.

Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,
And said, ""Son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot.""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed  alot.
Then I'd flop down beside him.

And he was ninety years old in sixty-three
And I loved him and he loved me.
And lord, I cried the day  he died,

'cause I thought that he walked on water.

Could jump through the moon and scale across the sky

With nothing more than the sweet by and by
And trailin behind is a horse with no rider
A horse he calls Memories that she used to ride

And he sang Oooh to the ladies
And Oooh he damn near made some fall right down and die
Now he rides away on a horse he called Music
With a pain in his heart, and a tear in his eye

High on a mountain in western Montana
Two crosses cut through a cinammon sky
Marking a place where a horse he called Music
Lays with a cowboy in the sweet by and by"

Carolers are singing
Snowflakes drifting
Through the air
Everybody's shopping
Got no time for stopping
It looks like Christmas
Is here

So tell me
How do I wrap my heart up
For Christmas
I wanna give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift
I'm givin'
Your lovin' ares
Will have to do

At first
I though of giving you
A pretty diamond ring
Wore myself out shopping
For a million other things
Finally decided
On something you can't buy
But how will I disguise it
So you will be surprised

How do I wrap my heart up
For Christmas
I wanna give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift
I'm givin'
Your lovin' ares
Will have to do

A gift of love
Was given to
The world so long ago
Laying in a manger
He was wrapped
In swadlin' clothes
And every year
We celebrate
And thank the Lord above
And give to one another
Our little gifts of love

How do I wrap my heart up
For Christmas
I wanna give it to you
Pretty bows and ribbons
Don't fit the gift
I'm givin'

Will have to do

Many nights, I've stood here by this window
Wondering if I'd always be alone
No one here to share this lonely bedroom
But that was long before she came along

Heaven only knows she's not an angel
But I was blessed the day she came to me
And when I close my eyes and lay beside her
I'll swear I can almost hear her wings

I never stopped to watch an evening sunset
Or tired to count the stars up in the sky
I never knew the world held so much beauty
Until I saw it through my baby's eyes

Heaven only knows she's not an angel

I felt weak inside
I searched my heart and mind
For words I couldn't find
Somehow you seemed to see
What came over me that night
As a love began to grow
That would last for all time

And you said,
I can see it in your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
Sometimes they say more
Than words could ever hold
We could wait a thousand lifetimes
And never feel like this again
But when you look at me that way
I can see it in your eyes

Later on I asked your hand
And I prayed the time was right
I knelt down on one knee
And said would you be my bride?
And the sound of silence
Filled the air
As your tears fell with mine
You didn't have to say a word
For me to realize

And I said,
I can see it in your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
I see dreams come alive
And future plans unfold
I could wait a thousand lifetimes
And not find a perfect love again
But when you look at me that way
I can see it in your eyes

Many years have come and gone
And what a life we've made
How again we search for words
As the heart inside me breaks
Until death do we part
Were the vows we made
And now the time has come
But goodbye is so hard to say

I can see it your eyes
They're the windows to your soul
The light of life is burning low
Soon you're leaving me I know
The time that's left is precious dear
So please don't she'd another tear
You don't have to say a word
I can see it in your eyes

I've heard you say a thousand times
I'll love you dear until I die

And suppose I said ""I wanna come back home"".

And I'm tired a-spendin' all my time alone. ""

If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say:

""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours to and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin', would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began?

Would you tell me that you'd missed me too and that you'd been so lonely
And you waited for the day that I return.
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

Would you say:

Once upon a time in our life
We held the key to every door
And I that I desired
Was you forever more
I found love in a heart
Once broken far beyond repair
And you restored a sole
That had forgotten how to care
Everything we needed
Was at our beckon call
With you and I together
We could conquer all
When I needed badly
To be cheered up for a while
You were there
And all you had to do was simply smile
And holding things together
Was so easy for us to do
For you could turn to me for help
And I could turn to you
And jealousy was something
That never entered our hearts
For we were made for one another
No matter where we are
When things were at there darkest
I could hold you next to me

And I knew all would be okay
For you were strong and I was weak
So given every chance for me
To start my life anew
There'd be no question

I'd do it all again with you"

Can bring a man to crawl

And I'd surrender all
To bring you back to me
Give up everything I own
Get down on my hands and knees
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all

Now I'm staring out the window
Praying every passing car would bring you home
So I could take you in my arms
And give the kind of love
You should have known

And I'd surrender all

Give up everything I own
Get down on my hands and knees
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all

Since my phone still aint ringing
I assume it still aint you

But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth
And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of pure prevention
And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing I've ever tried to

Go on, go on  Til you reach the end of the line
Cause I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
Remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know  That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
It's just a matter of time

Words are spoken with chords played
Someday and Someway
Girl you'll realise that you've been blind
Yes Darling, I know you gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know  That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time"

I don't want to let her see me cry
And the part of me that's breaking
Is The part that has been taking her for granted
And that's why she said goodbye

I twas me that let her down and left her lonely
But her leaving me was never in my plan
It started with my lying
And it ended with me crying
And she's taken all the lonely she can stand

It's out of my hands now
It's over and done
She's made her choice now
And I'm not the one
She'll find her future with some other man
It was all up to me but I just couldn't see
Now it's out of my hands.

She tried every way she knew to make me happy
She was more than just a lover and a friend
I was just too blind to see
And now she set me free
So it's best to walk away and let it end

It's out of my hands now
It's over and done
She's made her choice now
And I'm not the one
She'll find her future with some other man
It was all up to me but I just couldn't see
Now it's out of my hands."

Can you see the storm on the rise
Look around you can;t deny
This is the hour of heaven's time
Armies gather in the East
For the war that's soon to come
Death will march with the mark of the beast
So seek the Light and walk with the Son

Soon we'll see His wrath come down
And the Lord descending from the sky
When you hear the trumpets sound
God has answered Jerusalem's cry

When the sun goes black
And the moon blood red
And the stars fall from the sky
The Word of God in the Bible says
We're living in the end times

Soon we'll see His wrath come down
And the Lord descending from the sky
When you hear the trumpets sound
God has answered Jerusalem's cry

Soon the dead in Christ will rise
And join Him in he sky
Even unbelivers will see
God has answered Jerusalem's cry

You could hear a woman cry in the alleyway that night on the streets of David's town
And the stable was not clean and the cobblestones were cold
And little Mary full of grace with tears upon her face had no mother's hand to hold

It was a labor of pain, it was a cold sky above
But for the girl on the ground in the dark with every beat of her beautiful heart
It was a labor of love

Noble Joseph by her side, callused hands and weary eyes
No midwives to be found on the streets of David's town in the middle of the night
So he held her and he prayed, shafts of moonlight on his face
But the baby in her womb, he was the maker of the moon
He was the Author of the Faith that could make the mountains move

It was a labor of pain, it was a cold sky above
But for the girl on the ground in the dark with every beat of her beautiful heart
It was a labor of love

For little Mary full of grace, with tears on her face
It was a labor of love

It was not a silent night, on the streets of David's town"

Thought there was something waiting out there
Something I wanted but now it's so clear

Baby it's a cold, cold world
Out here tonight
It's nothing at all like I thought I'd find
So if you wonder why I'm standing here
I'm a little long on lonely, a little short on pride

If you slam the door, I wouldn't blame you
You've got every reason to turn me down
I was so sure I had the answers
After what I've been through, I'm not sure now

No net, just you to catch me when I fall

To find the confidence and strength I need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly.
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here.

To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man

When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive

That my heart could always fool my head
So I tripped and fell a lot
Learning what true love was not
Till one evening Mama said we ought to talk

Chorus
She said love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
You lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must shake off those blues
Just remember you've got nothing to lose
But you've had true love since the day you were born
Since the day you were born

Then she told me all she knew
About what makes true love true
And it hasn't much to do with heat
Young hearts race and then grow still
Passion cools and always will
But a river just keeps filling up the sea

Chorus
You see love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
You lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break
You bet your sweet dreams
Won't get tattered and torn
But when that happens
You must dream up some more
When you find it you'll have seen it before
But you've had true love
Since the day you were born

Love is a gamble
It's a chance that you take
To lay your heart down
And you bet it won't break

And women that sparkle shiny and cold
Like a statue carved out of ice
They shimmer like tinsel
On a blue Christmas night
But they never were quite so bright

When you're mining for coal

But you became flawless
When you were you polished by love

Loretta said this ain't no kind of way to raise a family
And one night she called it quits and called a cab
She left her clothes out on the clothes line
And the dishes in the sink
So I guess she knows that she ain't coming back

Well I just want to see my kids
I just want to hold my girls
Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ole world
I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved
I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was

Now lately she's been knowin' this old boy she met in church
And I can't say she's wrong for wanting more
I gave him the right to tell my wife that I can't come around
The night I knocked a hole in her front door
And Loretta tooks my keys and she made me wait outside
But she didn't call the law she called a cab
And as I pulled away I saw something in her eyes
So I reckon that she knows I ain't so bad

I just want to see my kids
I just want to hold my girls
Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ole world
I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved
I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was

Well my boss will tell you that I've been to work all week on time
And I ain't had no liquor on my breathe"

May lay between us
But only for the job
I choose to do

And what part helps me
Through my darkest hours,
Each mile brings me
Closer to you

(Chorus)
Please believe you're
All I ever wanted
If you should leave
I don't know what I'd do

I'd be like a child
Afraid of darkness
The greatest fear I have
Is losing you

Heaven knows I've always
Had these demons
Watchin for a place
To take control

Whispering you'll never
Be there for me
Waiting at the end
Of my road

Alone I wander through this world,
No meaning in my life
Then I found you
And finally saw the light

Can't deny the hurt was deep the way you slammed that door and walked right out

Break shatterd dreams lay every where broken promises are all we share I
Finally took all I could take my heart cacked but it did not break well I was

But it still holds my treasures
Things that will never be sold
There's a few things in this world
That just can't be measured
By money, by silver and gold

My house is filled with the things that I love
From her smile in the mornin'
To her soft goodnight hugs
Her whisper, her laughter
Everything that she does
My house is filled with the things that I love

This old bed that we sleep on
Don't have satin covers
But it holds some great memories
No decorations can make better lovers
In her arms I feel like a king
My house is filled with the things that I love
From her smile in the mornin'
To her soft goodnight hugs

Up front and on the table.

Just to see 'em tear it apart

Well there's my easy chair, just sittin' there,
I've spent a lot of time,
Thinkin' of this perfect love,
I know is yours and mine.
And oh, I know how I love that old picture on the wall,
Of you and me and the kids.
My most favourite times in life,
I've spent right here where we live.

There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
It just hit me as I was leavin',
There's no place like home.

From the bedroom, I smell perfume;
My favourite kind you wore.
And it brings back mem'ries of all those nights,
Behind our bedroom door.
And the saddest thing, I think, I've ever seen,
Was my closet all cleaned out.
It's sad to think that one must leave,
'Cos we can't work things out.

There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
It just hit me as I was leavin',
There's no place like home.

So, baby, say that I can stay,
For just a day or so.
Then maybe I can change your mind,
And I won't have to go.

Just look into these baby blues,
And tell me it's ok.
I love that smile, it drives me wild,
No, love won't die today.

There's no place like home.
There's no place like home."

I know a man we call him poor boy Jones
He's never been a 100 miles from home
He's got a pretty good farm
And a level head
A heart of gold

No satelite dish for his tv set
And he ain't on lie with the internet
He says guitar music entertains us here
And it sounds real good to the untrained ear

And I can't find a rason to echange
More of this and more of that
Has never been my game
The way I've got it figured out
I ain't missed a thing
And I can't find a reason to change

Some people like to fly around first class
But a greyhound bus goes pretty dang fast
Been a while lot of times when time were lean
A big night out was a Dairy Queen
He says all my children believe in god
They can hold their own
They can hold a job
There's a whole lot of color in the human race
And loving one another makes a better place

And I can't find a rason to echange
More of this and more of that
Has never been my game

Oscar was an angel and he used to walk the streets
Shoutin' out some prophesies at everyone he'd meet
He was a local fixture; like a cop out on a beat
Folks said he'd been shell-shocked long ago
And more than that for no one seemed to know
Oscar was a walker; at least four miles twice a day
The entire lenght of Main Street he'd be shoutin' all the way
And I had no idea where he heard the things he'd say
But he was not your normal voice of doom;
It was a happy song sung slightly out of tune

Refrain:

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven and we will all be angels
Someday and what you are in this world don't count for nothin' 'cause we are
Only children, we're just lost along the way, but we will all be angels
Someday""

Verse 2:

Well, I worked at the Rialto; I sold tickets at the door
And Oscar, he'd come by most everyday by half past four
And he'd pay to see some movie that he'd seen ten times before
But mostly we'd just let him in for free
Then he'd watch five minutes, then he'd come and talk to me

Refrain:

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven and we will all be angels
Someday and what you are in this world don't count for nothin'. For we are only
Children, we're just lost along the way, but we will all be angels
Someday""

Verse 3:

Well, it's going on ten years now
Since I left my hometown
And I went back last summer
For a week I hung around
I looked out for Oscar, he was no where to be found
And someone said they finally had to commit him
And he died before they had time to forget him
Now, I'm not about to argue, Oscar's train had jumped the track
But I'll bet my last dollar on the plain and simple fact
Oscar never said a word about me behind my back
And the way that I was raised to understand
Well, that bone, it makes him the better man

Refrain:

And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to heaven and we will all be angels
Someday and what you are in this world don't count for nothin'. For we are only
Children, we're just lost along the way, but we will all be angels

A virgin would be found to be with child and give birth to our King
And they laid Him in a manger in the town of Bethlehem
Born there in a stable 'cause there was no room in the Inn

And when He grew to be a man He began to teach
He came just for you and me to set the captives free
And He gladly gave His life for us, without one word He died
So we could live forever in Heaven by His side

And He gladly gave his life for us, without one word He died
So we could live forever in Heaven by His side

And all He asks of you and me is simply to believe
That baby boy in Bethlehem truly was our King"

Chorus:

Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
Keep walking till the hurting stops
Keep walking till my temperature drops
Keep walking till the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones

I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones

Sweet amnesia come and set me free
I just need to get you out of me"

Cities I have seen,
With concrete caverns rising from the ground.
Miles and miles of asphalt trail,
Stretch across a land,
Stampeding metal ponies leaving smoke along the way...

I'm going back to paniolo county,
Stars at night
No city lights.
Paniolo country, my home on the range.

I made up my mind, won't waste any time
I'm going back to where the clouds ride high.
Take my word it's pretty, not like the great big city
The winds still bring cool clear mountian air.

I'm going back to paniolo country
Rain drops fall, the grass grows tall
Paniolo county, my home on the range."

And the night, night is as fair as the day.
There will be peace in the valley
For me some day
There will be peace in the valley
For me, Oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness
No sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace
In the valley for me.
Well, the flowers will be blooming
And the grass will be green
And the skies will be clear and serene
Where the sun ever beams
In this valley of dreams
And no cloud will be seen.
There will be peace in the valley
For me some day
There will be peace in the valley
For me, Oh Lord. I pray
There'll be no sadness
No sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace
In the valley for me.
Well, the bear will be gentle
And the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down
By the lamb, oh
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed,
Changed from this creature that I am.
There will be peace in the valley
For me some day

There'll be no sadness
No sorrow, no trouble I see

The anger deep in your heart
You're the only one that it's hurting
You're the one that it's tearing apart
I'm sorry that he broke your heart girl
But it's time to let it go

Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row

He shattered your expectations
He broke all his promises too
With his little white lies he looked in your eyes
And made you believe they were true
Aw but this ain't the final curtain
Girl it's time to get on the show

Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row

It's been far too long now
Since I've seen your smile
Your bitterness don't look good on you
And self pity just ain't your style
Sooner or later you know you've got to play the card you've drawn
It's all up to you
You can stay blue or you can move on

Ain't it hard when you discover
Things ain't what you thought they would be
When all of your best played plans
Hit the wall of reality
Still all in all it's a good life
But it sure can be painful I know

Sometimes love is a river of tears pick up the oars and row
Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and go"
Randy Travis,Point Of Light,/r/randy+travis/point+of+light_20114223.html,"(Don Schlitz/Thom Schuyler)

There's a point when you cannot walk away
There's a darkness that everyone must face
There are heroes whose names we never hear

When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the words you say
It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers

There's a point you must decide just to do it 'cause it's right
And that darkness covers everything in sight
Reaching out to feed the hungry reaching out to save the land

That's when you become a point of light
Until it meets a single point of light
Reaching out to their fellow men.

All it takes is a point of light a ray of hope in the darkest night.
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right you will be a point of light.

There are dreamers who are making dreams come true
Taking time to teach the children there's nothing they can't do.
Giving shelter to the homeless giving hope to those without.
Isn't that what this land's all about.
One by one form the mountains to the sea points of light
Are calling out to you and me

All it takes is a point of light a ray of hope in the darkest night.
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light."

Then the preacher said
People take A moment or two
There something we need to do
Pray for the fish
They won't know what's coming
When the sin starts rolling off the likes of him
Lord be with em, they ain't done nothin'
Please wont you leave them just A little bit 'A room to swim

Well the preacher ducked em under
That cool clear water
Then he did it again
Eddie came up yelling
Lord in heaven halleauh!
I'm A brand new man
Well the water got to bubbling
Sky got to rumbling
And the thunder backed up the choir
The fish started jumpin'
It was like they was swimmin'
In A lake of fire
Then eddie's momma stepped out of the crowd
And started yelling out loud
Pray for the fish
They won't know what's coming
When the sin starts rolling
Off the likes of him

They ain't done nothing
Please wont you leave 'Em

Fold your hands

Your heart wasn't mine to take
Mine wasn't mine to give
And love wasn't ours to save
I shoulda let you when I could
When the memories
Weren't so many or so good
And one night was such a small price to pay

A small price to pay
When a touch was all it was
When the fire was just a candle flame
Throwing shadows of us
What I wouldn't give now
For those long gone yesterdays
When one night was such a small price to pay

Well I guess we'd better go
Maybe this time for good
But the last time wasn't though
But never again sure feels good to say
And I think back to the times
When everything I treasured wasn't on this fragile mind
And one night was such a small price to pay

A small price to pay
When a touch was all it was
When the fire was just a candle flame
Throwing shadows of us

Fallen angles fill the places
Where I go when my troubles pull me down

And the time that they will sell me
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town
Back at home in bed she's crying,
For her love for me is dying
But she'll pry I make it safely through the night
When the mornin' sun starts showing,
To her bedside I'll be going
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light

And I'll make promises
Promises to change
I'll make her promises swear I'll rearrange
And I'll start giving all the love she needs
If only she will stay
Once again she'll reasure me and
I believe her love will cure me
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face
Lord I know she's just a woman
And her love can't last forever
And someday soon I know she'll
Leave without a trace
For broken' promises
Will tear her dreams apart
Just token promises will someday break her heart
And for the last time she'll hold me when I cry
And while I'm sleeping
She'll quietly say goodbye"

It feels like everybody knows
You're fatherless
This boy may not be blood of my blood
But I'm gonna raise him up

I'll provide for him
Walk beside of him
I am strong enough
Cause it's time he knew
What A son can do
With A father's love

He could change the world

You only have to look at joseph
A couple thousand years ago
He held A newborn baby he named jesus
He said ""He may not be blood of by blood
Still I'm gonna raise him up

I will provide for him
Walk beside of him
I am strong enough
I will show him too
What A son can do
With A father's love

And he will change the world.

33 years later
When the son was in his grave
Broken and abandoned
By A world he came to save
His real dad said
""He's mine,
Blood of my blood
And I'm gonna raise him up""

I'll provide for you
Walk beside of you
I am strong enough
I have seen from you
What A son can do
With A father's love

One man changed the world and he can change your world

Of why I stay dead on my feet

The hair that I'm losing and a women who's choosing
To lay sound asleep by my side
The bills they are mounting that's when I start counting
On someone to help sooth my pride
A lady that knows me affection she shows me and a smile so easy and sweet
The dreams that I've buried the load that I've carried
Are some of the reasons I cheat
My children keep on growing me age keeps on showing
Like all  of my old friends I meet

The star that led them seemed to tell them what had come to be

Make the lame walk, the deaf talk, and give sight back to the blind.
Bring a light into the darkness no one can deny
As sure as there's a heaven, the Son's gonna rise and shine

At the age of thirty-three, the prophecy fulfilled
On the cross at Calvary His blood for man was spilled
The sky was black as midnight, but 'neath the dark and gloom
Voices rang and angels sang dancing 'round the tomb

The Sons's gonna rise and shine
He'll take away the keys of death, the grave will loose it's bind
Hell will be defeated in three days of time
On resurrection morning, the Son's gonna rise and shine

It's been two thousand years, but the story's still the same
For those who will believe in Him and call upon His name
The Son's gonna rise and shine
Heal the sick, raise the dead, the Savior of mankind
The day will soon be dawning will be the end of time
King of kings, Lord of lords, The Son's gonna rise and shine

Closing in upon that last one

So we held on and we told stories
Of the good and bad in all
Of the power and the glory
And the lonely days that crawled
And he said heaven holds true love

He said I ain't afraid of dying
Cause I know there's something worse
When you have to see your reason for living go first
And you get left behind
Some can't think of nothing better
Than to live this life forever
I never wanted no more than was mine
And to lay down someday and go home
With a satisfied mind

He said don't look into the darkness
If you want to see true black
Look into a morning's brightness
When love ain't coming back
And you will find right there a darkness that blinds
And don't think wealth is ever having
All you want all to yourself
It is found when you are giving
What you have to someone else
The only difference in the rich and the poor
Is a satisfied mind

And one light began to fade
As one grew brighter

And in your name my bread is broken
By your grace I'll rest in peace

I will not drown in shallow water
Not with your love within my reach
I did not come this far to falter
And will not rest until I'm free

Through your love my eyes are open
Through your love I'll learn to see
And in your name my bread is broken
By your grace I'll rest in peace

Randy Travis,Shopping For Dresses,/r/randy+travis/shopping+for+dresses+feat+loretta+lynn_20217677.html,"Jimmie Dickens, Merle Haggard, are. Q. Jackson

Down through the ages men have died for women
And done so for many times
Each time I loved one, I ve always lost one
Seems the right one is so hard to find.

Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them
One in each color, one in each style.
I ll find a lady someday to wear them,
My shopping will be done for awhile.

I ll bet somewhere s a lady shopping for britches
Comparing the value, appraising each pair.
Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together
And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear

Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them
One in each color and one in each style.
Maybe someday if I'm lucky
I ll find someone to wear them
And my shopping will be done for awhile.
My shopping will be done for awhile.

I m looking for a lady who ll look good in dresses
She must be red-headed, green eyes and be fair.
I ll make exceptions to all my requirements
As long as she s willing to care.
Chorus:

I just saw a beauty with blue eyes, what a cutie
Bond hair like a halo around her did flow,
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely
In the dresses I bought long ago.

Chorus:

Now as I sit here dreaming, planning and scheming,
Why should I make standards when everyone knows
As your need ranges, women make changes
And you must accept them or just let them go.

Chorus:"

The wonders of Your mighty love

Power and majesty
Praise to the King

At the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You

Nothing compares to the promise

After all these years I can still hear grandpa laughin'
As he applied that barnyard remedy
He passed his wisdom down to me
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

I remember my first crush was on the preacher's daughter
We were smoochin' on the front porch swing that night when he caught her
We weren't expectin' him home until quarter past ten
When the good Lord taught me that lesson again
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

You don't point your pistol before you check each chamber
And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive
It's just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

She rolled into town with rodeo, she was a beauty
And that cowboy saw you wink at her, she was a cutie
The sound of jinglin' spurs caught me dead on a run
He was fit to be tied and you were under the gun
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

Chorus.
No, you don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

Calling, Oh sinners come home.
Why should we tarry
When Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger
And heed not his mercies

It was time
It was over
After we had come so far
But I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
Well I think I can still find a will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

[Chorus:]
So Fly
Go ahead and fly
Until you find out who you are
'Cause I
Will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time
You will find what you longed for
Love that's written in the stars
And when you finally do
I think you'll see it
Somewhere in my broken heart

She was too, and he'd do anything to prove his love.
With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man.

Hearts caught fire and love ran wild.
She cried the day she called to say she was having his child.
With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man.

There's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right.
But, you live with decisions that you make in your life.
And what steers your direction is hard to understand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man

Now he drives a diesel out of Dallas,
Hauling cars out to the coast.
It ain't the dream that he remembered, just a few short years ago.
But tonight at a truckstop, while drinking a cup,
The waitress grins and winks at him,
And says, ""My shift's almost up.""
With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man.

With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man."

Livin' without you ain't no livin' at all
How I miss your naggin'

Up against the bedroom wall

In the kitchen early in the mornin'
Midnight walkin' the floor
Without your cryin', cussin' and your moanin'
Home ain't home anymore

So come on, honey
Come home and spend my money
Come back, mama, and take another swing at me

You could do me wrong all night

Us a tank of gas
And some Redman tobacco
When we were just teenage kids
Me and my old buddy Leroy,
We'd go driving around
If there was trouble to be found,
Then man we dang sure did
Cutting doughnuts in the fields
'Till old man Smith would call the cops
He'd come runnin'out with a shotgun cause we were runnin'  down his crops
And I reckon he's still wonderin' who that was
But that was us

Now some of these old local boys moved on
But we never changed a bit
Never had a lick of sense, least that's what
Some folks said
Then finally we turned old enough to buy our
Own beer
Don't remember much about that year,
Just lucky we ain't dead

'Cause somebody said they saw some boys
With a truck looked just like mine
Tryin' to pull down that old water tank
That sits out on the country line
And people wonder why it leans the way it does
That was us

Seems like small towns never change
But things get tough when times get hard
And they said when he got sick
Old man Smith would've lost the farm
'Cause he was getting' way behind on all his bills
'Till somebody brought his crops in from the fields
Yeah and folks 'round here still wonder who
That was

That was us"

My heart in need of help
I found eternal life
And lost my fear of death
Because I know the author of
My every breath,

On your way back to haunt my heart
'Cause it's safe behind these stones and ridges
You know how us healin' victims are
I take comfort where I find it
In the neon and the crowds
I guess someone like me designed it
This place where old flames aren't allowed

There's a border you can't cross
There's a wall that you can't climb
The space is drawn too wide
Between your world and mine
You've already broke my heart
(And) I won't let you break my mind
As far as your memory goes
That's where I draw the line

I'll bet this isn't how you planned it
I've picked myself up off the ground

Randy Travis,The Box,/r/randy+travis/the+box_20114228.html,"On the top shelf in the closet
In the workshop where he spent his extra time
Was a dusty wooden box that I had never noticed 'til that night
Then we set it on the table and carefully we opened up the top
And stared into the memories Daddy kept inside the box

There was a letter from Mamma, when she went out to Reno
To help her sister out in '62
And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation
It was the first time that my Daddy ever flew

And the pocket knife I gave to him on Fathers day
Years ago I thought it had been lost
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box

I guess we always knew it, but ""I love you"" was hard for him to say
Some men show it easily and some just never seem to find the way
But that night I began to see the softer side of someone I had lost
I saw the love he kept inside the first time that we opened up the box

There was a picture that was taken when he and Mom were datin'
Standing by his 1940 Ford
And a faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptized
I guess no one understood him like the Lord

And a poem that he had written all about his wife and children
The tender words he wrote were quite a shock

We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box"

Than just working with his hands

Chorus:
Love your neighbour like your brother
Treat your brother like a friend
Always turn the other cheek
Help the weary and the weak
Make the time for young and old
And as your life unfolds
Each kindness that you've shown
Will be the nails and hammers
As you build your final ladder
In the manner of the carpenter of old

You could feel compassion in his eyes
Only fools that hurt him did not realize
That he was speaking to us all
The righteous and the mighty
The silent and the small

And He'd say There's no home I could design that would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind, if you'd only take the time.

Goodies on the sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you.

Seven years of school

At night the only books he owned
Kepted his mind sharp as a tack

When to havest
How you weed just what you sow
When to look for rain and who to turn to when it don't
There was a plan for early frost
Salvation for the lost
Words to live and die by front to back

Handed down the day she died
The co-op sent the other

Knew Paul and Peter by first name

R. Kelly,Angel,/r/r+kelly/angel_21082112.html,"There's no better way to describe
What you do to me, I love you

Ooh, the summer came in the middle of the winter
And all my nightmares became a dream come true
Then suddenly my pool became an ocean
No sooner that I laid both of my eyes on you

And I have never seen wings like that
Never seen a smile like that
I've seen the light but never ever bright as that
(You blind me with love)
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream?

'Cause I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Right before my very eyes
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
And it was like a vision coming from the sky

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
She held my hand and whispered to me
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Nothing compares to what you are

A sad end became happily ever after
And a sad song turned into a song of joy
When the light is on to me was going dim
You showed up with a candle burning bright

And I have never seen wings like that
Never seen a smile like that
I've seen the light but never ever bright as that
(You blind me with love)
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream?

'Cause I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Standing right before my very eyes
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
It was like a vision coming from the sky

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
He held my hand and whispered these words
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Nothing compares to what you are

And it feels so good
That I found my angel next to me
That I just gotta tell somebody
About my new discovery

And how I'm touched by an angel
Touched by an angel, touched by an angel
Girl, it feels like I'm touched by an angel
(Feels like)
Touched by an angel, touched by an angel

I can't believe it, I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
And it was standing right before my eyes
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Like a beautiful vision coming from the sky

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
And it took my hand and it said to me these words
(I just saw an angel)
Nothing, nothing, nothing
(An angel on earth)
Nothing can compare to what you are

I'm so glad that I've got my angel
I saw an angel right in front of me, whoa baby, yeah
You're my angel and I know you can set me free"

Searching for that paradise

Oh Lord will you help me, find me
Take this crazy ghetto past of mine
And put it all behind me
Look down on the ghetto man
And change his mission
And put it in the hearts
Of many to stop confusion

[Chorus:]
My sistas, brothas
Let's put these hands together
We need to stop chokin' on the truth
And start smokin' on a plan man
Love and respect that woman
And bring her happiness

For each other we should help
While our babies are dying in the street
We've got to be saying to ourselves"

I'm on way back to Atlanta
About to start a new life
Cause I can't take it here
It seems the more we fight
The more the pressure
I'm in this lonely house
Sitting high up on a hill
Pressin' the buttons on the control
Flipping through channels on TV
Wondering when you're coming home
And take care of family
At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
If you love me, you would've done those things
You won't miss me till I'm gone
Impossible to drink from a well that's gone dry, yeah
And every night you come in singing the same old song
How could you do me wrong?
When you know it ain't right

Take in a movie show, a carnival
A place to go, we can be alone
But instead I'm staring at these matching walls
The weekends spent, a compliment
Flowers sent would've kept me at home
But now instead I'm packing my bags and I'm gone

For you to stay a little while
It's too late for it
Cause you forgot the little things, whoa, oh

R. Kelly,Be Happy,/r/r+kelly/be+happy_10237452.html,"Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you g

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you to be happy
You to have the best of things
To be down with me, baby
'cause your lovin', it's so good

You're giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby don't you know
That I'm down until the day I die
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you
Now you know i'll never do anything to hurt you
'cause baby I love you

Every night and day I pray
Your love returns
Oh I'd give my life
If it would only make you happy

Rap (notorious B. I. G)
Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'
Spittin' in faces in public places
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with amanda
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said
Poppa doin' this, poppa doin' that
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her word like the koran
Ya'll stay friends, i'll stay and smoke phil benzs
Honeysuckle sets, biggie secret pyjama sets
You were the reebok vandal, now you were chanel sandals
I made you - why would I play you?
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home

Chorus
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
Baby everything you want it for baby
You to be down with me
So give me that ass back baby
'cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe

Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you g

East side to west side tourin like what up
And even though the price for the house was so much
I still roll with them from the hood like what up
Cuz when it comes to bein the realest I'm sho nuff
I'm a straight up industry villain for sho nuff
And I can't satisfy some a yall no matter what
And some of ya'll cats are so jealous
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Aint nuttin but fake faces fake people fake friends
Said we livin in a cold cold world
Where there aint nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas
Yea I know I need a hug but yall need a hug too
Cuz god gunna judge me the same day he judge you
And even though we have our struggles that's alright
You know we get our folks and find a way to shine

I been around the world
And gets nuthin but love

Sometimes this world can be so cold
When you looking through the windows of the soul
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds
Cuz I been around this globe and back
Enough to know the fact
Who loves me
And who loves me not
We be shit's so hot
You could put it in red tops
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block
Until they heart stops
That's why they fiend for me
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord
And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off
Rubbin they face in fame
I'm sorry I changed the game
But it's mine and I can't complain
Rule and are Kelly
Been around the world
Puttin it on women
Bumpin n grindin these bitches
But we always on time when a woman fed up
And that's love
That's why they all fuck wit us

Said my lyrics is my testimony
That's how I live
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies
Over the years
You see me on tv sometimes
Not how it is
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz
When I'm rollin through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me love
And though I'm not conceited (right)
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever
Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we'll make it better

R. Kelly,Betcha Gon' Know,/r/r+kelly/betcha+gon+know_21382887.html,"Oh, welcome to a day of my life (day of my life)
The memoir of an imperfect angel

Woah, welcome welcome welcome to a day of my life
The memoir of an imperfect angel oh

Though the lights were low, I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still, I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows, just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara running
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this, happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when I get you back)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when we fade to black)
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse

Before we both get loud, I'ma break it down
And let you know what happened for real
I was over her house, me and her on the couch
And the whole plan was just to chill
And then it got hot, after taking some shots
The time must have slipped away
Because all I know, I woke hungover
And girl it was the very next day
With the sun in my face
I woke up in a rage
Screamed, ""What have you done to me?""
And I'm telling you babe
I know it sounds crazy, she must have put something in my drink, uh
I know you don't believe it
And you think I'm dead wrong
Standing there butt naked
With nothing but a sheet on
Then she come down
With nothing but a robe on
And that's when
I put my damn clothes on
Got the fuck up out of there

Girl you know I know how it looks
(See I know how it looks)
Baby you know I know how it looks
(But baby it ain't like that)
Girl you know I know how it looks eh eh eh eh
So don't go accusing me of something
That I didn't really mean to do

This is for real, for real, for real (no)
Oprah Winfrey whole segment, for real, for real (no)
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real (no)
60 Minutes for real

(Baby)
I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through
(You got me all crazy) (this is not my fault, no know it baby)
Somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk
(Your were supposed to save me) you were supposed to save me (I'ma love you)
Oh sweet baby (I don't love her, no)
(Fading away) (don't fade, don't fade, no)
But you gon' know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do

No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggaz wouldn't wanna switch places
I on the other hand relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it

Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughin and we back friends

You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night

Girl I don't wanna.. Let you go, I need you so

Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, ""You never spend timey, what's up with that?""
Translated it means

And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat

S** so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face

You can not deny that, so do not try that
I do not buy that..

I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world

She likes country livin' and acoustic guitars
And Kenny Chesney and country bars
And Cadillac's and I couldn't relate
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date
And her dad hated me... oh I knew it.
He didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears, and black music.
We still cow-tippin' and trippin'
With that brush papa shirt lit back cause she was pimpin
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin'
Aint used to my style big limos and clubbin'
A city kid and I'm doin' my thang
I like an old country girl this is how I sing.

-[Chorus:]-
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world

A country girl cut off jeans and lolly pops
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops
A country girl with them country ways
Livin' big city nights
But them country days
A country girl don't understand thuggin
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin
A country girl pig-tails and care-free
No direct dish just channel 3
(Come on, this the only channel you have?)

-[Chorus:]-
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a differenty world

Country Girls taste like chicken...."

Bittersweet migraine in my head,
It's like a throbbing toothache,
Of the mind,
I can't take this feeling anymore

Drain the pressure from the swelling,
The sensations overwhelming,
Give me a long kiss goodnight,
And everything'll be alright,
Tell me that I won't feel a thing

So give me novacaine

Out of body and out of mind,
Kiss the demons out of my dreams,
I get the funny feeling and that's alright,
Jimmy says it's better than here

Drain the pressure from the swelling,
The sensations overwhelming,
Give me a long kiss goodnight,
And everything'll be alright,
Tell me that I won't feel a thing

Gone away

Unstoppable
Trackmasters, Rockland, come on

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Na-na so sick, make your toes twitch
Get up in yo' ass and ride that shit
Oh yeah, dare you act shady with the first lady?
Let's go half on this baby
Inner thighs thick so when we fuck you must put me in a swiss ho'
Room 704, fuck they mad at me fo'?
Skin copper, na-na stay proper, who could stop her?
Nuthin'. Hey, do a somersault
All that platinum shit you bought?
Nigga, fuck you thought, it ain't my fault
Keep the wrist rocky, attitude cocky
Next time you see me, address me like, ""Miss Foxy""
It's for the wrist? Cop it. If it's a six? Drop it
Thongs with topless, how you like that Robbie?
Ain't nothing sweet, you know my style, doggy style
From the back, in the back, hit it like that

[Chorus: R. Kelly and Foxy Brown]
The dolla bill
Nuthin' but stacks get you anything
Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill
Say what you want baby
While you be stalling at the lights
We be dippin' in Mercedes
Dollar bill
Can get us from here to Rio
In two hours first class still time to take a shower
The dollar bill
Where ever we be it's vip stats, no doubt
So what y'all cats know about that

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Say lady, I'm liking what I see
Come on and talk to me baby, baby, baby
Can't you see one night is all I need
We'll go somewhere and be
Talkin' about your future plans with me
I would do anything
To have you in my life, that's right
We can take a flight out of here, go anywhere

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Uh uh, I got proof rims on the V-12
Make you raise the roof, no gold in the tooth
Put some in the vault cd's overseas
Private lofts, I'm you haters holocaust
Ain't my fault I rap, then still made a mill'
But it's my fault I got my own label deal
Vacation in Japan while you wish for Bennihana's
On the way to pick up Madona, the ill na-na

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
Now you know the na-na plays with the big boys, aye'day
From the six coupe to the big Royce, can you handle that?
A lotta sass and ass with that
And I'm strictly for the dough
So, fuck you think I'm here fo'?
Princesses in a row, row platinum status
Ice lace to pink face
Then I back the faggots
See me rocking ery'thang from Mongolians to Persians
Y'all still learning, I got 'em swervin', through a sermon
And there's nuthin' you can tell me 'bout these cats that I
Don't even ram through a plan, too much stack
Must I, continue this?
Might be a couple of cats that I miss
We could skip the French kiss, take it straight to the wrist
And it gets no iller than this
Na-na engraved on canary ice, see me wear it twice
Did y'all niggas hear me right?
Me and Kelly put the lock down on New York to Chi-town
His town to my town, for the dollar bill

[Chorus: R. Kelly and Foxy Brown]
The dolla bill
Nuthin' but stacks get you anything
Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill
Say what you want baby
While you be stalling at the lights

In two hours first class still time to take a shower

Where ever we be it's vip stats, no doubt
So what y'all cats know about that

[Verse 5: R. Kelly and (Tone)]
Tell me who dat said dat we couldn't rock
I roll the dice, bet the dots say we won't stop
I roll from Chitown to Cali, hit your block
I bless the day that R and B music meet hip hop
(You haters thought that Kelly couldn't keep it hot)
Even when I'm in your face, y'all see me not
Sportin' nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block
Merridian cd's with five tv's
College honeys follow in your gs3
We on the way to ihop, coming from the spot
Niggas in the lot jammin' to the knock
(Y'all mad cuz you can't get what we got)
Who's the number one contender, January through December?
Cut your forest down while you niggas screamin' Timothy
Sophia know me from the beach house in Miami
(Banks know me) so I could give a damn about the Grammies

I only wanted to be a son of a father
That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I
I gave up da weed and somehow I'm still high
Three years still seein' them three guys Lord (Whoo)
Sometimes I don't know what you want from me, but I do know you know what I want from you

Stop people from rapin' me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy

Believe me Lord I want you, got money and fame but still it just wont do
Sometimes I don't like who I am, when I look in da mirror my reflection is Uncle Sam (Uncle Sam)
And every night I have these weird dreams, that a preacher trapped inside of me wake up and can't

Alright now we got that out the way

Look we're in the club you trying to deside whether you gonna leave with me
You don't know because you got your girl with you
Bring her with you

Step up out the club with a dizzy head

Im about to double up
You know im about to double up
Pop off in that Phantom with the doors suicide

Im about to double up
And you know im about to double up
Double up

[Verse 1:]
I fall through the spot Kell's on the prowl
I see these honeys and they're dancing all wild
All upon eachother whining real freaky
Im plotting how im gonna take them home with me
Maybe her cousin, maybe her girlfriend
I just wanna get them both up out of here
Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib
Start off in my game room pop a little bub
And have them dance for me like they danced in the club
Oo they're so freaky and both of them horny
Shot some tequila puff some dro and now they're ready
Her girl holla out we're best friends
And then I holla out ya'll look like twins
Ain't no competition ya'll a couple of tens
And then they say Kelz tell us whatcha wanna do
Well I'm about to double up with you and you

See a girl with a girl and try and get a group hug
Get em' to the hotel
Get some group love
Her (her) me man I just can't get enough
All up in my tub
Steady poppin bub
Who is she to you and she replied ""First cuz""
Man I could tell they so naughty, naughty
The way they took me down like a forty, forty
One in the bed and one in the chair
One massage my toes while one braid my hair

In the private spot like two of these playas
In the car lot like two of these playas
Hatas saying damn how he doin this playa
Doublin up for me is like routine playa

Mix em up like I'm a dealer
Man three's company bitch call me jack trippa

I'm back up in the VIP

I thought I had it all together
But I was wrong obviously
Cuz what was once done in the dark
Came to light eventually

[1] - Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right

I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's
I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job
Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf
I told you that I would return
But by the look upon your face you had already discerned
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away

[Repeat 1]

Okay you, you're saying you came in and
And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that
All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in
Woke me up pourin' hot grits
And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)

With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong
But that damn Caller I'd is the reason for this song
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off

Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin
Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids
Now every day I live I regret all that I did
Out smoking with friends as I reminisced

I can't take it no more I've got to confess
See now, I don't know why
I thought that I could keep creeping
Cuz you see what goes around
Comes back on around and back on around
And back on around again, yes it does
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me
Take it from a man who knows
That three ain't company
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs
Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help
Must be because of what my old man did to her

If I had a dream that I was flying, 
Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming

I thought the love we shared, the contacts we've had. Remember?
Yeah

Feels like it's over,
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else.
Gave me the cold shoulder
But this I loss, cause I can find me somebody else

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around
Then took the plane again, baby

You got me feeling single,
About to give up.
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me, girl.
Feeling single,
Night is young,
Hit the club
Take somebody home with me

Get it, get it
Get it, get it
We can get it, baby
Get it, get it
Now I'm better single

She said 'forever'
Turned out to be the biggest life
Of all time
And she changed my weather
Rainin' all day
No chance of sunshine

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends.
If she wanna fool around,
Then took the pain you gave, baby

You got me feeling single
Feeling single,
About to give up.
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me.
Feeling single,
Night is young,
Hit the club
And take somebody home with me.

Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Till the morning, baby
Get it get it
Now I'm better single

The way I see it, girl, not gonna do right
About me, baby girl.
And I might as well(I might as well)
I might as well get out a mingle, girl
Cause you got, you got, you got me feeling single

Yeah
And I don't wanna do it, baby,
But you're gonna make me
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me,
Treat me right, baby
Be in my house, in my room, in my bed, in my arms at night baby.
And she's gonna love me, baby
And she's gonna give all lovin' lovin', baby"

Funny faces is all I see
At my place, you on top of me
Playin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi'
I grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets
I'm admirin' your heart shaped booty
Nothin' in your oven, baby feed me now
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this?

Might be ghetto but you queen to me
That's how it's suppose to be
Do whatcha gotta do for me
Forever fulfill your fantasy
When you think of me, have your cream
Everything my team must to do one thing
You're the meanest queen on the scene
Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams
For real, it's real as it seems
You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's
Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please
Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland

Want some ends? You outta there

Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring
Personality rings bells in my dreams
Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing
Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough
Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat
But watch her stay cool, calm and collected
Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin'
'Cause she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'

Keep it clean and in essence

Have to deal with the Macks
Like the traps in the concrete jungle
Life's a safari in the mornin' huntin'
In effect, your pulse beatin' like bongos
We be like this, gettin' high
Ghetto queen you look so delightin'
Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby
Tellin' me to rodeo ride it
Don't fall off, hold on
Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back
She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty
You're makin' me wantin' to snap
I know your man is mad as hell
'Cause it to a player and I did it well
And I added one more for the road, to let 'em know
Kilo weigh heavy on the scale, mmm

Dedicated to my ghetto queens in jeans
That think they're mean
I'll massage you with whip cream
I wanna spread you legs and said you were my lady
Down with me, clown with me, fall to the ground with me
Lovin' how you sound when we get 'em off
Carry on to the dawn, give a dog a bone (lick 'em low)
Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac
Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang)
Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang

On the down low, doin' my thang man

Had the landlord at my door
I heard him saying,
Tomorrow no more
Pay me now or leave
But we didn't have anything to give...(ah can you feel me)

Searching for restoration...(and we need restoration)
Make the church my family
This is my story
This is my song
And I can sing it all night long...I tell you why because,

Chorus

The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there aint no man)
There aint no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me

Children cry no more...(children cry no more)
Because heaven is upon you
Please put down your guns
And we shall overcome

Thought your load may be heavy
Know that the weight makes you strong
Take my life for example
While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song...

Put two heads together, mean mo' figures (ha)
Word to Tigger, put me off up in the ""Bassment""

Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we workin huh?  Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin

Yeah, I get it down , anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words?  I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast
I ain't tryin to collide with folk,
But I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke
I guess you niggaz just woke - good morning!

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me, what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

I see how you comin' at me now, I'm cool

I'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich
I go to the block and pitch
I go with the glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard; I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbin' my game
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indichted
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all know it, Jigga's a fighter
Plus I'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggaz, I heard you niggaz
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of Tupac hovers, above us

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis

Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. (I am the one)
What you want from me?  Not guilty

Uh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch

Got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fucking replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heart the rhetoric, Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin' gon' change
For nothin' else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
(I am the one) I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me what you want from me?
Not guilty

Turn the lights down low

Since computer love
Been wanting to set it off

Like a hotel room
I'm checkin' into you
I'm diggin' like a shovel
All the things you do

Take a leep over the broom
That's how you're makin' me feel
Come on in this room
And let's keep it real and go

All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

All I need is your body next to me
I'm singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

Now tell me what the deal is
Are you ready to bump
It's gonna take a lifetime
To give you all of this love
So baby, open up
And get ready to receive
A miracle of love
Gettin' down wit me

Like a baseball field
Wanna hit a home run
Me and you get together babe
And raise a little one

[Repeat 1]

Set it off in a six
Baby, that'll be cool
Take a trip downtown
Between me and you
Trippin' on Perignon
Conversation like what
Not afraid to go down
Once you open up
After nine to five
You deserve some twelve
Makin' future plans
To be where I dwell

From my toes up
To my knee caps
To waist line
Now slowly lady
Can we go half on a baby

From my toes up
To my knee caps
To waist line
Now slowly lady

I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin'with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth

(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live

When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'mma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the ghetto with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine

(Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you wanna see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held

They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh... Oh... Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and two brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are higher
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fire
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive

(Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me

And as for Robert', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me (Shower down on me now), wet me with your love
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah,
Yeah (Said I'm callin' on heaven)

Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug

You bring me joy
Night and day
Girl you and me should getaway
I got a special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone

Verse 1:
Oooo, baby this love making is so good that I can't picture myself with no one else
And girl God is good because he put you here just for myself

The way to walk and dress, your smile, your grace and s**
Tonight nothing's gonna come between us but s**

Chorus:
You bring me joy
Night and day
Girl you and me should getaway
I got a special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone
Imagine you and me naked

Bridge:
Like a mountain
Girl I'm gonna climb all on top of you

Like a river
I'm gonna be flowing all over you girl

And like a horsey
I'm gonna saddle up a ride you girl

Like a something
Something again

And our bodies shiver
Oooooo

Heaven must have sent your love to me
Cause when I look at you heaven is all I see

Whatchu know about the Mobster Elites, Crucial Conflict and dem Do or Die flows
Whatchu know about Kellz & Twist- two multi-platinum artists steppin'out the suicide doors
I ain't claimin' the crown or the throne, but I know I'm Chi-town to the bone
Come and have a round of Patron and get down to the song while I tell you bout the ground I be on- Chicago
Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places
Caught her starin' at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers
Feel the words when I spit em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light
Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight
The party so live, and I'm bout to set it off for the 0-5
It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass hoe to ride
And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room
Come let a West Side Nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh
Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think imma make her wifey
Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a White-Tee
Presidential Suite, wit some drank and some kush about to get em on
After dis one night, Imma be the one you call, when you wanna get a hit until the early mon...pimp on

Tryna get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an ocean
(rub her down) with some heated lotion

(she's ready) for the pipe
(fuckin' wit) her emotions
Wanna show you what a true playa's like, you would swear you was in paradise
Wanna turn that ass over and ride, good-bye to them other guys
Girl if you ride out wit me I promise you won't regret it
I shoot hoop and so you know this boy is real athletic
You want me to go down on you baby don't even sweat it
Just pass the Remy to me and watch me get real nasty
R's gonna give it to you how you like it, I'll be bumpin' on dat

Yo Kellz, take another sip, den another trip buy another fifth (now another bad bitch want me)
Grab another clip, hit it like the trip, represent the pimps (still a lot of platinum on me)
Sit back relax and watch her ride on me, get up in the morning do the same to her homie
Chuuch right here, muthafucka can't clone me

You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough

Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them
I need something to hold
Then I'm home to you

Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
It's still a part of me there but I

Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
Cuz the game keeps calling me

Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot
They never thought that a pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain
Got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear
I like her for her
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)

Help us up, and take us home now

On my people in Jamaica with my music
Cause I got fans there and they love me
You know what I mean?

Don't like confrontation
Don't like inconsideration
Don't like false accusations
Can't stand victimization
Don't like starvation

I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

I don't like aggravation
Don't like humiliation
And I can't stand defamation

You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you
You know I care about you
This time, you just brought it on yourself
Yo, check it out

Now I shoulda been more man
About the way things went down
Especially since we been dealin'
For like seven years now
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down
No conversation, no good s** in a while
But still you search and find a way
To love me somehow
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow
Got my faces, some ice and a tie
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin' down

(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you
(I don't mean it) When I say that we're through
(I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through
(I don't mean it) Baby

(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me
(I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it

Running around here talking about
How I'm a big player now
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share
Kelly makin' hits now
Thinking about this industry
And how I put it out
You were there for me
When I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you
I was talkin' too loud
When I didn't come home
I was hanging with the crowd
Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now

(I don't mean it) Cuz I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) Whoa

You been so demanding
You need to read my word, son
And get some understanding

Recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it
[are.] Is it too late to get her back?
[Priest]Not as long as I'm a fact

That will make her mine

R. Kelly,I Wish,/r/r+kelly/i+wish_10237490.html,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
That your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennesy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

[1] - And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you
Folks don't know the half
I would give it all up
Just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[2] - I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
Been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin'
This real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

[Repeat 1]

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolensces

[Repeat 2]

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hurst
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

[Repeat 1]

(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick all alone (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man lookin at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me cuz (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to those I be pimpin like I supposed to
Rollin like I supposed to
Shinin like I supposed to
In the club, freakin wit honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a playa bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryin to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, playa I'm goin holla at her
A dog on the prawl when I'm walkin through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt wit all yall
Yeah, yeah homie you say she ya girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm be like cousin

And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me

No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

All you need is time
Seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way

And when it comes down to the dollar
You can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I'; m up on my game

Had to set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do
You could treat the future like a menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you

Never be the one that's out to hurt you

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin'with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth

(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout

Are you ready for me?
Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest.
(Take ya time brotha)
You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do,
Evrywhere I go, and everything I see,
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass-yes- Can I talk about it?
(Talk on, talk on)
While you're looking I suggest you take a good look'
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for
(Amen)
Just like that song says- ain't nobody's business what I do- Now can I
Move on?
(Move on, move on, move on brotha Kelly)
I remember when I was trying to be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody
(I didn't know nobody)
But now
(Now)
I said now
(Now)
Can I say it again?
(Gon' and say it again)
Nowwww, every since God has blessed me, it seems that things are going a little
Bit different(yes it is)
Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes, why, even the Statue of
Liberty want some bump and grind
Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps (Amen)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth
Now-now, wait a minute, go that way
Ya see the good book says that the truth is the light, please, I think it's time
To turn on your lights and see the truth
Caaannnnnnnnnn, Can I talk on?
You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going, You don't know
What I do.
Caaaannnnnn I get a witness?
So before you go tyring to pass judgement on me, pass judgement on yourself,
Worry bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going,

R. Kelly,It Ain't Personal,/r/r+kelly/it+aint+personal_20112973.html,"[Jay-Z]
Man, they go and tell me like
You never know who your true friends until you ah umm
Both got a little bit of money
I mean cause y'all both broke
Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see

[are. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is dat?)
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

[Jay-Z]
Look, I'm a grown man dog
And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all
""He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able""
Well, nigga you've been wrong before
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
We move through the hood like identical twins
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin? (sup nigga)
Fake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

[are. Kelly]
I wish, I wish - that success, we could all
Get a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)
Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger
And do things like, pull up to some clubs
In the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out hey!
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors
But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit
Helped you out and you still actin like a little bitch
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row
When you asked me for some tickets to my tp-2 show
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow

[Chorus + ad libs]

[Jay-Z]
A-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)
We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game
How he jeapordized the whole game
Now when we see each other it's so strange
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know
Locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules

Keep me from rocking the white gold

When we do shows we sell out super domes
While you at home burning the hot coal
Honey left you coming home to me like it's a curfew
One nice day and now she calling me boo
And she calling you through
And you calling me singing the sad tune

Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her belly
Now I can get freaky with some K-Y-jelly
But I'd rather go cruise with my man

You were almost in
About to take you home with me
Until you opened up my eyes
And showed me your other side
You were inches from the room
Just about to take control
Now that I know it was all an act
I got to get that bracelet back

Riding in my gators sittin' on my things
Drinking and smoking up all my weed

I've been kickin it with your girlfriend
Oh what am I gonna do?
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I've been kickin it with your girlfriend

[Verse:]
Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunnin I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind
And I blame myself for wastin your time
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on tempin and teasin me
And plus she knew what she was doin when she did it anyway
I knew what she was doin too and that made it okay
Truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her
And how we get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to dislead you
At first I just wanted to please you
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Because I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And the truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

Unfortunately, I'm sleep
Been out partying all night
And I'm blasted off that Hennessey
I hop to hotel lobbies
Going to them after parties
Throwing up and carrying on
Bout to have somebody drive me home
I get through the door
Fall on the floor
Get up
I'm staggering
Look upstairs
Shit is blurry because I'm real bent
And now I don't know whether I'm coming or going
And this goes out to all of my honeys that's calling

Drinking Belvedere, 7-Up, and gin
I told myself never again
Sleeping while the club is crunk
Don't make no sense to be that drunk
Arguing through the night
Pushing on people and starting fights
I was fucked up
I confess
People saying Kellz is a hot mess
Even after that I was taking shots
Shot after shot
Shot after shot then
I couldn't even open the door to my Benz
Dropped off and I get in the door now
Lying on the stairs snoring now
Why you calling me calling me calling me?
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up Kellz
Why you calling me calling me calling me?
Pick it up

Pick it up
Pick it up
But I'm knocked out sleep

The shimmer or the shine that I'd never seen before.

I was taken in by the spotlight coming from the stare
Of your wanting eyes,
Like a Vegas green glow.
Yeah, grasping, wishing I could roll the dice again.

What it was like without you here

Here's another shot of you that you're about to discover
I'm gonna make you see the difference between
Just quitting and survival
I've got a voice and I've made a choice between heartbreak and revival
I know you hate how I make everything look easy to do
But it's my pleasure doing everything better without you
Cause this one works better than
Two wrongs don't make a right when one leaves the other behind"
R. Kelly,Lightning Does The Work,/r/r+kelly/lightning+does+the+work_20607480.html,"You know nothin's gettin' done when talk is all you hear
Like someone revvin' up a truck never put in gear
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around
He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground
Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show
When it gets down to it, everybody knows

It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work

You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down
You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light
There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get
But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat

It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work

I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm
Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door
But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half
The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'

It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts

You took my heart and you set it on fire
And now my love forever burns
You keep taking me higher

In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me

Just like the wings
You took me, flew me away, yeah
And now my ground is underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go
Then you gave me direction
And now the rest of my days
I can't help but give you the praise

[Repeat 1]

You saw my needs, forgave my faults
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts
You brought the sun into my life
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did
And you're the only one
Who was there when I needed a friend
You're the only one who can place joy
When there's pain in my heart

Money makes the world go round

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, for those who live the way that I live, we came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
Og's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six 'cause money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the jbl
It's Nas and R. Kell

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side
Anything I want, I can say it's mine
No more worries 'bout how can I provide

Money makes the world go round
(Nuttin' move but the money)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
(Said nuttin' move but the money)

Oh, many say it's wrong cuz I love to spend
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins
All I wanna do try, and let you know
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke

[Chorus: Kelly Price, (Nas) and R. Kelly]
Money makes the world go round
(Money makes the world go round)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
Yes, it does
(Said nuttin' move but the money)
Said money makes the world go round
(Money make the world go round, what?
Still nuttin' move but the money)
Nothing but the money
Money makes the world go round

Feels so good, yeah, yeah
So good, this life I finally live

For as long as you're willing girl
Want you to know that I'm willing too
And where you want me to go girl
I'll be willing to go there for you
And if you want me to take my time

In my life
Uhh, Track Masters
You're all I need in my life
Make money
You're all I need in my life
Duece, duece
You're all I need in my life

[R]
Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo
I remember in the days
Y'all niggas talking all that shit about keepin' it real
But when it comes to this game I'mma play the field
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal
We used to use the streets for the football field
In church free lunch was our only meal
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels
Living it up in Beverly Hills

[Tone]
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary
Now the ladies wanna find Tone in a hurry
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry
All you player haters going down like Mary
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland, Track Masters top billers

[1] - Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
So happy (Show me the loot)

I never thought that I
Could make someone like you
I felt energized
When you went through my groove
I'll never let you go no
You're so right for me
I've got to let you know
Forever you and me
(The balla's anthem right here)

[Repeat 1]

You must be heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you honey the money
We have a love that's long
And true I make you in many ways
I've got to roll with you
In each and every day

[Repeat 1]

You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
I said you're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one
I don't need no one but you

Baby won't you take me out of this club
I wanna be with you
Baby let me take you out of this club
I make your dreams come true
Baby won't you take me out of this club
I wanna be with you

I smiled enough
I flirted enough
I posed enough
Got freaky enough

Took pictures enough
Conversated enough
I sipped enough
I got enough

I see a cute boy chilling in some jeans and Tim's
I think I like him and I just might leave this club with him
And this swagger tight I'm feeling two's on me
Make me wanna, wanna, wanna got with him

VIP like ""Hey""
Dissing with my girls like ""Hey""
Then I call him off to meet me
I couldn't resist, so sexy

DJ get on the mic
And make them, from the front to the rear
Y'all ain't gotta go home
But you gotta get the hell up outta here

[Chorus]

I drank enough
I danced enough
I partied enough
I sweated enough

I stuttered enough
I flossed enough
I snapped enough
Two step enough

Now I want this awesome woman up in this club
And I like her and I wanna leave this club with her
Ever since the mama broke it down to the floor
I say she ready she ready she ready to go, to go

Then I got behind her like ""hey""
She pushed it on me like ""hey""
And she ain't scared to get dirty
Even though she's so pretty purdy

DJ get on the mic
And give us head from the front to the rear
Y'all ain't gotta go home
But you gotta get the hell up outta here

[Chorus]

Baby won't you take me out of this club
I wanna be with you
Baby let me take you out of this club
I make your dreams come true
Baby won't you take me out of this club
I wanna be with you

Thatz why every mutherfucka in the world dress fly.
Every baller
That can afford it they cop the best ride, for the power of the P-you-S-S-Y.

The power of the P-you-S-S-Y, thatz why niggaz get they hair cut, try to dress fly.
Every baller that can afford it he cop the best ride.
For the Power of the P-you-S-S-Y.

[Jay-Z]
I-I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown.
Hands down mami had the bombest pussy in town.
One dip in the girl pool, thatz all it took.
One sample of the snappa and ya ass was whooped.
Have you buyin Gucci sandals matchin pocketbooks.
Blowin up her beeper, ringin her phone off the hook.
Ball playaz they spent money, rappers they spent time.
All the while both claimin that they never spent a dime.
Buisness guys you were victimised.
Have 'em payin rent on condos in a Miami High Rise.
They ask her, ""Who pussy's this?""
Look her right in her eyes.
She say, ""This pussy's yours, Daddy""
Tell 'em nothin but lies.
Ha! They didn't believe it, but they wanted to.
Needed to. She had the type of body that you didn't want leavin you.
So they ignored all her flirtin ways and put a ring on her finger.
I'm like, ""Earth to Dave!""

[Chorus:]

Naw.. I ain't no rapper but I'mma sing my shit
When it comes down to that mutherfuckin click click click.
Niggaz I sip sip sip, turn on ya quick quick quick.
And thatz why I be givin mami much dick dick dick.
While yall chumps be copin diamonds and fur and all that,
Fiendin for this pussy as if yall was on crack.
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back.
Ya'll cats that be babysittin these broads need to be smacked.
It's this nigga named Monroe that I know from way back.
He hit the lotto, bought this girl a Cadillac.
Now this bitch be creepin behind this niggaz back.
Me bust his nut guess what he still took the bitch back.
Three things niggaz love... Money, pussy, and drugs.
Can't get one without the other unless you soft and in love.
Yall take it from a playa who's done all the above.
Niggaz it the lesbian R&B thug.

[Chorus:]

[Devin the Dude]
The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.
The you is for uterus, down deep in the middle.
Ss is so slippery when I go up inside.
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.
See I got my first shot when I was bout 7.
Her father called my house he said,
""I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's 11 and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed. ""
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
""No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!""
Then I was suspended 3 day, tooken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of yall.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels.
Cuz it's...

[Chorus:]

Oh yeah.
Niggaz will do anything for some pussy.
Hey Hey Hey!

Knowing that, that was no way for me to live

And I'd take up for him

I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me
And had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I broke down and cried
'Cause everybody knows me
Knows that basketball is my life

(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God

Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach

We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you

Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes (change)

Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you have to do is take this family life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls

Prayer changes (I'm a witness yeah)

Prayer changes things (woah when it looks like)
Prayer changes (you can't go on)

R. Kelly,Pregnant,/r/r+kelly/pregnant_20861646.html,"[Chorus:]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Knock you up, pregnant, Knock you up

[are. Kelly:]
Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand,
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates,
But much like my patron man I'm just tryna take it straight,
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty,
Sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie,
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while,
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child,
Telling myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off,
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog,
Never felt nothing like this,
She's more than a mistress enough to handle my business,
Now put that girl in my kitchen,

[Chorus:]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
That's what I told her,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

[Tyrese:]
Now all the pretty ladies please line up right next to me,
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese,
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasy,
I can have you co-starring and in one of my movies
Tell me what your name is,
I can make you famous,
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexing,
Now I ain't got nothing to do tonight I gotta wait for my crew,
I just wanna put some in you,
And I can tell that you want it too,
And I'm ready babe,

Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

[Robin Thicke:]
Ohh ooh this song has got me hungry baby baby
So tell me that you want me baby baby
And girl I'll love you until the sun shines
And girl I promise that I will make you my baby
Around the world in and out of clubs
Hanging with chicks and I don't see nothing wrong
With having a kid, ooh ooh, sounds like heaven's calling us
Ooh ooh and girl let's make this about making love
If you choose me I guarantee that the rest of your life
Would be man drama free, I think both of us should
Leave this club and get somewhere alone with me where
There is no phones to ring and plant this magic seed

[Chorus:]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

Told myself so many times I just won't do

Is this feeling for real
I wanna know you did to me, baby
I wanna know
Is this fellin' for real
I wanna know what you did to me, baby
I can remember the time my heart was badly broken
Can you tell by looking at me, I've been hurt before
Now my heart is beating so fast my body's trembling all over
Now the world is shiny and new
We're starting over again
I've been everywhere searchin' for the one
But no matter what I do, I run into you

Give a little love and just watch it grow
When good things happen then the heart will know

Christmas is for girls and boys
Trimming trees and Santa's toys
It's mom and dad, and grandma, grandpa too
Christmas is a sacred birth
A chance for hope and peace on earth
It's everything that we hold dear and true
But most of all, Christmas is
The love that lives inside of me and you.

Sleepy eyes are open wide
And tiny hearts beat fast
To celebrate the morning
Just like every Christmas past
We gathered close to family
Embracing all that's been
And all that's yet to be
Oh it's good to be reminded

Christmas is the candle light
Jingle bells and silent night
Friends from long ago
And friends and we've made anew
Christmas is a sacred birth
A chance for hope and peace on earth
It's everything that we hold dear and true
But most of all, Christmas is
The love that lives inside of me and you.

From where it all began
One night in Bethlehem
Reaches out to all of us
Reminds us once again

Christmas is for everyone
The greatest gift of all the stuff
The star that shines on all the world
The light that leads us through

A chance for hope and peace on earth

Malamig ang himig ko
Hanap ang yakap mo
Haplos ng 'yong puso
Parang walang ligtas
Kundi ang lumuha
Ang hapdi din
Nitong pag-ibig
Umasa pa sa sinabi mong

Alaala pa ang sinabi mo
Noong nadarama pa ang pag-ibig mo

From going all the way
To try a little harder
And make the hearts go fonder a
Little more than words can say

We just gotta keep on lovin'
We just gotta make it happen
Every minute hour of the day
Just the two of us together on
The wings of love we travel
Here we go up and away

Fly and feel the power
Of the love in one another
Fly release the power of the love that'll take us
Higher
Pa-ri-ya and feel

With hearts on cruise control

You will find a way

The way you touch my hand

The way you make me feel fine
When I'm cryin' at night
Paradise within my mind
So i huff and I puff

Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps sayin', ""This is where I'm meant to be.""

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
And I find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile, will be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years, would be worth my wait
It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shining star, I can go the distance
I will search the world, I will face it's harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms"

Puso mas malakas sa isip ko
Tibok nito'y di patatalo

O kay ligaya ko sana ngayong nand'rito
Akin, akin ang pag-ibig mo

Ipaliban mo na lang sa ibang pag-ibig mo pagkat

Sounds of distant traffic, float into my head
Eyes slowly open and words won't be enough
But what is left unspoken burns softly in your touch

Hold me in your arms
So my love, hold me in your arms
Time moves without us, this room will be untouched
We're safe beneath the truth now
Both safe within this love

Feels more than you can see
I can't get close enough
Every single day, is ours to feel this way
I can't get close enough, never close enough ...

Don't ever give up no matter how hard it seems
Until you see the sun come shining bright for you

It's time to cast your doubts and fears away
Stand brave and tall, through troubles great and small
You'll beat the odds with just a little faith

There's a spark of hope to guide you
Just believe in what's inside you
Someday all your wishes will come true

For many nights I stayed awake 'til morning
Wond'ring how to ask if you cared
Then to my surprise
The love I had inside
Was something that you didn't seem to share

I have to say goodbye
Guess it's time to end it
Say goodbye
It's the only way
Much as I want to cry
There simply is no reason why
It's hard for me
But still I've got to try
If love for you cannot be with me
There's really nothing more to say
Remember whoever may come to share my life
You'll always have a special place inside

An old familiar strain from way back when
Every note and every line
It's always been a favorite song of mine

It used to haunt me so some years ago
Reminds me of the boy I used to know
And although the melody lives on
The memories and the boy are all but gone

And while the song still brings that certain glow
And the world still sings of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before
I remember the boy
But I don't remember the feeling anymore

The promises we've made seemed easier then
As if we knew our love would never end
But sesond change and time erases the tears
As swiftly as the ripples disappear

So while the song still brings that certain glow
And the world still sings of love I know
It isn't quite the way it was before
I remember the boy
But I don't remember the feeling anymore

I remember the boy
But I don't remember the feeling... Anymore"

Through the clouds I see love shine, it keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far, to change this lonely life
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me
I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide, it looks like love has finally found me

Night after night we stay together
Sharing moments that spell forever
Day after day our love gets stronger
Growing every minute as we get closer
If we ever have to say goodbye
And go our own separate ways
I wouldn't know how to get by on my own
After all the love and passion you have shown
I'll never say goodbye
No matter how they try
To show me love
That last if we're prisoners
Caught in the past
Don't let your tears run dry
No need for you to cry
I promise I will stay
And with you all the way
Our friends will soon forget
That you and I once met
As long as deep inside
I know it's love not pride
And I will never say
Ever say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
There are no reasons why
Our souls are so entwined
There is us, not you and I
And time will soon regret
Regretting we once met
Because we'll show them all
With love we can walk tall
And we will never say
Ever say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye"

And they're calling you back to my arms

But I'm going nowhere without you
You left aboard the run away wind
And left me standing all alone
You travelled far and I travelled slow
I turned around and you'd gone
And I wish I was back in your arms
Holding on to all our dreams
And so the road might go on forever
But I'm nowhere without you
If you give a song that I'm now singing,
Hold on to every word,
Don't let the times we had slip through

But the night bird song

Will talk to the trees and worship the wind
But if you go I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to feel up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away as I know you will
Please tell the world to stop turning till
You return again if you ever do
For what good was love without loving you
Can I tell you now as I turn to go
I'd be dying slowly till the next low
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll write on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes then I'll learn so much
But if you go I won't cry
Though the good has gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away cause I know you must
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty wound full of empty space

Leaving only memories, where did we go wrong?
I couldn't find the words then, so let me say them now
I'm still in love with you
Tell me that you love me, tell me that you care
Tell me that you need me, and I'll be there
I'll be there waiting
I will always love you, I will always stay true
There's no one who loves you like I do
Come to me now
I will never leave you, I will stay here with you
Through the good and bad I will stand true
I'm in love with you
Now we're here together, yesterday has past
Life is just beginning, close to you at last
And I promise to you, I will always be there
I give my all to you
Living life without you is more than I can bear
Hold me close forever,
I'll be there....
I'll be there for you
I will always love you, I will always stay true
There's no one who loves you like I do
This I promise...
I will never leave you, I will stay here with you
Through the good and bad I will stand true
Hold me closer...
Our love is forever, holding us together
Nothing in this world can stop us now
Love has found, love has found a way
I'm in love, I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love, so in love
I'm in love with you"

That keeps unraveling but then
It ties us back together in the end

In your eyes I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes I found the answers to my questions
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes
We're drifting safely back to shore
(And) I think I've fin'lly learned to love you more
And she warns me that life changes
And that no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow
Even though the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same
Through it all our love will still remain

In your eyes I can see my dream's reflections

By: Regine Velasquez
Composed by: Vehnee Saturno
Produced by: Vehnee Saturno

Kung ang tinig mo'y di naririnig
Ano nga ba ang halaga ng buhay
Sa daigdig
Darating ba ang isa ngayon
At magbabago ang panahon
Kung bawat pagdaing ay laging
Pabulong

Aanhin ko pa dito sa mundo
Kung ang mga matang nakikita'y di totoo
May ngiting luha ang likuran at paglayang
Tanong ay kailan bakit di natin
Isabog ang pagmamahal

Sundan mo ng tanaw ang buhay
Mundo ay punan mo ng saya't
Gawing makulay
Iisa lang ang ating lahi
Iisa lang ang ating lipi
Bakit di pagmamahal
Ang ialay mo pangunawang
Tunay ang siyang nais ko
Ang pagdamay sa kapwa'y
Nandiyan sa palad mo

Diba't ang gabi ay mayroong wakas
Pagkatapos ng dilim ay may liwanag
Araw ay agad na sisikat iilawan ang
Ating landas ng magkaisa
Bawat nating pangarap
(Repeat chorus)"

Composed By: Anka - White - Spiro
Duet With Paul Anka

There's something in the air
A feeling of danger
I've seen that look before
The face of a stranger
There's something wrong with you
I know I see it in your eyes
Believe me when I say
It's gonna be okay

I told you from the start
I won't be demanding
If you have a change of heart
I'll be understanding
I only know just where I stand
Or where I lie

Believe me when I say
We'll work it out some way

Refrain:
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want

I want what's best for you
And if there's something else
That your looking for
I'll be the first to help you try

Believe me when I say
It's hard to say goodbye

I can tell by the way you lay your head
In my shoulder
Your hand is cold as ice, your hearts even
Colder.

It's tearing me up inside to think
No matter how hard I try
You may still walk away

No matter what I do or say

If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want what's best for you
And if there's something else
That your looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say goodbye"

Masdan mo syang muli, at lumilipad na

Huwag mong bibitiwan ang iyong pag-asa

Don't know why I found reason to doubt you
One day
If I could just be near you once more
We could find the joy we had before
Nothing wrong with trying to
Relight the fire
If only you would believe me
Lonely times, I've accepted with no choice
Wish that I had the comfort of your voice
Maybe we could take it over once again
Try to put love back on course and then
Everything would be so fine
For all of tiem I'll be yours
If you'd only just come back to me
I can't forget the way that it was
I know that yet there's something for us
My heart won't rest until I have you
Loneliness we share
Happiness we shared together
Loneliness we share
Let's try it again
I know I tried to make myself strong
I wish I knew just what's going on
I prayed all night just to be with you
All day long I am wondering what you fell (I'll never leave you)
Time goes on and without you it's too real
Maybe something that I say will touch your heart
It's all that I can do to make a start
Try to open up to me
And what I have just for you
Won't you come back
Just one more time (let's try again)
Baby come back
Just one more time
I was wrong when I let myself doubt you
Now I know I just can't live without you
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time"

When will new hope rise from within
Giving me strength to start all over

Be pulled down by this loneliness

When all our tears have finally dried
That no matter how
We fools may try to turn the tide

When the magic seems to fade

Can hold tomorrow in our hands
All it takes is just
The faith to truly understand

We're the first gifts of love
Given to a poor child by kings
A shepherd and his lambs
Gathered around to see a miracle
On a peaceful night angels sung and prayed

For such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care whether all our songs rhyme now
Music, music and me
Only know wherever I go
Were as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me
Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony
Birds of a feather
Well fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me"

A feeling inside
That won't be denied
Set me free, My Love Emotion
Make me feel, I am alive
Lift me up, My Love Emotion
Burn my soul, give me your song
Wake up my heart, My Love Emotion shine on
Here I am, on the horizon
Mountains high, sharing the blue
That's my face, there in the windscreen
Staring back, thinking of you
Somewhere to hold
Somewhere to love
Set me free, My Love Emotion
Make me feel, I am alive
Lift me up, My Love Emotion
Burn my soul, gentle and strong
Wake up my heart
Where has all the love gone
Where is all the good evening news
Where has all the love gone
Where is all the passion and truth
So easy to lose
Let Love Emotion shine through
Put words in my mouth
Straight from my heart
Set me free, My Love Emotion
Make me feel, I am alive
Lift me up, My Love Emotion
Burn my soul, give me your Emotion
Set me free, My Love Emotion

Another day began without you
Each time I have this feeling
I find myself believing
You will soon come home to my arms
It's not the case I told myself a million times
The sweet embraces that we knew then
Are written in the pages
That first love story gave me
Reason to be strong and carry on
Everything is so different now
Inside the freedom that love allows
I've got on reason to regret anymore
Love is water for hearts to grow
Though it's over for us I know
I'll  always treasure what we learned as one and shared together
It's nice to know I have a place to call my own
Returning to my sweet, sweet home
Sometimes when romance comes it's easy to believe
That perfect love appears to take you, ooh
Till where your dreams had come true
There's just one happened with you
Till we saw the light and let it go
All I need is for you to know
When you loved me you gave me hope
I'll keep those memories inside of my heart
If you see that you need a friend
I will be there until the end
Now I continue on like this until the future brings me
Someone to fill the space I only have for now
It's all I've got my sweet sweet home
Everything is so different now
Inside the freedom that love allows
I've got no reason to regret anymore
Love is water for hearts to grow
Though it's over for us I know
I'll always treasure hat we learned as one and shared together
It's nice to know I have a place to call my own
Returning to my sweet sweet home (3X)
My sweet, my sweet sweet home"

What's happening to me
I've realized I'm all alone
Without your company

But then we've shared so much
That a part of me is me no more
I'm caught unaware and unprepared
For what will be in store

Now that you're gone
To wake me takes me countless hours
Just thinking how to make another day go by
That coffee cup just stares at me
It turns cold and bitter sometimes as we
The cigarette butts on the floor
Who picks it up nothing but me

Now that you're gone
I count each time the phone would ring
With fingers crossed expecting actually hoping
From the other line a familiar voice
That would say I'd be back today
No it isn't you, its never you
What can I do

Now that you're gone
How can I go on living
How can I go on feeling
An empty touch
An empty stare
How can I without you there

Now that you're gone
I feel like I am useless cup
A muted violin
A single teardrop

Now that you're gone...

Of places, friends we used to see
I traced the steps we've taken
No its useless they're unreal

You are the sunshine that
Lights my heart with in
I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise
Come take my hand and together we will ride

On the wings of love
Up an above the clouds
The only way to fly is
On the wings of love.
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high upon
The wings of love

You look at me
And I begin to melt
Just like the snow
When a ray of sun is felt
I'm crazy bout you baby
Can't you see?
I feel so delighted
If you would come with me

Yes you belong to me,
And I'm yours exclusively.
Right now we live and
Breathe each other.

Insep'rable it seems.
We're flowing like a, stream running,
Free travelling on the wings of love.

Regine Velasquez,Sandcastle,/r/regine+velasquez/sandcastle_20653296.html,"I have always dreamed of this day
The whole world at my feet
And fame within my reach
Friends I have a plenty
But when the lights down low
And nowhere to go
There's no one there but me

Time flies and all things
Must come to an end
Like the sandcastles
Slowly being swept away
By the incoming tide
All that is left are traces of what
I used to be

Today I have to let go
And all will be forgotten
But after everything's
Been said and done
And knowing that I once had
You in my life
And memories of what I used to be
Are traces that will remind you of me"

By: Regine Velasquez

My morning starts to shine
With teardrops in my eyes
And here I am alone starting to realize
That my days would be brighter
If I could learn to hide
The feeling that I have for you
Keeps hurting me inside

Then my days begin
With simple thoughts of you
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you
Sharing dreams with each other
And making them come true
Holding one another, saying all ""I need is you""

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Now my nights would end
With just one wish, that's you
To hold me in the dark
And help me make it through
'Cause the pain that's inside me
Would simply melt away
If I had you here with me
And promise me you'd stay

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you
Ooh, ooh, ooo

And show me that you care

My love will always be with you

And laugh while you're bleeding

And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself

We smile but the smiles we give are wanting
We look upon each other's eyes
No spark, no glow, no real signs
But we both know this is all for show

Until that sometime, somewhere
We could show the world we have each other
Sometime, somewhere we need not hide our feelings
We just keep on believing that we both have the time together
Sometime and somewhere, our lips would be free at last
You say the words we've hungered to say
And we won't have to worry, we smile we won't say sorry
One look and we have cast our fears aside

Sometime, that sometime will turn to forever, for all time
Somewhere, our somewhere would not just be one place
But everywhere

Until that sometime, somewhere
We just have to be content with stealing glances
Somehow, content with saying nothing
Smiles are always wanting
Though deep inside it hurts
Because we know that our love, like love
Is what it is, it's what we got
Our love, like love we'll have to wait
Until that sometime, somewhere

Sometime, somewhere
We just have to be content with stealing glances
Somehow, content with saying nothing

Ooh

I never dream
'Cause I always thought that dreaming was for kids
Just a childish thing

And I could swear
Love is just a game that children play
And no more than a game

CHORUS
Till I met you
I never knew what love was
Till I met you
This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day

I believe you
I believe in every word that you say
I love you all the way

Now I could swear
Love is not a game that children play
So tell me that you stay

CHORUS
Till I met you
I never knew what love was
Till I met you
This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day
Each day

BRIDGE
You and I should be together
Can't you see
Can't you see

CHORUS
Till I met you
I never knew what love was
Till I met you
This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day
Each day

Till I met you
Oh, I never knew what love was
Till I met you
This feeling seems to grow more everyday
I love you more each day
Each day

Till I met you
Till I met you"

As I lie awake althrough the night
The anger in my heart had all been gone
Now the morning starts to cry
To reach you I'll fly across the sky
To tell you we belong together
We were ment to stay forever
To reach you and touch you
A cold silence is behind me now
I'd set the pain, the doubts, the tears outside
I must heal the wounds set my heart
To love you forever is all I desire
To reach you
I'll fly across the sky
To tell you we belong together
We were ment to stay forever
To reach you and touch you
The anger in my heart has long been gone
(to reach you I'd fly across the sky)
And tell you we belong together we belong together
We were ment to stay forever
To reach you and tell you we belong together
We were ment to stay for ever

To reach you"

There and then I knew I'd fall in love with you
You should know that you had me at hello
I was Juliet and you're my Romeo

You're my super hero save me from this sorrow
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away
You are my Mcdreamy, you're my own Mcstreamy
Brad Pitt and George Clooney don't stand a chance
You're my one and only true romance

Just one kiss you swept me off my feet
And my heart was beating faster than it should
Just one smile (Just one smile) and it's like a carpet ride
I can hear the song a whole new world with you
(A whole new world)

You're my Bieber fever, yu're my Ashton Kutcher
I'm going Lady Gaga (papa paparazzi) over you

Ooh you are my Mcdreamy, you're my own Mcstreamy
Brad Pitt and George Clooney don't stand a chance
You're my one and only true romance

I'll be yours forever and a day
Our love is here to stay
You are my one true romance

Loving you is easy
Though it might sound cheesy
I'm a girl just standing in front of a boy
Asking him to love her
(When you say nothing at all)

You're my super hero
Save me from this sorrow
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away

You're my one and only true romance

Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

When will this strong yearning end?

Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood

Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could oh yes

There can be miracles, when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe oh yeah

In this time of fear
When prayers so often prove in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
So swiftly flown away

Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles, when you believe When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve You can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears oh
But when your blinded by your pain
Can't see your way straight through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says love is very near Yeah Yeah

There can be miracles miracles
When you believe lord when you believe oh ho
Through hope is frail through hope is frail
It's hard to kill it's hard to kill oh oh
Who knows what miracles you can achieve

The sweet love story
That is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love
He brings to me
Where do I start

To this empty world of mine
There'll never be
Another love, another time
He came into my life
And made the living fine
He fills my heart

He fills my heart
With very special things
With angel songs
With wild imaginings
He fills my soul
With so much love
That anywhere I go
I'm never lonely
With him along who could be lonely
I reach for his hand
It's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now
But this much I can say
I know I'll need him 'till the stars all burn away

Composed by: Keno
Produced by: Ronnie Henares

Will there really be a morning
When the night is gone
Will there be a dawn
To greet me urge me to go on
Is there no home for me
To even love again

Will there really be a morning
Or is this the end
Will there really be a sunrise when
The darkness dies
Will the strength to last'll be there
To fight the fears inside
The nights are so endless
Endless as it seems

Will there really be a morning or
Is this a dream
Days have come and days have passed
I wish the morning stayed
I pray that they would last
For in those mornings I
Could see what it meant to be free
Will there really be light again
When this tunnel fades
Will I reach out and touch it
Ir will I be afraid
I just hoped that
I'll still be there just that
I may see
Will there really be a morning to
Come for me
For in those mornings
I could see what it meant
To be free

Will there really be a morning to
Come for me"

Far too long in bed
I've been dreaming of you lover

I don't want to wake up
I'm scared to break the spell
Oh I'm sleeping like a baby
I hope you sleep so well

You know I'm hoping, hoping

We're gonna find

I know there's a dream for us
I believe it's true
In a word, love you
And I'm hoping our dream comes true

You know I'm hoping, hoping

Miracles and moonbeams, wishes on a star
These are things I dream of, I know it sounds bizarre
I see familiar faces, or is it déjà vu
The one recurring vision
Is a dream I have of you

You know I'm hoping, hoping

When you find someone you find someone you love
You know you can't believe it
When you find someone you know you can't deceive it
Your love takes you high

Don't you think that it's a crying shame
We must play these silly games

The pain in my heart that shows we're apart
Is growing stronger day by day

I won't try to change your mind
But try to think of the love that we once had
And maybe things won't seem so bad

The memories of those times are vivid in my mind
And yet they slip away as time goes on

Take me back tonight
Hold me close and tight
Forever I will be true
I'll love only you

Convince me she's fine.

It's always the same.
She's playing her game.
And when she goes I feel to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems.

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense of it all.
The rain on my face,
It covers the trace
Of all the tears I'd had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All I can do is cry for help.

No need to feel ashamed. Release the pain. Cry for help.

Cry for help is all I need.

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

Skip in his stride, what a beautiful day

Becomes a victim of circumstance
I've lost my way, now I'm so confused

All my dreams are far behind me
They don't matter any more
I don't care about the things I could lose

Now the one who always played it safe
Becomes another who's lost his way

I was almost sleeping
When I heard you come home
You knew I loved you madly
And I would gladly
Do anything for you

You climbed the stairs to Heaven
But you may never climb those steps again
You thought you'd be forgiven
But I was driven to make you understand

I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your head
I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your bed

Tell me how you could do it
Why put me through it
When you said you'd be true
You said that it was nothing
But it was something
And sometimes that's enough

So climb the stairs to Heaven

And as we stumble for the truth we're caught in a web of lies
Is nothing worth a damn without the danger

We're lost in a world of illusive dreams
Where every story has a desperate ring

[Chorus:] We got a right to happiness in the name of love
And though sometimes we may forget to give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get in the name of love
And without pause or regret searching only for the best

We could see the light unfold right before our eyes
Blinded by the tears we get lost in the shadows

Oh but the heart is a wondrous thing
Surviving the thunder outlasting the rain

Till then
I'll keep holding on
Praying i'm not wrong
Hoping that our love is still strong
(till then)
Keep our love alive
Hope you're satisfied
Till you're right here by my side
And the hands on the clock
Going round and round and round
But time don't seem to be moving at all

Every minute you were on my mind
Every day i wrote you
Half of me is lost in time
Half of me is always with you

Till then
I'll keep holding on
Praying i'm not wrong
Hoping that our love is still strong
(till then)
Keep our love alive
Hope you're satisfied
Till you're right here by my side
And the hands on the clock
Going round and round and round
But time don't seem to be moving at all

Another ticket for another trip
To another destination (destination)
It's just the thought of you that keeps me strong
Moving in the right direction

If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Chorus:
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing

End in empty sighs
I remember that the only thing
That I can lose is pride

Even if I'm broken on the inside
There's nothing I won't do to make it right
You know, you know I got to try

So I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try

Are shattered into dust

Even if I lose and crash and burn
I won't quit until your love I've earned
You know, you know I got to try

Don't need anyone to tell us this is golden
I can see that there are diamonds in your eyes tonight
Don't need anyone to tell us to be open
We'll open up, we'll open up our wings and fly

Even though our hearts are on the line
Even if we're broken on the inside
There's nothing we won't do to win this fight

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summers day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul...
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colours on the snowy linen land.

Now I understand
What you tried to say, to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free:
They would not listen; they did not know how --
Perhaps they'll listen now.

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colours changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.

Now I understand
What you tried to say, to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free:
They would not listen; they did not know how --
Perhaps they'll listen now.

For they could not love you
But still, your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do --
But I could've told you, Vincent:
This world was never meant
For one as beautiful as you."

They're driving me insane they push me over my limit
Do you believe it they catch me every time?
It ought to be a crime. Wo, the things they say

There ought to be a reason for turning black to white
Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite
They don't need a reason to turn your world around

I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm just about done with it all

Do you believe it, when politicians talk
And make, make the people walk into the fire
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame

We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words
They don't even write them now is that absurd
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart

And I'm just about done with it all

With it all

And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings
For the bad man to fall

Ever since Ren got his
Pectoral implants & went to Hollywood.
(Singing)
I've never asked for anything
Just your happiness.
And now that you have found it
I should be glad, I guess.
But I've played in my litter box
As long as I can.
And I would give most anything
Just to hear ""What is it man?""
I know you've got your pecs now
And gone on to bigger things
But before you go and flex now
There's a cat at home who
Sings
That each and every day and
Night he misses his best
Friend.
And I only need to see you once
To make this feelings end.
No matter where you go,
No matter what you do
Remeber there's little bit of
Stimpy's butt in you.
And just once when you strike a
Pose could you think of me?
'Cause when I scratch my rear
I think of how it use to be.
The house is much too quite
Now that I don't hear
Your voice
And you know that I'd be with
You if I only had my choice.
But I know I will smile again
When I see your name
In lights
And when they talk about you
I'll tell them
That I knew you when you were
Just Ren."

And searing sand blows up our skirts

And the buzzards, they soar overhead
And poisonous snakes will devour us whole
And our bones will bleach in the sun
That's it

And we will probably go to
And that is our great reward

Afraid of the fall it'll take to move on
There's a sinner on the front steps of a little church on main
The whiskey on his breath holds back the prayer he needs to pray
Sometimes, redemption, seems like a mirage in the distance

You can run and try to catch it
You can give up and just forget it
You can hold on for one more day
You're just a breakthrough away

There's a sorry I forgive you just waiting to be said
That could gather up the pieces and make you whole again
There's hope and there's peace, and courage to be found
And the sum of them is greater than the fear holding you down
But sometimes, redemption seems like a mirage in the distance

You can run and try to catch it
You can give up and just forget it
You can hold on for one more day
You're just a breakthrough away oohh

You can escape but do you want to?
Let me in
Let me dream your dreams
Let me dream your dreams

And don't you question, how you got here
Don't try to think, don't think to judge
And there's no price there never will be
Can't value hope, can't value love

Oh broken dreams linger on
They tie you up they bind like steel
You can struggle or surrender
Let me in
Let me dream your dreams
Let me dream your dreams

Not always clear, but always there
Sometimes we're blind and lost for looking
We look to hard at empty air
Can't live on air
Can't live on fear
So we live on dreams

Now it's close, so close to you
Chorus:
Oh the great wheel turns,
You never know,
You ride that edge
And it moves so slow
But it turns and turns, and deep inside,
You think you know
But your just a child
Just a child...
Nothings fixed, it all flows
Comes together then moves apart
Find the centre, If you can
Come together and find your heart
Chorus
Find the rhythm, It's a gift
Waiting for you it stays true
It stays true...
It will touch you if you try
Touch so gently, enter you
It will touch you, touch you
Chorus
Your just a child"

One day, believe fate will be kind

You'll lose what matters most, it'll be gone

Oh, some are brave but I'm not one of them
Oh, some speak up, but I have no voice
I want to dance, I want to sing for you
But I'm locked away inside my heart

You could not hear what I tried to say
You could not see what I had to give
Why did I wait, why do I always wait?
I want so much but then I freeze

Was that me?
I was invisible
Was that you?
I'll never, never know

Oh some are brave but I'm not one of them
Oh some speak up, but I have no voice
I want to dance, I want to sing for you
But I'm locked away inside my heart

No need to speak, he'll just know
No need to ask, he isn't blind at all

Akala ko'y dina magwawalay pa

Bakit ba, ako ay iiwan
Ano ba ang pagkakamali
Sana ay sabihin sa akin
Nang malaman ko ang sanhi

Chorus

I'll keep on loving you
Kung sadyang di ako
Ang sigaw at tibok ng puso mo
Mabuti at nalaman ko, na akoy di mo gusto

Wag kang mag alala
Kung sadyang di ako ang lahat ng pinapangarap mo
Kung wala ng pag ibig
Pabayaan mo na lamang

Nasasaktan man ang puso't damdamin ko
Magtitiis ako, pagka't nais mo
Marahil ay hindi ako para sa'yo
Basta't isipin mong ako ay narito

Bakit ba ako ay iiwan
Ano ba ang pagkakamali
Sana ay sabihin sa akin
Nang malaman ko ang sanhi"

Renz Verano,Solitaire,/r/renz+verano/solitaire_21279413.html,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
Solitaire
And by himself it's easy to pretend 
He'll never love again
Ohhh

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
Solitaire, solitaire"

And I told that man I'd sell my soul if somethin' wet and cold is that old cell
That kindly jailer just grinned at me all eaten up with sympathy
Then he bought himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear
That booze was just a dime a bottle boy you couldn't even buy the smell
I said I knew there was somethin' I liked about this town
But it takes more than that to bring me down down down down
But there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls in this best of all possible worlds
Well they finally came and they told me they was a gonna set me free
And I'd be leavin' town if I knew what was good for me
I said it's nice to learn that everybody's so concerned about my health
I said I won't be leavin' no more quicker than I fastly can
Cause I've enjoyed about this much of this as I can stand
And I don't need this town of yours more than I never needed nothin' else

That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that binds me
Or somethin' that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin' cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind"

And I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas night two years ago

That she'd been sittin' there and cryin' over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and caught her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day when I wasn't home when she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey and I wake up nights and call her name
Yes now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

Trying hard to copy everything I did

We could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the season she was changin' to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man

As she often lay beside me
In the coolness of the evening
Til' the morning sun as shining on my bed
And at times when she was sleeping I'd smile when I'd remember
How they used to call us jody and the kid

Now the world's a little older
And the years have changed the river
'Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on sundays I go walking
Down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl who follows me

And it makes the old folks smile
To see her tag along beside me
Doing little things the way her mama did
But it gets a little lonesome

Roger Miller,Loving Her Was Easier,/r/roger+miller/loving+her+was+easier_20117682.html,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies

Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colours in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes

Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and places that I've been

Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of tring
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before

In my time

She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
And I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door

In my mind

But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again"

Wishing I had your sweet hand to hold
Loving you is always on my mind

Loving you is all I'm living for
Ain't nobody 'bout to change my mind
For you have won my soul and my heart
Loving you is always on my mind

You're my friend when what I need is a friend
You're my loving when it's loving time
It's true so I'll just say it again
Loving you is always on my mind

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield whispers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands we finally
Sang up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I done
And everynight she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left to show she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

Barbershop will open up and Jacksons drugstore too
And they'll talk about this poor young wandering fool
Taking in the sights see the city lights smiling at the girls and being cool
Having fun my life has just begun fishing in the stream with a piece of string
All I catch is turles and old boots and I don't mind cos I'm feeling fine

Meanwhile back in Abilene the sun is going down

For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams

You had my child in Memphis then I heard of work in Nashville
But we didn't find it there so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska to a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there so we moved on
Now we've left Alaska because there was no gold mine

Now all we have is each other and a little mem'ry to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone

Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pining for the love I can't forget

Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape

Writers wells, grusin

I'm going home, to Rainbow Valley
I've been away, away too long
Going to see those purple mountains
Smell the meadows green, and hear the Bluebirds song

When I started to roam
I was barely seventeen
Guess a man has to roam
'fore he learns what home can mean

Goin' home, to Rainbow Valley
Gonna settle down
Right there in my home town

Yes it's a one whistle town
Lots of others are the same
'cept that folks lend a hand
And they call you by your name

Goin' home, to Rainbow Valley
Gonna settle down
Right there in my home town"

Yesterday's gone and where I stand here alone it's a hollow ringin' place called today
Last night I watched baby as she was boardin' a greyhound bus back to St Louis
I couldn't let her know I knew why she was leavin' not after all we've been through
Slippin' my coat from my shoulders I said hon it may get cold in St Louis
And the look in her eyes grew suddenly sad she knew that I knew what she knew

When my eyes fell upon this magazine
And I got to reading this article on sky-diving and parachuting
And it said jumping out of air-planes was the thing

Now being raised down on a farm and always ready for adventure
I knew that I could figure out a way
I said ""Well Delmer Gill's got a parachute and Uncle Harvey's got an air-plane""
So I said ""Call the boys together, today's the day""

Well I found out too late what Uncle Harvey called an air-plane
Was nothing but an engine and a wing
And I could feel my fear a-rising as Delmer packed the parachute
'Cos he kept telling me I was doing the right thing

Ron Mcloughlin shook my hand as jd strapped me in the harness
And Tildon brought a jug and passed it around
I took one look at that parachute and that whisky and that air-plane
And I turned that bottle up and drank it down

Well I was drunker'n Cooter Jones when they poured me in the plane
The engine coughed and headed for the clouds
But I was sober as a judge by the time they opened up the door
And I've never known my heart to beat so loud

I said, ""Harvey, I can't do it"" as he kicked me out the door
And I wrapped my hands around the landing gear
And I was holding on real good 'til Harvey stepped down on my fingers
And Virgil said he heard me scream from way down there

Well I thanked God and Delmer Gill when my parachute finally opened
I said ""Well, hell there ain't no use in being afraid""
And I went crashing through the hen house, scattering chickens and breaking eggs
And I kissed the ground and fainted dead away

Now friends I've done some fighting, and I've been shot at once or twice
And I've durn near been run over by a train
But I don't think I remember being any more afraid
Than the day I jumped from Uncle Harvey's plane"

And from the start he never had a chance
And though the doctors said he couldn't live his mama had some faith to give
And they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance
He was sick a long time then I used to sit by him
I'd rub his head he would squeeze my hand
But he never cried he'd grit his teeth and smile at me cause he couldn't speak
And that's when I began to respect the little man
And I think Vance was three right about then
He started school and one day he came home and at the doorway
I could tell the little man didn't want to come inside
He'd met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty
Had caught him walkin' home with her and nearly killed Vance
But then Vance never cried and the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride
And he said papa do you become a man when you're twenty one
And I said age doesn't make a man a man my son
He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind
And I think Vance was seven about that time
[ strings ]
I guess they say that first love is the very best
At least it was with Vance cause he'd scratched Becky on his desk
But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small
And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall
And then a few years later Vance came in one day
And told me and his mama that he had to go away
To be fitted for a uniform and though his mama she'd a tear
He kissed her and said he'd see us in two years
And he looked at me and said papa I'm gonna be a man
Well two years to the day Vance came walkin' in the driveway
And I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near
He came in and he hugged his mama
And said hey papa little man wanna go with me somewhere and grab a beer
So we're sittin' at this table when this fella at the bar started buggin' Vance
Callin' him soldier but Vance kept his cool
And he said papa that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now
Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school
Then Smitty said the wrong thing when he brought up Becky's name
And Vance finally stood and said boy what did you say
And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty
And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away
Well Vance left the very next mornin' and it was cold and it was snowin'
And from the first life hadn't been much fun
But he had finally made a stand and he'd become a self made man
And incidentally he had just turned twenty one"

To be free to leave this awful place I'm in
It's hopeless ""cos I haven't got a penny
Or a friend

To blow across the cottonfields of home
It will gently touch the lovely face I long to touch again

One wants to just run away
From all that he's bothered by
Little things, day after day
Sometimes the rain is cold
Sometimes the sun shines down
Life's just a ball game that can't be played all in one town

Roger Miller,The Swiss Maid,/d/del+shannon/the+swiss+maid_20845368.html,"One time a long time ago
On a mountain in Switzerland
Yo lo lo lo lo
There lived a fair young maiden
Lovely but lonely
Yo ho ho ho

Day afetr day she'd pine her heart away
Yo lo lo lo lo lo lady yay
Because no love came her way.

One day her papa say
Someday we'll go down to the village in the valley
There you'll meet a nice young man
He'll ask for your hand
Then you'll be happy.

But every day she grew unhappier
On the mountain in Switzerland
Yo lo lo lo lo
Every day a little bit lonelier
Which way to turn, which way to go.

And day after day she'd pine her heart away
Yo lo lo lo lo lo lady yay
But no love came her way.

Some say the maiden's dream never came true
She never got to go to the valley
If she did or not I really don't know
Wo ho ho ho
Did she die unhappy?

I'd rather think she found her love
Wouldn't you rather think she did find love
Somewhere, someway
Yodel lady ay
Yodel lady ay."

Is in the sunshine and the rain
I don't feel no hurt at all

I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
It only hurts me when I cry

That my recovery took awhile
I worked for days and nights on end
Just to walk and talk again
You can't believe the time it takes
To heal a heart once it breaks
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine and the rain
I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count my teardrops fall
I tell the truth 'cept when I lie
It only hurts me when I cry
Oh every other now and then
I have a small heartache again
You wouldn't know when you look at me
Those tiny scars that you can't see
It was a struggle to survive
I probably lucky I'm alive
The only time I feel the pain
Is in the sunshine and the rain
I don't feel no hurt at all
Unless you count my teardrops fall

She outshined all others that I'd known by far
I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor
Harlan had a rubber-tired, new shiny car

Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years

I tried, but in vain, for to take my own life
Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin'
She lost her desire to become my young wife

Woman setting home with a month-old child. 

Dang me, 
Dang me; 
They ought to take a rope and hang me; 
High from the highest tree, 
Woman wouldja' weep for me? 

Just sitting 'round drinking with the rest of the guys, 
Six rounds bought, n' I bought five; 
Spent the groceries and half the rent; 
Like fourteen dollars and 27 cents. 

So dang me, 
Dang me; 
They ought to take a rope and hang me 
High from the highest tree, 
Woman wouldja' weep for me? 

They say roses are red, and violets are purple; 
Sugar's sweet and so is maple surple. 
I'm the seventh out of seven sons; 
My pappy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun.

(patsy cline radio transcription)

I walk up to my door and hate to turn the key
Emptiness is all that waits inside for me
That's how it is when the one you love is gone
That's how it is when your house is not a home

I look around and see things marked with ""his"" and ""hers""
Little things like this just make things that much worse
That's how it is since I live my life alone
That's how it is since my house is not a home

Is there a way out for a soul so torn as mine
Each day I live I'm like a prisoner passing time
That's how it is, ask anyone who lives alone
That's how it is when your house is not a home

As you danced across the floor.
Were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door.

Tonight as I lay here touching her sweet body
And the good familiar feeling I recall
As I closed my eyes to kiss her, your memory appeared
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?

You were here; we loved; now you're gone
Why can't you let bygones be bygones and stay gone?
You always find the wrong time to come around and call

Girl, I'll be right there

Her head down to her feet

And I'm about to go out of my head

I just might not see you no more

And turned her head and smiled
She was 34-24-38
And dressed in the latest style

I finally caught up
With the pretty little thing
Before she got out on the street

And she told she was
Waiting on her old man
Who was a policeman on the beat

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time

It's up
To your knees out there

I thrill
When you touch my hand

How can you do
This thing to me

There's bound

One o'clock til four
An' Lord how slow the moments go
When all ya do is pour

I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry.

To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight

Feelin' low as the ground

To maybe come around.

While children laugh and play out in the snow

Lights on christmas trees
And snowflakes fallin' down
What a lovely site to see

You will always know when christmas time is near
You feel the need to be in harmony

'Cause christmas time
Is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love

Christmas time
Is all about receiving
The gift that god has sent from up above

People goin' here
And people goin' there
Buying gifts for those they
Know and love

Never stop to think
That the greatest gift of all
Is he who sends his love from up above

Waitin' in suspense
To open all my gifts
It seems like the time just creeps along
When we finally see the presents that we have
We open up our hearts and sing this song

That christmas time
Is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love

Christmas time
Is all about receiving
The gift that god has sent from up above

Christmas time
Is really more than givin'

Christmas time
Is all about receiving

Christmas time
Spreading news of peace and love

Christmas time
The gift that god has sent from up above

Christmas time
Is really more than givin'

And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry

Darlin' do you ever see
Some situation somewhere, somehow
Triggers your memory
And do you ever wonder
What became of all the time
Honey, do I ever, ever cross your mind

Do you ever want to know
Do all dreams go on endlessly
Or do they just run down somehow
And gradually become the custody
Of that melancholy jailer for the time, oh no
Do I ever, darlin', ever cross your mind
Do I ever cross your mind
Uninvited
When you're lonely
Or does it only happen to me
Darlin', do you ever want to know
What became of all the time
I wanna know, do I ever, ever cross your mind
Oh, baby, baby

Little darlin'

What became of all the time

Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
I was living in darkness
But then you came
Bringing the sunlight
Easing my pain

Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
No more stormy weather

Dont set me free
And leave me all alone
Dont make me be
Just a rolling stone
Lock me up and throw the key away
Make me a prisoner night and day
And whatever you do to me
Dont set me free

Dont set me free
On my knees I pray
Have mercy on me
Dont send me away
Like a train jumpin off a track
Without ya baby, Id blow my stack
And whatever you do to me
Dont set me free

Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you
I could love you better, than anyone else can do

So dont set me free
Though Ive done you wrong
Baby cant you see
Without you I cant get along
Keep me in a state of agony
Make me miserable as can be
And whatever you do to me
Dont set me free

Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you
I could love you better, than anyone else can do

So dont set me free
Though Ive done you wrong
Baby cant you see
Without you I cant get along
Keep me in a state of agony

Ray Charles,Doodlin',/r/ray+charles/doodlin_20618772.html,"Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.
Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,
I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away
Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,
Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""
""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""
That's for true!
Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin'
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!
'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.
I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,
Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.
Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.
Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.
Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter,
Called him the real fool,
Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,
When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away
We just doodle all day!"

Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh
Tell 'em about it
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.

Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
But when her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""Daddy,Daddy don't you dare""
He gives me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story)
Here's the point I have made (I'm listening)
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right)
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.
Aha, what a lovely way to burn.
I tell you, what a lovely way to burn.
All right now, what a lovely way to burn.
I like that, what a lovely way to burn.

And if you're ever up a tree, just phone to me, alright I'll call you to collect
And if you're ever in a fire send a wire, well
And if you ever loose your teeth, when you're out to dine
You can borrow mine, alright I will

When other friendships are been forget, I will still be great
Alright say it

If they ever black you're eyes put me wise, will you
Well if they ever cook your goose, then turn me loose
Alright I'll let you go right away
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain I'll complain
It's friendship, it's friendship, just a perfect little blendship
When other friendships are been forget, I will still be it

Well if you're ever down the well, would you ring my bell
And if you're ever in a flop call for pop, well
Well if you ever take a boat and you're lost at sea look for me, really
It's friendship, it's friendship, just a perfect little blendship
When other friendships go up in smokem I will still be hope
I will still be great, I will still be hot"

A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes.

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track,
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back,
So if you want to have fun in this man's land,
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands. ""

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight,
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

[Bridge:]

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose,
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face,
While she went down to the powder place

With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The music stopped and the lights came on,
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll"

To tease 'em and thrill 'em,
To torture and kill 'em

There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man

yesterday, perhaps --
danced with Jim and Paul

Once I was young,
but never was naive.
I thought I had a trick or two
up my imaginary sleeve.
And now I know I was naive.
Refrain
I didn't know what time it was
then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
you hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
and I'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
to be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,
hear your voice say I'm all your own.
I didn't know what time it was
live was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
and I know what time it is now.
Verse 2
Once I was old --
Twenty years or so --
rather well preserved:
the wrinkles did't show.
Once I was old,
but not too old for fun.
I used to hunt for little girls
up my immaginary gun.
But now I ain for only one!

Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories

Wandering from room to room, she's turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea

The sound of each phrase
Echoing time uncoantable by days
The things he played are with us now
And they'll endure should time allow
Oh yes I remember Clifford
I seem to always fed him near somehow
Every day I hear his lovely tone
In every trumpet sound that has a beauty all its own
So how can we say something so real has really gone away?
I hear him now, I always will
Believe me I remember Clifford still."

And your answer
Threw back Heaven's door

And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,
Then you've left her to hunt a new game.
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's prob'ly doing the same?
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue,
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed
But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.
I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how,
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine.
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now."

Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
And their chauffeurs would drive

A song is playing
I can barely hear
About a love that's gone wrong
The freezing rain on my window pane
Listen, they're playing my song

Taps being played
By a soldier's grave
So sad, it torments your soul
Listen to that North wind moan
Tonight is so dark and cold

Somewhere a siren
Cuts through the night
It sounds like the
Whole world's gone wrong

Thunder just warned
But it's coming a storm

And you can bet he barely makes a dollar

And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny

Her clothes are old but never are they dirty

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city...
Living just enough...
For the city... Ooh, ooh

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution

I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow

Begin to shout.
Hey, Hey Uncle Dud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi Mud.
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi Mud.
What a dance do they do.
Lordy how I'm tellin' you.
They don't need no band.
They keep time by clapping their hands.
Just as happy as a cow chewin' on a cud.
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi Mud.
Lordy how they play it.
Goodness how they sway it.
Uncle Joe, uncle Jim!
How they pound that mire with vigor and vim.
Joy it nearly kill me.
Boy that music trills me.
What a show when they go.
Say they beat it up either fast or slow."

And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud

I get misty, just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty whenever you're near

Don't you know that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

Too misty
And too much
Too much in love"

Shine on my love and me,
So we can stroll beside the roll,
Of the rolling sea.
Moon over miami,
Shine on as we begin,
A dream or two that may come true,
When the tide comes in.
Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours,
Hark to the throbbing guitars,
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause,
After each song to the stars.
Moon over miami,
You know we'Re waiting for,
A little love,
A little kiss
On miami shore."

Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves, a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icy finger-waves
Ski trails on a mountainside
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

Ev'ning summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway
And they travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...

I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further
One mint julep was the cause of it all

The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!
I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles
But from now on Ill be thinking double
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

Stop in the very last row
We hadn't been there a good five minutes
Before she's ready to go

I had to roll with my baby
I had to roll with my baby
I had to roll with my baby

I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime
Can't buy me no whiskey
I guess I'll have to settle for wine
And then I can

Roll with my baby
I know I can roll with my baby
I'm sure I can roll with my baby

I'll never let her go

Lord knows I love her so

Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

When you pretend I have no shame

Turn me into your house clown...
If I don't fit the bill...
All the same
I loved you then
I love you still!

Want to know the truth?
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got ahold of me
I could not shake it free!

Has been haunting me!

Forever chasing me...
But say no more
I may not be an easy man
But the way you played your hand
I couldn't stand!
It's too bad
There is much more we could have done!
But now those days are dead and gone
Nothing lasts!
All along
You made me feel this useless guilt
Can you look back on what we built?
I wonder what you saw in me...
Tell me was it real?
Was it love?
You tell me...

Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation

Seven, that's the time we leave - at seven

Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back

Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey

All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.
Fellas, won't you tip your hats. Oh boy, ain't she the cats?
Who's that mister, tain't her sister, It's Sweet Georgia Brown."
