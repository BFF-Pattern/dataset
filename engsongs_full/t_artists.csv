Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...

The Autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools,
We built a wall (we built the pyramids),
Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery,
That all started with The Big Bang (Bang)!"

Follow every rainbow,

Every day of your life
For as long as you live.

I wonder
What will my future be?
I wonder
It could be so exciting
To be out in the world
To be free
My heart should be wildly rejoicing
Oh whats the matter with me?

I've always longed for adventure
To do the things I've never dared
Now here I'm facing adventure
Then why am I so scared?

Captain with seven children
Whats so fearsome about that?

Oh I must stop all these doubts
All these worries
If I don't I just know i'll turn back
I must dream of the things I am seeking
I am seeking the courage I lack

The courage to serve them with reliance
Face my mistakes without defiance
Show them I'm worthy
And while I show them
I'll show me! So!

Let them bring on all their problems
I'll do better than my best
I have confidence
They'll put me to the test
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me

Somehow I will impress them
I will be firm but kind
And all those children
Heaven bless them
They will look up to me
And mind me

With each step I am more certain
Everything will turn out fine
I have confidence the world can all be mine
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me

I have confidence in sunshine
I have confidence in rain
I have confidence that spring will come again
Besides what you see I have confidence in me!

Strength doesn't lie in numbers
Strength doesn't lie in wealth
Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumber
When you wake up
Wake up! It's healthy!

All I trust
I give my heart to
All I trust becomes my own
I have confidence
In confidence alone

I have confidence in confidence alone!
Besides what you see I have confidence
In me!!!!!!!!!!!!"

A star has come out to tell me it's time to go
But deep in the dark green forest
Are voices that urge me to stay
So I pause and I wait and I listen
For one more sound for one more lovely thing
That the hills might say

The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing ev'ry song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on it's way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to prey

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before

My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more"

Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
Drifting this way and that
Not touching ground at all
Up above the yard

She isn't sure where she's gone
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was

Burning down the house
Hold tight, wait 'till the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house
Here's your ticket, pack your bags, time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire
All wet, hey you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty five degrees
Burning down the house
It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work said, ""Baby what did you except?""
Gonna burst into flame, go ahead

Burning down the house
My house is out of the ordinary
That's right, don't want to hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house
No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the tv set
Fighting fire with fire

There's good points and bad points
Find a city
Find myself a city to live in.

There are a lot of rich people in birmingham
A lot of ghosts in a lot of houses
Look over there!... A dry ice factory
A good place to get some thinking done

Down el paso way things get pretty spread out
People got no idea where in the world they are
They go up north and come back south
Still got no idea where in the world they are.

Home of elvis and the ancient greeks
Do I smell? I smell home cooking

The Spaniards lived for gold
The white man came and killed them
But they haven't really gone

We live in the city of dreams
We drive on the highway of fire
Should we awake
And find it gone
Remember this, our favorite town

From germany and Europe
And Southern you. S. A.
They made this little town here
That we live in to this day

The children of the white man
Saw Indians on tv
And heard about the legend
How their city was a dream

We live in the city of dreams
We drive on the highway of fire
Should we awake
And find it gone
Remember this, our favorite town

The Civil War is over
And World War One and Two
If we can live together
The dream it might come true

Underneath the concrete
The dream is still alive
A hundred million lifetimes
A world that never dies

We live in the city of dreams
We drive on the highway of fire
Should we awake
And find it gone

Is he not made the same as you?
And some have fallen down
And blood spilled on the ground

Knocking... Knocking... As his neighbors weep

Were sacrificed for agriculture

Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I'd be able to do these things.

And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he's at
He can't afford to stop... That is what he believe
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years.

I'm walking a line-I'm thining about empty motion
I'm walking a line-just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-no time to begin
This isn't the time-so nothing was done
Not talking about-not many at all
I'm turning around-no trouble at all
You notice there's nothing around you, around you
I'm walking a line-divide and dissolve.

Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope

I'm walking a line-i hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line-just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-no time to begin
This isn't the time-so nothing was done
Not talking about-not many at all
I'm turning around-no trouble at all
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line-divide and dissolve.

I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
I'm moving twice as much as I was before
I'll keep on digging to the center of the earth
I'll be down in there moving the in the room...

I'm walking a line-visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line-just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-no time to begin
This isn't the time-so nothing was done
Not talking about-not many at all
I'm turning around-no trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line-divide and dissolve."

Let's not be ourselves today
Is it just my imagination
Is it just someone's fave
Pleasantly out of proportion
It's hard to hold on to the ground
Now I didn't come to run
And this is everything
And gravity lets you down

I get wild, wizing up
I just can't let go
I get wild  when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Living lights
Special lights
Yellow turns blue
I get wild  It's automatic
I can hardly move

Go ahead and pull the curtains
Check to see if I'm still here
Let me lose my perspective
Something worth waiting for
Somewhere in South Carolina
And gravity don't mean a thing
And all around the world
Each and ev'ryone
Playing with a heart of steel

I get up climbing out
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Beautiful
Beautiful
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic
No surprise at all

No one here can recognize you
Here is ev'rything that you like
Feelings without explanations
Somethings are hard to describe
The sound of a cigarette burning
A place there where ev'rything spins
And the sounds inside your mind
Is playing all the time
Playing with a heart of steel

I get wild, wizing up
I just can't let go
I get wild  when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Red 'n' white  black to gold
Yellow turns blue
I get wild  It's automatic
I can hardly move

Girl time, boy time, is that the difference between me and you?

I choose to believe you,
I said before that I can't.

Take it easy baby... Don't let your feelings get in the way.
Some day, I believe, we can live in a world without love.
I can answer your questions,
If you won't twist what I say.
Please respect my opinions,
They will be respected some day.
Because we don't need love.

Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway,
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,
I'm getting used to it now

I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey,
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver,
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas,
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading,
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime,
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no mudd club, or C. B. G. B.,
I ain't got time for that now

Heard about houston? Heard about detroit?
Heard about pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peant butter,
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no
Heaphones, ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard,
I can't write nothing at all
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
I'd like to kiss you, I'd love you hold you
I ain't got no time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,
We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we're tapping pohne lines,
I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives,
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,
I don't know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions,
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,
Whatever you think is best
Burned all my notebooks, what good are
Notebooks? They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace,
The burning keeps me alive
Try to stay healthy, physical fitness,
Don't want to catch no disease
Try to be careful, don't take no chances,

I can see the people on the street
Open those windows up
A hundred floors below me
Pilin' those houses up
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher
I can feel them swayin' back and forth
Building it higher, higher
This tower's learning over

I got bad coordination
Stuck a pencil in my eye
I can hardly wait to get back home
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid?
I's only havin' fun
Scum-bags and superstars
Tell me your names
I'll make a bet, you're
Both the same

I can see my lifetime pilin' up
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars
I can see the house where I was born
When I was growin' up - they say that
I could never keep my trousers up
I remember days and crazy nights
Are there any pirates on this ship?
And if they sober up - they'll have us
Home by morning

Cry, cry, cry
It's just you and I
Like an automobile
With no one at the wheel
Spinning out of control
We're all over the road
In our sexy machine
All the passengers scream
Scream, scream!

I can see my lifetime pilin' up
I can see it smashin' into yours
It was not an accident at all
Open your window up - I hear you laughin'

Goin' one, two, three, four, five
Goin' from the bottom to the top
Maybe I'm holding on too tight
And now I'm growin' up
I got a funny feeling
Pilin' those houses up
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher
Building that highway to the stars
And turning the music up - Hey!
I got a winning number"

Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, into silent water
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

You may ask yourself, where does that highway lead to?
You may ask yourself, am I right, am I wrong?
You may say to yourself, my god, what have I done?

Don't you want to make him. Stay up late.

In the playpen... Woo...(all night long)

Why don't. We pretend.
There you go. Little man.
Cute. Cute. Why not?
Late at night. Wake him up.

A millionaire washing his hands
Rattle of bones, dreams that stick out
A medical chart on the wall
Soft violins and hands touch your throat
Ev'ryone wants to explode

And when your hands get dirty
Nobody knows you at all
Don't have a window to slip out of
Lights on, nobody home

Peeka peeka- risky business
All that blood, they were covered in mess.

They drive in cadillacs
Using walkie-talkies, and the secret service

Their big top
Imitation of life
And all the flags and microphones
We have to cover our eyes

We play the sideshows
And we like the tunnel of love
And when we ride the ferris wheel
We're little children again

And when they're asking for volunteers
We'll be the first ones aboard
And when the ringmaster calls our names
We'll be the first ones to go... To sleep

Stealing all our dreams
Dreams for sale
They sell 'em back to you

On with the show
Start the parade
We sand along
Sweep us away

It's political party time
Going down, going down
And the celebrities all come out
Coming down, coming down, coming...

The sun is going down
And the dogs are starting to howl
We stay out after dark
Eating cotton candy
And the music's playing...

How we all laughed!
We split our sides
The cameras flashed
We almost died!

The rain's gonna pour on down, falling out of the sky
Coming down, coming down
And the celebrities all run out, and the rain's
Coming down, coming down

Gonna rain,
Gonna rain, gonna rain
Gonna rain, gonna rain,

And who he's leavin' behind?"

I have found the line and it's direction is known to me.
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find... Similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.

I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong."

I see it but I pay it no mind.
Hear my voice, hear my voice,
It's saying something and I hope you're concentrating
I've got money now, I've got money now,
C'mon baby, c'mon baby.

Warning sign of things to come (take it over, take it over)
Someone's talking on my telephone (when we're older,
When we're older)
Hear my voice, move my hair.
I move it around a lot, but I don't care. (what I remember)

Warning sign, warning sign,
Look at my hair, I like the design.
It's the truth, it's the truth.
Your glassy eyes and your open mouth
Take it easy, take it easy,
It's a natural thing and you have to relax,
I've got money now, I've got money now.
C'mon baby, C'mon baby.
Warning sign, of things to come (turn me over, turn me over)
Love is here but I guess it's gone now (hurry up babe,
Hurry up babe),
Hear my voice, move my hair.
I move it around a lot, but I don't care.

Do you remember
What it is that you remember
Baby remember
Baby remember."
Talking Heads,What A Day That Was,/t/talking+heads/what+a+day+that+was_20340643.html,"Well, I'm dressed up so nice
An' I'm doin' my best
An' I'm startin' over..
I'm startin' over in another place

Lemme tell you a story
Big chief with a golden crown
He's got rings on his fingers
And then he walks up, up to the throne

He's makin' shapes with his hands
An' don't choo dare sit back
Now don't choo dare sit down
And don't choo dare speak up!

And on the first day, we had everything we could stand
Ooh who could've asked for more?
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
Ooh what a day that was.

There are 50,000 beggars
Roaming in the streets
They have lost all their possessions
They have nothing left to eat

Down come a bolt of lightning
Start an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction
Go pull a fire alarm

I'm dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions

And on the first day, we had everything we could stand
Ooh and then we let it fall
And on the second day, there was nothing else at all
Ooh what a day that was.

Oh a day that was
Ooh that's the way it goes
There's a million ways- to get things done
There's a million ways- to make things work out.

Well I'm going right through
And the light came down
Well they're roundin' 'em up
From all over town

They're movin' forward and backwards
They're movin' backwards and front
And they're enjoying themselves
Moving in ev'ry direction

And if you feel like you're in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
You feel like talking to someone
Who know the difference between right and wrong

And on the first day, we had everything we could stand
Ooh and then we let it fall
And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all
Ooh what a day that was.
(We're go(in') boom boom boom That's the way we live
And in a great big room and That's the way we live.) x3"

Here comes the doctor in charge, she's got some wild, wild life

On the way to the stock exchange, he got some wild, wild life
Break it up when he opens the door, he's doin' wild, wild life

Like sittin' on pins and needles, things fall apart, it's scientific
Sleeping on the interstate, getting wild, wild life
Checkin' in, a checkin' out, I got a wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time, done too much wild, wild life

But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leavin'

No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away.

And you still got it in your drawer, even now.
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days.
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I’m not fine at all...

'Cause there we are again on that little town street,
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter,
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses
In a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me 'bout your past
Thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But, maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I’m paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I’m still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well..."

How it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real
Will I be ready when
My heart starts to fall
What will I do when my love comes to call

And my daddy tells me
That I light up his world
Everyday he says ""Darlin, 
You're my best girl""
He tried to teach me
From the very start
The meaning of love
So nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?
For love

I know I'm not a little
Girl anymore
Cuz I'm feeling things
I've never felt before
Sweet sensations
And anticipations
Calling commotion
To my emotions

And I hear the words
My daddy says to me
He said ""be true to yourself
And keep your spirit free
And love will find you One way or another
Be good to yourself
And be good to each other""

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?

And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of it's hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for this game?
Am I ready for the kiss?
Am I ready for the stars?
Am I ready for the bliss?
Am I ready for love?"

Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sand Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just

Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, american boy

Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl"

So much for summer love and saying ""us""

You weren't mine to lose, oh

You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

This is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time, all the time"

Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to

So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

When summer sings a lullaby

On the hood of his Daddy's car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet Mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby

The world is spinning round
Look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like
Being with my baby

Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture of my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Those back roads were a better way
For me and my baby

The closer that we get
I know I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like
Being with my baby

We both know what we've found

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you

So, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you"
Taylor Swift,Blank Space,/t/taylor+swift/blank+space_21089931.html,"[Verse:]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors, fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Pre-Chorus:]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[Chorus:]
Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 2:]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Pre-Chorus:]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

[B. O. B]
Ever thought about losing it?
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side.
Make a n-gga wanna run staight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times, but still can't find no food in
It,
That's foolishness.

And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look,
And the way we talk and the way we act, and the clothes we bought,
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter? Cause life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same old ladder, in the same boat,
With the same old paddle.

Why so shallow? I'm just asking. What's the pattern for this madness?
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick,
Most of us ain't hollywood actors.
But if it's all for one, and one for all,
Then maybe one day, we all can ball.
Do it one time for the underdogs,
Sincerely yours, from one of yours.

You just wanna live, been everythiing's so low that you could drown in a
Puddle.
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up,
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us.

To every single time that they play this song,
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us.
When the tides get too high snd the sea upon your knees get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person getting lost in the crowd,
Where your partner, no please, uh, because we won't be near yet
Both of us.

But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always a chance to us
These are the things that've molded us and if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up
Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Feel better from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all

'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

Never a clean break, no one here to save me

""I didn't bring her up

I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down
That sweet face?

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said ""he tried but
There's just some things I won't do""
And through the tears
She said ""I couldn't do that to you""
And he said

""I didn't bring you up so he could wear
You down
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away,
You weren't brought up that way""

Says ""it's Officer Tate""
He said ""sir, there's been an accident,
You better come down here right away,
A drunken driver missed an overpass,
And Emily, she's fading fast""
He says ""God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day
They put her

Only thing that kept me alive,
Was that little girl's smile

You pack a suitcase
And take a picture
From the wall
I always knew
This time would come
When I ask how long
You think
You're gonna be
You say

Come undone""

Summer's over
And leaves begin
To fall
And another winter's
On the way

This very well
But I'd give everything
To have you here today

Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine"
Taylor Swift,Clean,/t/taylor+swift/clean_21089669.html,"[Verse:]
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back-and-forth
You still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hum ahead as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus:]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2:]
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus:]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean"
Taylor Swift,Closest To A Cowboy,/t/taylor+swift/closest+to+a+cowboy_21081710.html,"I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me"

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Oh Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made

4 am, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York... Be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... Be here, come back... Be here.

And let me know what you find

And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to your self, Talk to the tears, talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

Wondering where did my baby go?

What's a lifetime of achievement

Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
The universe waits
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows swung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

Taylor Swift,Dear Digdan,/t/taylor+swift/dear+digdan_20898026.html,"This melody is what your love means to me
I love you so much babe can't you see
It is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm
Your love aways kept me safe and warm, 

You had to walk through that open door
I suddenly fell down to the floor
It hurt so much to live without you
I tried not to think about you

You were more than I ever had
My love for you still makes me glad
So please come back we could start anew
No more sitting around feeling blue

So come on, it wil be just me and you
Don't hesitate
It would be great
It's not too late
Lets celebrate!"
Taylor Swift,Dear John,/t/taylor+swift/dear+john_20892108.html,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through
Again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game but you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and you're sick need to give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by your dark twisted games
When I loved you so
I should have known
You are an expert at ""sorry""
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town...
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known..."

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it’s not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It’s death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united, we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Why are my fears at the touch of your hands?
Paper cut stains from my paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I'm poetry, complicated, simply stated
Hey, yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie, are you with me?
When I mess up, I don't get up
I just get down to you

Yesterday was lonely, you're the only one who gets me

I can't stop thinking about you
I bet you're thinking of me too

With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you 
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do 
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife good bye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle 
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried 

Didn't he call you 
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do 
Where were you
And didn't he pray too

The taxis were full up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

And didn't they call you 
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down

But you never realized,

The roses I left you last night,
And the calls unanswered,
Sometimes I think we're getting nowhere,
But you don't care 'cause you're a bastard,
I can do nothing but think of you time and again,
I can't watch you go leaving me alone,
The more I try, the more gets the pain,
Baby, this love is undone,

And I'm really disappointed,
So disappointed of you,
I'm really disappointed of you,
And I'm too frustrated of you,
Disappointed of you,

Did I do something wrong to make you put a hold
On our future, 
It was just a week ago when you asked me
What date I plan to ask you the big question, 
Why did you do this to me

Now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them
Should just add a stone to them and make it read
Here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,

Else in your life
Tell me I wasn't good enough for you
But don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

Why did yo do this
Now I stand here with this ring, flowers, and dirt on my knees
Tears falling down my eyes with humiliation, 
It might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me, 
Tonight isn't a luck y night, 

Now I can't look you in the eyes any more, 
Just go ahead and walk away
Just leave me here in my misery of shame, 

Just let me go, tell me I'm not the one for you
Tell me you found someone else in your life

Don't say you're sorry
And don't tell me you want to when I don't want to anymore

You say you're not ready yet

Reminds me that there's time a to change, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey 
But since his return from his stay on the moon 
He listens like spring and she talks like June, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey

But tell me did you sail across the sun 
Did you make it to the milky way 
To see the lights all faded 
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
One without a permanent scar 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Now that he's back from that soul vacation 
Tracing his way through the constellation, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo 
Reminds me that there's room to grow, eh, eh, ey, eh, eh, ey 
Now that he's back in the atmosphere 
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol Jane 
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did this wind sweep you off your feet 
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
And head back to the milky way 
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind 
Was it everything you wanted to find 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong 
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone

Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim Mcgraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard"
Taylor Swift,Enchanted,/t/taylor+swift/enchanted_20892548.html,"There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered ""have we met?"" across the room your silhouette
Starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up 2am, who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey

It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon

I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em

I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

Catching my death

On thе very moment, all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

Is there a line that I could just go cross?

I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days) (Or the violence of the dog days)

In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

The beautiful kind, making up for lost time, 
Taking flight, making me feel like

Winning battles with our wooden swords,

Where everybody stands and,

Was to be wanted

And tell yourself what you know now

Marry him someday

Taylor Swift,Forever And Always,/t/taylor+swift/forever+and+always_20766343.html,"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?

Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened
Please tell me cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare, at the phone
He still, hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always

Was I out of line? Did I say something way to honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure

So heres to everything
Coming down to nothing
Heres to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare, at the phone
He still, hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said
Forever and always

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always

Didn't mean it baby?
I don't think so

Ohhhhh

Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when you said
Forever and always

Oh, I stare, at the phone
He still, hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
(Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
I shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
Well, he was runnin’ after us, I was screamin’, ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain’t a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,

With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit

Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention

Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons

Taylor Swift,Holy Ground,/t/taylor+swift/holy+ground_21047817.html,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord, it took me away
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of “I need you”
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you

Darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight I’m gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't want to dance
If I’m not dancing with you"

I try to think; try to walk away with you... Me in

Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling,
As we walk down by the drives.
Take my hand, take my breath away,
Cause you make me feel like flying!

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine! Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!

To sit around
And wait for you
But baby can't you see
There's nothin' else
For me to do

Devoted to you

But now
There's nowhere to hide
Since you
Pushed my love aside
I'm not in my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying
""Fool, forget him""
My heart is saying
""Don't let go""
Hold on to the end
That's what
I intend to do

Devoted to you

Pushed my love aside

And I wish I could run to you

Everytime I don’t,
I almost do, I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe

Wait right by the phone every night,

He'll never fall in love
He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He likes to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him...
I'd lie

He looks around the room
And innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on
Doesn't he know
That I've had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He likes to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him...
I'd lie

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you,
But he can play guitar
I think he can see through
Everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up,
My God, he's beautiful
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He likes to argue
Oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him...
If you ask me if I love him...
I'd lie"
Taylor Swift,I'm Only Me When I'm With You,/t/taylor+swift/im+only+me+when+im+with+you_20658841.html,"Friday night beneath the stars,
In a field behind your yard,
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.

And sometimes we don't say a thing;
Just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side.

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you.

[Chorus:]
I'm only up when your not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
The other half I'm only trying to let
You know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.

And I don't try to hide my tears.
My secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.

And you know everything about me.
You say that you can't live without me.

[Chorus:]
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
The other half I'm only trying to let
You know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself.
Only you can tell.

[Chorus:]
That I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
The other half I'm only trying to let
You know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Oh oh oh
Yeah

Yeah"

Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinking bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me here like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to a night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back come back come back to me here like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've be waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back come back come back to me here like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I left you out
But I'd take it all back now

Come back come back come back to me here like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby what about the ending
Oh I thought you'd be here by now oh ohh ohh
Woah oh oh
That you'd be here by now"

You changed everything,
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game,
You changed everything,
You changed the rules!

It kills me to say this,
It really does, it kills my heart!

Reason we're just fallen apart.
But it's not like e to answer
Gonna change my mind!

All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?

Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tight rope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you

It's alright, just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent, still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easy in your firefly catching days
Everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

It's alright just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Everyone of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember.
Today is never too late to
Be brand new

Oh, it's alright just wait and see your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay life is a tough crowd

Sleeping in tents

You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact who she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

Begging 'til my knees bled

Praying to his greed

But I've got me

She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone by the first ray of sun,
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound,
But I understand that somehow

If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well,
But I could tell that her smile Was only something to hide behind.
She felt so out of touch, Cause she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want Nothings ever enough And time stands still,
When you're nowhere bound,
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night
Would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lines
And unfamiliar exit signs
I'd just drive on by,
Just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan
I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
And I don't have a when
And I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

Drive all

Drive all night

I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
I thought you were someone to rely on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special"
Taylor Swift,Last Kiss,/t/taylor+swift/last+kiss_20892702.html,"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58 
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me so why did you go... away.

I do recall now the smell of the rain, 
Fresh on the pavement, 
I ran off the plane, 
That July ninth, the beat of your heart, 
It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms. 

But now I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes, 
All that I know is I don't know, 
How to be something you miss. 
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this 
Your name forever the name on my lips 

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then you pulled me in. 
I'm not much for dancing, 
But for you I did because 
I loved your handshake meeting my father 
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets 
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something. 
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions and 

I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes, 
All that I know is I don't know, how to be something you miss. 
Never thought we'd have a last kiss 
Never imagined we'd end like this 
Your name forever the name on my lips
Ohh 

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep and 
I'll feel you forget me like I use to feel you breathe and 
I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are. 
Hope it's nice where you are and 
I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and 
Something reminds you, 
You wish you had stayed we can plan for a change in weather and time, 
I never planned on you changing your mind. 

So, 
I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes, 
All that I know is I don't know, how to be something you miss. 
Never thought we'd have a last kiss 
Never imagined we'd end like this 
Your name forever the name on my lips, 
Just like our last kiss, 
Forever the name on my lips, 
Forever the name on my lips. 
Just like our last"

My kind is the odd and quiet type, but I can be loud when I want to,
Don't be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too,
You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but I'm not helping that task
You tell all your friends that I am real strange,
You can't talk cos your gay,
Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall,
You need give me space, ortherwise I will.... Nut you.

You call me every name under the starlit sky,
Get a life, that's worth living, your making mine like hell.

Don't be stupid and wreck your life,
Go away dj, I aint that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge,
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone!"

That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines

Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring

Oil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person

A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall

Taylor Swift,Long Live,/t/taylor+swift/long+live_20892705.html,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls would crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, one day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You trade your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls would crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders, One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls would crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls would crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you

And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered"

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

That without them, you feel like nothing

You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello, little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, they're tryin to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes

And she says do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you
Do do do do do do do do

She sings her little songs
She walks a long a little
Halfway headed for the skies
Left to travel,
Lives they unravel
Mind over matter,
That's what she says

Mama named her Lucky
On a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket,
She dances in spite of
The fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

Maybe she'll sing you do do do
Maybe she'll bring you
Into the skies
Honey, she'll love you
Funny how some view
Angels above you,
Aint so far away.

Mama named her Lucky
On a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket,
She dances in spite of
The fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you"

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

They strike to kill and you know I will

What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth ""fuck you forever""?

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear till her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
They say ""move on""
But you know I won't
And women like hunting witches, too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear till her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

I'm taking my time
Taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb
Watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad

You made her like that"

I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name: Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

But last... There was love on the...
And when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.

I keyed her car, got my guitar and wrote this damn song,
Look what you found she's been around I hear the line's long
And don't you tell me to be nice, I'm not a nice girlshe died of complications from the things you told her
So when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down.

Any funny you said honey you... Dark,

Taylor Swift,Mean,/t/taylor+swift/mean_20892128.html,"You, with your words like knives, 
And swords and weapons that you use against me.

You, have knocked me off my feet again, 
Got me feeling like a nothing.

You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded.

You, picking on the weaker man. 

You can take me downnn, 
With just one single blow~

But you don't know, 
What you don't know! 

Someday, I'll be, living in a big ol' city, 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday, I'll be, big enough so you can't hit me, 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.

Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides, 
And your wildfire lies, and your humiliation.

You, have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them. 

I walk with my head down, 
Trying to block you out, cause I'll never impress you.
I just want to feel okay again.

I bet you got pushed around~
Somebody made you cold.
But the cycle ends right now.
Because you can't lead me down that road.

And you don't know, 
What you don't know.

Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city, 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be, 
Big enough so you can't hit me.

And all you're ever gonna be is mean.

Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now, in a bar, 
Talking over a football game.
With that same big loud opinion, 
But nobody's listening.

Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things.
Drunk and grumbling on about, 
How I can't sing.

But all you are is mean.

All you are is mean, 
And a liar, 
And pathetic, 
And alone in life.

And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean! 

But someday I'll be living in a big ol' city, 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.
YEAH-EAH! 
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me, 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.

Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city, 
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean.

Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me,

Taylor Swift,Mine,/t/taylor+swift/mine_20457203.html,"You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left the small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You said we'll never make my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh oh ohh
And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
And I ran out crying and you followed me out into the streets
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said I'll ever leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

(Hold on, make it last)
(Hold on, never turn back)
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
(Yes, yes), Do you believe it?
(Yes, yes), We're gonna make it now

 I can see it now"

Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard

And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

I'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

I'm going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh....

Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?"
Taylor Swift,Need You Now,/t/taylor+swift/need+you+now_21513665.html,"I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But i'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Words i heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain
Your mind as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now"
Taylor Swift,Never Grow Up,/t/taylor+swift/never+grow+up_20892549.html,"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder that I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up"

Watch you from the stars

I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then, I love you

And everytime you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time, everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby
To make it go away
So look at you and look at me
I think of who we could be

And everytime I look at you
I can hardly say a thing

What happens when you turn away?
And everything turns blue and gray
And I just wish I told you never mind

But baby, never mind

Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

We play dumb we know exactly what we're doing

We hang back its all in the timing

Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity

That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt

At her job or anywhere

And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

And said oh my, my, my...

Take me back to the house with the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me

Just two kids

Take me back to the creek those weeks in love
Two am ridin in your truck
And all I need
Is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very fist fight
The slammin of doors 'stead of kissin goodnight
You stayed outside
Til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, my

A few years head gone and come around
We were sittin at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time
When we walked down the aisle
The whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do
And I did too
Took me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time

And crawled on my knees
Through the valley
Of the shadow of doubt

Gonna sail the ocean,
Gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain,

We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days were over
You were calling my name when your face faded from view

And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
And wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you

Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

And what ever happened to the things you loved
And the songs we played, and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and Maude and singing
Like Harold and Maude and singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?"

Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Asking God if He could play it again

After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away

Got to the hallway, well, on my way
To my lovin' bed

And the note that said

And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours"

Looking at it now, it all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch, I remember!
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus:]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?

In the clear yet, god.
Are we out of the woods?

[Verse 2:]
Looking at it now, Last December
we were built to fall apart, then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck, the night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (We decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus:]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good.

Are we out of the woods?

[Verse 3:]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying
Baby, I did too
But when the sun came up
I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up
You were looking at me

[Pre-Chorus:]
You were looking at me 
Oh!
You were looking at me.
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
I remember.
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?

Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

The wine is cold

Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

Darling, you're the one I want, and
Paper rings and picture frames and dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best

Just another picture to burn.

Planning my revenge.

Start ringing her bell

Of the red, white, and blue

Passionate as sin, ended so suddenly

Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him is like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh red burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head

Burning red! 
Darling it was red! 

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

We'd go so loud, but we don't care,

Cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.

You'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,

And this moment is perfect.

Train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.

Don't you dare be quiet.

This journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.




Lets take the ride of our lives.

This is the moment where the chemistry happens,

Yeah that special connection.

These are the days of our lives.

These are the times you'll never forget.
Never regret as long as we ride here side by side.

We can speak, we can dream,

This is our time, you and me,

Lets have the ride of our lives.



As we watch the world outside the window past,

I'd pray, hoping that this moment lasts.

You've got me smiling, got me thinking that I've got it all.

You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,

Cause every time we ride together it's like stranger than fiction.

I don't ever want this train ride to come to an end,

But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.

Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here

Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Get a box or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Some perspective, but I sat and stared

Slip a sable
Under the tree
For me
I've been
An awful good girl
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Santa baby
A '54 convertible
Too, light blue
Well
I'll wait up for you
Dear, santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight
Yeah

Think of all
The fun I've missed
Think of all the boys
I haven't kissed
Next year I could be
Just as good
If you check off
My Christmas list

Santa baby
I want a yacht
And really
That's not a lot
I've been an angel
All year
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Santa, honey
There's one more thing
I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Come and trim
My Christmas tree
With some decorations
Bought at Tiffany's
I really do
Believe in you
Let's see
If you believe in me

Santa baby
Forgot to mention
One little thing
A ring
And I don't mean
On the phone
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight"

Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 2]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Any time I wanted

The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say
That you'd take it all back,
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd
Get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there,
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no,
Baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things
To say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past,
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd

Oh, oh, oh

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

Noooooooo, nooo
No, no, noooooo, nooo...

You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go

The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still throught
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleamin
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nights"

Kinda know that I won't get far

Close enough to touch
Close enough so hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but

And watch the lights go wild

And she is yelling at a bridesmaid, somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

You need to hear me out and they said speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a n-gga wanna run staight through the fence
Open up the fridge about twenty times
But you still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look, and the
Way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought, how much that
Cost?
Does it even really matter?
Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern to the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs

That you could drown in the puddle

So every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what bobby ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea upon your knees get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that've molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I woulda wound up
Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs

Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
I made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'til the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you
Oh, with half of my heart
With half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Time will hold, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you with half of my...

Half of my heart
Half of my heart

Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything

Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart"

From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad, you're already had the best days
The best days of your life

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight

And ain't it sad?
You can forget about what we had
Take a look at her and do you like what you see?
Or do you wish it was me

'Cause I'll be there, in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad, you've already had the best days
The best days of your life

And does she know?
Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one

I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?

'Cause I'll be there, in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad, you've already had the best days
The best days of your life

... With me was a fairytale love
I was head-over-heals 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you've already had the best days
The best days of your life

I heard you're gonna got married
Have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But, I've been told that a cheater
Is always a cheater
So I've got my pride, and she's got you...

'Cause I'll be there, in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad, you've already had the best days
The best days of your life

Of your life
Oh, oh, yeah
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me in your life
Oh, oh, yeah
It's a shame, it's a shame...

Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

To keep free people from Red domination
And maybe you can't vote, boy, but man your battle stations
Or therell be no need for votin in future generations

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

There are buttons to push in two mighty nations
But whos crazy enough to risk annihilation?
The buttons are there to ensure negotiation
So don't be afraid, boy, it's our only salvation

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

You tell me that marches wont bring integration
But look what it's done for the voter registration
Be thankful our country allows demonstrations
Instead of condemnin, make some recommendations
I don't understand the cause of your aggravation
You mean to tell me, boy, it's not a better situation?

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

You missed all the good in your evaluation
What about the things that deserve commendation?
Where there once was no cure, there's vaccination
Where there once was a desert, there's vegetation
Self-governments replacing colonization
What about the Peace Corp. organization?
Don't forget the work of the United Nations

So over and over again, you keep sayin it's the end
But I say you're wrong, were just on the dawn of correction

Traditional,Danny Boy,/t/traditional/danny+boy_21180755.html,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!"

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then"", said the Angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might""

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down
Unto the Lord did pray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy"

From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep"

Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in Thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And, gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

O morning stars, together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven

No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him
Still the dear Christ enters in

Where children, pure and happy
Pray to the Blessed Child
Where misery cries out to Thee
Son of the Mother mild

Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks
And Christmas comes once more

O Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel"

As on the plain she'd while away the day;

She loved a warrior bold,
This shy little maid of old,
But brave and gay, he rode one day
To battle far away.

Chorus:
Now, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
The breeze is sighing, the night bird's crying,
For afar 'neath his star her brave is sleeping,
While Red Wing's weeping her heart away.

She watched for him day and night,
She kept all the campfires bright,
And under the sky, each night she would lie,
And dream about his coming by and by;

But when all the braves returned,
The heart of Red Wing yearned,
For far, far away, her warrior gay,
Fell bravely in the fray.

Now, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
The breeze is sighing, the night bird's crying,
For afar 'neath his star her brave is sleeping,
While Red Wing's weeping her heart away.

As sharp as any thorn;

I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place, now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace, I could've stayed...
But I chose the life, I chose the life, then I realized, she might've been the one, I let it go for a little fun. I made a trade gave away our days for a little fame, now I'll never see your face but it's okay I adapted anyway. Uh ohhh

Adapted to these models
Whose adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay here till tomorrow
Just to tare down all their morals

So clean, as opposed to what I offered

Domesticate you

And I'll pull you closer holding on to

And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile

You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know

How all of this would end up
Girl I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight

You knew that talking dirty to me
On the phone would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected girl
You're such a masochist and I ask why

And you reply
I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So baby don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone

Baby please
Would you end your night with me
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little life

But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
Got some bad new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me s** in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
""I heard he do drugs now""
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute
We just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin
And when we act a fool
It's probably cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal
Ain't no fuckin phony
Big O know the deal
He the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fuckin beat
Like he fuckin told me
Is that your girl, what's her fuckin story?
She cut her bag but she ride it like a fuckin pony
I cut down on her man
Be her fuckin story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man
Get to know me
Ain't no offense though
I promise you
If you a real man dude you gon' side the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare; Elm Street

Mix it in the potion like a science

The shit so raw nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me is when I'm balling with my niggas

Don't hold back

[Verse 2:]
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you 'to my west coast girl
Until they book a show in nyc
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, tryna finish all this potion
Baby take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still hot, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong, and never sleep until it's mornin'

[Bridge:]

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside, so you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just twelve months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
God damn I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me something to pop
I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver gettin' fired
And I don't got any friends, I got xo in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida,
Ft. Lauderdale to that mia
Cold drinks, Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits,
White Russian with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of your tongue rings
She likes the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard to her teacher
I make it harder, with gold grills
I make her suck, with gold grills
In the back room, In the vip
She don’t ever leave…

If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

Ask me if I do this every day, I said ""Often""
Ask how many times she rode the wave, ""Not so often""
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

Ask me if I do this every day, I said ""Often""
Ask how many times she rode the wave, ""Not so often""
Bitches down to do it either way, often

This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

Often, often, girl I do this often
In that thing, switch lane to lane, look like I spent a fortune
Awesome, 100 plus, can't this from the auction
Need a chick to ride my dick and back it up like parking
Show that pussy, work that pussy
Who that pussy, that's my pussy
Wet that pussy, stroke that pussy
Ooh! I twist the weed
You on your phone texting your friend to come fuck
I wonder if it's the druggies wit hoes or the millions of bucks
But, ask me if I do this everyday you know
I'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know
Trade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know
I'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know

Freakier than freaky, when she climax she make [?]
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin'
Long eyelashes, palmin' her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'

You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real

But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through

We're professional

We're sophisticated
At loving...

What does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes it's way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's supposed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you've put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah

I love, you love

We're sophisticated

All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
Because your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how did you drain all the soul from your eyes
How did you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no
Every touch that you sell is a lie

I love, you love
This love

I know, you know

Buy you a rollie to make up for time
And flood it all out to make sure you shine girl

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

The sun and the moon and star, boy

And five of us have probably fucked

Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)

I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?

If I didn't make it then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

Said you want a little company
And I love it cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be
Your pill refill and I’ll still be
Your addiction, you can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly, we hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each other
But we gon' film cause I will want your ex to see
(Get it?) that...

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me, but at night, if you seek those thrills
What I expect to be?
Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that...

I apologize but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely on me
I remember on the bathroom floor
Before I went on tour
Like you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, oooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And oh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will

Honey please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just speaking lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in

For all my souljas just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say ""your lyrics do shit for me""

I get 3 suv's for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at french laundry and napa valley
Scallops and glasses of dolce, that shit right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at ya, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choosing to be at now

And tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
You need a minute, you got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
When you record with 2 others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see the nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya nigga

The pain, the air is killing me
For years my limbs stretched to the sky
A nest for birds to sit and sing

But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't bear the glow
They did so long ago

One day I was full of life
My sap was rich and I was strong
From seed to tree I grew so tall
Through wind and rain I could not fall

But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't offer
Poetry to men of song

Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this world can give
Pollution and slow death

Oh Lord I lay me down
No life's left to be found
There's nothing left for me

Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this earth can give
Is pollution

Trees like me weren't meant to live
(Oh Lord I lay me down)
If all this earth can give
(My branches to the ground)
Is pollution and slow death

There's nothing left for me"

Now a young man's gone
But his legend lingers on
For so much had he to give

But his life is through
For the story told is true
For he died just as he lived

For this daring young star
Met his death while in his car
No one knows the reason why

Screaming tire, flashing fire
And gone was this young star
Oh how could they let him die

Still a young man is gone
Yet his legend lingers on
For he died without a cause

And they say that he'll
Be known for evermore
As the 'Rebel Without A Cause'"

She must have had some others before I finally met her
And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain
Betsy took some beatings but she never once complained

She had a classic beauty that everyone could see

To remembering the fascinating episode of the night before

And sat in his favorite chair

Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And with my old guitar 
I'll make up songs to sing.
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water

And so while stars shine brightly from up above
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log.

Precipice-footed ridges
Above Ventana Creek, that jagged country which nothing but a fallen
Meteor will ever plow: no horseman
Will ever ride there, no hunter cross this ridge but the winged ones, no
One will steal the eggs from this fortress.
The she-eagle is old, her mate was shot long ago, she is now mated
With a son of hers.
When lightning blasted her nest she built it again on the same tree, in
The splinters of the thunder bolt.
In a broken shack an old man takes his time about dyin'
And just at the back a wild flowerbed that he'll lie in
In dawn's new light a man might venture
A horse drawn stage from Monterey.
The she-eagle is older than I: she was here when the fires of eighty-five
Raged on these ridges,
She was lately fledged and dared not hunt ahead of them, but ate scorched meat.
The world has changed in her time; humanity has multiplied,
But not here; men's hopes and thoughts and customs have changed, their
Powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic.
Spilled down the hill a wagon load of bodies lay scattered, shipwrecked at sea.
Limestone ore is all that mattered.
They took it from the hills right through the cargo doors
How many ships have come and gone at Thurso's landing shore?
The unstable animal never has been changed so rapidly.
The motor and the plane and the great war have gone over him,
And Lenin has lived and Jehovah died: while the mother-eagle
Hunts her same hills, crying the same beautiful and lonely cry
And is never tired: dreams the same dreams,
And hears at night the rock-slides rattle and thunder in the
Throats of these living mountains.
It is good for man
To try all changes, progress and corruption, powers, peace and anguish,
Not to go down the dinosaur's way
Until all his capacities have been explored: and it is good for him
To know that his needs and nature are no more changed, in fact, in ten
Thousand years than the beaks of eagles.
Of the eagle's plight, we know that nature's balance is undone.
And it's the birthright of man to unify and live his life as one.
A whisper of the word will let you soar with your soul."

Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'cause santa claus comes tonight

Presents have been passed
The wood in the fireplace
Is glowing its last
I'm closing my eyes now
In my bed I'm snuggling
Outside my window
The carolers sing

Christmas comes and the snow covers all
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread
The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed

A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
And may your christmas
Last all year
With laughter of children
Peace and cheer

Now before I melt away. ""

With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.

Right to the traffic cop.

The funky pretty flame in my heart
Me and my Pisces lady are apart

Her calendar is not like ours (She rules the hours)
The hieroglyphs mark changing hours (She rules the stars)
Her guiding light is from the stars (She's got the powers)
Whoa
A book of verse a jug of wine (She's soft like wine)
She'll always tell what's on your mind (She's much like time)
By just your birthday place and time (She's very fine)

Cause it's a silent night in the sea
And if you're cosmic'ly conscious you'll see
Why she's a princess incarnate to me
Daughter of Neptune the ruler of the sea

The queen in Copenhagee (Funky pretty)
The dream of Amsterdamee (Pretty funky)
The cream of gay Parisee (Funky pretty)
The theme of you Say Asee (Pretty funky)
The scene in Great Britainyee (Funky pretty)
The meaning in Los Angees (Pretty funky)
The heat in Tokyosee (Funky pretty)
The treat in Manhattohsee (Pretty funky)
Yeah yeah funky pretty

She said ""Don't worry it's alright
I'm coming back when the aspects are right""
And now I look in the paper each day
Wonderin' what my horoscope will say

Funky (oooo funky)
I still remember funky pretty (ooooo)
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why 
(Why can't you tell me why)

Funky (ooo funky) (something so why)
I still remember funky pretty (something so why)

When they leave Capistrano
Fly away so gracefully

Going clear up to the roof

Take five

Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys weve known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing well never walk alone

When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind

It's getting obvious that's not where it's at
A big pot and tripley chin
Oh what condition my condition was in
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame
What ever happened to my greek godly frame

Cyclamates juicy steaks, sweet things too
Aren't always good as they seem
Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too
That's what you get when you eat that way

I read a book on organic foods
Jumped on a health food kick
Put me in the mood
You may not get to perfect overnight
But on the way you're feelin' clean out of sight
We ate tonight at fairfax and 3rd
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today
We're mighty thankful now that H. E. L. P. 's on its way
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat
With carrot juice to wash it all down
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat
And H. E. L. P. Has got the best food in town

Hamburgers and hot dogs throw 'em all out

Giving to you can you dig
Me

Me I'm only searchin' for the things I really need
I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water
And I can barely barely breathe
Rolling down the road
Rolling down the road
Rolling down the road
Rolling down the road
Rolling down the road

Hear the music play

The Beach Boys,Here Today,/t/the+beach+boys/here+today_20013844.html,"It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

Youve got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her

Well I'm not saying you wont have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

Youve got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast"

I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time

Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the spanish and indian home
Home of the heroes and villains

Once at night the cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dudell do in a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what youve done

Heroes and villains
Just see what youve done

Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright
By the heroes and

Heroes and villains
Just see what youve done

Heroes and villains
Just see what youve done"

Sitting against a small stump
Behind some flowerbeds

The light from his bedroom window he could still see
The music of bach was playing

After a while it began to sound distant
As the young prince gazed at this radio on his knee
The music was floating away from his hearing

What could be happening
He took it off of his knee
And put the radio to his ear
Nothing happened

Then the transistor left his hands
And was floating in the mid-air
Two feet off the ground

As the prince laughed
It suddenly turned around
And it was light green phosphourous in color

Dancing back and forth
The magic transistor
Started moving down his path

He could hear the sound out
Like nothing he had ever heard before

The trees were getting closer together
And flowers glowed with tinges of magic light
As he followed thinking to himself
"" what's going on?""

The transistor lifted slowly
Up to the top of a little tree
And sat there
While it slowly became louder
To where the prince could hear it clearly

Fireflies shot across the path in front of the prince
He turned around and couldn't see the light from his window
There he was watching all alone all by himself
He got a hunch to get back to his room
And he turned and ran right back"

In the back of my mind I still have my fears

I live my life with her
Love her true she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm 'fraid it's gonna change

I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just good the way they'll be
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I leave her
It will always be way in the back of my mind"

In the sun ocean spray
To get your face in the race
Or lay back's no disgrace

And have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one

And enjoy it while it lasts

Like distant bugles love is very gone
It's over now

It took a part of me, the heart of me
To watch it fade away

Heaven is far away
Angels no longer play

I need to take this fear and force it down
And just pretend that you are not around

And cry my blues away

You had a way of making it come alive

It was the last place
That he stopped at
On the way back to his boat

She was dancing
Met his glancing
Like they say
""It was all she wrote""

But I can't stay (bye bye)

And when the sun goes down
I'll say ""goodbye"" to this Hawaiian town

You and Lahaina always on my mind

They left the dance floor
So they could spend more
Precious time near the water side

It wasn't wrong
And it wasn't right
They were two ships
Passing in the night

You know I want to
But I can't stay (bye bye)

Leaving this town for another one

So afraid to lose this dream
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can
It's so easy to lose my way
Lay your head where you may find some peace 
I've been searching for my happiness
Don't you want to wake up and take my love,
I'd be happy if you'd let me know
Should I stay or go
Let me know
Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me, 
Of new realities, 
Heavenly angels won't you guide me 
Please help me to decide the path most 
Meant for me."

He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

Turn around and help the monster turn it out

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
And if you don't have core hard cash
You can still do the monster mash
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too

Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash

Tom Lehrer,A Christmas Carol,/t/tom+lehrer/a+christmas+carol_20138380.html,"One very familiar type of song is the christmas carol. Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time. However, I'm informed by my ""disk jockey"" friends - of whom I have none,
In order to get a song popular by christmas time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here goes. It has always seemed to me after all. That christmas, with it's spirit of giving, o
Us all a wonderful opportunity each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply believe in.

I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street, even attempt to capture the true spirit of christmas as we celebrate it in the unit
Ates. That is to say the commercial spirit. So I should like to offer the following christmas carol for next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.

Christmas time is here, by golly,
Disapproval would be folly,
Deck the halls with hunks of holly,
Fill the cup and don't say ""when.""
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens,
Mix the punch, drag out the dickens,
Even though the prospect sickens,
Brother, here we go again.

On christmas day you can't get sore,
Your fellow man you must adore,
There's time to rob him all the more
The other three hundred and sixty-four.

Relations, sparing no expense'll
Send some useless old utensil,
Or a matching pen and pencil.
""just the thing I need! how nice!""
It doesn't matter how sincere it
Is, nor how heartfelt the spirit,
Sentiment will not endear it,
What's important is the price.

Hark the herald tribune sings,
Advertising wondrous things.
God rest ye merry, merchants,
May you make the yuletide pay.
Angels we have heard on high
Tell us to go out and buy!

So let the raucous sleigh bells jingle,
Hail our dear old friend kris kringle,
Driving his reindeer across the sky.
Don't stand underneath when they fly by.
Actually I did rather well myself, this last christmas. The nicest present I received was a gift certificate ""good at any hospital for a lobotomy"". Rather thoughtful."
Tom Lehrer,Alma,/t/tom+lehrer/alma_20138391.html,"Last december 13th, there appeared in the newspapers the juiciest, spiciest, raciest obituary that has ever been my pleasure to read. it was that of a lady name alma mahler gropius werfel who ha

Interesting, there were three whom she went so far as to marry.

One of the leading composers of the day: gustav mahler, composer of das lied von der erde and other light classics. one of the leading architects: walter gropius of the bauhaus school of design.
One of the leading writers: franz werfel, author of the song of bernadette and other masterpieces. it's people like that who make you realize how little you've accomplished. it is a sobering tho
For example, that when mozart was my age he had been dead for two years. it seemed to me, I'm reading this obituary, that the story of alma was the stuff of which ballads should be made so here
Ne.

The loveliest girl in vienna
Was alma, the smartest as well.
Once you picked her up on your antenna,
You'd never be free of her spell.

Her lovers were many and varied,
From the day she began her -- beguine.
There were three famous ones whom she married,
And God knows how many between.

Alma, tell us!
All modern women are jealous.
Which of your magical wands
Got you gustav and walter and franz?

The first one she married was mahler,
Whose buddies all knew him as gustav.
And each time he saw her he'd holler:
""ach, that is the fraulein I moost have!""

Their marriage, however, was murder.
He'd scream to the heavens above,
""i'm writing das lied von der erde,
And she only wants to make love!""

Alma, tell us!
All modern women are jealous.
You should have a statue in bronze
For bagging gustav and walter and franz.

While married to gus, she met gropius,
And soon she was swinging with walter.
Gus died, and her tear drops were copious.
She cried all the way to the altar.

But he would work late at the bauhaus,
And only came home now and then.
She said, ""what am I running? a chow house?
It's time to change parters again.""

Alma, tell us!
All modern women are jealous.
Though you didn't even use ponds,
You got gustav and walter and franz.

While married to walt she'd met werfel,
And he too was caught in her net.
He married her, but he was carefell,
'cause alma was no bernadette.

And that is the story of alma,
Who knew how to receive and to give.
The body that reached her embalma'
Was one that had known how to live.

Alma, tell us!
How can they help being jealous?
Ducks always envy the swans
Who get gustav and walter,
You never did falter,
With gustav and walter and franz.

I know some people feel that marriage as an institution is dying out, but I disagree and the point was driven home to me rather forcefully not long ago by a letter I received which said: ""d
G, I love you and I cannot live without you. marry me, or I will kill myself."" well, I was a little disturbed at that until I took another look at the envelope and saw that it was addressed
Ccupant.

Speaking of love, one problem that recurs more and more frequently these days in books,and plays,and movies on, is the inability of people to communicate with the people they love. husbands and
Who can't communicate; children who can't communicate with their parents, and so on. and the characters in these books, and plays, and so on, and in real life, I might add, spend hours bemoanin
Fact that they can't communicate. I feel that if a person can't communicate the very least he can do is to shut up."
Tom Lehrer,Be Prepared,/t/tom+lehrer/be+prepared_20138405.html,"You know: of all the songs I've ever sung, that is the one I've had the most requests not to.
I have time for one more here. This one is a little song dedicated to the boy scouts of america. [applause] we seem to have a convention here tonight. The boy scouts of america, those noble litt
Bastions of democracy, and the american legion of tomorrow. Their motto is... I would like to state at this time that I am not now and have never been... A member of the boy scouts of america.
Motto is, as you know, be prepared! And that is the name of this song.

Be prepared! That's the boy scout's marching song,
Be prepared! As through life you march along.
Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well,
Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell.

Be prepared! To hide that pack of cigarettes,
Don't make book if you cannot cover bets.
Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure
That they will not be found
And be careful not to smoke them
When the scoutmaster's around
For he only will insist that it be shared.
Be prepared!

Be prepared! That's the boy scouts' solemn creed,
Be prepared! And be clean in word and deed.
Don't solicit for your sister, that's not nice,
Unless you get a good percentage of her price.

Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you.
If you're looking for adventure of a
New and different kind,
And you come across a girl scout who is
Similarly inclined,
Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared.
Be prepared!"

U'll find yourself at a reunion of grads, and old undergrads, and eh... somebody will start proking out one of these things and everyone will gradually join in. each in his own key, of course. u
The place is just soggy with nostalgia. well, a typical such song might be called bright college days, and might go like this.

Bright college days, oh, carefree days that fly,
To thee we sing with our glasses raised on high.
Let's drink a toast as each of us recalls
Ivy-covered professors in ivy-covered halls.

Turn on the spigot,
Pour the beer and swig it,
And gaudeamus igit-ur.

Here's to parties we tossed,
To the games that we lost,
We shall claim that we won them some day.

To the girls young and sweet,
To the spacious back seat
Of our roommate's beat up chevrolet.

To the beer and benzedrine,
To the way that the dean
Tried so hard to be pals with us all.

To excuses we fibbed,
To the papers we cribbed
From the genius who lived down the hall.

To the tables down at morey's (wherever that may be)
Let us drink a toast to all we love the best.
We will sleep through all the lectures,
And cheat on the exams,
And we'll pass, and be forgotten with the rest.

Oh, soon we'll be out amid the cold world's strife.
Soon we'll be sliding down the razor blade of life.

Ready?


But as we go our sordid sep'rate ways,
We shall ne'er forget thee, thou golden college days.

Hearts full of youth,
Hearts full of truth,
Six parts gin to one part vermouth."
Tom Lehrer,Clementine,/t/tom+lehrer/clementine_20138382.html,"I should like to consider the folk song, and expand briefly on a theory I have held for some time, to the effect that the reason most folk songs are so atrocious is that they were written by the
Le. If professional songwriters had written them instead, things might have turned out considerably differently. For example, consider the old favorite, with which, I'm sure, you're all familiar
Ot; clementine"", you know:

In a cavern, in a canyon,
Dadada dadadada...
A song with no recognizable merit what'soever, and imagine what might have happened if, for example, cole porter had tried writing this song. The first verse might have come out like this:

In a cavern, in a canyon,
Excava-ha-ha-hating for a mine,
Far away from the boom-boom-boom of the city
She was so pretty, what a pity, clementine.

Oh clementine, can't you tell from the howls of me
This love of mine calls to you from the bowels of me.
Are you discerning the returning
Of this churning, burning, yearning for you-oo-oo... Ah-ah...
Well, supposing at this point that mozart (or one of that crowd) had tried writing a verse, the next one might have come out as a baritone aria from an italian opera, somewhat along these lines:

Era legera e come un fairy
E suo shoes numero nine,
Herring bo-ho-ho-hoxes senza to-ho-ho-hopses,
Sandalae per clementina si, per clementina si,
Per clementina sandalae, per clementina sandalae, per clementine.
Clehementina, clehementina, clehe-he-mentina...

Herring boxes senza topses sandalae per clementina,
Herring boxes senza topses sandalae per clementina,
Che sciagura clementina, che sciagura clementina, cara clementina, cara
Clementina-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
Supposing at this rather dramatic juncture in the narrative, one of our modern ""cool school"" of composers had tried writing a verse, the next one might have come out like this:

Drove those ducklings to the water
Yeah brach! Doddley doo doo uh ah!
Ev'ry morning like 9am
Ooh pah! De do de do do do, biddley da!
Got hung up on a splinter, got a-hung up on a splinter
Cloo ge mop! Huh huh!
Do de do de do do do
Fell into the foamy brine, dig that crazy clementine, man!
To end on a happy note, one can always count on gilbert and sullivan for a rousing finale, full of words and music and signifying nothing.

That I missed her depressed her young sister named esther,
This mister to pester she tried.
Now her pestering sister's a festering blister,
You're best to resist her, say I.

The mister resisted, the sister persisted,
I kissed her, all loyalty slipped.
When she said I could have her, her sister's cadaver
Must surely have turned in it's crypt.
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

But I love she and she loves me.
Enraptured are the both of we.
Yes I love she and she loves I
And will through all eternity!

See what I mean?"
Tom Lehrer,Everybody Eat,/t/tom+lehrer/everybody+eat_20138417.html,"Everybody eat!

For example there's an uncle who when he's drunk'll be a real pest.
And cousin julia is actin' childish to put it mildish.

Fight fiercely, harvard,
Fight, fight, fight!
Demonstrate to them our skill.
Albeit they possess the might,
Nonetheless we have the will.
How we shall celebrate our victory,
We shall invite the whole team up for tea
(how jolly!)
Hurl that spheroid down the field, and
Fight, fight, fight!

Fight fiercely, harvard,
Fight, fight, fight!
Impress them with our prowess, do!
Oh, fellows, do not let the crimson down,
Be of stout heart and thru.
Come on, chaps, fight for harvard's glorious name,
Won't it be peachy if we win the game?
(oh, goody!)
Let's try not to injure them, but
Fight, fight, fight!
And do fight fiercely!
Fight, fight, fight!"
Tom Lehrer,George Murphy,/t/tom+lehrer/george+murphy_20138392.html,"During the last election we had a good deal of fun back east following your senatorial contest out here. I'm from massachusetts and I feel we have a certain right to gloat over the other states
Se massachusetts is after all the only state with three senators. anyway, here's a salute to your new junior senator.

Hollywood's often tried to mix
Show business with politics,
From helen gahagan
To ronald reagan,
But mister murphy is the star
Who's done the best by far.

Oh gee, it's great,
At last we've got a senator who can
Really sing and dance!
We can't expect america
To win against it's foes
With no one in the senate who
Can really tap his toes.

The movies that you've seen
On your television screen
Show his legislative talents at a glance.
Should americans pick crops? george says ""no,
'cause no one but a mexican would stoop so low.""
And after all, even in egypt, the pharaohs
Had to import
Hebrew braceros.

Think of all the musicals we have in store.
Imagine: broadway melody of 1984.
Yes, now that he's a senator, he's really got the chance
To give the public

I hold your hand in mine, dear,

From your dainty fingertips.

My joy would be complete, dear,
If you were only here,
But still I keep your hand
As a precious souvenir.

The night you died I cut it off.
I really don't know why.

And waitin' for the robert E. Lee.

Where pellagra makes you scrawny,
And the honeysuckle clutters up the vine

Down below that mason-dixon line.

Oh, poll tax, how I love ya, how I love ya,
My dear old poll tax.

Won'tcha come with me to alabammy,

Yes, for paradise the southland is my nominee.
Jes' give me a ham hock and a grit of hominy.

I wanna go back to dixie
I wanna be a dixie pixie
And eat cornpone 'til it's comin' outta my ears
I wanna talk with southern gentlemen
And put my white sheet on again,
I ain't seen one good lynchin' in years.
The land of the boll weevil,
Where the laws are medieval,

When it's fiesta time in guadalajara,
Then I long to be back once again
In old mexico.
Where we lived for today,
Never giving a thought to tomara.
To the strumming of guitars,
In a hundred grubby bars
I would whisper ""te amo.""

The mariachis would serenade,
And they would not shut up till they were paid.
We ate, we drank, and we were merry,
And we got typhoid and dysentery.

But best of all, we went to the plaza de toros.
Now whenever I start feeling morose,
I revive by recalling that scene.
And names like belmonte, dominguin, and manolete,
If I live to a hundred and eighty,
I shall never forget what they mean.

(for there is surely nothing more beautiful in this
World than the sight of a lone man facing singlehandedly
A half a ton of angry pot roast!)

Out came the matador,
Who must have been potted or
Slightly insane, but who looked rather bored.
Then the picadors of course,
Each one on his horse,
I shouted ""ole!"" ev'ry time one was gored.

I cheered at the bandilleros' display,
As they stuck the bull in their own clever way,
For I hadn't had so much fun since the day
My brother's dog rover
Got run over.

(rover was killed by a pontiac. And it was done with
Such grace and artistry that the witnesses awarded the
Driver both ears and the tail - but I digress.)

The moment had come,
I swallowed my gum,
We knew there'd be blood on the sand pretty soon.
The crowd held it's breath,
Hoping that death
Would brighten an otherwise dull afternoon.

At last, the matador did what we wanted him to.
He raised his sword and his aim was true.
In that moment of truth I suddenly knew
That someone had stolen my wallet.

Now it's fiesta time in akron, ohio,
But it's back to old guadalajara I'm longing to go.
Far away from the strikes of the A. F. Of L. And C. I. O.
How I wish I could get back
To the land of the wetback,
And forget the alamo,

And the quaint and curious costumes that we're called upon to wear.

He wants to fight and bleed and kill and die for liberty.

Because he finds it broadening.

Played with soldiers as a boy you just can bet.
It is written in the stars
He will get his captain's bars,
But he hasn't got enough box tops yet.

He's from georgia, and he doesn't speak the language very well.
He used to be, so rumor has, the dean of men at alcatraz.

Be that as it may, some of you may have had occasion to run into mathematicians and to wonder therefore how they got that way, and here, in partial explanation perhaps, is the story of the great
Ian mathematician nicolai ivanovich lobachevsky.

Who made me the genius I am today,
The mathematician that others all quote,
Who's the professor that made me that way?
The greatest that ever got chalk on his coat.

One man deserves the credit,
One man deserves the blame,
And nicolai ivanovich lobachevsky is his name.
Hi!
Nicolai ivanovich lobach-

I am never forget the day I first meet the great lobachevsky.
In one word he told me secret of success in mathematics:
Plagiarize!

Plagiarize,
Let no one else's work evade your eyes,
Remember why the good lord made your eyes,
So don't shade your eyes,
But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize -
Only be sure always to call it please 'research'.

And ever since I meet this man
My life is not the same,
And nicolai ivanovich lobachevsky is his name.
Hi!
Nicolai ivanovich lobach-

I am never forget the day I am given first original paper
To write. It was on analytic and algebraic topology of
Locally euclidean parameterization of infinitely differentiable
Riemannian manifold.
Bozhe moi!
This I know from nothing.
But I think of great lobachevsky and get idea - ahah!

I have a friend in minsk,
Who has a friend in pinsk,
Whose friend in omsk
Has friend in tomsk
With friend in akmolinsk.
His friend in alexandrovsk
Has friend in petropavlovsk,
Whose friend somehow
Is solving now
The problem in dnepropetrovsk.

And when his work is done -
Ha ha! - begins the fun.
From dnepropetrovsk
To petropavlovsk,
By way of iliysk,
And novorossiysk,
To alexandrovsk to akmolinsk
To tomsk to omsk
To pinsk to minsk
To me the news will run,
Yes, to me the news will run!

And then I write
By morning, night,
And afternoon,
And pretty soon
My name in dnepropetrovsk is cursed,
When he finds out I publish first!

And who made me a big success
And brought me wealth and fame?
Nicolai ivanovich lobachevsky is his name.
Hi!
Nicolai ivanovich lobach -

I am never forget the day my first book is published.
Every chapter I stole from somewhere else.
Index I copy from old vladivostok telephone directory.
This book was sensational!
Pravda - well, pravda - pravda said: (russian double-talk)
It stinks.
But izvestia! Izvestia said: (russian double-talk)

Let's make peace the way we did in stanleyville and saigon.

Once all the germans were warlike and mean,
But that couldn't happen again.
We taught them a lesson in nineteen eighteen,

And though it seems a pity, it

He loved to burn down houses just to watch the glow,

Because he was the mayor's son.

Then dropped her in the pond and watched her drown.
Oh, yes indeed, the people there are just plain folks

Tom Lehrer,National Brotherhood Week,/t/tom+lehrer/national+brotherhood+week_20138394.html,"One week of every year is designated national brotherhood week.
This is just one of many such weeks honoring various worthy causes.
One of my favorites is national make-fun-of-the-handicapped week,
Which Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis are in charge of as you know.
During national brotherhood week various special events are arranged to drive home the message of brotherhood.
This year, for example, on the first day of the week Malcolm X was killed which gives you an idea of how effective the whole thing is.
I'm sure we all agree that we ought to love one another and I know there are people in the world that do not love their fellow human beings and I hate people like that.
Here's a song about national brotherhood week.

Oh, the white folks hate the black folks,
And the black folks hate the white folks.
To hate all but the right folks
Is an old established rule.

But during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
Lena Horne and sheriff Clarke are dancing cheek to cheek.
It's fun to eulogize
The people you despise,
As long as you don't let 'em in your school.

Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks,
And the rich folks hate the poor folks.
All of my folks hate all of your folks,
It's American as apple pie.

But during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans 'cause it's very chic.
Step up and shake the hand
Of someone you can't stand.
You can tolerate him if you try.

Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics,
And the Catholics hate the Protestants,
And the Hindus hate the muslems,
And everybody hates the Jews.

But during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
It's national everyone-smile-at-one-another-hood week.
Be nice to people who
Are inferior to you.
It's only for a week, so have no fear.
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year!"
Tom Lehrer,New Math,/t/tom+lehrer/new+math_20138395.html,"Some of you who have small children may have perhaps been put in the
embarrassing position of being unable to do your child's arithmetic homework
because of the current revolution in mathematics teaching known as the New
Math. So as a public service here tonight I thought I would offer a brief
lesson in the New Math. Tonight we're going to cover subtraction. This is the
first room I've worked for a while that didn't have a blackboard so we will
have to make due with more primitive visual aids, as they say in the ""ed biz.""
Consider the following subtraction problem, which I will put up here: 342 -
173.

Now remember how we used to do that. three from two is nine; carry the one, and
if you're under 35 or went to a private school you say seven from three is six,
but if you're over 35 and went to a public school you say eight from four is
six; carry the one so we have 169, but in the new approach, as you know, the
important thing is to understand what you're doing rather than to get the right
answer. Here's how they do it now.

You can't take three from two,
Two is less than three,
So you look at the four in the tens place.
Now that's really four tens,
So you make it three tens,
Regroup, and you change a ten to ten ones,
And you add them to the two and get twelve,
And you take away three, that's nine.
Is that clear?

Now instead of four in the tens place
You've got three,
'Cause you added one,
That is to say, ten, to the two,
But you can't take seven from three,
So you look in the hundreds place.

From the three you then use one
To make ten ones...
(And you know why four plus minus one
Plus ten is fourteen minus one?
'Cause addition is commutative, right.)
And so you have thirteen tens,
And you take away seven,
And that leaves five...

Well, six actually.
But the idea is the important thing.

Now go back to the hundreds place,
And you're left with two.
And you take away one from two,
And that leaves...?

Everybody get one?
Not bad for the first day!

Hooray for new math,
New-hoo-hoo-math,
It won't do you a bit of good to review math.
It's so simple,
So very simple,
That only a child can do it!
Now that actually is not the answer that I had in mind, because the book that I
got this problem out of wants you to do it in base eight. But don't panic. Base
eight is just like base ten really - if you're missing two fingers. Shall we
have a go at it? Hang on.

You can't take three from two,
Two is less than three,
So you look at the four in the eights place.
Now that's really four eights,
So you make it three eights,
Regroup, and you change an eight to eight ones,
And you add them to the two,
and you get one-two base eight,
Which is ten base ten,
And you take away three, that's seven. Ok?

Now instead of four in the eights place
You've got three,
'Cause you added one,
That is to say, eight, to the two,
But you can't take seven from three,
So you look at the sixty-fours.

""Sixty-four? How did sixty-four get into it?"" I hear you cry.
Well, sixty-four is eight squared, don't you see?
(Well, you ask a silly question, and you get a silly answer.)

From the three you then use one
To make eight ones,
And you add those ones to the three,
And you get one-three base eight,
Or, in other words,
In base ten you have eleven,
And you take away seven,
And seven from eleven is four.
Now go back to the sixty-fours,
And you're left with two,
And you take away one from two,
And that leaves...?

Now, let's not always see the same hands.
One, that's right!
Whoever got one can stay after the show and clean the erasers.

Hooray for new math,
New-hoo-hoo-math,
It won't do you a bit of good to review math.
It's so simple,
So very simple,
That only a child can do it!

Y this and here then is the prospective title song from oedipus rex.

From the Bible to the popular song,
There's one theme that we find right along.
Of all ideals they hail as good,
The most sublime is motherhood.

There was a man, oh, who it seems,
Once carried this ideal to extremes.
He loved his mother and she loved him,
And yet his story is rather grim.

There once lived a man named oedipus rex.
You may have heard about his odd complex.
His name appears in freud's index
'cause he loved his mother.

His rivals used to say quite a bit,
That as a monarch he was most unfit.
But still in all they had to admit
That he loved his mother.

Yes he loved his mother like no other.
His daughter was his sister and his son was his brother.
One thing on which you can depend is,
He sure knew who a boy's best friend is!

When he found what he had done,
He tore his eyes out one by one.
A tragic end to a loyal son
Who loved his mother.

So be sweet and kind to mother,
Now and then have a chat.
Buy her candy or some flowers or a brand new hat.
But maybe you had better let it go at that!

Or you may find yourself with a quite complex complex,
And you may end up like oedipus.
I'd rather marry a duck-billed platypus,
Than end up like old oedipus rex.
The out-patients are out in force tonight, I see."

Out one of the many delightful pastimes the coming of spring affords us all.

Spring is here, a-suh-puh-ring is here.
Life is skittles and life is beer.
I think the loveliest time of the year is the spring.
I do, don't you? 'course you do.
But there's one thing that makes spring complete for me,
And makes ev'ry sunday a treat for me.

All the world seems in tune
On a spring afternoon,
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park.
Ev'ry sunday you'll see
My sweetheart and me,
As we poison the pigeons in the park.

When they see us coming, the birdies all try an' hide,
But they still go for peanuts when coated with cyanide.
The sun's shining bright,
Ev'rything seems all right,
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park.

Lalaalaalalaladoodiedieedoodoodoo

We've gained notoriety,
And caused much anxiety
In the audubon society
With our games.
They call it impiety,
And lack of propriety,
And quite a variety
Of unpleasant names.
But it's not against any religion
To want to dispose of a pigeon.

So if sunday you're free,
Why don't you come with me,
And we'll poison the pigeons in the park.
And maybe we'll do
In a squirrel or two,
While we're poisoning pigeons in the park.

We'll murder them all amid laughter and merriment.
Except for the few we take home to experiment.
My pulse will be quickenin'
With each drop of strychnine
We feed to a pigeon.
It just takes a smidgin!
To poison a pigeon in the park."

If you visit american city,
You will find it very pretty.
Just two things of which you must beware:
Don't drink the water and don't breathe the air.

Pollution, pollution,
They got smog and sewage and mud.
Turn on your tap and get hot and cold running crud.

See the halibuts and the sturgeons
Being wiped out by detergents.
Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly,
But they don't last long if they try.

Pollution, pollution,
You can use the latest toothpaste,
And then rinse your mouth with industrial waste.

Just go out for a breath of air,
And you'll be ready for medicare.
The city streets are really quite a thrill.
If the hoods don't get you, the monoxide will.

Pollution, pollution,
Wear a gas mask and a veil.
Then you can breathe, long as you don't inhale.

Lots of things there that you can drink,
But stay away from the kitchen sink.
The breakfast garbage that you throw in to the bay,
They drink at lunch in san jose.

So go to the city, see the crazy people there.
Like lambs to the slaughter,
They're drinking the water
And breathing  the air."

Of which we don't approve,
Who is it that always intervenes?

They have their place, I guess,
But first send the marines!

We'll send them all we've got,

But not to mississippoli,

What do we do? We send the marines!
For might makes right,
And till they've seen the light,
They've got to be protected,
All their rights respected,
'till somebody we like can be elected.

Members of the corps
All hate the thought of war,
They'd rather kill them off by peaceful means.
Stop calling it aggression,
O we hate that expression.
We only want the world to know
That we support the status quo.
They love us everywhere we go,
So when in doubt,
Send the marines!"

Everything is lewd.

Tom Lehrer,The Elements,/t/tom+lehrer/the+elements_20138388.html,"Now, if I may digress momentarily from the main stream of this evenings symposium, I'd like to sing a song which is completely pointless but which is something I picked up during my career as a
Tist. This may prove useful to somebody some day perhaps, in a somewhat bizarre set of circumstances. It's simply the names of the chemical elements set to a possibly recognizable tune.

There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium,
And hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium,
And nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium,
And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium,
Europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium,
And lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium,
And gold and protactinium and indium and gallium,

And iodine and thorium and thulium and thallium.

There's yttrium, ytterbium, actinium, rubidium,
And boron, gadolinium, niobium, iridium,
And strontium and silicon and silver and samarium,
And bismuth, bromine, lithium, beryllium, and barium.

Isn't that interesting?

I knew you would.
I hope you're all taking notes, because there's going to be a short quiz next period.

There's holmium and helium and hafnium and erbium,
And phosphorus and francium and fluorine and terbium,
And manganese and mercury, molybdenum, magnesium,
Dysprosium and scandium and cerium and cesium.
And lead, praseodymium, and platinum, plutonium,
Palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium,
And tantalum, technetium, titanium, tellurium,

And cadmium and calcium and chromium and curium.

There's sulfur, californium, and fermium, berkelium,
And also mendelevium, einsteinium, nobelium,
And argon, krypton, neon, radon, xenon, zinc, and rhodium,
And chlorine, carbon, cobalt, copper, tungsten, tin, and sodium.

If you feel dissatisfaction,
Strum your frustrations away.
Some people may prefer action,
But give me a folk song any old day.

The tune don't have to be clever,
And it don't matter if you put a coupla extra syllables into a line.
It sounds more ethnic if it ain't good english,
And it don't even gotta rhyme--excuse me--rhyne.

That's the kind where each of us belongs.

Tom Lehrer,The Hunting Song,/t/tom+lehrer/the+hunting+song_20138411.html,"Almost every day during the hunting season you see at least one item in the newspapers about somebody who has shot somebody else, under the impression that he was a deer with a red hat perhaps,
A large flesh-colored squirrel. At any rate, it seems to me that this marks an encouraging new trend in the field of blood sports, and deserves a new type of hunting song which I present herewi

I always will remember,
'twas a year ago november,
I went out to hunt some deer
On a mornin' bright and clear.
I went and shot the maximum the game laws would allow,
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow.

I was in no mood to trifle,
I took down my trusty rifle
And went out to stalk my prey.
What a haul I made that day.
I tied them to my fender, and I drove them home somehow,
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow.

The law was very firm, it
Took away my permit,
The worst punishment I ever endured.
It turned out there was a reason,
Cows were out of season,
And one of the hunters wasn't insured.

People ask me how I do it,
And I say, ""there's nothin' to it,
You just stand there lookin' cute,
And when something moves, you shoot! ""
And there's ten stuffed heads in my trophy room right now,
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a pure-bred guernsey cow."

Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
About a maid I'll sing a song
Who didn't have her family long.
Not only did she do them wrong,
She did ev'ryone of them in, them in,
She did ev'ryone of them in.

One morning in a fit of pique,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
One morning in a fit of pique,
She drowned her father in the creek.
The water tasted bad for a week,
And we had to make do with gin, with gin,
We had to make do with gin.

Her mother she could never stand,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
Her mother she cold never stand,
And so a cyanide soup she planned.
The mother died with a spoon in her hand,
And her face in a hideous grin, a grin,
Her face in a hideous grin.

She set her sister's hair on fire,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
She set her sister's hair on fire,
And as the smoke and flame rose high'are,
Danced around the funeral pyre,
Playin' a violin, -olin,
Playin' a violin.

She weighted her brother down with stones,
Rickety-tickety-tin,
She weighted her brother down with stones,
And sent him off to davy jones.
All they ever found were some bones,
And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,
Occasional pieces of skin.

One day when she had nothing to do,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
One day when she had nothing to do,
She cut her baby brother in two,
And served him up as an irish stew,
And invited the neighbors in, -bors in,
Invited the neighbors in.

And when at last the police came by,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
And when at last the police came by,
Her little pranks she did not deny,
To do so she would have had to lie,
And lying, she knew, was a sin, a sin,
Lying, she knew, was a sin.

My tragic tale, I won't prolong,
Rickety-tickety-tin,
My tragic tale I won't prolong,
And if you do not enjoy the song,
You've yourselves to blame if it's too long,
You should never have let me begin, begin,
You should never have let me begin."

I ache for the touch of your lips, dear,
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear.
You can raise welts
Like nobody else,
As we dance to the masochism tango.

Say our love be a flame, not an ember,
Say it's me that you want to dismember.
Blacken my eye,
Set fire to my tie,
As we dance to the masochism tango.

At your command
Before you here I stand,
My heart is in my hand. Ecch!
It's here that I must be.
My heart entreats,
Just hear those savage beats,
And go put on your cleats
And come and trample me.
Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany,
That's why I'm in such exquisite agony.

My soul is on fire,
It's aflame with desire,
Which is why I perspire
When we tango.

You caught my nose
In your left castanet, love,
I can feel the pain yet, love,
Ev'ry time I hear drums.
And I envy the rose
That you held in your teeth, love,
With the thorns underneath, love,
Sticking into your gums.

Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches.
The last time I needed twenty stitches
To sew up the gash
That you made with your lash,
As we danced to the masochism tango.

Bash in my brain,
And make me scream with pain,
Then kick me once again,
And say we'll never part.
I know too well
I'm underneath your spell,
So, darling, if you smell
Something burning, it's my heart.
Excuse me!

Take your cigarette from it's holder,
And burn your initials in my shoulder.
Fracture my spine,
And swear that you're mine,
As we dance to the masochism tango."

Tom Lehrer,The Professor's Song,/t/tom+lehrer/the+professors+song_20138424.html,"To ""if you give me your attention.""
If you give me your attention, I will tell you what I am.
I'm a brilliant math'matician - also something of a ham.
I have tried for numerous degrees, in fact I've one of each;
Of course that makes me eminently qualified to teach.
I understand the subject matter thoroughly, it's true,
And I can't see why it isn't all as obvious to you.
Each lecture is a masterpiece, meticulously planned,
Yet everybody tells me that I'm hard to understand,
And I can't think why.

My diagrams are models of true art, you must agree,
And my handwriting is famous for it's legibility.
Take a word like ""minimum"" (to choose a random word),
This was performed at a blackboard, and the professor wrote:
////////////////
For anyone to say he cannot read that, is absurd.
The anecdotes I tell get more amusing every year,
Though frankly, what they go to prove is sometimes less than clear,
And all my explanations are quite lucid, I am sure,
Yet everybody tells me that my lectures are obscure,
And I can't think why.

Consider, for example, just the force of gravity:
It's inversely proportional to something - let me see -
It's r^3 - no, r^2 - no, it's just are, I'll bet -
The sign in front is plus - or is it minus, I forget -
Well, anyway, there is a force, of that there is no doubt.
All these formulas are trivial if you only think them out.
Yet students tell me, ""i have memorized the whole year through
Ev'rything you've told us, but the problems I can't do. ""

Are into portions of the mass, to replace latin, and to widen somewhat the range of music permissible in the liturgy, but I feel that if they really want to sell the product, in this secular age,
They ought to do is to redo some of the liturgical music in popular song forms. I have a modest example here. It's called the vatican rag.

First you get down on your knees,
Fiddle with your rosaries,
Bow your head with great respect,
And genuflect, genuflect, genuflect!

Do whatever steps you want, if
You have cleared them with the pontiff.
Everybody say his own
Kyrie eleison,
Doin' the vatican rag.

Get in line in that processional,
Step into that small confessional,
There, the guy who's got religion'll
Tell you if your sin's original.
If it is, try playin' it safer,
Drink the wine and chew the wafer,
Two, four, six, eight,
Time to transubstantiate!

So get down upon your knees,
Fiddle with your rosaries,
Bow your head with great respect,
And genuflect, genuflect, genuflect!

Make a cross on your abdomen,
When in rome do like a roman,
Ave maria,
Gee it's good to see ya,
Gettin' ecstatic an'
Sorta dramatic an'
Doin' the vatican rag!"

Do you remember the night I held you so tight,
As we danced to the wiener schnitzel waltz?
The music was gay, and the setting was viennese,
Your hair wore some roses (or perhaps they were peonies),
I was blind to your obvious faults,
As we danced 'cross the scene
To the strains of the wiener schnitzel waltz.

Oh, I drank some champagne from your shoe.
I was drunk by the time I got through.
I didn't know as I raised that cup,
It had taken two bottles to fill the thing up.

It was I who stepped on your dress.
The skirts all came off, I confess.
Revealing for all of the others to see
Just what it was that endeared you to me.

I remember the night I held you so tight,
As we danced to the wiener schnitzel waltz.
Your lips were like wine (if you'll pardon the simile),
The music was lovely and quite rudolf frimly.
I drank wine, you drank chocolate malts,
And we both turned quite green

There's a delta for every epsilon

There's also an N.

A lonely life all the others live,
In no theorem
A delta for them.

The matter merits our attention.

Once he shone on his own,

Ah, but now when he speaks he must clear it.
Second fiddle's a hard part, I know,

And she grew up fast
In the age of television
And she made a vow to have it all
It became her new religion

And everybody's all around me
Shaking hands and saying howdy

Cracking up like a worn out shoe
I ain't wet but the world leaking through
I'd run but I'd find no place
I'd laugh but it's wrecking me
Make you shiver make you shake
Make a monster just like an earthquake
Everybody's having fun
I don't know how they can carry on

I don't think it's funny no more cracking up
I don't think it's funny no more cracking up

The dead of nighttime the crack of dawn
It comes upon me without warning
If I were a gun then I would shoot
I tear the head out by the root
I'd make a knife out of an ocean
All that sea in an ocean of emotion

You can lose it without knowing.
You wake up,
And you don't notice,
Which way,
The wind is blowing.

Don't fade,
No, don't fade on me.

You were the one who made things different.
You were the one who took me in.
You were the one thing I could count on.
Above all, you were my friend.

Don't fade,
Don't fade on me.

Well your clothes hang on a wire,
And the sun is overhead.
But today,
You are too weary,
To even leave your bed.
Was it love that took you under?
Or did you know too much?
Was it something you could picture,
But never could quite touch?

No, don't fade on me.
So don't fade.
Hey, don't fade on me."

Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have

Be a landlord and a renter

Create myself down south
Impress all the women
Pretend I'm samuel clemens
Wear seersucker and white linens

I promise you this winter
I will worship you like gold
And ride your train forever
Electric fortunes to be told
And I don't want to question or even celebrate
All the joy you took and then gave back too late




It's the same sad echo when you lie
It's the same sad echo when you try to be clear

In a pool of sweat
With a box of pills and you
Yeah, and I'm gonna keep my head
I'm gonna keep my cool
Oh, I'm so in love with you
Yes and in another world nothing was like this
There may have been a girl
There never was a kiss

The poison came in liquid
She was naked all the time
And no one could explain it
It was all between the lines
And I don't seem to trust anyone no more
It could be faith I'm just not sure

It's the same sad echo every day
Yeah the same sad echo another way
When you call
It's the same as the same sad echo most of all

Well you just got tired
You just gave in
You took it hard
Then you just quit
You let me down
You dropped the ball
You fell on your face most of all
And I don't want to mean anything to you
I don't want to tempt you to be true

The language you dream in when you count to ten
You go to the edge and you always give in
On your first flash of freedom

Down every canyon and mountain we fall
They'll laugh at our shadows, tall on the wall
Your brain is so full but you can't keep it all

Across ancient bridges through a town with no name
Across painted hills that no rich man can claim
Runnin' wild mustangs that nothing could change

But this old town just seems so hopeless.
I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times
Were just a little bit more in focus.
But when she puts her arms around me,
I can, somehow, rise above it.
Yeah man, when I got that little girl standing right by my side,
You know, I can tell the whole wide world, ""Shove it,""
Hey, here comes my girl, here comes my girl,
Yeah, she looks so right, she's all I need tonight.
Every now and then, I get down to the end of a day,
I'll have to stop, ask myself, ""What've I done?""
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard,
And nothin' ever really seem to come from it.
And then she looks me in the eye, says, ""We gonna last forever,""
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it.
No, because this feels so good and so free and so right,
I know we ain't never goin' change our minds about it.
Hey, here comes my girl, here comes my girl,
Yeah, she looks so right, she's all I need tonight.
Yeah, everytime it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more,
I find myself havin' to reach out and grab hold of somethin'.
Yeah, I just catch myself wanderin', waitin', worryin'
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'.
And then she looks me in the eye, says, ""We gonna last forever,""

And ride you too far and
Conservatism to boredom what's more
So go out by the river
And watch the stream flow
Recall all the dreams
That you once used to know
The things you've forgotten

To pastures not greener but meaner

Midnight creepin' out to the servant's shack
Kept a secret under the bed
Wrapped in a burlap sack

I knew it was time to go
Yeah, and I still get nervous every time
That bugle blows

When the public gets bored
But we'll fight 'em with lawyers

Thinks our books look shifty

>From across the canyon a guitar plays
Through an amplifier on long delay
It was an old melody, I recognized the song
I had an amplifier too, so I played along
I'm makin' some noise, I'm still a working boy
Up at the top of my voice
Sayin', ""Look at me Mama I'm makin' some noise.""
I7m makin' some noise, I been a long gone boy

You can tell which way he lays
Hes the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

His gowns come from paris
Occasionally from rome
He can go anywhere
Say back to his home
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
Flashing to the white collars
Ha, he doesn't care at all

Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around.
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights.

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen.
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen.
I was introduced and we both started groovin'.
I said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on.
Keep movin' on. ""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

Well, I don't know, but I've been told,
You never slow down, you never grow old.
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down,
Tired of myself, tired of this town.

Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.
Honey, put on that party dress.
Buy me a drink, sing me a song.
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long.

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

There's pigeons down on Market Square.
She's standin' in her underwear,
Lookin' down from a hotel room.
Nightfall will be comin' soon.

Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.
You got to put on that party dress.
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone.
I hit my last number and walked to the road.

Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers,Money Becomes King,/t/tom+petty+the+heartbreakers/money+becomes+king_20548234.html,"Money Becomes King
If you reach back in your memory
A little bell might ring
About a time that once existed
When money wasn't king
If you stretch your imagination
I'll tell you all a tale
About a time when everything
Wasn't up for sale

There was this cat named johnny
Who loved to play and sing
When money wasn't king

We'd all get so excited when
John would give a show
We'd raise the cash between us
And down the road we'd go
To hear him play that music
It spoke right to my soul
Every verse a diamond
And every chorus gold
The sound was my salvation
It was only everything
Before money became king

Well I ain't sure how it happened
And i don't know exactly when
But everything got bigger
And the rules began to bend
And they taught the people
How to get their hair to shine
And how sweet life can be
If you keep a tight behind
And they raised the cost of living
And could we have known
They'd doubled the price of tickets
To go see johnny's show

So we hocked all our possessions
And we sold a little dope
And went off to rock and roll

We arrived there early
In time to see rehearsal
And john came out and lip-synched
His new lite beer commercial
And as the crowd arrived
As far as i could see
The faces were all different
There was no one there like me

They sat in golden circles
And waiters served them wine
And they talked through al the music
And to john paid little mind
And way up in the nosebleeds
We watched him on the screen
They'd hung between the billboards
So cheaper seats could see

Johnny rocked that golden circle
And all those VIP's
And that music that had freed us
Became a tired routine
And i saw his face in close-up
Trying to give it all he had
And sometimes his eyes betrayed him
You could see that he was sad
And i tried to rock on with him
But i slowly became bored
Could that man on stage
With everything
Somehow needed more?

There was no use in pretending
No magic left to hear
All the music gave me
Was a craving for lite beer
As i walked out of the arena
My ears began to ring
And money became king

Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps

""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate"", I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed

Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history

Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school

""Equality"", I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach

My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect

Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

You remain a mystery, no information found I speed dial the judgment call
The near miss hits the ground
The new king hides behind the throne refusing to be crowned.

Got my back to the wall

Restless through and through
I'm restless restless

I'm a hair trigger lover
And I can't face up to nothing
I'm impatient with the wind
But I'm waitin' here for somethin'

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless restless
You look restless too

Restless sleep, twisted dreams
Moving targets, silent screams
Restless city, restless steets
Restless you, restless me

I'm a face out the window
I'm a black satin sheet
And I can't stay warm
I stay out in the street

And pretty baby I'm restless, restless
Restless through and through
I'm restless restless
You look restless too"

To walk

If you don't want to crawl
On your hands
Through this world

Oh my love if I reveal
Every secret I've concealed
How many thoughts would you steal
How much of my pain would you feel

You need eagles wings
To get over things
That make no sense
In this world

You need rhino skin
If you're gonna pretend
You're not hurt by this world

If you listen long enough
You can hear my skin grow tough
Love is painful to the touch
Must be made of stronger stuff

You need rhino skin
To get to the end
Of the maze through this world

You need rhino skin
Or you're gonna give in
To the needles and pins
The arrows of sin
The evils of men
You need rhino skin"

So lets get to the point,
Lets roll, another joint,
And turn the radio loud,
I'm to alone to be proud,
You don't know how it feels,
No you don't know how it feels,
To be me--

People come, people go,
Some grow young,
Some grow cold,
I woke up, in between,
Memory, and a dream.

My old man, was born to rock,
And he's still trying to beat the clock,
Think of me what you will,
I've got a little, space to fill,

You don't know how it feels,
No you don't know how it feels,
To be me--.

Like a fire fly without a light,
You were there like a blow torch burnin',
I was a key that could use a little turnin'

So tired that I couldn't even sleep,
So many secrets I couldn't keep,
Promised myself I wouldn't weep,
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now,
I'm in too deep there's no way out,
This time I have really let myself pull stray

Runaway train never goin' back,
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere,
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile,
Make it somehow seem all worth while,
How on earth did I get so jaded,
Last mystery seemed so naked

I can go where no one else can go,
I know what no one else has known,
Here I am just a drowning in the brain,
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything seems judded inside,
Day and night earth and sky,
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never goin' back,
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere,
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Want a ticket for a runaway train?,
Like a madman laughin' at the rain,
A little out of touch little in the brain,
Its just easier to deal with the pain

Runaway train never goin' back,
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere,
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never comin' back,
Runaway train tearin' up the track,
Runaway train burnin' in my veins,
Run away but it always seems the same"

You can never explain
Like when an angel cries
Like runaway trains

Like one of those times
That's never the same
Like when something dies
Like runaway trains

I'm used to being alone
And holding my own hand
I'm stronger than you know""

It was always cold, no sunshine

Surroundin' me alone

With its walls of stone

Fading by degrees

Country homes and ranches
Watching life between the branches below

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you baby?

You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace

I'm moving on alone over ground that no one owns
Past statues that atone for my sins
There's a guard on every door
And a drink on every floor
Overflowing with a thousand amens

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you baby?

You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace
Don't you baby?

You're rolling up the carpet
Of your father's two-room mansion
No headroom for expansion no more
And there's a corner of the floor
They're telling you is yours
You're confident but not really sure

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days

Sometimes she seems depressed

She don't remember it

But she's got me thinking 'bout it

Well then it's time to go down town
To the agent man, won't let you down
And so you sell to some company
Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware

And in a week or two if you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart

Listenin' to the stories we could tell

Remember that guitar in a museum in Tennessee
And the nameplate on the glass brought back twenty melodies
And the scratches on the face
Told of all the times he fell
Singin' every story he could tell
And oh the stories it could tell
And I bet you it still rings like a bell
And I wish we could sit back on the bed in some motel
And listen to the stories we could tell

So if you're on the road tracking down here every night
And you're singin' for a livin' 'neath the brightly colored lights
And if you ever wonder why you ride this carousel
You did it for the stories you could tell

Straight into night

I remember flying out to London
I remember the feeling at the time
Out the window of the 747
Man there was nothin', only black sky

Oh give it up to me, I need it
Girl I know when I see it

Real love is a man's salvation
The weak ones fall
The strong carry on

Something seemed kinda queer
The roar turned into whispers
Everyone stood there

When the sounds fit the night
Like it hiding from the light
Like strangers in the night

Well, I didn't see those shotguns
And I didn't see no knife
But I saw this crazy black guy
With a demon in his eyes

And I heard him say, ""White man""
I've seen that silver cue
You don't remember me well
But I remember you

When the sounds fit the night
Like it hiding from the light
Like strangers in the night

Well, the knife just left his fingers
As the black guy took his aim

And with her bride gone she'll tag along with any old crowd

Said we'd book you, but we don't have a case

Kung bakit hanap-hanap ka pa
Ang yong mukha'y laging
Lagi na lamang sa isipan ko

Bakit di magawa nitong damdamin
Ang paglimot sa mga nagdaan
Sadya nga bang ganyan
Pag nagmahal ay di matatakasan

Chorus:

Nais ko'y makapiling kang muli
Nais kong mayakap kahit na sandali
Kung pangarap ma'y tatanggapin ko
Ikaw pa ring ang iniibig ko"

Ang panahon
Na para sa iyo
Huwag maiinip
Dahil ganyan
Ang buhay sa mundo

Huwag mawawalan ng pag-asa
Darating din ang ligaya
Ang isipin mo'y may bukas pa
Na mayroong saya

Kabigua'y hindi hadlang upang tumakas ka
Huwag kang iiwas 'pag nabibigo
Dapat na lumaban ka

Ang kailangan mo'y tibay ng loob
Kung mayrong pagsubok man
Ang liwanag ay 'di magtatagal
At muling mamasdan
Ikot ng mundo ay hindi laging pighati't kasawian
Ang pangarap mo ay makakamtan
Basta't maghintay ka lamang

Kung hindi ngayon

Run up on my old schools, see what the semi do/
A hop out, corner store grab me a O.E./
White-tee dicky sagging G-Unit sneak's/
Twelve-inch cross-fires, you can still hear my speakers/

(Johnny Juliano)
(Cardo got wings)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified, you better off committin' suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, leave you 9 like Fif'
How a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can’t live?""
Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hope I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas, we the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Hook: Drake and Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, 100
L.A. niggas, we the craziest, yeah, 100
L.A., all I ever asked is 100
L.A., L.A. niggas, we the craziest, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself...

[Verse 3: Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when ""Bleu Davinci"" got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas, we the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dog, cause I'm a always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

My record sell slow imma show you my dick (reapets 7x)

[The Game]
Hit a breakdown
No 400 bars yet, I don't need that
I'm gas, your whole click is ass, I mean that.
G-Unot cocksucker, better believe that
I say it one time, watch the whole world scream back
G-U-N-O-T, now that's for Billboard, rest in peace
And since my nigga died, I been stress no sleep
Contemplating suicide in my Lexus jeep
I tried twice but I couldn't make my death complete
I guess you could say Mya got the best of me
Came back from the dead to address the beef
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak
That's when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat
You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem
Cause running with a snitch is not quite my thing
I tried to take Buck with me, but he stayed on the scene
Guess all I can do now is pray for Supreme
While I finish my next album, 5 million and countin
Anticipating, tellin the world I did it without him
If Aftermath was a family that didn't have a mother
I'd be Dre's newborn, you'd be the jealous older brother
Yea, daddy love us but in the meanwhile
You talkin behind his back and in his face you smile
You moved out the house, You a failure now
And lil' Game grew up to be a problem child
I whip yo head boy, that's for Kanye West
I whip yo head boy, with the back of my tech
Yeap, your fuckin group fell flat without me
You mad, what you gonna do rap about me?
Your bars is park garbage, hooks is mediocre
And your new shoes look like Reebok pennyloafers
Try to walk in my shoes a block
Hurricanes in stores the day after Christmas, nigga fuck Reeboks
You a steroid addict, you need Detox
Hopefully you make it out in time to be on Detox
Cause BlackWallstreet expandin, yea I bought 3 blocks
My CL so smooth, it should of came with Pete Rock
And lets not forget who made me hot
It was Dr. Dre that took me out the weed spot.
You want credit, forget it, I did it on my own
Gave you 300 bars, then said I'm gone
But I'm back, this is rap and a fact is a fact
They say once you turn snitch, you never go back
Heres a picture of Ja Rule, motherfucker hold that
What goes around comes around, get used to the gold plaques
Homie got cheese, but he don't feed no rats
I show the world my dick if Lloyd Banks go plat
I'm lyrically insane, Lloyd Banks know that
He told me I was like a Big Daddy Kane throwback
Started with 1 brick, built my own company
And don't spread news about it unless it come from me
Guess whos the boss, nigga my squad deep

But Glasses Malone is not signed to BlackWallstreet
Nigga don't, don't, don't, don't, don't believe the hype
Hear that Mike?
And don't be alarmed, this is not a diss
But missusing my logo kinda got me pissed
And I got enough beef, now Lil' Eazy dissin
He don't write his own raps, so I gotta forgive him
I got love for ya pops and I always will
So on behalf of Eric Wright, my nigga you gotta chill
I'm the reason you new westcoast nigga's got a deal
While I was doin mixtapes, they was watching College Hill
For real, you mothafucka's ain't got half my skill
I run this shit like OJ and pass for the bills
Trying so hard to be a gangsta, nigga you seethrough
Posing like 50 on the cover of the GQ
Button up shirt with the cut off sleeves
I got twin desert eagles, nigga suck on these
I got that CEO flow, yea my bars are sweet
Like Hova in Takeover, chewin out Mobb Deep
Like Pac on Hit Em Up, chewin out Mobb Deep
Don't one of you niggas got sickas, fuck your talk is cheap
When I see you, and I'm gonna see you
Imma strip you down asshole naked and that's how Imma leave you
Then Imma find Havoc, make him walk through Queens nude
With Black Wallstreet tattooed on his back
Nigga's signed to G-unit, now they bustin guns
But last week it was: ""My nigga Game, what up dun?""
See that's what the fuck I mean, you can't trust these rap niggas
And you wonder why I always say fuck these rap niggas
So Imma break it down for MC's and friends
If you don't hear your name, let the beef begin
Ain't got shit against Hov, I like the nigga style
Nas is my nigga, I been bangin him for a while
I fuck with Fat Joe, he got the streets locked
And that's the same reason I fuck with Kiss and D-Block
Place Eminem in the number 3 spot
And Snoop is like my big brother, we both raised by the Doc.
Young Jeezy you hot, we both new to this
While I'm in the ATL, shout out to Ludacris
Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays
Just like Paul Wall got me ""sittin sideways""
And I can't forget about the homie Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones, Skeet screw the fuckin song
I fuck with Slim Thug and my nigga Bun B
Can't do that without saying free pimp c
And that's the reason why 50 try to pimp me
So I went window shoppin and bought 2 Bentlys
I'm in the drivers seat, motherfucker don't tempt me
Turnin Spider Loc against me, cause your scared to come get me
'cause know what's up, Bloods still got love for em'
Come to the block, I'll shake off the rub for em'
Ask for G-unit, motherfucker it's a rap
Ma$e made it out alive, thank God for that
If Dipset don't get you, Jesse Jackson will
And if all else fails, I'll see you in hell
Wear that G-unit spinner when you come to L.A.
I have a nigga parkin cars, dressed up like valet
He gonna turn back pastor when the gun in his face
The real chain still in Chicago when I'm takin the fake
You can call who you want, I ain't givin back shit
Unless Olivia show the whole world she got a dick
Can't seem to save her life, but she talk a lot of shit
And I want my 10 G's cause Yayo caught a brick
I guess my G-Unot tattoo was a smart move
Cause in the end you lost a 100 Mil. to a cartoon
3 years after you got tatted by cartoon
The beef is over, G-Unit is gonna fall apart soon


Hahahahaha
Faggot ass niggas
I guess I win nigga
Life is a game of chess nigga...
Some King, Some Queens
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Pastor fuckin Ma$e
You niggas is pawns
50, or Boo Boo, or Curtis, or Chicken Little, Hahaha
Stop Snitchin, Stop Lying!, In Stores December 6th
The DVD, it's a tell all motherfuckers
Yea, my documentaries be better than your movies nigga, Hahaha
I drove by your house nigga
Go buy the DVD, $16,99 nigga
At your local record store, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, Warehouse
Shout out to the moms and pops, for helping me slay dem faggots.
G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-UNOT! Hahahaha

What the fuck is all this noise?
He from Cali, he can't rap
He ain't better than this nigga
That's my favorite artist
Fuck y'all, hear the breakdown..

[Freestyle]

No detox, I'm comfortable dog
Like the solo Reeboks right up under me dog
And it feel like I done it before
Sit in the throne pollutin the airwaves like a Hummer exhaust
Don't let Makaveli fool you homie, thugging it costs
Pour out a little liquor for the loved ones that we lost
You ain't gotta wait for the album I don't fuck with The Source
But I turn up my Eazy-E and let it bump in the Porsche
I mean turn up my B. I. G. And let it bump in the Porsche
Tell 'em to roll red carpet when he come in New York
Hip-hop police on me think they runnin New York
Till I lace my Air1 show 'em how to run in New York
They tryin to take me downtown put me under the court
Cause Joe Buddens told 'em I carry a gun in New York
And homey that's strictly fact, he got ripped on wax
So he snitched just to get me back
No matter what you say dog, your shit be whack
You better watch what you say, it might get you clapped
Here's a little advice, homie: switch your raps
Cause that shit on your last album ain't get you plat
What nigga you need a gun? I'll get you that
P-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back
It ain't an industry, niggas I admit to that
But I don't even want your chain, I'll let the Crips do that
12 bars for that bitch, he won't live through that
Even a nigga with a ten year bid knew that
Put a gun in his mouth yeah, yeah do that
He a pussy (sniff, sniff) his own kid knew that
I'm Ready To Die, B. I. G. Knew that
He ain't eatin, look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that
You cocksucker, let your ears do that
Or ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap
2 Lincoln Continentals sittin back to back
Leavin' Jersey City naw nigga, Hackensack
Where's that? Somewhere where the crackers at
Real far from where the roaches and rats is at
Come to Compton I'll show you where the racquet's at
Down the street from the Staples Center where they Hack-a-Shaq
Give the advance money back, I ain't have to rap
Break Harry-O out tell him crack is back
That's nine five a bird take half of that
Import it, export it in cracker jacks
When you get to the projects, ask for Black
You know what you started with? Give him half of that
He gon give you 50 G's in a plastic sack
And I'mma give you 3, 500 cash for that
Gotta keep your mouth closed or I'mma blast the mac
They won't believe you the whole world know that bastard rap
Once you're out of the throne, you can't have it back
Retirement home and ain't nothing after that
Except you layin' in a casket, black suit on
You can't go to heaven with Timberland boots on
No subliminals, I ain't talkin to you Shawn
I'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on
Who the fuck put you on
Faggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons
I fuck with Fab, get my dj Clue on
Sit inside Hot 97 with no tools on
And it don't matter if it's Sway or Kay Slay
Angie Martinez I'll take 'em back to kday
They act like they forgot about Dre-day
I don't rap for Free that's why they fired aj
It's me leaking through your stereo
Envy me as an mc, prepare for your burial
I kill niggas without lettin' the Desert blow
Razor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son
All black like the Range Rover wheels
Niggas whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill
Let me show you the scars, take you back to the car
Rewind time, March 3, 1994
I was only in my teens, deuce-deuce in my Levi's
When Nas hit the scene I was still rockin' knee-highs
Runnin' with my brother Fase, he was 17
Two guns in the upper waist, so we hit the block
Saw niggas from a rival gang bumpin Dre
Ran up on the '64 and that's all she wrote
We runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin' Radames
First murder and I did that without a mask
Fast-forward, see Game gettin out a Jag
Two piece suit on, he still got his rag
Gangbangin' forever, he still got his swag
Let me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass
Everybody in New York know that you a fag
Come out the closet, show the world how to use a pad
Speakin' death on my red bandana
Naw, he couldn't have said that, so I raised my antennas
Look at my Nextel, got a call from Santana
That nigga a pussy, we just saw him in Atlanta
So I hopped on the first thing smokin' to Atlanta
Pulled up at 112 ran up on that black Phantom
Security hopped out, no Joe in here
Just Outkast gettin' ready for a show in here
So I uncocked the. 44
Hopped in the cherry low-low
Chrome grill with the G-Unit logo
We watched Hov go, now the world waitin for my solo
I'm the man, Stat Quo know
I ain't gotta explain, even Bo know
Half of these rap niggas is faker than rolls gold
Get hit in the face with the back of the. 44
And pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose
My bitch harder than you, yeah Vida loco
I ain't sold one record got rap in a chokehold
I'm Dre certified like the leader of the band
Run up, you sure to die, I'll leave you where you stand
Smurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man
But he peed in his pants when he saw us at Summer Jam
Lucky I wasn't there, I had to bury my man
Or I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam
""What you mean terrorize New York?""
I mean expose these pussy ass niggas like I'm Too $hort
Somebody tell Domination I'll leave him in parts
Leg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park
He can't walk through New York no more like John Stark
Got a call cause I'm a break his ankles like Hot-Sauce
Ask niggas from your hood I'm thorough in 5 boroughs
Sit on any stoop, Pelli Tims in the thermal
Wait till Alpo come home
Like Azie from Harlem, Dre gon' pay me regardless
Cause he know Jay-Z departed
And these other rap labels know don't feed they artists
Talkin blueprint shit you got three garages
Gettin money off Roc like little E and Carter
Showin off your little chain like these is flawless
Send him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin'
I got R and B bitches givin' me ménages
Deep massages, I could hear Eazy talkin
Tellin me to have a seat in Tomica's office
Buy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in
Promote without that magazine in Boston
Take a couple mil, make Beans a offer
Give him money we don't see that often
But it was all a dream, like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy
I ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy
I said my man told me he don't see Bleek in Marcy
I'm from Compton where niggas used to bleed for Barkley's
Drive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em
Just a little information for your summer vacation
Bring your chain cause every nigga in L. A. Waitin'
Mad cause Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers
And they'll kill you cause they can't find Gary Payton
Meanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin' it
Shyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us
Playboy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in
Niggas got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin' shit
Quiet as a church on Tuesdays
Niggas say they hate my music, but my alert's on they 2-ways
Nigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis
Touch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic
With or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it
I'm blind to the masses like Stevie Wonder without glasses
I'm a savage spit murder like A. 38 Magnum
16 bars'll baggum let the hook toe tag 'em
Murder any mc throw 'em in that white wagon
Let him die and come back look at 'em, he white flaggin'
Spreadin' rumors like, ""When I see Game I might jack him""
I'm tellin' the world: he reach for my chain, I might clap him
Cause niggas shot me in 2001
Took one in the heart cause I was too proud to run
The clip was empty when the police found my gun
So I don't bring that gangbangin' shit around my son
Nigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel
And I found out Buck got shot up in Cashville
And Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit
And Yayo just came home (G-G-G-Unit)
Backstage at a D-12 concert
A fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's Converse
Niggas show me love when they see me in the streets
But they frown when I don't want to hear none of they beats
Nigga, this shit crazy
Em said some shit when was 16, now they tryin to ruin Slim Shady
I forgive him, I got problems of my own
How you think the streets gon' act now that Suge got home
These niggas is birds, I can see the feathers on 'em
If Doc give me the word, I put this Berretta on 'em
When the beef is on, my piece is on
White sheets is on 'em, Doc breathin on 'em
And I got an extra clip in my Reeboks
Cause I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops
Game got the streets locked
Call 911, get the whole fuckin lapd shot
Niggas snitchin' to the street cops
Get your nephews and your niece shot
When my heat cocked, then the beat stop
Nigga with a attitude like I heard Dr. Dre doin' ""Detox""
Niggas fightin' for the throne that ain't shit
Tryin to measure the fallin' legends but the shoe won't fit
Niggas might think I'm ridin' dick
Cause I'm at the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's
Tryin to talk to Jesus Christ into lettin' me dig 'em up
So they could stand side by side again and live it up
This might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up
With ""Suicidal Thoughts"" bangin' me and my bitch in the truck
My conscience tellin' me if I put the clip in the buck
It might be loud enough to wake B. I. G and them up
What if that was P. Diddy sittin' in the truck
And 2Pac was in jail the day he recorded ""Hit 'em Up""?
I wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin' Jigga What
Wouldn't be signed to Dr. Dre, I wonder is it luck
They got me on mtv with Banks, Fifth, and Buck
I ain't tryin' to be L. A. 's king, he carry a pimp cup

[Outro]
Snoop Dogg got the crown, nigga
What the fuck y'all mad at me for?
I ain't sold one fuckin' record
I'm just tryin' to use these 200 bars to feed my family, nigga
I ain't no threat
I can't rap, I'm from Compton remember?
You gotta be out your motherfuckin' mind
Ask Kay Slay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex
I'll murder anyone of you motherfuckers
G-G-G-G-Unit"
The Game,240 Bars,/t/the+game/240+bars_20582334.html,"Hear the break down
Spider loc is a joke

Ya life is a movie
You aint a factor you a actor fifty gave you a script
Went from runnin with the bloods to a g-unit crip

You a myspace gangsta nigga suck my dick
Your flow is budweiser, mines is crystale
Put the faggot on ice he gon be there for a while
Now watch me put my chest out like 10 og's

Im gutter mutha fucka,
Tell you fuck you to Fifty face, and wont st-st-stutter muthafucka

I tell you a story about a spider caught in his web
Marvel williams, a well known crip
Not cause he put in work, cause his brother a snitch
He belong in g-unit, ima tell you the truth
Fifty, this nigga brother tell more than you
So ima break it down like an ounce of glue
I met this nigga spider at Alliyah video shoot
True, true, he had on no blue
Dmx start laughin he said 'this nigga think he better than you'
So i kicked a freestyle, and in the meanwhile
This nigga soakin up game tryna copy my style
Gave him a hundred bars, all he did was smile
And DMX named me the fuckin problem child
Now back to the future, you got a problem now
Snoopin around my hood, get fucked doggy style
I pull ya faggot ass out them g-unit sneakers
And let ya soul burn in hell on the anniversery to 'ether'
You g-unit crip, used to be a piru
Your name marvel, all you need now is a spiderman suit
Black wallstreet bitch you can't fuck wit my crew
My flow blind baby, ima make you do what it do
Lets take a ride Nigga ima make room in the coupe
Put the shovel in the truck, throw you in there too
Bitch in the passenger side, say she hear somebody screamin
Turn the music up.. baby that's comin from the speakers
She said i aint trippin i hear somebody screamin
I had to throw her off so i start singin

I know you don't love me
You aint the same when 50 Cent's in town
I know you don't love me
You always talkin' bout how Ma$e get down
I know you don't love me
You scream and holla when Spider Loc's around
Got me fucked up wit them g-unit crips
Tryna run game on me you punk bitch

Get yo ass in the trunk
Prodigy know that i aint a punk
Keep these rap niggaz in check like a pair of ducks
Who can flip like i do?
Spit like NaS too?
Rock a yankee fitted, still throw up piru?
Rock a dodger fitted in the middle of the bronx
I shine in any hood like paul wall fronts
Nigga my flow foolish sit back while i do this
Watch me manuever threw cedar block, and end up in hoover
I spit like a ruger
You spit crap like a rookie dice shooter
Snake eyes to the loser
Nigga im grand pooba
Gave em somethin' grand nubian
Created g-unot, fifty tried to sue me and
Say he kick me out the group nigga i left
Spider, you want my spot nigga? clean up my mess
Dirty ass nigga, fifty give him a check
And if you sign, nigga put ya contract on the internet
I been bangin for 10 years, muhtha fucka i been a vet
For 500 dollas he'll claim any set
Give him a 1000 dollars hell tat it on his hand... damn
That's worse than me lyin sayin olivia was a man
Ya XXL cover look like makin of the band
You mad, cause i got my own shoe
And my nigga take shots for the game like NJ do
Some say it's bullshit till i pull quick
Till i empty a full clip
Get on the horn, meet me in the bullpit
Tony yayo you old ass coward
You 36 and u spit your hottest verse on my album
Now.. i aint sayin that you dope nigga..
But you better than spider loc Nigga...
Fifty saw the oppourtunity and thought he could use him
I know he don't be listein to that wack ass music
You got the west on your back? you a lyin bastard
You the reason niggaz push mute when they play madden
What the hell made you think you could fuck wit the game
When yo claim to fame was Yukmouth's chain
Take my advice and lay low
Heard you and your uncle Yayo
Got ran the fuck outta san diego
I'll give you 5 shots when the 38 blow
Leave a whole in your chest.. the size of a bagel
We can do it when you say so
Wait till the lakers on the road, shoot it out at the staples
Open your chest, show the world what you made of
My dick hard i can't wait till the day come
When i can put the infared on him
Let billboard rest, don't speak on my dead homie
All you new west coast niggaz chill
The city is mine, Eazy left it to me in his will"

3 Killas on the rise,
Come through scremin homicide when we ride (when we ride).

Come through screamin homicide when we ride (when we ride).

Eastwood [Verse 1]

Ha ha, Eastwood nigga check it out.

Yo, I caught'em at the corner liquor store,
Ran'em for his jewels
Told'em gimme everything you got,
Hat to the shoes.
You done showed me what it is,
Now show me what it do
I done jacked a gang of bitch ass niggaz like you.
My profile suspect,
I'm wanted for murder
Investigated by the feds on no shit I ain't heard of.
In '94 they say the wood was involved wit' a carjackin,
That's when my phone started trippin, I'm knowin my shits out.
Tryin' to tell me how I'm livin' like they B.E.T,
Sometimes I feel like it's a camera in my T.V screen.
Ha ha,
I am the best ever since my moms left,
I ain't holdin' my breath,
I'm prosectured to death.
It's Eastwood,
I'm as deadly as terpentine,
Spittin venemous rhymes with more heart then valentine when we ride.

The Game [Chorus]

The Game [Verse 2]

Life is what you make it,
Sometimes I see blatant visions of Satan.
I been smokin' hella the marijuana vapors,
Wit' dreams of gettin paper on felonious capers
Rent a car from Avis bangin' the best of Anita Baker,
Now Is That sacred when niggaz spend money on Jacobs,
And it's that same shit that get blood spilled on the pavement
I'm patiently waitin' for God to open heaven gates
& I'll take a knife in my heart before I'll murder my neighbor
& for that i'm hated,
'cause most of they rhymin is basic,
Drop 1 album & left the whole world stuck in amazement,
Started wit' Rakim,
Found him in my moms basement,
One demo tape & i'm on Em & Dr. Dre shit.

The Game [Chorus]

Techniec [Verse 3]

The hood got me feelin' like my back against the wall,
But I been here befo',
Let me fly or give me death,
Im in here for dough.
My pops used to hustle the corner in lotto kicks,
Attempted to try'em on,
Didn't like that fit.
Went after a record deal,
Shit I got that supersize,
Niggaz aint fly then Tec at this shit
Im a natural nigga,
So it's only right we boss up after these figgaz,
So classical nigga.
I'll document the avenue,
Study the set back to the O.G's,
Create a new avenue niggaz, so we can ride.
Rims spinnin off the chrome,
Check the rearview wave spinnin off the dome,
Honey the westcoast is home.

The Game,300 Bars And Runnin,/t/the+game/300+bars+and+runnin_20582331.html,"Intro]
My mama took me to Sam Goody's
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent cd
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a muthafucka
Don't fuck with Game

I like 50 Cent
He reminds me Spongebob
And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche

I went down one of them Bodaga s***s right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck cd
Took that shit home, put it in my boom box
Thought I was bout to be on some radio Raheim shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wallstreet for life now
Ggg-Unot!

[Game]
300 Bars and Runnin
Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes
Walk with me

Here the breakdown, pass the doja, . 45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggaz they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only niggaz that rapped in Philly?
See them niggaz with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
??? Said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a you-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheese stake, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock
And I can't forget, B. I. G. Got murdered by the cops
Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing many things, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block
So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top
You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop
You sell records but a ggg-you not!
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mr. Ccc who hot
Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300 C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you black out before you see the cops
I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block
So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your cd shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggaz when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat
Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap
It's about when the??? Clap, is rufus back
I see what you thinkin, you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go
Drop them off, then the sound like Esko
I'm a say??? If me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a???
Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see
Niggaz running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, nigga I pop mines
How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes
I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog
I don't need 50 Cent, my niggaz make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over, career is over
We in qb, banging cnn in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's the phony nore
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off???, go back to pc
And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on dvd
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me
I'm a G-Unit toy soldier
On Sesame street doing voice overs
Bitch ass nigga need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio, when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines
That's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhymes
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you aint go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap
Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both??? In the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin
And I beef with any nigga, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'
You can put it on skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them s***s sell out like a Air Jordon shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to dj with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'cause Bloods gonna get ya
Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside ny, in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L. A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggaz on them cd's and tapes
Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake
Take the dj off your name, Mr. Instant replay
Not the instant replay
I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit
Niggaz only for your shit just a lil bit
On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebock to make him some boots
Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head
He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear air max for the???
Unless you one of the Bloods, or a latin king
'cause if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting
And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer
They will stab you then??? Then fuck you on Rikers
And Life Goes On
Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one
Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling that's enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hurse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I'm Mr. Ol' King, that New York cab
Who's this fake nigga, on pictures with the Jake nigga?
Got his crew starving 'cause he aint the whole cake, nigga
He ain't Nas, ain't B. I. G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
Nigga I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O
'cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted
Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord givth, if Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
Niggaz hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the da waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the swat car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay
The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay
'cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into granades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like that wit Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they call???
'cause they heard about what went on in D. C.
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock, like???
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is news, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds
They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the pentition
I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
I'm in the hood politican, Impala???
And I keep a black. 45 on the side of my prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like kid before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back
While I do B. I. G. And 'Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you asap
They won't know which hole to patch up, when the??? Clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash nigga?
Say my name now that's your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my ak-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucka I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the no
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed
Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga fuck Reebocks
I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B. I. G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever muthafucka, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever muthafucka, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?)
Let 'em rest in peace
From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplacable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga nor a hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music, go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin, nigga the wait is over
I'm gone"

(A Million) bitches wanna give me head
(A Million) Dollars in my bank account
(A Million) Soundscan the first week out
(A Million) Motherfukka's on my dick
(A Million) Motherfukka's talking shyt

Hit a break down...
I'm the king, and you better respect it
All I need is Beyonce, and a Roc-a-fella necklace
Nigga you can ""check up on it"", I'm a Slim Thug
Cincinnati fitted, wit the red and black brim blood
Gave nigga's 300 bars, two mixtapes, and a dvd
I did it for the C. P. T.
Did it for New York, did it for Chi-town
Ran through hip-hop, and made these nigga's lie down
I'm going away for awhile, call it a California vacation
I call it a Bentley with a smile
God bless the child, wit incredible style
Nigga sicker than West Nile, who king of the West now
I'm putting my vest down, nigga's ain't going to kill shit
Shut the fuck up, nigga you ain't going to kill shit
Rappers don't kill rappers, guns kill rappers
And I be wit real crips, real bloods, real clappers
Fuck rappin, these nigga's will push ya grill backwards
Faster than Iraqis when Bush attacking
My flow semi-automatic, blhow
Touching pussies is my job, you a bitch, this is sexual harrassment
Nigga get a lawyer, when 'The Game' coming for ya
My jab, like Zab on the chin of De La Hoya
I'm the golden boy, and I'm making Hova noise
Got the whole world clapping, just like the Nolia Boys
Since a juvenile, I had to prove my style
Went from Kayslay to dj Clue, and blhow
20 Magazine covers, nigga look at me now
You need a hot 16?.. I need 100 thou
Cause half of these rap nigga's just be running they mouth
The other half, in the atl runnin' the south
10 Mill in the bank, 7 bedroom house
I'm rich, so on my 30th birthday I'm out
Nigga, I'm so ahead of time, and I spit better lines
Better rhymes everytime, nigga's hate on me so much, I feel like I'm Kevin Federline
Fuck it I'm rich, for nothing, tell the media to get off of my dick
You wit me, my next album going to sell like Britney
I beat on these rap nigga's like Bobby do Whitney
No more drama, no more beef wit 50
And if you just tuning in, welcome to the 360 (welcome to the 360, welcome to the 360)
Right back where I started, in Compton, taking out the garbage
Where Crips and Bloods shoot it out like Pearl Harbor
That was '95, when Cube was in his prime
You brought yo Lethal Injection, and I brought mine
Rewind to '89, got my first mixtape
My brother brought it for me, they use to call him Big Face
But now, we ain't brothers, nigga we ain't shit
And you living in my shadow like Marcus Vick
And I heard about yo little rappers talking shit
Stay out my family bidness, or you get a coffin quick
I ain't change, same nigga that got off them bricks
Got signed to Dr. Dre cause his bars is sick
Getting head on the road, cause his cars is sick
And he whop so good, I had to pause this shit
I told 'em bomp, slow down baby
Got to get this shit firm like Foxy, Nas and az
She said 'fuck you, pay me
So I left her in az
That's what I get for letting her listen to my Jay-Z
Fuck a bitch, give me a 40, I'll take that
Dress up for the grammy's, but I still don't drive maybach's
Nigga I'm gangster, and homey don't play dat
Stand way back, or get ya ass clapped asap
Nigga this the payback, you want beef.. Say that
I'll have a hundred hurricane hoodies where you lay at
Get yo whole clique wet, making up crip sets
Nigga got ran outta New York by Dipset
Then he got ran out of Compton by my set
Banned from Watts, can't even walk through his projects
Nigga so lame, talking he gangbang
Won't bust a shot, and the nigga know where I hang
I'm Big Daddy Kane, and the platinum chain
The fact remains, the game don't rap for fame
Game rap for fun, Game blast his gun
The game gotta rap in tongue, so that bastards done
Be easy, I might give you a pass this once
I'm ready to die, but I don't want a bastard son
Nigga, I rap too good, and I'm back in the hood
On the same couch, I put my demo in a package for Sug
After one meeting, I was right back in the hood
Red bandana hanging, selling crack in the hood
Now it's, Aftermath for good...
Any nigga mention Dre, get a Desert Eagle shoved in his fucking face
How that taste?
Blow yo shit out fa'real, nigga I'm for real
Call Nelly or Paul Wall, tell 'em make you a grill
I cook beef, like a steak on a grill
Got the clipse on hold, but I ain't Pharrell
Nigga I'm fa'real.. My flow ill, like smoke in ya lungs
I Spit sharp like a razorblade under my tongue
Nigga, I'm number one, motherfukka bar none
Who else kick knowlegde outside of Hova and the God Son
We can go bar for bar, cocksucker drop some(tm)
Watch me Take Flight like Tom Cruise in The Top Gun
You might win some, but you just lost one
I beat on these lil nigga's like Dr. Dre drums
Look at these motherfukka's trying to prove theyselves
Thinking beefing wit hurricane going to boost they sales
Never that, motherfukka, I'm a clever cat
Kanye West in slacks, nigga, I'm as fresh as that
Ask Dre, ask Snoop, I'm nice
I'm Cube, I'm Jacob, I put rappers on ""Ice""

A skee, let me ask you a question
If you take the 120 bars, put it with the 240 bars
Then add the 360 bars, wit one Kevin Federline, what you get?
(A Million) Haha.. Lets get the fuck outta here man..
Go find something to do"

Impalas parked next to Bentley trucks
Four bins supposed to be here, I should dig 'em up
But since I can't, we gon' hold this Henny up
15 years of greatness
15 years of hatin'
15 years of patience, that's what I had to practice
So I ain't end up back on that county jail mattress
Fuck all this rap shit
In Compton we in the dirt, sticks on us like a cactus
Cincinnati on, closin' on the third strap
Gave two away to some fans, this my third hat
Runnin' this marathon, I'm on my third lap
Where my key to the city, don't y'all think I deserve that?
L. A. Sheriffs left Ryan on the curb, flat
37 shots, so I'm on 133rd strapped

Money fallin' out your pocket while you're sellin' drugs
And we drinkin' Old English, grab a cup, I'll fill it up for you

You surrounded in the club? We pullin' up for you
You went to jail? I took that money, put it up for you
You still got your hand out like I ain't did enough for you
You put on that snitch jacket and it stuck to you
On my life, I love you but I can't fuck with you
I gotta stick to the code
Never slip, never fold, and stay rich 'til I'm old
Love my kids on my soul
Both my baby mamas know if I go, open the safe and give 'em all the gold
And my cousin, Magic Cold, he in the pen on his toes
How you talk them people into transferrin' you to a level 4?
He got 20 months left, that shit movin' hella slow
20 blunts, half a pound a day until they let him go
I give him 30 racks every time he touch the surface
I'm startin' to think this nigga goin' to jail on purpose

Louder than the drums
In the California bandstand
Head nigga in charge hnic
That's me
Born in raise in the Cpt
I get funkier than the funky drummer in the Roots band
Stomp harder than muthafuckin' Jodeci boots and
I get psycho
Shoot like Michael
When I say fuck the pigs I ain't talkin' 'bout white folk
So don't get offended
Or apprehended my ak-47 back with a vengence
So shine them fuckin' lights in the back of my car
I might kill yo ass in 2000 raw

I hate the muthafuckin' pigs cause them pigs hate me
And I should kill 51 cops
For the 51 shots
That they gave that fuckin' kid in New York
I'm mad
That the KKK traded the sheets and the robes for a gun and a muthafuckin badge
And I ain't never shot a cop but if they do me like Huey P Newton
I'm pullin' glocks
I refuse to let a pig run away from a farm
And put them muthafuckin' handcuffs on my arm
I bet the government got Obama in the scope

Cause in 2000 raw we ain't playing that
You scared of us
We scared of ya'll so we staying strapped
Before I let a muthafucka kill me in the streets
It'll be a gold plated badge under them sheets
Cause you muthafuckas corrupted
Can't be trusted
Bullet-proof vest wearing always on that tough shit
Punk ass police pull me outta my seat
What make a muthafucka wanna plant drugs on me
Is it cause I'm black and I rap got tats
On my face and my back and was born in the trap
Screw face when they roll up
It's cool nigga hold up
So my son don't grow up
To be a muthafuckin'

Run up on you and give you a buck fifty like six quarters

Er'y one in the gun til it go click click
Then I'mma switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste
Palm over my forearm so I can shoot straight

My flow dope like I go in the booth and shoot base
Duece duece the skates in the coupe great

My boots laced I got base and them white keys
Bout to cop a convertible crib, like Ice T's

Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising

From the P houses, did it from the weak hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I'm thinking

This the voice of ghetto intelligence, if you got work
Go to work the work at your residence...

Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)

You and Olivia in the showa, my bad that was Terrence Howard
A lil Hustle & Flow and a damn coward

The best actor in the movie was the baby in it
This aint Newy Jack City and it can't be Menace
The worst actor in the world, you made the Guinness
I made G - Unot and that made you finished
I put two quarters in and I played you niggaz
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50

You know I love you like cooked food, I’m a good dude
Let’s hit the Roscoe’s on Pico, I’m in a hood mood
I'm sittin’ here thinkin’ ‘bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin’ tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin’ Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, f-ck with me and you’re famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we’d grew into, whatever we into
That’s too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

[Hook: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

[Verse 2: Lil’ Wayne]
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let’s be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don’t answer my phone, then we probably f-cking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain’t got no room for her name but I’mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said “I’m glad you ate it, "" where my cap & gown?
Told her “I can be your chauffeur,” dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M. O
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

[Hook: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so

I’m where she already knows

All that, all that, all that

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, my girl’s sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t f-ck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
Cause she know me

[Hook: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

I’m feeling your style
I’m loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You’re killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl

First I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinkin what's good
Things that I can change, I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Ms. This is the bliss I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least
I'm resurrectin the peace pipes the Indians used to light
We called it Chief, right
Steppin on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th... Th... Th... That I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam, man
Bike pedaling
To the nature spot, to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop
I like it alot... Yeah... An angel

And you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly
Sometimes I wanted to die
Probably cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop
And I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber
Cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain
Pretending that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it
Shock G and Pac told ya she get around

I got love for the streets
Peace to New York and every hood in the East

She said she will die for you and I told her I'll do the same

I believed I could do anything, 
You made the world dance, 
You made the music come to life

Why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side,

Never gon let you go, it's from my heart

Whos Michael Jackson, 
Your Michael Jackson, 
I'm Michael Jackson, 
We all Michael Jackson, 
I guess what I'm asking is everybody bow their head for a legend don't breathe for a second, 
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about, 
So you can hear my message, my confession, 
Someone tell Usher, I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him, like he touched me, like he touched you, 
So carry on his legacy, something I must do, so I trust you lighting candles, concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room, 
First thing I did when I heard was call puff, 
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us, 
Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge.

As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker, 
When list my air ones, MJ was my nier.
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star, 
And since I'm a hollywood star I'm gonna tell you my story, 
Never had a family that close, never see Barry Gordy walking through interscope, 
Just like me they always had Mike in a scope, 
No matter what you say, 
I'm gonna love him and he's still dope, 
Let me take you back to 85 when I was in a zone, dancing for my momma thriller jacket with all the zippers on, 
Now I'm doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston, 
Listening to Outcast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson
Anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta you, 
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to let us through.

Skip through the blueprint one bang this what's mentioned
Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin
Balls faster than roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it nypd to respond to the shot

Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block

I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin I was makin it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message

Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch
And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you

And with my strength I will devour
Sickening thoughts are running through my head
That's when I realize I'm glad I'm not dead
A second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers

We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill
It was a dream and then hit me, reality struck
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Clost to buck 50 and we all stand strong
In respect to the family in times of our insanity
And through the words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family

Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killing niggas who misunderstood what diseased is
Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip-hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin', where the beach is?
Time to show the world, what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bulletproof cars in Sri Lanka
Twelve years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
Ten thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemars
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cause that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker

We robbin’ each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese tools
But nah, Mandela did twenty-eight straight

Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains

I remember I was rappin' for a year and a half
Couple tears in the glass
Some gunshots then I appeared on the map, bust it
In the studio, way in the back with Busta
Next mornin' back to weighin' the crack, fuck it
What if Dre don't make an album out my demo?
At least me, Snoop, and Nate Dogg smoked some indo
Mailman told me, ""Be patient,"" thanks for the info
Next thing I know, I'm in Hits Factory with Timbo
Came back and threw the Range on Lorenzos
I'm reminiscin', lookin' out this Lamborghini window
My Granny told me I'd be bigger than Nintendo, Game
Let the top down so she could scream her grandson name
We on our way back to the nursin' home listenin' to Just Blaze beats to put these verses on
My life almost got cut short on the 'Math, 'til Jigga told Dre ""Hate it or Love it"" was a smash

[Chorus]
I sit alone in my room in the zone writin' classics
Who rap better than me?
I sit alone in my room in the zone writin' classics
Who rap better than me?
I sit alone in the room in my zone writin' classics
Who do it better than me?
Who rap better than me?
Who rap better than me?

[Verse 2]
Shit sound like I found the Fountain of Youth
It's like the bald-head Game steppin' back in the booth, true
I'm the only nigga rap like I do, proof
Who survived after 300 Bars, who?
Nobody, I'm still countin' these bodies
Still countin' these millions
Still make everybody quiet when I walk in the lobby of that Interscope buildin'
I still drop one line and have 'em all in they feelings
I know you miss me but I just been in Calabasas
Bought the crib far just to stop from whoopin' nigga's asses
I'm the definition of classic
I'm the feelin' fans used to get when they rip the shit up out the plastic
How many legendary studios got my plaques in it?
New Lambo truck, let's see if I can start from scratch in it
And I started from the bottom of the block
Hate it or love it the underdog still on top, nigga

[Chorus]
I sit alone in my room in the zone writin' classics
Who rap better than me?
I sit alone in my room in the zone writin' classics

Who do it better than me?
Who rap better than me?

Game was always open arms
You know what I mean?
And, you know, he was the only one for a while
Yeah
From the-from the generation after the Snoop, Dre, Pac
So Game was-he held the position of-everybody looked to Game
For-for, you know, ""Hey, listen to my tape, woo""
And I actually met Game in my hood on Crenshaw and Slauson
And I was outside on the block with like twenty of my homies
And, um, I see the Range Rover, I'm like, ""That's Game right there""
And we all walked up to his car and I handed him my cd
And on my daughter, he had a Glock on his, on his hip
I mean on his lap
And that's what made me like, I ain't gon' say made me respect Game
I respect Game off all the things he done
But when we met, you know what I'm sayin'?
It was um, I was in the middle of my hood, you know, with all my homies before rap
And Game was drivin' through solo with a, with a Glock in his lap
You know so
No security, just solo?
Nah, nah, on the solo (On the solo)"

Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack [whispered] - Compton
Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm going down, in the town, where my name is all around
And niggaz just be hating and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doing nutting but claiming my city
See my lyrics are double or nothing proving to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into free styling, or trying to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-four, so
And that's how I'm living, I do as I please B
A young gangster put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stomping
If you're born and raised in Compton

[Chorus:]
[Quiet scratching:] 
""Born and raised in Compton""

Now Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog
Till I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody must of wanted me to die
Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They must of  thought that I was gonna' play the bitch role
Cause I lived through four five six holes
But I ain't going out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangster nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're ducking cause you can't stop a Y.G.
Gangster, cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and things ain't gonna never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is taking over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangster motherfucker never ceasing to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm coming like this and I'm coming directly
Cause niggaz getting all stirred up, I'm doing damage quite effectively
Rhyming is a battle zone and niggaz can't win
Cause I'm a gangster from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N"

Told him I wish he was in Casino (probably checking)

Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino (hood nigga)
Eating breakfast with Al Pacino (Wass good nigga?)
Please

[Verse:]
My life a movie directed by Tarantino, my Lambo lounging the kimo
I’m at that fork in the road like a torturous Hov
I ain’t wanna sell blow, I was forced to that stow
See, I was forced to be hard, without multiple goals
So I multiplied and magnified that coke, till I was satisfied
Took oath in my last supply, I kept my tenants classified
My momma ain’t know nah
My daddy and my uncles gave me bundles
Put it on bees I made it bumble
Bred 11’s, thou should not stumble
In bed by eleven, that’s where she thought but I’m in a jungle
Sayin no this ain’t no training day
I’m on that track, but I put them trains away
And my enemies on this train today
My dreams is where them bangers lay
The sky is where my fingers stay
Unless I bring the K, and choppers making rainy day
Niggas praying to Yeezus
Remember before he was famous, yeah!
A younger game would say

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
And if you must know, nobody’s perfect
We screw up, we make mistakes
Have heart breaks, go through hard times
But you need to know that’s life
The world ain’t full of assholes
But they strategically play
So that you could come across one every day
You know what I’m saying?
Sometimes things that happen in life are not part of a plan
But when that happens, don’t give up on your dreams!
Just find another way to reach em
Just give your food for thought, ladies and gentleman
Worrying won’t stop the bad from happening
But it will stop the good from being a joy
Yes sir!"

But don't play that nigga cheap
Cause you're body might wash up
By the courts at Venice Beach
Ain't shit sweet but my swisher
Ain't shit buzzin but my liquor
Cali chickens got to the ""A"" to strip
And come back a little thicker
With more ass than Deelishis
That's my flavor of love
We make it rain like Rain Man
When he play with the glove
I'm the king to you pawn niggaz, Punisher, Spawn niggaz
Playin in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggaz
We them barbeque, front and back lawn niggaz
Summer Jam, throw your ass offstage, Akon niggaz
We drink kool-aid with the ice on your arm nigga
Take that Champion hoody off
In the California sunshine...

[Chorus 4X]
California sunshine
In the summer time
Oh...

[Verse 2:]
I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire Boulevard
We can't find Biggie's killer
So we gave Puffy a star
And I'm by far Hollywood Boulevard
But I'm from a boulevard
That tought y'all how to shoot out of moving cars
Remember, ""New Jersey Drive""
Was like a East Coast ""Menace""
And ""Belly"" was like the sequel without O-Dog in it
Give me a New York minute
To show you Cali got more dead bodies
Then the Yankees got New York pennants
Cause we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted
I duck shots where Venus and Serena used to play tennis
And they never came back
Like throwin a boomerang flat
See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat
It's like a scene from a movie
When the screen fade black
Niggaz roll up on you
Now you stuck in that Harold and Caine trap
If you slippin in Hollywood
And you get your chain snatched
I know some niggaz that owe some niggaz
I'll get your chain back

[Chorus 4X]
California sunshine
In the summer time
Oh...

[Verse 3:]
Niggaz already know who had the Marijuana first
We birthed Haze and Sour Diesel
I was there when the water burst
Hell naw we don't surf
We half way go to church
Tell you the truth, shit
Right now I'm in the fuckin hearse
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse
It'll be another ten years before you see an Mc Ren here
Where he been
I been there
That Lambo, I'm in there
Hotter then the beginning of my career
With 50, Dre and Em there
Top off the Murcielago like Victoria's Secret swim swear
So listen, I'm so sincere
About to work out like gym wear
Murder mtv's top ten, then tat my face with 10 tears
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits
10 motorbikes stoppin traffic
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid
Don't you ever-ever leave me out of the top 10
You fuckin bastards
Blaow!

[Chorus 4X]
California sunshine
In the summer time

I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater cause I was nervous
That's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever... Whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'm a tell her? Daddy's your umbrella
Get with a glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name!
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon be the Godfather? Lil Wayne?
Y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma...

[Verse 2: Game]
You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up!
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat
But I'm a tell her later
Forget the car seat – man – I'm hella-faded
She like ""I know you ain't high! "" Man, I'm celebrating...
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt
Screaming at the top of her lungs: ""I need help! ""
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine: she pulling on me ""stop I'm about to crash, shit! ""
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Butterflies still here – am I happy? Hell yeah!

[Verse 3: Game]
I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think: damn... One of the nurses stuck her head out
They gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
""Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 – one more – 1, 2, 3, 4&#8243;
Push! C'mon Tea, push! God damn it, just push! ""
Nurse coaching her, doctor pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical
She out, 8 pounds 4 ounces
Hold up: I'm about to make an announcement
See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I think the woman who gave her life for my baby girl"

Cause if she roll wit us,
She wont even miss you.

Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack,
Before it hit the ground she throw it back.

Climb over to the passenger side and freeze.

Time for the world to pay homage

Fuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit
If you ain’t fuck, then you ain’t get your dick wet
I see your little chain
I see your little dreads tryin’ to be a Lil Wayne, shit

Started with a little rock, got me a little stove
Made a little money, bought me a little rose
Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill, everybody know my name now

Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It’s time to confess my sins, cause I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I’m thinkin’ it’s time for me to chill
Cause I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell
I’m triyin’ to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell

Dre promised me records, I never got ‘em
That’s why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records
And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
I pop champaign when I heard he was with Dre
And I’m tellin’ y’all this true story cause I’m real
Dre, first time, he ain’t ’bout it, wonder how he feel
Cause I feel like shit severin’ the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop, Pac, Em, 50
Me, Kdot, watch us do a 360
Plus the Documentary say we from penitentiaries
I ain’t trippin’, niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5&#8242; s and don’t mention me
Fuck ‘em all

Father forgive me, cause I ain’t perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can’t get it right, I always try to get it right

See I been spendin’ these late nights
Oo, girls I never seen gettin’
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me, yeah
With ‘em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
That’s the way the story goes
? I can’t feel my heart
But I just keep ridin’, ridin’
Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah

Shit on niggas check the urinal and you'll see
That I be droppin' jewels and you should take 'em like a jewel thief
Wolves teeth is what I use to eat my fuckin' pray up with
Used to make the yayo flip now Game told me to lay your hits
Teamed up, toured the us just to let the name ring
Goin' home to fuck shit up, I did the King James thing
Steak and lobster with the gentleman, sit with a gangster posture
Blowin' all these bands fans, screamin' like it's Frank Sinatra
Made it out the South Bay village homies hate I prosper
But I don't owe you niggas shit, I'm supposed to thank my mama
Only chase for commas, got 'em in now raise the Llama
Hotter than a blazin' comet, fuckin' south central moth

Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please

Alright
You kids get to bed I'll get the story book

Heeeeereeeee weeee go

Slam the impala door and want do ya see
Some niggas hangin on the fence lookin at me
I had phat red laces in my addidas
Big chain around my neck like mardi grass
So I stepped up to them [?] far from here
One nigga lifts his shirt then yells out ""yeah""
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like ""nahh""
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four five with the kung fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the star
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
""What did you do""
I shot!
Are you crazy fool?
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well I'll be damned
It was 7: 15 on my rolex watch
And I can't do the time that my rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And impala passes, it's my homeboy clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six for, orignal inside
With no key in the ignition
Whered you get this clyde?
Nevermind, I'm out, it's a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the dukes of hazard
Then clyde yells out ""you stupid bastard""
So I'm runnin though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, it's my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in long beach
Cause in california the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his barklys
I ain't seen these since 92'
I'm feelin like a bad boy without the shiny suit
Here the cops come, shit, so I hide behind a honda
[?]
In the car kissin [?]
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked into the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
Said sorry, jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
It's chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let him free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'Dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run need a ride [?]
Hell yeah bigg snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
This another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C. P. T
Walked straight up to my house, pulled out my key
It's my girl playin [?]"

Corn rolled by a L. A. Bitch
And I can't forget
My niggas riding the train Yankee fitted
Thermals under that Pelle shit
I love New York but gangbanging that's L. A. Shit
And I'm proud of it
Spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it
I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangsta, let the. 40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doing life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Than break up the streets of Compton and spill my blood in the pavement

Put us in the same cage and I'ma have to peel? Em

If five shots couldn't drop me but I ain't take 'em and smile
I lost a lot of my niggaz to gang bangin and ditches
One finger on the trigger, dawg, I live the life of a sinner

Starring death in the eyes, 20 niggaz deep, when we ride

Money over bitches is my motto, in the street I'n known for catchin hollo's
Packing pistols and drinking belvy and Grey Goose out the bottle
No role models, only killas and fiends
Withness my niggaz strapped with gats, and army fatigues
If it's murder, he wrote it, if I'm lying
Let the devil excel quoted and know that I'm strictly a rap poet
Babtized in my own tears, chastized by my own peers
I'm a product of my childhood years
My mother told me I'm hopeless, my pops wasn't around
One of the reasons why I'm clutchin a pound
California dreaming, chronic smoke out the beamer
One hand on the nina, scheeming got these hoochie bitches screaming
They know that I'm a celeberty - keep the cop-killers in the clip

Kick the door open, Will let's go
Flow like Esco', New York niggaz say I'm the best yo
Hard like Timbos, blowin on indo
Niggaz try to play me get stretched out like a limo
I was shoppin crack when Dre was bangin my demo
And all you old niggaz is washed up like N. O.
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence Will bang the instrumental
.. I spit for my niggaz in the line-up
That'll never see the sun again, so I close my blinds up
First album sold 'em out, Impalas rolled 'em out
Cause the whole motherfuckin world wanna know about

Welcome to the city of G's
Where we eat fried chicken, rice, and black-eyed peas
Fans got us in-the-scope/Interscope, like Jimmy Iovine
Cause we (Ruthless), like Will before the (Black Eyed Peas)
Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see
I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm hiv
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hirin
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retirin
I just might put out ""Detox"" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
Fortyfive in my khakis gotta watch my health
I'm so hard nigga, glock 17 quick draw nigga
Like the old me, 17, sippin malt liquor
All black khaki suit, all black Converse
Nigga I'ma keep on stompin comin (Straight Outta)

They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V. I. P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the cx-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the [?] name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga

I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V. I. P. Strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new are. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in hurr, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N. W. A. Chain glow like the memory of I'll Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and jt

Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends

And them niggaz sellin the work ain't half as old
As the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin since the 60's
Everybody yellin gimme, gimme
Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, c'mon walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell
And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine
Keep a (Mac) on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans

The boys in the hood is always hard

And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverand, a dime for a witness

Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A. I. Zone
And mob like Al Capone through N. W. A. 's home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggaz to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin about if y'all seen where..

We drug dealin, but niggaz is squealin (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stooooooood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggaz ball, some niggaz do what we do
And other niggaz sing for Cash Money like tq
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

Super good
How many people endure that judgment?
The steeple is meant to usher the presence of higher power
But the reverend desires showers with seven virgins
And hours of heaven, lustful pleasures
A couple C cups and the essence enough to keep blood rushin', I fuck with her heavy
I might jump in her belly
I might summon her friends just so we all function like Eddie
I treat it like an animal plus the camera's on steady
Do my damage and then go scramble leaf panties like levies
They gon' judge me no matter what I do, uh
So I keep my halo with a peace sign, give a fuck 'bout you
When I recline, I'ma need a fee, so I never get enough, I knew
I barely even touched my food, we skipped the appetizers
I slid inside her, when I'm done, I'm like, ""What the fuck I do?""
Now her head's on my sleeve and my hand's on her weave
She wanna stay and parlay and conversate over trees
But now I'm ready to leave
And I'm just wonderin' where my keys is at

We live this real-life shit then put it in a verse
But this freak only askin' me, ""Do them bullets really hurt?""
Can't answer no questions unless you really from the turf
But I can put you on
See your curves from them curves that I swerved up on
Legs so smooth, the type of thighs you sniff a bird up on
Fuck the Summer Walker, no matter how many times we done heard that song
Daycare on your back, scoop them kids up with the shirt that's on
Back to the block where niggas stay active, no drama teachers
Pour O. E. Out for our lost ones and stay elevated like Balenciaga sneakers
Inglewood to Compton, Space Jam's on, shot it out with monsters
13 to your back, Tristan Thompson

Every picture got a nigga next to Judas
Every nigga got his own cross to bear
And that's the reason that...

As the devil says, la, la, la...

[The Game]
[Verse 2:]
I never said thank you, and I took it for granted,
You let me in your house and made me a part of your family,
Now I'm eating with you, Eve and Busta Rhymes,
I wasn't star-struck, I was just glad to be signed,
And even though sometimes I run loose,
You still my homeboy, Doc, I'd take a bullet for you,
I'm not asking you to take my side in the beef,
But you told me it was okay to say 'fuck the police! ',
Now it's my turn to carry the torch,
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover o' The Source,
Remember when we got drunk to do Start From Scratch?
I told you you was like a father to me, I meant that!
Sitting here looking at my platinum plaques,
Thinking 'What the fuck am I without a Dr. Dre track? '
When Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!

[Chorus:]
I didn't mean to walk away,
But I hear every word they say,
I guess my mind just drew a blank,
Like la, la, la....
Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,
Reminiscing about my day,
Wit' your blood all over my slate,
As the devil says, la, la, la...

[Busta Rhymes]
[Verse 3:]
See when the world is on your shoulders, and the stress grows bigger,
The fire in him made it difficult to talk to the nigga,
Most of the time I let him know, I don't agree with what he do,
But he a hard-head, Dre, that's why I'm talkin' to you,
See when I first met my nigga, son was laying in the cut,
Type reserved, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut,
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut,
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck,
And as time went on, and he was working with the finest,
I saw the pressure start to build so I gave additional guidance,
You gave him something that could make or break a nigga you should face it,
So big I don't even think he was ready to embrace it,
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction,
The only problem was our little nigga wouln't listen,
But when Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!

[Chorus:]
I didn't mean to walk away,
But I hear every word they say,
I guess my mind just drew a blank,
Like La, la, la....
Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,
Reminiscing about my day,
Wit' your blood all over my slate,
As the devil says, La, la, la...

[The Game]
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here

[Chorus:]

[Blue Chip]
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
My girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry

[Chorus:]

[The Game]
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you

Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards

Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower

[Blue Chip]
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

[The Game]
And I ain't sayin s** is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you

Bitch, don’t kill my vibe – nigga, don’t blow my high
Wake up in a Bugatti but I’m in a Maserati when I’m on the 405
I’m king of the motherfuckin’ Westside
Two dubs up when the teks fly
“Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla!”
Turn a 600 to an S5
Compton made me direct this ending
Like my little nigga Kendrick, props to Jay-Z
Got a Rocky pendant and a drop Mercedes
I’ll been gone ’til November but I’m not from Haiti
I’m a C-O-M-P-T-O-N, N-I
Double G A like a young D-Wade
Brought my city a championship by myself
And niggas think I’m doin’ this shit for my health
I am, don’t make me go ham, 4-5
Go blam, I was just protecting my wealth
Matte black Bentley, all-black pennies
Black Tom Ford shades, I’m ’bout to go stealth
All black everything…
Trap Wesley Snipes inside Tiffany’s wedding ring
Nigga, never get out…
I’m constipated, just tryna get my shit out
False alarm, I can’t do #2
Pee on you peons for eons and eons
Used to intercept niggas, rock like Deion
Sellin’ white packs out my grandmama’s Neon
Ask my nigga Breon…
I played ‘Pac’s brother in this classic movie
No relationship to Leon…
When I spit for Dre I had a nigga forehead like a nigga was a klingon
No album out, I’m on 106 like a nigga put Free on
Any beat that I breathe on or be on, I be gone
I brawl like I’m out in Maryland, Georgetown, Michigan
Florida, watch a nigga get his unc on
Baby Jordans for my baby daughter
No Harold Miner, can I get my usc on?
Eight cars in my driveway, sideways
Horsepower make the Lamborghini fly away
I am the shit when I step out the Six
And I step at your bitch in my brand new kicks
…you bitch… don’t act brand new
‘Cause you suck on my dick when you walk in my crib
Airplane mode, won’t be no duck lips next to Van Gogh
Dance with the devil, I learned to tango
“S” on the metal, I wrapped the Range Rove
Ride to my limits inside the Infinite
God is my witness, I’ve got the roof in it
Designed to go win it
Mismatched rims on the motherfuckin’ Phantom
Nigga, nigga on God, I’mma spend it
Compton… Westside, and I’m riding with Kendrick

[Outro: Kendrick]
I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
You ain’t heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don’t you see that long line"

Our Lord, grant us good in this world
And good in the life, to keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson, rest in peace Mike Brown and all the young soldiers out there
God help us

[Hook: tgt]
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwin up our hands don't let them shoot us
Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

[Verse 1: Game]
Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson
Talked to Tip, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying stop the riots, we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there, thought I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got
Police taking shots and I ain't talkin' bout Ciroc
I'm talking bout Emmett Till, I'm talking bout Ezell Ford
I'm talking bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky, still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul
Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll
The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming, 'I'm a Boss! '

[Hook:]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?
Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest, it's a slow process
Heard it's a lot of rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
Yeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed, and I know it's for a cause
My only question is, what we doing for the loss of Mike Brown?
Cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to speak up
And don't you ever let them silence you
Cause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up, that's what occured
Man that sound absurd, matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Ay yo Game, I had a crib out there
I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing
So it's time we come together, use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown, cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we looting, paint pictures like we some animals
On my nwa cmg
Holl'in' ""Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police""

[Verse 7: Wale]
Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing?
I’m sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you, you ice challenge
Okay, and I support the als just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt, so you just flexing then
Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop
People only there for a minute, then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all?
We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart

[Bridge: tgt, King Pharaoh & (Swizz Beatz)]
Where does it end?
I got my hands up, what else am I supposed to do?
(Rest in peace to Mike Brown)
Where does it end?
(And all the other warring soldiers)
Tell me, where's the love for everything we're going through?
(That will not be on the news or televised, ah)
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
(As we lead in peace)

[Verse 8: Swizz Beatz]
Martin Luther King had a dream!
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out, go dark it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair
It's going down, armageddon right here
Right now, not on tv, but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice, yeah, we need justice here

[Verse 9: Curren$y]
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts, a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done, the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his, the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried

[Verse 10: Problem]
The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide
Fuck that, we have arrived!
And who cares who ain't on our side cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like ""We gotta do something""
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna do nothing
Fuck it, my moms, sorry, I'm ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage, oh lord it's

Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects

My pops left me in a foster home

New car, new house, and sometimes friends change

And your Jesus piece is sim-you-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-you-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no +Unsigned Hype+, nigga *Fuck* The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggaz breathin the same air as me, actin like they don't bleed

Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be

I got NASCAR novels, I was build to race
Gone the long hot summer, I was gone through space
It's the next best thing, making soda and base
It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the people we're chasing
Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic
I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a poor start
She walking around naked like she my personal all star
I push one button and boom: ""hey, baby, how can I serve you today? ""
Pussy wet like a typhoon. Ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate back stroll, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm about to miss my flight
First class to London, fucking with you all night

[Chorus]
Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air
Dropping car, feeling like spaceships
Riding with models and stripping ace in the club
Show international girls how to do it with dub
While my chain swing left to right
Came with the party with you, do it all night
My money never run out, we party 'till the sun out
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out

From west to uncut, working at home
From BJ to YJ, now the J grown
One click of the wrist, I compare her to gun flight patrol
On your turn flight to predator draw more
Not to mention Pitbull bully razor heads
Bloodline, Wu-Tang fans, police
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for a fight
Or the flash green lights meeting at your door sight
Let's go to war now, off the world is steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
Want your fingers sliced, now you pay the price
Put your light on the line if you feel get that nice
Running bullshit over here, get you shot
Stupid, I retreat that, everything you're not
Exits more the spot, that's everything that's hot
Walk right upon you and run everything you've got

[Chorus]

I, I, I hit 'em with a nuke, get the pussy
They're scared to shoot
My niggas get you with the 21 gun, salute
I paratroop to your city, hit the club, recruit
Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound
You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground
Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud

When I see Lloyd Banks it's goin' (down, down)
If you in the car wit em' you betta get (down, oooh, and out)
Automatic rifle and I'm blastin' on sight so

Two in the leg knocked em (down, down)
From Thirty feet away, he fell (down, oooh, and out)
Touch kids like Michael
One roll of the dice, oh!
You wanna gamble wit' your life?
Nigga die slow

Now your casket goin' (down, down)

Told P-nut to get (down, down)
I looked back and saw my nigga goin' (down, oooh, and out)

Soon as we hit Houston then
We heard police sirens

Oh shit!, it's goin' (down, down)
Guns out, they tellin' him to get (down, oooh, and out)
He on both knees
Blood squirtin' out his jeans
Catch 22, should I go to jail or flee the scene

Either way it's goin' (down, down)
So I hopped in the truck and went (down, oooh, and out)
Broadway in a black suburban
One thing on my mind
Go hard til' them fags get murdered

Cuz he tried to get my nigga shot (down, down)
But he survived and now he goin' (down, oooh, and out)
To the station
Police at the Double-U waitin'
On me to arrive and now I gotta shake em'

They wanna take a nigga (down, down)
We on the same elevator goin' (down, oooh, and out)
Dodger fitted
Got the Hova lean
So they ain't notice me
Now they mad as fuck
And gotta watch my Range Rover leave

Hit the 95 and head (down, down)
It's to Philly so I can lay it (down, oooh, and out)
Catch the first thing smoking back the L-A-X
Kicked up my Air Nikes
Then I slept the whole flight

Had a dream about it goin' (down, down)
Woke up and saw my plane comin' (down, oooh, and out)
Missed the palm trees
Sun shinin' everyday
New York's my second home
But from in L.A.

And I hold shit (down, down)
The throne was empty so I sat (down, oooh, and out)
And just handled my biz
There's two sides to every westside story
And I just tell it like it is

And that's how it went (down, down)
On my son that's all that went (down, oooh, and out)
So stop tellin' them lies to all them motherfuckin' magazines
And radio stations nigga you know what happened

Me and Lloyd Banks aint (down, down)
Keep talkin' shit, I'll lay you (down, oooh, and out)

You niggas ran out the backdoor nigga
All I wanted to do was holla man
To see what was what

Y'all was too fuckin' scared to come (down, down)

His parents hustled
So he was left alone by himself a lot
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do
When boys in the hood came out, this little nigga rolled himself a joint
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad
She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit
So she never knew, until now"

In Compton, you either a blood or a crip
Nigga ain't no one in between
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips
His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5
His brother Jevon, he got murdered when he was just 13
After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
And never looked back"

[San Quinn]
Drama is real, like not wakin up
I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
Everytime you spotted they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty
If you seen how niggaz hit the club, they pullin out uzis
Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin
No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash

[Chorus: The Game]
If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga
If the stash spot smokin I done murdered a nigga
San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz
We take this beef shit further than niggaz
Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggaz
All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggaz
Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggaz
We take this beef shit personal nigga

[The Game]
I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four-fifty put somethin through your son Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells

[Chorus:]

[The Game]
See the Escalade got 'em runnin downhill, snowball niggaz
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game put niggaz in a coffin too much
Turn niggaz kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky & Hutch
Your daughter cryin it's just [?] tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, the Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese cause if you owe me
Guns O-you-T, we all gon' squeeze

I woke up out dat coma, 2000 and 1
Bout the same time Dre dropped 2000 and 1
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude Volume 1
Rap critics politicin
Wanna know the outcome!
Ready to die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like Pac, after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind the G-Series and All Eyez On Me
I watched the death of a dynasty!
So I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr.Dre was a ""DREAM!""
I had visions of makin' a classic
Then my wall turned black,like I was starin outa Stevie Wonders glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine,like Kanye West
Comin back from a fatal accident, to beat makin' and rappin'
But, we da future
Whitney Houston told me that, it's gon take mo' than a bullet in a heart to hold me back

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!""
Aaliyah had a ""DREAM!""
Left Eye had a ""DREAM!""
So I reached out to Kanye and ""brough you all my dreeam!""

[Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]

[Verse 2]
I had dreams of fuckin' an R'n'B bitch like Mya
When I saw dat ass on a front of that King
Read the article in a magazine
She loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm the glass house havin' nasty dreams!
Good girls neva' give it up
But anything is possible ,if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles,found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream about bein' Unsigned Hype
Till I was crushed my Dave Mase, almost let my pen fall asleep on a page
Daydreamin' yesterday
Dozin' on offback stage
I tought I saw Eazy talkin' to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over heard Jam Master say
It's a hardknock life, then you pass away
They say sleep is the cousin' of death
So my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to ya last breath

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce
Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a ""DREAM!""
Aalyah had a ""DREAM!""
Left Eye had a ""DREAM!""
So I reached out to Kanye and ""brought you all my dream!""

[Sample playin ""It's cuz I love you!""]

[Verse 3]
The Dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The Dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you!
Who walk through the Whitehouse without a business suit?
Compton had Jerry Curl drippin' on Ronald Reagens shoes
Gave Mike Lim my demo came here to pay my dues
Started of with Whoo Kid then I started blazin' Clue
It was all a Dream like BIG said it be
Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmares to reality
Rap Phenomenon defyin' the rulez of gravity
Studied all the classic start revisin my strategy
Cuz Marshall Mathers made it
Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went?
How do I say this, I'm livin' for my son but I can't figure, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus Piece like a Cathlic Nun
The War to be a rap legend has just begun

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce
Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

Cause everybody tired of them R.I.P.'s

Now, cowards wanna pack and, killers wanna cruise and
Real niggaz stand alone mayne and do what we do

And you a boss for not cuttin him with the boxcutter
And it was cool 'til this chick really got to trippin
Spittin drink in yo' face, boy she popped up pimpin (what?)

They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin
Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs

I go from 0-60, a couple seconds
She go from sober to tipsy and gettin' naked
Me and Game the '010 Crockett and Tubbs
Trey said he gon' meet us on the block of the club
You heard Jerome, but instead of a Benzo
Get rid of your Friends-oh to ride in this Enzo

Hey

Hopin that one day I can flip the pies on you
Since you down south show you what that rock could do
Come back rich, yeah nigga that's my proof

Nigga run up on Ya Boy baby you be shootin' too
Fuck Bonnie and Clyde mama, we much deeper
Ya Boy love dough and you the toppings on my pizza

And I knew you was my bitch from the first, moment I seized ya
And just like, every blunt needs some green
Every gun needs a beam, every thug needs a queen
She suckin me up, I be sippin the bub

And it's gutter hell, it's just me and my bitch

Night after night..
Lookin through that glass window wishin you was mine
Wishin I could hold you..
Just wanna squeeze the life outta you..

I remember in '96 when we met, you got the best of me
I had an appetite for destruction, you had the recipe
Told me the last motherfucker chose his destiny
One in the head, execution style, so I'm guessin
He ain't know you was special, misused you and abused you
Put his hand around your neck, squeezed harder when you refused
To open your mouth, give him everything you got
I see the fire in ya eyes and in a nigga the shot
I guess what I'm tryin to say is that I like you a lot
You let me hold you like he hold you we take over the block
Go from the dope spot to the cl drop
You like it I love it, now me and you callin the shots
Remember yesterday when we rocked ____ (muted) ??
You told me you wished you could've been there when Pac got knocked
Tonight we goin to the range, that'll get you hot
Wear your pretty dress, the one with the infrared dots

No question I'm rep'n Vatican, we gone do this big nigga style
Let's take em there for real, let's go

[Verse: Raekwon)
Before flusty days living in Killa Hills
I was young'd out with rusty waves
Cut'n hair chill'n, going down town blaze'n
Lay'n up in Albee Square, When I bought my first fronts there
Everybody young as fuck, in the pizza shop, what up
Brooklyn niggas rap with a cuffle
Call the highlights the gangsta dialect
Before I let any nigga take mine I'm die'n, Moet
What's the jump off, the new shit
Then he said hold up a sec
Get this crack money, niggas except
Wick checks, food stamps and amps
Blue Wallabee's, aviaries' on in the back on the ramp
You know we pop off for hours, cowards beware
Word to mother, you will respect my power
Respect the dollar, no quizzy, Get busy
It was like adolescents at war, we clapped them thizzies
On the duece suited Voltron, The ratchet heavy
In the crib cool'n blunted, watch'n Tom & Jerry
Bag'n up, laugh'n, bling'n, rhyme'n and sing'n
When it come to getting currency, call me a swinger
We rock Maybach's, Benz's is little
Icicles on, cover the ground with a massive dribble
Call us ballers, brawlers, them whores want all us
Suede down, cool'n, play'n spades with quarters
And then left it for the rap game
All my niggas grab champagne
Bust of them seals it's mad flames, yall lames
Stay in your lane, we move'n like big money
Bet a nigga die for them chains
You know the slang baby, watch me lay her
Half goon, half mayor, the other half call me a hater
But later, I'ma polly for Rae-ah, and a hundred wolves
Pull next time, respect the playa, What

Talking bout ten a key, Baltimore, Tennessee

I'm sick and that drop Aston is the medicine
Ride'n with the moon in the rear view, it's only evident

Game code his rhymes, ain't even been recorded yet
On the fence where my father used to sport a Vet
And my Uncle Red ran the rock like door set
Rewind time ten years before I had the Lex
Mail man scared to drop the bills on my door step
Little nigga street dream'n bout a fast car
My Father had dope tracks like his arm was Nascar
In eighty-seven, shit I was maybe seven
Watch'n my big brother throw'n ten, come back with eleven
Only knew what it was cause I overheard
My pops on the phone talking bout selling all my birds
I cried over the next eight years over them pigeons
To only find out not one was missing, Word

Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggaz tryin to ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's cd
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood tv
So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on
Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new gs with two, three tecs
Got niggaz Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep
Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that glock stuffed tonight
I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it
A block bust tonight

[Chorus 2X: The Game]
Getting American Money Easy, all I know
The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough
It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts

[The Game]
Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

[Chorus:]

[Young Noble]
Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointin fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-you-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standin next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets

I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggaz to New York
""Juicy"" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
'Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boom box, had to say
Today was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggaz can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstaz was dancin' like New Edition
'cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
'cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

And ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day

Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say WHOA!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name:
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose, Amen

Got my mind on this murder, Impala's all gassed up
Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, play it out on that movie screen
And to scope with some killers, almost die for moving green
My mama a felon, my daddy so long gone
My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed
Left me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed

Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rag, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes
Killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can we do
When you got on the wrong colors?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
On that Impala, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray

Yea I still love you baby
Yo, yo, yo the story gets crazy but in the beginning the shit was all gravy my girlfriend she straight up from Brooklyn type of chick jus to kill another bitch just for looking she's so Brooklyn she so crazy I swear to god man I love my baby,
But you could all ways catch a nigga hanging out I was in the late night spot smoking out. That's when I saw this girl she was leaning, she was kind of tipsy from the drink she was drinking, she was looking then she started winking,
Thinking to my self man I probably shouldn't be here I got her name then I got her number, I should be ashamed because I went home and called her, now we on the phone telling me she older said she from the Bronx and she want me to come over I was like

[Chorus]
Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

Man this shit gets deeper I hoped on the subway jus to go meet her she was looking like a wannabe diva freaky lil bitch borderline skuzzier,
My girlfriend she wasn't hesitating she blowing up my phone ever second we was hanging..
She so inpatient she's on probation I swear to god man I love my baby,
But I always spend my time hanging out sawp chilling with this hoe in the Bronx digging her out.
Fucked her in the kitchen, hit it on the couch, I can't forget to mention I put it in her mouth.
And now it's a long ride home I know I was so damn wrong... but dam I had so much fun.
My girl kept calling my phone I'm thinking about what I've done.

[Chorus]
Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

The next day I thought shit was all over but my girlfriend giving me the cold shoulder said she found some empty condom rappers in the rova, now she throwin fits telling me to go,
Crying in the bed room burning all my cloths taking all my shoes and put 'em on the stove all in the kitchen looks like a furnace...
Ten minutes later whole house burning, and now you see me in a robe running out and you can here the police coming without a doubt.
The cops saw us fussing my girl was tripping hard, they locked me up in handcuffs threw me in the car, and now I know that
It's over I called her over and over she won't answer my call's I thought my pimping days were over, I stood up only to fall.

[Chorus]
Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe cheated on my woman with a girl from the...cheated on my woman with a girl from the... cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx."

Since big aint here, I’mma do it for T’yanna
And put roses on the grave for Kanye’s mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, gettin’ beat on by their man
Respect women, I don’t care if they a 2 or a 10
We don’t beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end
And we don’t wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missin’ women out there, let’s just focus on them

This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her Daddy, so I wrote this on Fathers Day
I know she gone, but she aint far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar ‘Ye
I’m about to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back, listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way
When police came our way, my daddy had his act on
Like it never happened: (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga, she ain’t gotta deal wit’ ya
You want some money? Nigga I aint get a deal wit’ ya
You aint sayin’ nothin’, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air cause
You coulda went out, like ya boy Steve Mcnair

Good evening, I’m in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models, but hmm… I don’t believe ‘em
Who’s still gettin’ tested?
Wheres all the women at, could still remember who they slept with?
Where’s all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working with what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I’ll be your King, be a Queen Latifah
I love ya ass like Milhouse love Lisa
I love ya ass like the ninja turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of
You got it girl, this song remind me of Kat from Philly
A girl I used to love but still she started acting silly
Her hearts a lil’ chilly, she a little too carefree
In 10 years, who’s paying for all that therapy
Umm, nigga not me!
Yeah, I’m probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches I’m coming straight to you
Good girl

Like ugh, them is basketball wives?
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes chick
Can’t swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first day
Or pop a bottle with her on her birthday
And tell her ass, get on
That type of shit’ll get you spit on
I don’t hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like “hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy world”
“Get busy girl, drink that Rose til you dizzy girl”
She walking round the club all lost like “where is he, girl?”
He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Dom spray
That's your girl, nigga go on make her cry
Soon as you do, I’m pulling up in that Porsche, like “Lets ride”

2018, what a fucked up year for me

Only way I got through it was bumpin' Wayne's first Carter
With the speakers blarin', windows down on my Mclaren
See the wheels and it's apparent, this why these fuck niggas starin'
Had a premonition, parked and got out, Calabasas far

You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids
I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers
And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller
Haters trip when they see the whip dippin by
The paint on it change like the I-95
I'm just Clyde, without the Bonnie, I got the hollowpoint
Heat for you niggaz and the po' for the mamis
Sean Gotti, I'm puttin an end to camraderie
I'm lettin off heat, 'til them eyes get watery

My mama kissing a girl
Confusion occurs
Coming up in a cold world
Daddy aint around
Probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing
Check, check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat
If I could move a few packs
I get the hat
Now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning
Niggaz done stole my bike
Different day, same shit
Ain't nothing good in the hood
I run away from this bitch
And never come back if I could

Guns on both sides
Right above the gold wires I four-five'em
Kill a nigga on ma song
And really do it
That's the true meaning of a ghostrider
Ten g'z will take your daughter outta air forces
Believe you me homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call, have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been banging since ma lil' nigga, rob, got killed for his Barkley's
That's ten years
I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my air-max 95's
Told Banks when I met'em I'm a ride
And if I gotta die, rather homicide
I ain't had 50 cent when ma grand-mama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with ma jacob on
See how time fly?

Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fucking with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My Ma's happy, she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range
Thinking how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone, and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No school books
They use their wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in a booth
And I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion
I love you Ma

I got it made like my last name...
I'm gone... Juss like my After-math Chain...

Don't make me take you back to '96...
Leanin on that dostin... On the corner... Eatin catfish...
The Game... Da-Da-Da-Game... Spit dat shit...
I'm controversial... Like the Afro-pic with the Black fist...
Jus ask the rapper that had to catch my last diss...
I'm reckless... And I aint never crash wips...
My pops wasn't around... So this bastard...
Bleed california from the cradle to the Casket...
And I wont stop ridin for my coast...
Niggas keep talkin bout my bread... We gonna make toast...

Jump back
Strapped with the fat buddha sac
And a '78 lac
Oh clean
Gangsta lean

Like it aint no thang
I hang with og
Playas don't set trip
Or you might get what we call a rat pack
I don't slack when it come to streets
I get real g funk to a gangsta beat
Its so sweet when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt 'n' a fly big benz
I make ends

Givin love to the playas that I know is real

Ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary

Ridin on these niggaz cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy
Still heavy in this game

Quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on

Bust on these bitch-made niggaz hit em up

Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger
Lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz
I love my females strapped
Love fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks
Californias where I'm at ridin'
Passed by while these niggaz wonder why
I got shot and didn't die

For all my homies in the pen

And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk-fools payin me
And broke groupies and hoochies don't faze me

To put platinum and gold on a record shelf
I don't brag
But I tellem like it straight up iz
Befo you do a record partna handle the bizness

The Game,Hug The Block,/t/the+game/hug+the+block_1737143.html,"[Verse 1]
My daddy died, I paid for his whole funeral
I get it, I was supposed to
But after that, if you knew what I had to go through
You would understand why I wanted inside that hole too
You ain't even give me a hug or a pound yet
Askin' for money, daddy ain't even in the ground yet
That ain't what bros do
How you spend your whole life with a stranger you call your brother that don't know you?
2006 Bentley coupe parked at Nobu
I was your bulletproof vest when them Crips tried to smoke you
Shit be hurtin' my heart so I approached you
We on the same team but you think I'm tryna coach you
I was in first class, I looked back
You was mad so I gave up my seat and sat in coach too
Here's somethin' to toast to
I bought the weed, the blunts, you smoked that and the roach too

[Chorus]
(Calling) All this stress got me pourin' shots
(Out to) Can't hug my daddy so I hug the block
(All my) You supposed to be my family but I know you not (Family)
(Calling) All this stress got me pourin' shots
(Out to) Can't hug my daddy so I hug the block
(All my) You supposed to be my family but I know you not (Family)

[Verse 2]
Over a bitch, dawg? All this shit over a bitch, dawg?
I mean, really, over this bitch, dawg?
I was Lebron, you were supposed to be my Rich Paul
Baby to Slim when a nigga got rich, dawg
But your love turn to hate, that's what we split for
When the fuck you get soft
And start talkin' behind my back like baby mamas when they pissed off?
I couldn't fuck with your energy when the shits off
Hate it or love it video inside that '64
Me and 50 was the twin towers
You hit us from the inside and watch both them shits fall
I almost died, you ain't save me then
You ain't patch the bullet holes in my Mercedes Benz
You hate me now, you hate me then
I remember the way you looked at me in my baby crib
My brother's keeper, right?

[Chorus]
(Calling) All this stress got me pourin' shots
(Out to) Can't hug my daddy so I hug the block

(Out to) Can't hug my daddy so I hug the block
(All my) You supposed to be my family but I know you not (Family)

[Verse 3]
I can't believe this life took my pops
We fightin' each other and we both look like pops
Nah, I take that back, I look like pops
And when I see you, you look like opps
You look like Biggie, I look like 'Pac
Fuck it, we could both die, all this shit is for nothin'
I'd kill my own brother, I ain't bluffin'
It's a temptation of mine and you look like David Ruffin
I can see you all my enemies in a dark room
Or maybe I'm hallucinatin' like I'm off shrooms
But I'm not, you mad my life is a movie
And you been hatin' since turnin' off my cartoons
All this shit bottled inside, I'm 'bout to blow up
Pimp the butterflies in my stomach before I throw up
So what? I got this Hennessy, it's time to pour up
You 44 years old nigga, it's time to grow up

[Chorus]
(Calling) All this stress got me pourin' shots
(Out to) Can't hug my daddy so I hug the block
(All my) You supposed to be my family but I know you not (Family)
(Calling) All this stress got me pourin' shots
(Out to) Can't hug my daddy so I hug the block

Your son wonder when you comin' home
I wonder why you couldn't make it home?
I wonder why they love you when you gone?
I wonder if you know how much they miss you?
Crenshaw, now they yellin', ""Crenshaw""
Crenshaw, now they wearin' Crenshaw
I wonder why they love you when you gone? (When you gone)

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius and The Game]
I wonder if you're there right now (Right now, Ayy, Dom)
I wonder (Ayy, this classic shit, Dom)
I wonder if you're really listenin' to what I feel right now? (This L. A. Shit)
I wonder
I'm hopin' you're the peace that'll make 'em really care right now (Throw them dubs up)
But you're gone and it just isn't fair right now, right now (One time for our nig', we got the world lit)
On God, the work is never done (We love you, Nip)
The good they die young, used to be my son
Even when it waivers, the pain I feel is numb
Know that you were loved, yeah
I didn't wanna write this song

[Verse 1: The Game]
Didn't wanna write it, so it's from the heart
Even brought your homie from Leimert Park
Smokin' papers on Vernon for the hurt
Reminiscin', you and Blacc Sam built it from the dirt
Los Angeles, the gift and a curse
Focused on your neighborhood but you shifted the earth
You had the Staples Center packed like a church
Whole South Central put they hands on your hearse
I wonder if Heaven got a Slauson
You with Biggie and Pac, look at you, big as the bosses
Headed to a marathon, look at your nigga, he flossin'
Your legacy untouchable like Emani and Kross is
On the days that I'm feelin' exhausted, think about uncle Snoop at the funeral talkin'
This type of shit you don't see that often
Stevie Wonder singin', he can't even see your coffin

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder if you're free right now, yeah
I wonder if you're happy, are you livin' out your dreams right now?
I hope the angels are givin' you your wings right now
The hardest thing that I had to sing right now
Right now, right now, oh, God
The best was yet to come (Sometime)
The good, they die young
Used to the be sun even when it rains, yeah
Pain I feel is numb
You'll always be loved
I didn't wanna write this song

[Verse 2: The Game]
Ayy, shit sound like it look
All the history you made, nigga, I could write a book
You had the Eight Treys walkin' with the 60s
I witnessed it all, you was right there with me
From Eritrea to South Central
From South Central to Brooklyn, look at what you been through
Mind over matter, yeah, it's all mental
But I still don't trust 12 when I see 'em in my rearview
Six years ago, I could of been you
Me and some of my old homies had the same issues
If I come, tell God to let me in
Give 'em the room next to Aaliyah with espn
You got tears fallin' down the cheeks of Mexicans
You got a number in my phone I can't text again
And if they killed you, they could kill Game
But I don't mind dyin' if it's gon' bring real change

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosius]
Say hi to the sky, now it's your turn to fly
Still we cry (Still we cry)
I wish I could have protected you there
Just say hi to the sky, now it's your turn to fly
Still we cry, cry, cry
Still we cry, yeah
Cry, cry, I cry
Didn't wanna write this song

Squashed it man, been there done that
Somebody had to gon' on and fuck it up

No more Bleek and Buddens I was hopin' for silence
Till the little sleeping beauty, went and woke the giant
This little bitch from The Luniz want beef he liein'
So I called E-40, and tried to seize the violence
I got niggaz on the island, for puttin' in stainless work
With vaseline on they palms, gettin' ready to +Bang Em Smurf+ (you little bitch)
I here him screamin' in Compton, sound like my bitch cummin'
You wasn't never fuckin' with G-Unit, quit frontin'
For domination be Lisa Leslie, a big woman
With a nine on the back, I'm gonna catch that bitch runnin'
Shove a .40 in his throat, now nigga spit somethin'
And get lost boy, go visit your big cousin
I got fish to fry, throw a line in the pacific
With cocaine on the hook, for this +Luniz+ ass nigga
You a bitch, how you call your self the Ice Cream Man
When Master P took your name and your ice cream van
Made 500 million, that's your homey though
Took your man hood, gave your shit to Lil'Romeo
This nigga, 5 foot 2, talkin' that big shit
You got +5 On It+? that money went to Chris Hicks
Tryin' to diss Too $hort for doin' his pimp shit
Nigga you been gitten fucked, swallowin' big dicks
Pac knew he was a pussy, that's why he ran south
Signed to Rap-A-Lot, they never put his ass out
Hid behind Lil' J, all the sudden you thugged out
Ran back to the Bay, sleepin' on wannabe 'cause couch
How you drop 5 albums, don't own one house
Or get the boss to call me, Banks, and fuck out
It's G-Unit bitch, let me show you what blood bout
When my blood pressure rise, I bring the bloods out
Put the barrell on his neck, blow his guts out (*gunshot)
Now that's what's you call a +Yukmouth+

Yeah, you little faggot ass bitch
Yeah nigga, on the motherfuckin' internet with that faggot ass footage nigga
You little bitch ass nigga, Domination, nigga

See how you like when it's motherfuckin' 50 Cal, nigga
Blow your motherfuckin' brains out nigga, i'll braid your hair you little bitch

And when I catch you nigga, you gonna need Dr.Dre to get my motherfuckin' G-6 out you ass
You bitch, you faggot ass nigga, and don't try to turn the Bay 'gainst me nigga

Rolling with this one and that one

Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede

Cuz I like girls that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me

[Tyga]
It's funny when b-tches be runnin' around actin' silly
Now they wanna show me titty, cuz I'm partying with Diddy now
Money aint a thing you could ask my n-gga Game
LA still the same but these hoes, done change
Champagne bottles in both hands
Rose don't spill the whole thang
Girls swallow, blow like Chicago
N-gga get mad, uh, gun, throat, hollow
Dummy, aint nothin' young but the money
Got plenty girls you could take some from me
Ice in the bucket, keep the drinks comin'
All the girls love me love me
They love me, especially... 

[Chorus - Tyga]
My birthday girls, big booty girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls, that like other girls
I like girls and they all like me
She dancin' on her, she dancin' on me
It feels so good, I'll buy another drink
Cuz I like girls that like other girls

Yea bitch you niggas know what it is with me nigga
Dirty south in this muthafucker
Young Buck nigga you know where I'm from Ca$hville nigga
[Get money]Make sure you put a dollar sign on the S too bitch

[Damn...]


[Verse]
[Young Buck]
Bulletwounds and tattoos is how I show my pain
I'm gone so much my little girl don't know my name
My palms covered in residue from cocaine
Been on the block since 6 in the morning
The neighbors complain about the traffic at my house (Fuck y'all)
When they need to borrow something they put their hands out
Little kids start running when they see my car coming
Just looking at me will make a nigga start hustlin
I ain't a start nothing I just know how to count
Know how to eyeball an 8ball you wearin em out
Lips black from the blunt of that sour diesel and the desert eagle [Im so illegal]
I can't even feed you what they put in the needles
Amsterdam got me thinking marijuana is legal
You can call me country but don't call me broke (Why)
We got all this money 50 where ya wanna go c'mon nigga


[Chorus]
[Young Buck]

Shit ain't really all good but I luv da hood
All I need is my weed I luv da hood
We ain't living like we should but I luv da hood
But they still Tennekee yea I luv da hood
Shit ain't really all good but I luv da hood
All I need is my weed I luv da hood

[Verse]
[Game]
They say can remember Whoo Kid let it ride
Fuckin wit G-Unit I let the Desert fly (gunshot)
Ridin through Ca$hville wit Buck throwin my dubs up
For those who don't know that stand for west side
I blast on my enemies
Fuck you if you ain't kinnin me
Knock your top off like Kennedy
Then sip hennesy
Ridin through Tennessee
If you need coke Young Buck got the remedies
I got it for 9 5 if you wanna fly
Put em in a Range Rover if you wanna drive
If you only need 1 you ain't gotta come
I just pack it up and strap it to a bitch' thigh
You ever seen a Impala drive
Seen hollows fly
Seen yellow tape everytime
Its a homoside
When it's drama I pull the glock from my waist
Niggas tried to make my mama cry

It's G-Unit nigga
You better recognize
I'll put you in the grave for that shit that Joe Budden Tried

I remember right there when my brother died
Then 2pac, Biggie Smalls and some other guys
So me and my homies ride
With a chrome .45 in my lap and my waist an the double 9's
Niggas tried to kill me but it wasn't time
I took 5 shots from my own brother' 9
Went into a coma woke up in the hospital
Cops said they found drugs
I said it wasn't mine
Bad boy but I wouldn't shine
Matter fact wouldn't shit
Thought that 'cause I wouldn't sign
Now its G Unit Nigga read between the lines Bitch



[Chorus]
[Young Buck]

Shit ain't really all good but I luv da hood
All I need is my weed I luv da hood
We ain't living like we should but I luv da hood

Baking soda and a Triple Beam, I remember
Loaded fully auto-magazine, I remember

I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names, but if you
Put that pussy right up in my face, I remember, the way she put it down
On the flo', I remember, the way she bring it down on the pole, I remember

[Verse 1: Game]
Pop the pussy don't play with it, I don't care if Kanye hit it
I don't care if Jay hit it, I'mma eat it up and I'mma lay wit' it
We shot a choppa' at the gun range, got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang, got a off-white Porsche, c** stain
I'm whippin' work (I remember), Roll up that Purp' (I remember)
Po' up that surp, (I don't remember) How Tunechi had that purple slushie
Comin' out that blender
Got a Keisha, got a Ronda, got a Neisha, got a Tanya, got a Teisha
And had a Honda, and I eat her Anaconda
Got condomds in that condo, got kush greener than Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow, You already know

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Got a Rolls Royce, got a black Benz, Got a bad bitch, with some bad friends
She bring em' through and I fuck them, but I don't fuck with them in public
Got random bitches just walkin' up, they be like ""Do you remember us?""
She show me that tat, on her ass, and I be like ""I remember""
Chop it up, like a blender, I fuck then I befriend her
Got a red bitch call her Ginger, ass and Cash on my agenda
You buy the bitch, we rent her, she took the cash and I sent her
That pussy prolly' so tight, callin that shit 'Illegal Tender'
(Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up), That's a young nigga dinner
Fish eyes to a fuckin' Lion, that's Visene, nigga never cry
We the young niggas wild'n out, talkin' shit to niggas that's 35

I'm riding through your neighborhood with my stainless,
Yayo I'm Outside your place,
If I can't get you I'm fucking Lloyd Banks up,
You know nigga look at my face

I told you not to mess with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase,
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe,
You told us that Ja rule was a wanksta
Yayo I'm Outside your place,
Now the whole G-unit camp is in danger
It's The Game, nigga look at my face,

(1st verse)
First things first motherfucka, stop tellin them lies,
It's easy to stretch the truth now that homo died,
In front of your grandma's house, right outside,
Nigga ran up on yo' shit and let off nine,
And fifty knows homocide let off nine,
You ain't die 'cause you only got shot 3 times,
1 in the jaw, two in's and out's,
He was screaming that'shy they knocked his teeth out,
I've seen your medical reports you phony homie,
Look me in the eye's I tried to warn you homie,
A coward dies a thousand deaths in his vest,
I'll give you six more slug, you can add to the rest,
Till' everybody from ny wanna be from the west,
Kiss my converse bitch and take your last breath,
'cause that G-unit shit ain't gonna last,
You could sign Jesus Christ, he couldn't save your ass

(chourus 2x)

I took a trip to Connecticut, I was lurking with the Glock,
Mad 'cause Shot Money had me working with the cops,
You 5-0 nigga, that your name,
Where I come from 5-0, that's some change,
We did background, I know you moved back some things,
But he get low like Bleek when them ratchets bang,
Mase step inside the confessional booth,
You turned your back on God, the devil got you spooked,
You ain't Murder shit, you don't even got your own block,
Takin orders from a snitch, who sleep with cops,
And Little Curtis always lookin for a scam to pull,
You ain't the real Fifty Cent, you Sam the Bull,
You got shot in the mouth once you still talkin' shit,
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick has got to fit,
Now my nuts on your tonsils, my little kid is screaming G-Unot at your concert,

I never said anything, I never take anything back

[Young Buck]
Well you kinda heard me speaking
""You ain't a crip like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game""
And I was speaking on Game without knowing him
But now, you know alot of these dudes jump in the game
And they rap artists, and that's exactly what they is
But they not what they say they are when they rap it

[T. I.]
Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
They ain't runnin the damn thing with they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
It's a given, and it ain't cause what I'm doin for a livin'
It's more because of what I'm doin how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin, I'm just hurtin niggaz feelings
And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
But while the crack was in the house, the record sale went thru the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So niggaz'll come and look for you if you sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say and be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

(The Game)
Everybody wanna be the King of the West
But, they ain't runnin the damn thing in the West
That's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin they minds
Stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
My crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
And it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
So nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin drug dealin, some people say I'm a villain
Went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin millions
So watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
Cause to me, murderin wack mc's is somethin like a disease
Top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
And where I'm from, niggaz throwin up B's and C's
So make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say
And be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - impala with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king - disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech

Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown

Layed out like a drunk, on the late-late

Yeah!  What is it?  It's Young Menace, and the Game
(Hahaha, yeah) Stackin chips, G-Unit (Chuck Taylor)
Doublin down on who? (Compton's young guns)
Sacramenton's finest (Who fuckin with me?)
From Sac-Town to Compton, you dig?

[The Game]
Yo, yo, now ain't no tellin what the Game'll do, listen dawg
I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit crackin, I drop the toaster
Grab the Louis go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that, I hop out a new pink
Rolls
With the fifty-two Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy-E sold coke at
And dawg I'ma test your education
What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite
Down half the Goose then choke your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg I put in the work
Then move bags like Doony & Bert
And stuff work in the GMC, cause on my block
I'm the King of Rock like Run-D.M.C., nigga

[Chorus: Young Menace]
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah
I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah

[Young Menace]
Shhhhh.. I got a lot to say
Dawg I gotta get paid that's why I rock the lle'
And chop the lle' to push bricks through your block a day
I'll bring terror to your squad and make you rock away
Don't depend on tomorrow you can get shot today
I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay
Dawg I spit on your grave and fertilize you too
I hit 'em hard with 16 bars, flames and fumes
Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb
Go 'head and keep talkin that shit and get your life consumed
I put a hole in your chest dawg the size of the moon
Yeah you musta been talkin, how'd you get out that soon?
(You fuckin snitch!) I got a chop that'll touch yo' head like
Vidal Sassoon
You don't wanna see my platoon, I got gorillas and baboons
That won't hesitate, they gon' do what they have to
When there's beef on the streets it's on for life like tattoos

It don't matter what season, it don't matter not a day
I move traffic through the city, plus I keep the right of way
I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team mayne
Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game
Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages
I'm never doin bids because my game is so immaculate
A bitch try to snitch, ""I Can't Deny It"" like Fabolous
Before the evidence gatherin, someone's in an ambulance
Now that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut
Those with big mouths I got the perfect size nuts
Yeah I do my dirt, but I wash my hands thoroughly
Handle my business first so I can celebrate early
It's business before pleasure my business brings me pleasure
It feels good to be able to shine, in any type of weather
That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin tight
Whether I'm jukin on the block or have bitches hookin lights

And all this hennesey'll make a nigga crash the G-5
Catch me at a stop sign, niggah I ain't drunk,
I'm gangsta I pop mine leave you eye in the pump
Tie you faggot ass up, let you die in the trunk,
I'm from westside compton, niggah I ain't a punk
Streets is talkin, is he from cali? Is he from queens?
Do he ghost for P. Diddy, can he write me A sixteen?
Did he take 5 shots? Is he a blood or a crip?
Ride through the cpt, my hood painted on them bricks
And I'ma die with a empty clip, 'cause I'm a ghetto boy
I just rap a lot like J-Prince (the boss of rap a lot)

In '99 I studied +The Chronic+ inside out,
A +Doggystyle+ for breakfast, lunch was +Reasonable Doubt+
I ain't know how to count bars, I was writin' on napkins(?)
High as fuck I wrote my first sixteen to +Illmatic+
I was in the hood fightin' with niggaz, over who the best mc
Ice-Cube, Snoop Dogg or Xzibit
And how the east been makin' the killin'
Since them long-beach niggaz walked in new york and crushed the buildings
Then this marcy-project niggah came and stole the crown,
Right after the king of ny got shot down,
Ten years later I'm in Harlem killin' them mixtapes,
They like me, I want them to love me like they love Mase,
But holla in la them niggaz tell ya they hate me,
And the plan is to catch me with my gun on safety
Niggah I'm still breathin', I ain't dead,
Next time you try to kill me, put one in my head

Before Jimmy Iovine the kid wasn't iv(?),
These bitch niggaz tried to take my live for five G's,
I was in the projects, two o' clock in the mornin',
Playin' madden, niggaz kicked in the door and start blastin',
Niggah I'm a gangsta, I don't need no pitty,
I just sit inside the ferarri and roll up a fillie
And I been compared to shyne like shyne was compared to biggie,
I'm from compton, he from new york city
Come on really, you gotta be kiddin', ain't nobody biggie but biggie,
But I'm a six figi niggi, and I know Fifty,
But that don't mean I can get you backstage at awards,
Or 'cause you went to highschool I'ma take you on tour,
'cause he got two bodyguards he can't get hit with the four,
And 'cause he wear a vest don't make him tupac shakur,
When you see me in the streets, ain't no security guards,
No L. A. P. D, no bullet proof cars, I'm a gangsta!

But see true homies will stay the same

What? This nigga only sixteen
And I wanted to be, just like him, middle school fightin
Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me? Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin, just outline chalkin
Nigga Witta Attitude from birth, ""100 Miles and Running""
Gunnin bustin shots like fuck the cops

Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggaz rock

Ten shots to your spleen, let them violins sing

Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play

You niggas know who I is, what kind of car I drive
Kill a California, the door's commiting suicide
Bitches ain't fucking with you unless you in the newest ride
You know me, 5 star nigga do or die
I'm from the home of the...
East west north south, niggas getting lost in Los Angeles
We got the baddest bitches on the north campus
Nigga hopping off the Transit, straight off inside a Phantom
Stop at the liquor store, get a swisher hit the dough
Then hit the hood, ay blood what they hitting for
Whole hood tatted up, bandana white side jeans coming out
Busters leave when it's nighttime
15s in the trunk hit me 'fore they see me come
Wear 24s no need to ask where I'm from
Westside home of the perk even 12 year olds put in work
West coast got 'em bang

31 still banged out shots let 'em rank out
Walk through any crip or blood hood with his chain out
Grandmomma stay on the shore in the same house
Be on the porch Dre beats on with my thang out
That ain't a threat but little do you forget
I was 20 years old rolling up on nigga's sets
Coming straight up out the Jets, Impala sitting wet
Try me in 'em high lows coming up out the Tech
Now I'm getting money big Snoop on the techs
Andre Young on the bottom of my chest
Fresh from the fade to the bottom of my cheques
Matter of fact... Cadillac trucks
... Peanut butter guts...
Shit hit the block and post up
Then gather the crew hit childs to toast up
Hoes breaking their neck tryna see me close up

You show me love wherever I go

How you throwing a stocking cap and they ain't never cocked it back
Nigga copy that, capiche nigga
Extended clip got 1 bullet for each nigga
Ask nice and I might let you eat nigga
Let you smoke, I keep Kush in the swisher
Keep the blunts rolled up, Phantom 24'ed up
Hop out knockout hoe chest froze up
I be in the back of the club looking like so what
20 bottles 40 grand pro'ly why chose up
Now she in the... With her nose up

On the cover of The Source with my chain hanging
That was '05 still Fuck Benzino
Riding through the city with them twin benzitos
Stepping on C-Notes, rolling red dice like casinos
Throwing 'tron shots like free-throws
Tell Judas I'm alive and well
Will I be crucified only time will tell until then I'm thugging
Spend my money on whatever
Running through this cheddar as long as my crew together
Pop Ace, pop tags, pop hammers
""Thug life"" I put that on Pac's bandana
Los Angeles King, tell my niggas in the Bing
I blacked out the card and minimized the bling
Updated the Ghost, went Nas on the wig cap
And made wifey ring rocky ASAP, yea
(aha, let's go)

This right here reminds me of when
The playas had the the dope so the girls brought their friends
And every single night we did it again
We had a good time, we had a good time
In the city

I was forced to be a Farce
Diamonds in my cross that calls for me to floss
Got me exhausted
Exhaust that's on the Porsche, got me wide awake
Just make sure that my wallets caked while away
The coupe drop well
Got banana clips in the Big Apple homie fruit cocktail
Eh Game what it look like
I got the shorty and I'm playing with her chest on the corner look like a rook right
The city that never sleeps
We ain't talking bout money we proly will never speak
Lobby within a week, we generated revenue
Old heads put me on the things that I never knew
I'm big in New York word to my moms baby
And its hard to be the giant just ask Tom Brady
That's why they pay me
When you ask who the best right now that's why they say me

Red Rose, white cellar
No body, no casket, just blood spillin'
I aint a dead President but I love millions
They like ""Game, where ya been?""
Yeh Blood chillin'
But not on no islands or no villa's
I've been lost in Compton with some drug dealers
I bought the Relapse loved it, hit the block hugged it
Em still spit crack the Aftermath oven is a muthaf-cker
But I aint seen it in years
Still survive like niggas threw me off the first tier
Still the most gutta, spit the most butta
My album's got more game than niggas at the Rucker
Who said I'll never go Platinum, never drop a Phantom
I park my shit at every strip club in Atlanta
Peace to my nigga T.I. for keeping a level head
Niggas I know flip after doing bids in the feds
So peace to C-Murder, come to my hood see murder
Aint a street in my city that you aint heard of
Bought up on the block, no love, black glocks, chrome slugs
And we all fit OJ's glove
And I'ma keep name droppin' long as my name poppin'
I mean long as the 'cane poppin'
All white knights, white Range, white pipes, crack in the concrete
Living the?
I switch cars like superhead switch stars
You know why, cause I'm a crook bitch
F-ck ya book bitch
I live life like aint no money on my books bitch
I write the 16, you sing on the hook bitch

Same colour as the big apple
It's for my New York niggas that's in the hood clappin'
I done been through Brooklyn, Queens, BX and Harlem
Only chase money, never chase the stardom
Back to the law, that's how I became a target
Respected in every hood, bullet proof regardless
My glock got no feelings, hollows leave you heartless
Retaliation like tryna swim in the shark pit
Will I ever go at Nas, hell no
Will I ever go at Jay, I don't know
Stay hittin em with pot shots
Ridin' round tryna figure out who got Pac shot
Cause that got BIG shot, nigga's try to take out LA like big shot
That's Chauncey Billups, for you niggas who don't understand it
You rap niggas like bitches, pitching underhanded
It's like throwin soft balls at Derek Jeter
I keep it hood, never put money in parking meters
Like the f-ck the US government
I be on some over shit
28 inch rims rubber shit
Roll down the window f-ck with this
Roll up the endo, f-ck with this
Get it backward, yeah my shit that good
No more medical weed, back to chronic

Or hit 'em up close, let 'em know that I'm a f-cking killer
Like Ghost-face, no trace for the jakes

Nas was like U-God, I'm like ""nah you God"", right next to Rza as I'm
Lighting up the swisha
Pourin' out this liquor for my niggas that was bigger than the ditches that
They living
That was put in by the triggers, they some niggas with some cold hearts
And you wonder why I walk around like my soul long, black hoody on
Writin' music like Mozart, Denzel, John Travolta, I play both parts
Drive this raggedy ass Bentely like it's a go-kart
Aint been crazy since I learned how to throw dart
Run up on his muthaf-cking car, you a dead man
Nah, don't sweat it like Lebron James headband
Empty out the clip on anybody but Redman

Everybody know that I'm the aire to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gonna turn down a 38 snub

Turn on the TV and all you see is the A
You niggaz better make up a dance and try and get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit cause I know what I say
And niggaz talking bout me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuiton beltbuckle holding the glock
No bean, no silencer, I know when to pop
Wait til Lil' Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number 1 billboard spot

Straight outta Compton, Chuck Taylor in Brooklyn 8 deep
And the Desert Storm blew in Ghetto F-A-B
The only difference between us
Is the coast and the length of the ninas
And the rainbow paint on the beamers
Out here they call me ""All Star Game""
And every nigga with a gun is waiting on the '04 All Star Game
So while you in the Staples parking lot
I'm watchin the corners, with the safety on like Ronnie Lott

Straight outta Brooklyn it's the same youngan
Slangin that same onion
Smokin that Cali bud that my nigga Game brung in
I keep a dame tongue on my dick
The chain huggin my dick
The cane brung by the brick, it's ghetto!
The fiends sprung on me quick
But I still got 20s of dope that'll have yo brain strung on a fix
These haters can't stop the rock I pushes
Cause a nigga move around with more arms than them octipusses, nigga

I got a winchester that will turn your vest into confeddi
I'm Chuck Taylor, the same nigga that put the 6-4 in Chevy
It's the same nigga that keep the. 44 in the Chevy
With no stash spot, when you in Compton ask coppers
If that Aston Martin's the same color as grass hoppers
I'm runnin the rock, not J, Dame Dash of Hoffa
So when you in Compton, you know who to ask for
That 21 year old young gun with bricks in the Jaguar, nigga

The kid push Bentley exaust thru
And if you see my guns you would think Bush sent me to war too
Even with chicks beggin me for dick regularly
A nigga known for gettin rid of weight like dick Gregory
I'm New York City's fly guy, you bums don't impress me
I already got the lead waitin for someone to test me
You don't wanna be in the news
Cause when I'm lookin for you
Not even Bin Laden wanna be in your shoes, nigga

Every ghetto in America, I know that niggaz lettin clips fly
So I keep that in mind when I'm out in the N-Y
Niggaz see the Aftermath chain they like f... 50
Cause we flyin thru Queens in that Ferarri F-50
Bitches see me in the video, wanna have s** with me
So keep a box of Magnums and a bag of X with me
Keep A. 38 Magnum stashed in the vette with me
And it's 'fuck yo life' if you ain't signin check with me

Nigga I'm eatin, and you be snackin like you on a diet
That's why you window shoppin actin like you wanna buy it
Actin like you gonna roit, like you gonna shoot
When in fact you gone be quiet, like you on mute
That's proof, you a punk, and you lucky
There ain't enough room to fit a nigga in my roof or the trunk
I got a box to quickly hide the gun
You shouldn't move if you seen Boyz N The Hood
And when Ricky tried to run

Niggaz know when them hollows airin
I'll turn your Antoine Walker into a throwback Robert Parrish
With 2 holes under the Celtic
And you will think your 'Boston Warm-Up' jacket hot
Till the desert eagle melt it
I'm a gangsta, and the birds, they love it
20 with a baby face, and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
If you can't afford the new Bentley, fuck it!
Copp yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage

In my hood the slower you move, the quicker they get you
Sometimes it's somebody in your click that be with you
That's why my vest is thicker to get thru
And I keep 2 nines on my shirt like Dickersons shit do
Why waste my breath when I'm bickering with you
I'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you
You sick cause my shit blew
And you ain't goin' nowhere for a while
A commercial where Snickers will fit you, fucka!

Ain't nothin but a gangsta party when I'm spittin to Pac
The paint fall off your Miskeen when I'm spittin the Glock
Before I was 16, I was liftin the drop
Spittin on cops, pitchin the rock
Like Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks
Now you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab
On a New York bench, while you old niggaz in rehab
And if I can't be a hip-hop legend, I'll just die in a ski-mask

[Fabolous]
When a gangsta like me ride
It be suede in it, be shades in it
Tires that got the rims that Spree made in it
1 of the prettiest hoes be laid in it
Blowin the kid faster than pre-paid minutes
And I'm guessin these haters

Steady postin’ ‘bout her head

Got me clingin’ to my daughter like shark fins and water rocks

This my life and it’s exactly how I planned it, damn it

Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers around greasers make it cohesive

Draw closer to a true blood leader
Soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up
Knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
The sacrifices we made is sort of Christ-like
At the after party thinkin’ what the after life’s like
He paid for our sins, is it really price right?
Fuck it, I see the light
Broads, they see the light
Can’t deny my Jesus piece that’s so Peter-like

Another Jane Doe or a golden angel?
Pending on the angle, watch the chain glow

Listening to this Big Sean like, ""oh shit!""
My lil nigga Kendrick kills you on your own shit
But I fuck with Sean
It's just Compton, nigga
I helped him get his Jesus piece back from the mobsters, nigga!
I've been the middle man for rap niggas and jury niggas
Ask me find that shit like I'm motherfuckin Siri
iPhone, ass nigga! Five homes, yes nigga!
New coupe slide back with the roof
Hunned 80 proof, gotta throw it back to proof
Air Jordan Ones, North Carolina
I'm killing these bitches like Ray Keruf
They salute like soldiers, nigga
Give, yo game up like soldiers, nigga
Treat em like lawn chairs, throw them nigga
Still got the West Coast on my shoulders, nigga
Keep to the city, that polices is watching
A hundred thousand on funerals
Bitches calling me Robin
Cause I'm a hood nigga, doing good, nigga!
I'm God's favorite, I wish you would nigga!

The Game,Justo Tribute,/t/the+game/justo+tribute_20676573.html,"[Justo:]
What up? I be the one they call Justo if you didn't know
Trying to check my man dj Skee with his new mix-tape
Pick it up you square, you heard what I'm said?

[The Game:]
It's another sad day in Hip-Hop
We lost another one of our brothers, Justo Faison
We love you, and we'll always miss you
Mix-Tape King, forever

[Chorus:]
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo

[Verse 1:]
I picked up my pen four years from the date
Never thought I'd be rapping, and be signed to Dre
Never been to New York, I had to find a way
So I dropped 40 bars on the Clue mix-tape
On the Birdman beat, then my name started buzzing
Aftermath's young gun, and now everybody love him
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's little brother
He took me to Kay Slay, and Slay put me on the cover
Drama King, I should of known, 'cause all of the sudden
Mc's calling my name and I'm beefing with Joe Budden
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colors
Then caught him at Def Jam and found out, it was nothing
Looked back at my career, staring out at the City
Thinking about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy
If I was signed to Bad Boy, would 50 be on the Math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow
And sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show
Spit over 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host
That's when they start showing me love on the east coast
Then more people found out I was with Dre
And at bodegas I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix-tapes
I'm workin' on my album and the world can't wait
Cover of the Vibe, and I ain't even have a release date
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five
Went to Houston's and that's the first time I met Nas
Had Billboard with me and two months later he died
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th
When the Documentary dropped, it flooded the streets
My mix-tape buzz made me gold the first week
Double platinum in two months
Record labels getting' scared
Cause the kid from Compton selling like Sunny and Cher
Mix-Tape awards came around, glad I was there
To get my award, Mix-Tape Artist of the Year
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know
You might as well crown him the new kind of the West Coast
A couple of months passed we ain't speak
My Sidekick went off ""Justo Rest in Peace""
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo
They say the good die young, if you know like I know
Live your life to the fullest one day we all gotta go

[The Game:]
Give a moment of silence
If you're wearing a Fitted Cap take it off
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road
We lost an underground legend
Justo Faison
Mix-tape King
Rest in Peace"

How everytime I drop an album one of my n-ggas get killed
Make a n-gga wanna stop spittin'
Plus Interscope be bullshittin' Scott Pippen
This is not livin'
Livin' is when you working a 9-5
Liftin' heavy ass boxes just to stay a-f-cking-live
N-gga aint got a car but he got drive
So he appreciate the rims sittin on his ride
The world going crazy, n-ggas going crazy
They say the Illuminati affiliated Jay-Z
I'm in this Mercedes seeing how L.A be
My life should be a movie shot by Martin Scorsese
Gun's off safety n-ggas is Polamalu
The cops killed BIG and drove off in the Impala
And Pac did biz? just to get a couple dollars
F-ck rap, I shoulda took my black ass to college

I'm just tryna be real
I'm just keepin' it real
I'm just tryna be real
I'm just keepin' it real

I'm tryna see my kids through college before I gotta die
Still sayin' R.I.P Aaliyah 'fore I gotta fly
N-ggas running out of time
So they doing homocide
Gotta take the stand tell the judge and jury their alibi
And they all racist so they giving boys 25
Stand up be a man, and stare straight into his momma eyes
And she still traumatised, her baby boy shot up
Kissed him on the forehead right before he got up
You shot him in the forehead twice before he got up
All over a bitch, n-gga the devil wears Prada
Amber Rose wears nada
And that's how she should keep it
'Cause you can go Tyra from wearing Victoria's Secrets
They say there's a secret society
To get notoriety from selling your soul to 'em
N-gga you aint buying me
Only thing for sale is this Phantom
It's Aftermath, that's why I rep the A like Atlanta

[Hook]

They say I look like Kanye or Wale in this Louie napsack
Rather be them than them dumb n-ggas f-cking with Kat Stacks
I smoke kush to get my mind right
I used to listen to Nas to get my rhymes tight
I used to sell them dimes and keep my 9 tight
But now I'm f-cking them dimes, but in hindsight
Almost turned on my family for the limelight
And I'mma go see God when the times right
They say the purly gates white but my President black
My money green, the sky blue and that's where heaven is at
I don't carry a gat, but my n-ggas do
It's like my jumper is off, I let my n-ggas shoot
And don't none of my n-ggas do
Take the time to listen
I'll tell you what my n-ggas do
Scream Suwoo while they dumping out of billy coupes?
But I'm just tryna be a good n-gga, master
And take this rap money and give this shit to the Pastor

[Verse 1: Game]
Operation kill everything, kill everything
Married to myself, fuck a wedding ring
Tried that shit twice, gave that girl everything
She a good woman, she got good goals
Love her to death but can't be in that fishbowl
Niggas gotta live and what the fuck does it matter if I take care of my kids
I got three of them little niggas
And every time they smile I see me in them little niggas
I get my heart I get my soul and nobody fucking with me till Harlem 20 years old
And that day I'm gon' retire, look back at my career
Like I started from the bottom, Now I'm mofuckin' here
Look back at my career like I started-
Started to do something, shit I've been working out for two summers
In the gym I pile on cruel summer
When everybody dope in your clique you do numbers
But I ain't got no clique
Still got the same cars, and broads sucking my dick
Still fuck the same stars that (uh) up in my six
Still finding old panties and broads up in my whip
This bitch got my dick hard as Roc Nation
That's like Cole and Hov at a show keeping fans waiting
And you know they ain't go do that
Girl go and do that
Guess it's time to turn up
I got a whole lot of marijuana to burn up
And I ain't mean to make you stop
But it ain't a party without aquahydrate and Ciroc so

Hey yo, what up Game
What's up, it's your boy Diddy man
I'm just gettin' back from Vegas
Yeah man, party was off the chain
Well, I'm back in sunny California
And it never rains in southern california
Yeah yeah all that man
So I decided to throw this white party man
So I'm up at the mansion right now
I just emptied out the pool, filled it up with aquahydrate
So you know when the chick is in the pool, they correctly balanced
And also, we got the Ciroc fountains overflowin'
Blue dot, red dot, white dot
Man I want you to come and bring the whole crew
Bring that west coast love, the all white party man
And we goin' leave colors at home, I know you wanna wear all red man
But you gotta wear all white to this one man
And tell Snoop that too, he gotta wear all white to this one man
I see ya'll at the white party at the mansion man
Hey yo, let's get it
Love
Hey yo, Tuck for real, wear all white

[Verse 2: Game]
I guess we going to Diddy's
It ain't a party without the king of the fucking city
Handsome ass nigga these bitches are fucking with me
Woke up in that new Bugatti these pigs ain't fuckin' with me
I'm like Dr. J with his from
Something like [?] with the blow
Pumping [?] I got it just so you know
[?] zipping up all this dough
Summer nights we at toxic with all these hoes
Then we back at the mansion take off them clothes
I let my niggas hit it first I'm in and out
Just as fast as niggas spit a verse then they out
Then I'm back to the booth
Rollin' up sipping something 80 proof
And I dont chase the liquor or these hoes
Heard Jordan got some new shit out, [?] order those
Just bought me a ghost like where the Rolls
[?] club with all my bros
Can't get none of my bitches to get these hoes
Plus I sit back and still get paid like Derrick Rose

The Game,Life Is But A Dream,/t/the+game/life+is+but+a+dream_21070107.html,"[Intro: Martin Luther King Speech]
I am happy to join with you today
And what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation

[Verse 1]
So it seems I’m lost
In between exotic cars and fiends
Palms hella itchy, baby mama bitchy
Dish washer broke cuz them pots too sticky
Snap back to the back cause I got that crack
And I’m from that city
Where even if dubs is packing they strap Beats on
They don't hear that rap, shit
Unless it’s Y.G or Problem
Then them bitches turn up ASAP like they went to school in Harlem
But they know they from Compton
Yea they know they from Compton
Where we put bass with the head before Dre was with Monster
We pulled guns on niggas 'fore we ever play Contra
Turned contra into bands and that make them hoes dance so
Let that bitch breathe before she take yo kids
And you be forced to watch that bitch leave
And that’s every nigga’s situation
In a town where them gang signs go up
And them bitches going down

[Hook: Elijah Blake and Game]
Life is a but a dream
I’m searching for a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is everything but a dream

[Interlude: Martin Luther King]
A great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free

[Verse 2]
Niggas rock two chains and one star, I seen these niggas runnin
Them ain’t yo niggas no more ‘cause I got mine's comin
You take a nigga jewels and act like you done did something
We take a nigga life and act like we ain’t did nothing
And all of this is at the push of a button
I got niggas bustin' simply because they ribs touchin'
No we ain’t tryna work at Mickey D's
Niggas is tryin to put that six on Ds
And flip one of them Bentley keys
Hood niggas that only wanna be hood rich
Stack a hundred thousand in the safe and wife a good bitch
Cop a Gucci belt, maybe Louis too
Line a Challenger with that Camaro and see what it do
Hit toxic ‘cause we got a fit and can't wasted it
It’s hot as fuck but at least we can see these hoes’ faces
Ask Drama what that shit do
Every time he hit the city give him a couple hoes and a pistol
‘Cause I, I hold my niggas down
I said I, I hold my niggas down
Yea I hold my niggas down
And the day I go out this is Kendrick’s crown

[Outro]
No, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is everything but a dream"

June 30th, 11: 07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 2: The Game]

They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11: 32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was lamaze class, breathe baby
""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11: 46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell ? I just cut the umbilical cord""
11: 57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 3: The Game]

I wanna thank Dr. ? And Nurse there'sa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle?, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

Walkin' down the street, and ma allstarz,
In ma khaki suit, doin what I do
Walkin' down the street, smokin chronic,
In ma black lotus, lookin' at you

Guess who's back on the west coast tracks,
Its the mother fucking messiah and gangsta raps,
Still dippin the 6-4, still puffin on the same chronic,
Haters mad 'cause I still got it
I never fall off even without the doc'
You niggas sellin your soul tryin to stay on top,
Bitch nigga checkin kotex,
You niggas aint movin shit like the hand on a fake ass rollex

I'm 5 million sold the cover of my last album
The only time you see me sittin on gold
I'm the most anticipated, the most celebrated
The most loved and the mother fuckin most hated,
Keep rollin like gold daytons
Niggas got the game fucked up like Henessey with a coke chaser,
You gotta deal with me I'm the west coast savior
Niggas think of me everytime they 6-4 scrape,
What do you call a nigga whose older,
Parady, belligerance, foul defined,
And very disrespectful, you call that nigga a doctor's advocate,
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his hey day in the worst way,
The 5 star surgeon / general took Jayson
To the aftermath research department,
And gave 'em a blood test, that came back G-A-M-E positive,
The niggas infected with the game virus,
His oraltorical skills are so impeckable, that niggas in the street call him Sirus,
The young damu is down with violence cause in his heart he's a tyrant
Its not a game, it's just called the game,
There will be no referee, no half time report,
When the game is over, the game is over,
You can't put a quarter in the machine and get 3 more men,
That's the end

Walkin' down the street, and my allstarz,
In my khaki suit, doin what I do
Walkin' down the street, smokin chronic,
In ma black lotus, lookin' at you

I'd of been to hell and back, left for dead, you know who to thank for that,
Finished my second lp without a Dr. Dre track,
You can take my soul but you can't take my plaques,
I'm the mother fuckin' snair when you touch the beat,
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet,
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-are-E,
Product of my enviorment you old ass niggas get ready for your early retirement,
Before I let hip-hop burn down I'll run in the buildin like a fireman
Who can out spit me when I'm high off sticky,
Throwin back Patrone shots in some creased up dickies
I'm D. O. C certified, ice cube lenched me, snoop stamped me and the good doc hand picked me,
You still wit me? Me and my mic can't be separated like interscope and...(haha)

I get drunk, but I ain't never smoke no wet
Been on tour 3 months and I aint had no sex
Been meditating, exercising my mental bowflex
Michael Jackson dead, which one of us 'bout to go next
Me, Mary J, Robin Thicke or Britney Spears
Nigga I ain't afraid to die, tell the devil I'm right here
Hoe, I can take the strings out of these Nike airs
Tie it round the ceiling fan and end it right here
Kick the ladder cause I climbed that twice
Hate it or love it, I'm one blood nigga, it's my life
And I can die if I want to, and mama you can cry if you want to
Just tell my sons the truth and as the maggots eat away at my flesh
Let this iced out cross, walk through the bones in my chest

Hit you with the switch blade
Then she ran but I ain't know which way, she ended up in Vegas doing
Everything her pimp say

Bought her shades with my last five, 
My little sister is a prostitute, and I'ma tell you what I'm about to do.
Go get her cause she... (lost)

On my way to Michigan, not to see D12
I'm knocking on every door, ""have you seen this female?""
Here's a picture of my pretty baby sister
Here go one when she was ten and this one our last Christmas
Low light skinned girl, long curly black hair, sorry for wasting time, I
Know you probably don't care, 
Feel like I walk longer than just 8 miles
Ran into a borded up BMF safe house
Made me think about all the time I spent with Meech makin' it rain in Magic

Now life is a rotton apple
Run faster than New York

She was looking for me, pulled up in that Old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed...
But I use that still cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing
My papa smoking sherm blunts and
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat! Tat! My. 45 knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this, Pharrell, drop the instrumental

[Pharrell:]
Yezzir...

[Hook: Nelly Furtado]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still don't know where we all came from

[Verse 2: Game]
Crack a Swisher, crack a 5th up
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Moms working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid N Play type
Didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me
Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up in sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's song, going around the hood serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like ""here hug em ma, one last time""
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

[Hook: Nelly Furtado]

[Verse 3: Game]
Put your block down, recognize a king cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never! She carried me for 9 months so she can have whatever
Plus she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So rip to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like ""how come? ""
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, hey playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a Sidekick?"

Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire and drain all his f-ckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a f-ckin' train
Sniff a f-cking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook... And just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. The crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanco on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight p-ssy!

A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and f-cking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
I suck? Where the f-ckin Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolfgang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (F-ck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherf-cking teresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost

I do cause Tunechi always bless me
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
F-ck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I f-cked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking her p-ssy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delante West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, f-ck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you

Ohhh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime

(Game-Verse 1)
I'm sitting in my Ghost, I don't know what to do
What I know is I'm at my best when I fuck with you
I always thought we'd kinda just end up like the huxtables
Thought our love was like Swizz and Alicia, untouchable
Thought we always had that Jay and B potential
And ever since we've been apart everything is an instrumental
And I can't even hear the words to my favorite song I'm so numb inside
Miss you telling me boy I'm ovulating so just c** inside
I'm kinda torn between what I want and What I know
That's why sometimes after the kids fall asleep I get up and go
Used to chase me down the hallway acting like you on Broadway
Hop in your Benz, tailing my Range trying to jump out where that broad stay
And that was crazy but at least I know you care
That was then this is now how the fuck we end up here
Now we care about our instagram posts more than each other
Post some subliminal shit like we ain't never met each other, that's crazy

[Chorus:]
Oh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime

(Game- Verse 2)
We spent the last 24 months arguing over these broads
That we forgot about the show and then Cali became the star
And maybe that was a blessing
Cause she could grow up to be Raven-Symone
In our discretion, I'd be right there for protection
These days my kids the only place to get affection
Could be wrong, you the school teacher maybe I just need correction
You Used to be the one to point a nigga in the right direction
Now we both inside graced on sitting in different sections
Pretending we had no fun
All I really wanna do is get you to that sls and fuck you til you see the sun
Maybe I wouldn't feel so bad every time I see my son
He ask am I coming home
And I tell him to go ask his mom
And shit get real hard cause I can't live without my daughter
Why can't you just be Beyonce and try to ride for Sean Carter
You know I love my Kids and can't no nigga replace their father
This could be a love story, you the author, Write

[Chorus:]
Oh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime"

All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore
Fuck the police, they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for
My money or my Glock, who do I trust more?
I don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green, cause paper motivate niggas
And my Rolex racist cause it hate niggas
I used to only sell 8's like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24's like I play at the Staples Center

Running from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watching colors chasing after my older brothers
Cause they was always sending shit with me we had different brothers
Playing football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kicking back making money cause the crack fiend
Was always there so I start selling that cane cause nobody never cared

Taking care of my sisters cause my daddy wouldn't...

Open the refrigerator like where did the food go?

Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

Laying here staring at this doggy style poster on my wall
... Spinning this basketball, what the fuck is going on?
Ain't a niggaare here, all of my homies gone to jail, or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was 19, chasing in pipe dreams
Cause... Bullet for chilling, that was a nice scene
Like the movies, niggers acting fool, when you pushing the beemer
Who gives a fuck about the school?
Mom's out of... But I was breaking all the rules
Kicked a niggaare out the house so I started forming my crew
Getting a little bigger on my own, in the 12 grade creeps scheming on me
Cause they know my trap cell mate, trying to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower, that's...
Paying no... But keep my chrome too the end of time
Feeling like no niggaare can see me I think they're going blind

Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah

Showing the little homie how to use a fucking gun
Now look what I become, niggaare is on the run
From the cops, the slums, the right, like father like son
But I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a niggaare getting paid
Pouring down rose for my niggers in the grave
My niggaare big wheel and my homie p
Feel like yesterday we was running in the streets
And I swear to god funny how the time fly
And the only thing certain that we all die
So let your soul fly

How we follow the path of the hero.

Boast about the day when the rivers overrun,
How we'll rise to the height of our halo.

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,
Our way into the arms of the savior.
Fading all the trials and the tribulations.

None of us have actually been there,
Not like you...

The ignorant fibbers in the congregation.
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Spare me...

None of them can even hold a candle up to you.
Blinded by choices,
Hypocrites won't see.

But enough about the collective Judas.
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated?
Your little piece of the divine.

This little light of mine it gives your past unto me,
I'm gonna let it shine
To guide you safely on your way.

Your way home...

Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun?
Other than tremble incessantly.

High is the way,
But our eyes are upon the ground.
You are the light and the way.
They'll only read about.
I only pray heaven knows,
When to lift you out.

10,000 days in the fire is long enough.
You're going home...

You're the only one who can hold your head up high.
Shake your fist at the gates saying,
""I have come home now...!""
Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father.
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.

""It's time now!
My time now!
Give me my
Give me my wings...!""

Give me my [x5]

(Give me my wings)

You are the light, the way,
That they will only read about.

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers.
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Judith Marie, unconditional one.

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this bold suggestion.
Should you see your maker's face tonight,
Look him in the eye.
Look him in the eye and tell him,
I never lived a lie, never took a life,
But surely saved one.

Hallelujah
It's time for you to bring me home."

That made blue be your color.
You had your knife with you there too.
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes.
Your hands were sticky.
You wiped them on your grass,
So now your color was green.
Oh Lord, why did everything always have
To keep changing like this?
You were already getting nervous again.
Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.
Your head was almost empty.
It always hurt you when you woke up like this.
You crawled up out of your ditch unto your gravel road
And you began to walk
And waited for the rest of your mind to come back to you.
You could see the car parked far down the road
And you walked toward it.
If God is our father, you thought,
Then Satan must be our cousin.
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?
When you got to your car,
You tried all the doors,
But they were locked.
It was a red car and it was new.
There was an expensive leather camera case lying on the seat.
Out across your field
You could see two tiny people walking by your woods.
You began to walk towards them.
Now red was your color and of course,
Those little people out there were yours too."

""I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone and the symbol on you.  So he bashes his skull through the window while over looking the sea.  Twilight amber ego.  We were amused by this""

Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way, with
Someone who would die for me.

Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin lie.

Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you step out of line.
Don't you fuckin lie.

You've claimed all this time that you would die for me.
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own
Eulogy?

He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.
He had a lot to say.
He had a lot of nothing to say.

Come down.
Get off your fuckin cross.
We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr.

To ascend you must die.
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies.

Why your heart is just a stabbing
Bloody eyes can't describe
The nature of your hacking
Back to front the blade tastes blunt
In the safety of your bedroom
No desire to touch the fire
It's just a just a sad obsession

Recalling all of those times.

Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again
You get nothing for nothing: expect it when
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel
It's easy to go along with the crowd,
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing

So I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall!

You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your bidding
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go
If you get it wrong, at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together!

And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall!

On the highway! On the highway!

Making a curve or taking the strain
On the decline, or ut on the wain
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend.
Back on your feet to take the next bend!
You weather every storm that's coming atcha!

And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway,
I got nothing to lose at all.

The moon tells me a secret, her confidant

She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her we are lifeless satellites drifting

And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here serving my narcissism
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

Before I pine away...

And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical

Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun.
I stick my hand into his shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand.
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been.
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes look so familiar.
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song...

So good to see you.

So glad it's over.

When someone passes away...
Either a star is born,
Energy so pure,
That it creates new worlds...
Or as the soul releases,
Shatters into peices,
Becoming free flowing thoughts,
From a mental thesis...
Maybe we just don't understand,
Spirits, can still walk the land,
Or whatever the case, I believe,
That we all still remain to share the same space...

Cleanse my soul,

I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge 2 be sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone

Bridge:
When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much see cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Chorus:
Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the paddywagon cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Screamin' loud and holdin' sheets
Scared that you'll be called a freak
Gotta let it go while you can
Ain't 2 proud 2 beg you see
Cause my man belongs 2 me
And I know that he understands

Bridge

Chorus

Yo left eye kick that rap

Realize the realism of reality treats
Us both the same
Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words lets refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' da waterbed
Yeah I like it when you (kiss)
Both sets of lips
Oooh on the tlc tip

I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (I ain't 2 proud 2 beg)
What I call my own
Just you and me (uh)
Heyyyyyyyy

Ladies and gentlemen
It's the adventures
Of Left Eye

Respect just as one
The request from the Left Eye
I need a dose or maybe two only to get behind
But I'm not speakin' in terms of drugs you see
I'm talkin' you and me with this temporary insanity
Please baby I say baby four more times
And then please breakin' it down
I start with P-L and you end it with Ease
It's not hard you see
But taken literally
That is exactly what I want it to be
Cuz if I need it need it need it in the middle
The middle the madiddle of breakfast
Stop and correct this
I broke somethin' that need ta be fixed
Got no time to be wastin' when we admitted into the remix
Take it that you're steppin' to a start that is slow
Instead of me and my left lip you'll blow
And right at the left one it's wet as a fountain
Speed it up G with 3 minutes and countin'

Chorus:
Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the paddywagon cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

For me to beg it is nothin' nothin' but a sixth sense
The other five is aidin' me in helpin' me to dispense
Cuz seein's believin' when seein is what I saw
If it's wrong let the left hand commence
To touch what such great thing lies ahead of G
Tempted enough I taste till it comes back to me
Movin' up to rock the boat and I won't see
So till you increase to the reason of your mindless peace
And what the hell there is no smell
But I can always tell it's left here here as well
And if the lovin the lovin the lovin was that strong
Then he gotta get at it all day and night long
Oooooh but as for you another minute ticked away
We're down to two
For those who don't know the three letters in TLC
Stand for T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli

Chorus

Yo left eye kick that shit

Tis the season to be givin'
And I've got somethin' just for you
Let's take a trip to my cabin
We can celebrate
A funky christmas made for 2 (oh)
That's all I want

Chorus:
All I want for christmas
Is to be loved by someone like you
Outside the snow is falling
My heart is calling
To spend my christmas time alone with you

Now throw a log on the fire
Then we could trim the tree
How much fun it would be
To take a walk in the snow
As you're holding me close
That would be your christmas gift to me

Chorus

Maybe it ain't got nothin' to do
With my 2 front teeth
Not unless of course you're lookin'
For some chewed up beef
See I love ya 'cause I'm in love
And in love 'cause I love ya
These words and sentences is for the heads
Between and above ya
Can you imagine me alone
A dial tone
A two flips cone
The echo of a moan
A single bow
A measley dug it
A pea in the bucket
Flat out for christmas all I wanna do is (yow)
Maybe if my baby didn't treat me like a lady
Just the hose for my toes
Kiss the spot that's mostly shady
Twist the left all around
Flips these lips upside down
Then you'll never have to ask me why I'm crazy
So hear me in or hear me out
Give me deaf or give me doubt
Or tell me what it's all about
And if you figure out my flow
Be it fast or be it slow
Me and my baby will be chillin' with the mistletoe

(appears on paula cole's album ""amen"")



I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference

Little boy caught in a drive-by
Witnessed the killer who made his daddy die,
And 'cause he identified and signed the dotted line,
He could feel it in his stomach, he signed away his life
Little boy who once was the leader of his class
The little source of joy, always neatly dressed
Now would hang his head and be left crying at his desk,
Was found with his mother, lying in her lap
With two bullets in his chest

Bridge:
And, oh my god, what is this madness?
I will not let it kill my gladness
And, oh my god, what is this madness?
My joy inside will send this message

Chorus:
I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference,
For we all are children of the mother
I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference,
For we all are children of the father

Outspoken man, leading sisters and brothers,
Picked himself up from hustling, drugs and gutters
Doing time on the inside, he found a higher power
Now, back with a mission to help us help each other

Respected from bourgeoisie to homeless in the street
From universities, africa, the middle east
And through the threats of death he spoke truth and set men free
But the power of the truth made enemies of the weak
He was killed by his own people

Bridge

Chorus

Ignite this fire inside, this light that is the truth
Shake off the system's chains, no longer be their fool
In the face of brutality, show the other cheek
Trigger-happy policing will never kill our dignity

Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you livin' this large
I be smooth like debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossin' down
The fifteen my whole aura gleamin'
Who dat kid in the green v
Envy brother scheamin'
I ain't thinkin' bout them racing chicks in the pink bm
With my speakers tweakin' freakin' off this weekend in
Las vegas boss players all across the board move makers and
Shakers money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight and we gon' have some fun tonight

Now how we do it (you know it's big willie style baby)
How we doin' it (you know it's big willie style)

I'm in a five star casino shuttin' crap tables down (boom)
Non bettin' willie watchers standin' around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes lookin' at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare havin' drinks at the bar a round
For everybody with these big willie cards from civilians to stars
They wanna know who we are it's me big will, nas escobar, J. L.
Omar carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick the swift exit

It's left eye with a tight crew representin' like it's ladies night
Comin' right through don't be spiteful plus an eyeful
Sportin' hot-pink rocks in a link in a drop with a mink
Like my shit don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like sadam
Blowing up spots then runnin' off with the pots
Left eye ready for action the main attraction
I'm in the fast-lane passing breakin' you down like fractions
While we be rappin' about things that really happen
Big willie style philly style let's make it platinum
With mademouselle from gazels to versace
With a sweet smell this female leadin' the posse got jokes like cosby
In the lots where the cars be with no apologies it's left eye
Big will let the champagne spill is it a man's thing for real
Can us girls roll wit y'all what the deal

Chorus

Well now it's lookin' like a car show convoys and whips
On the strip pullin' up in the six makin' brothers sick for real
Big will household name entertainer gold handle cane and matchin'
Gators swervin' lane in pole position rolling deep like a co-malition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene my whole crew lookin' clean
Shine with a diamond gleam step above where the players be
Don't hate me one is where they rate me lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V. I. P. Eating grapes under the A. C.

Chorus:
Rock-a-bye baby
From the rooftop
When the guns blow
Your cradle gets rocked
When the earth quakes
And the sky start to fall
Down will come emcees
Fake shit and all

Rooftoppin' be the shell shot
The bomb drops
Aftershock blow your mother clock
To smitherines
Time stops
Flying guillotine
Comin' for your fly
What you mean you spilled the beans, huh?
Blacked out and thought I seen 'pac
Laced a big glock
What's a bird to a brother with a flock what
They got some nerve
They even try share the turf
On john j
Flap a nigga gay
With the word play
Hot neck shoot you with a gift
It's your birthday
God hatin' ugly in the worst way
Fuck 'em like the earth say
From first day
I surveyed the hassle
Death knockin' at your door
In the big apple
Meth rotton to the core
Shackled in the sound castle
The dungeon with vermin
In the form of emcees
Determined to step foot on god's soil
Not knowin' that these egg-heads
Come hard boiled
And heavy handed
The aliens have just landed
Any any way
Overthrow these niggas planet
Independence day
Felons get split melons
Homicide
Bug nigga's get the bug repellant
Insecticide
Johnny 5 take it worldwide
As long as I pledge allegiance
To the dark side
I never die
Who you know with a flow like this
Bring 'em in
What clan you know blow like this
Bring 'em in
Take dat nigga

There will be....

The sound of gun bursts
Put the foul in the turf
(foul in the turf)
You can't think planet from the my control theory
(my control theory)
Murder in the first bring 'em back down to earth
(back down to earth)
Ya'll niggas don't hear me prepare for the worst
(prepare for the worst)

Times gon' change
Nuttin' will remain the same
Million dollar broke niggas
Still fucked up in the game
Make me wanna choke niggas
Shittin' on my name
Tuck ya chain when I approach
Nigga go against the grain now
Can you stand the rain now
Die hard fan
Call me john john mcclain now
Snake verse the crane style
Death to the enemy
Wu brother number one
The centipede
Troublesome
Send 'em all to kingdom come
Sun still shine one
Time for your crooked mind
Drunk off of cheap wine
Son I'm in the street crime
Every word every line
Got juice very fine
Turn me loose on man kind
Detonate the land mine
Funk gets my go now
I'll never sell, never sold
Live by the code now
Never tell, never told
Darts I throw
Like clyde with the finger roll
Clutch shots and whatnot
This is where the buck stops
Still can't eat
And y'all still can't sleep
I elect myself as presidential emcee
Wu tang killa bee
The bee hive facility
In love with the blunt smoke
Even though it's killin' me
Bad vibes fillin' me with
Thoughts of conspiracy
Whitewater scandals
With bill clinton 'n hillary
Too hot to handle
Too well put together to dismantle
Fucker
You heard
Fucker...

There will be....

Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Catch me when I fall son
I'm too young to die
Me and lefty

Come touch me

You'll never know me

Man if you test me....
Fire upon your head

Degrees of self

Highest level of change
Too many niggas sittin' on they ass
Waitin' for shit to just happen
Shit don't just happen
Don't fuck around and miss the boat
If you take away the negative
Make room for the positive
That's addin' and subtractin'

Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing crazy-s***-cool

Crazy
What is crazy
Something we find profound
One having flaws or cracks untied
Found mentally unbalanced deranged
Psychopathic
Insane
You know they say there's a fine line
Between genius and insanity
Like the difference between
Fine english and profanity
It's like walking the tightrope between stormy and clear
Through the eyes of left eye
Here we go
Have no fear

I'd like to introduce myself
My name is crazy
When I say ""what's my name? ""
Y'all say ""crazy!""

Chorus:
What's my name
Crazy!
My claim to fame is
Crazy!
Left eye better known as
Crazy!
'cause when I'm on the throne I'm
Crazy!
Now tell me how ya feel
Crazy!
Who is ya keepin' it real wit'
Crazy!
What's the name of this song
Crazy!
It goes on and on like
Crazy!

As I hit you with this first line
Get you with this nursery rhyme
Left e-y-e psycho in the mind
Gemini is my zodiac sign
Feel the beat get ya mind
Feel the track rewind
When you see me throw up the l three times
Y'all got that
The l three times
Come on throw up the l three times
Let me know that ya know your signs
In numerology the number is 9
These bombshells comin' more devine
Now feel the energy
'cause now is the time for the crazy left eye to shine

But ya know sometimes
I just feel like
A flower in the jungle
It just kinda makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under
But then a light seems to pop into my head
Speaking of lights anybody got a light
Anybody got a house?
Just kiddin'
Alright what we have here
Is a string
This string has been treated
With nitroglycerine
Do you guys have my light ready
Alright y'all ready

Chorus

Comin' back with verse two
It's the angelic being
Some call me left eye
Others call me crazy
S***-cool
But no fool
Twenty-five million sold
And that's the truth
I thank you you you and you
Just keep buyin' baby
I keep rhymin' baby
And tlc will keep climbin'
Tlc will keep climbin'
A visionary emcee in my own little world
Arsonist yes it's me I'll burn up your curl
Take that get me back on the left hand side
You're feelin' crazy let's rock

But sometimes
I just get this wild hair up my ass
Squigets hand me my balls
Not those sweaty stinking balls
My juggling balls

Chorus

To accomodate this new geometry
A rhyme that's desired
A world premeire in the history of time is required
The crooks wanted yesterday
Wanna blaze the new way
For you and I and the things we have to say
So the new you to you I'll showcase a few
Events with mania that makes no sense
See I'm a diamond in the rough
Beautiful but tough
Quick to call your bluff
Think you've had enough
Open up your mind
Look what others have dared
Let your light shine
With a little savoir faire
I'm out all night
I'll check the tunes and then it's you
I'ma keep rhymin'
For my fans and my crew

But sometimes
I feel a little ebony
And then ivory
So I must expose
The beethoven inside of me
Move over buddy

That you had a thang for me

Monkey lines are now in season

Could've been like anywhere

Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relation-ships

When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, Lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

(appears on the panther soundtrack)

Now this is time for free your mind and your soul
Yo our official story has never been told
Ladies you got to demand what you want
And what we want is respect, right
Yo listen up on the track here
'cause you'll also have to deal with it right
Freedom every time for the sisters
Check this watch this

A here we go now
Listen if I'm poompa moo
I'll be the ruler like slick rick
Get with this quick witted
Adidas-wearing chick
Poppa got a brand new bag
Momma got a brand new jag
A gold tag I ain't no old hag
I represent not only in the kitchen
And the bedroom room
But also in the board room
So give me more room
Deny my opportunity
You in jeopardy
Yo-yo set me free
Don't hinder me
Let me be

My fightin' for freedom
I got the heat in case you need 'em
I'm a straight soldier
Ain't nobody told you
Hold up on them lies
I know your games and your plans
Do whatever you can to oppress demand
But when it's time to drop the bomb
Bring the funk and it's on
You say you never met a sister so strong
You're wrong now how can we be free
It takes you and it takes me
To blend together in harmony
And peace and love and all of the above
Sisters coming together representing one love
No disrespect but we gotta get it together
No matter what's the weather
Sisters gotta stick together
If sisters be stronger
Don't let 'em steer you wrong
Hold on 'cause sisters got it going on
Yeah

Chorus:
Let's free your mind and your soul
Don't let no guys go and take control
Because you're young and a you play the role
And our official story has never been told

Whoever said these are the things that you can do
And the things you ain't supposed to
So am I further when I think I'm getting closer
That's when I tend to think of rosa how was it
Took a seat to make a stand
But now in standing we've gotten more demanding
They never thought in planning
That a wish for us to sit would be a dose of
This fucking rollercoaster
Whether tradition or religion
Why you question my decision
Why you spend up all your time trying to
Get into my mind
Why everybody and they mama
Gots to add to all my drama mad drama
Hell if i'ma keep my dominating feministic hell
Creating crazysexycool black ass
In the palms of your player hater's stands
My only chance of being free is to fly within me
And it's illegal to kill a fucking eagle
A bird is never more important than my people
I guess we didn't need him so I took away his freedom

Chorus

My spiritual awareness leads me to believe
That you doubt in the sisters
That come with the peace we've been together
Since God created all of thee
African daughters celebration is in order
Pop the cork and give the champagne to the stork
That brought the lyte to my momma in new york
African I come again and again
You kick me down I get back up
I'm coming back in multiples of ten

You know where I come from
Slung from the belly of the beast
Used to speak african tongue
So I showed her next one bolder
Slung the devil over my shoulder
I'm getting over 'cause I'm bolder than the next
I'm enlightened 'cause I speak the real truth from the text
Who's next to flex with this s-i-s-t-e-are
The sun the moon the crest and the star
Wanna see how open you are

Chorus

Come and take a walk with me
Closer walk with thee
See what only I can see
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
So it's back to the womb of everlasting life
And truth let the heaven of a
Sister embrace you and praise them other gods
Come into the light let it shine blackness is fine
The blackness of your skin
The blackness of your mind

I am who I am and that's who I be
And I don't give a damn if your eyes can't see
If you can't see what I can see
That you're blind baby bop
I'm a woman who's black so back up back up
'cause it's on i'ma tell you strong what's wrong
With the world that we're living on
It ain't who you know it ain't what you drive
It's about how you feel about yourself
On the inside when your self-esteem is low
And they call you a ho then they think you's a ho
But that ain't what the lord God made you to be
I need you to see you're black and you're free

Excuse me mr. Officer
You think we're bad, huh?
You wanna clean up the streets, huh?
Well you better put society in handcuffs
Ha ha, you got a hard job

Music by bernstein
Lyrics by sondheim
I'm talkin' 'bout west side story
It's before my time
Police sweat me like the sharks & the jets
Because I do what I does
So they wanna hit me
If you let me
I'll explain the game
Clear my name
And show you ain't a damn thing changed
So don't criticize the way that I ball hey
This ain't broadway
We learned it the hard way

Dear kindly sergeant krupke
You gotta understand
It's just our bringin' upke
That gets us out of hand
Our mothers all are junkies
Our fathers all are drunks
Golly moses, naturally we're punks

Gee, officer krupke
We're very upset
We never had the love
That every child oughta get
We ain't no deliquents
We're misunderstood
Deep down inside us there is good

There is good!

There is good, there is good
There is untapped good
Like inside, the worst of us is good

You see, officer krupkee
You gotta have some compassion
You know, you always harrassin' me
But what you don't understand is
I come from a broken home
My momma don't care about me
My daddy don't care about me
And you always gettin' on my case
It ain't me homeboy
It's society

Dear kindly judge, your honour
My parents treat me rough
With all their marijuana
They won't give me a puff
They didn't wanna have me
But somehow I was had
Leapin' lizards, that's why I'm so bad

Right! Officer krupke
You're really a square
This boy don't need a judge
He needs an analyst's care
It's just his neurosis
That oughta be curbed
He's psychologically disturbed

He's disturbed!

We're disturbed, we're disturbed
We're the most disturbed
Like we're psychologically disturbed

We out of our minds you know what I'm sayin'
Yeah, because we got problems
Deep down inside
I ain't got no analystic junk heap
And sit down on the couch
Then find out why I'm disturbed
I know why I'm disturbed
And you know what
I don't care
'cause it's just like that
And that's just how it is
You know what I'm sayin'
That's the way it is
Crazy

Father is a bastard
My mom's an s-o-b
My grandpa's always plastered
My gramma pushes tea
My sister wears a moustache
My brother wears a dress
Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess

Officer krupkee you're really a slob
This boy don't need a doctor
Just a good honest job
Society played him a terrible trick
And socialogically he's sick

We are sick!

We are sick, we are sick
We are sick sick sick
Like we're sociologically sick

In other words
This is what happens when cousins marry
We are pendejo heads, inbred
Hey we're like chicano forrest gump's

Dear kindly social worker
They say go earn a buck
Like be a soda jerker
Which means like be a schmuck
It's not I'm antisocial
I'm only antiwork
Glory osky, now that's why I'm a jerk
Officer krupkee ya done it again
This boy don't need a doc
He needs a year in the pen
It ain't just a question of misunderstood
Deep down inside, he ain't no damn good

I'm no good!

We're no good, we're no good
We're no earthly good
Like the best of us is no damn good

The trouble is he's crazy
The trouble is he drinks
The problem is he's lazy
The trouble is he stinks
The trouble is he's growin'
The trouble is he's grown
Krupkee we've got troubles of our own

Gee, officer krupkee
We're down on our knees
'cause no one wants a fella
With a social disease
Gee, officer krupkee
What are we to do
Gee, officer krupkee
Krup you!"

Everytime you come around,
you always put me down,
you're always on my case.
That's why I act this way,
cuz livin day 2 day,
Is hard enough. to face.

No need to ask me why I feel so down,
When the life it stops, nobody comes around,
And that's why I say.

CHORUS
Don't try so hard,
you're doin fine,
don't go too far,
don't cross the line.
Don't push so hard.
cos I might break,
just need a chance to get away.

Everything in life we know,
we gotta learn by the chances we take.
If we don't give a damn about it we would never try to make away

Just be true about the way you feel,
cos when its right you gotta keep it real.
And that's why I say.

chorus

Nobody can, nobody knows,
but when you don't, it shows,
the way that you live defies the truth,
but the way that you feel about your life reflects on you.
And that's why I say.

I had some problems
That no one could seem to solve them
But you had the answer
You told me to take a chance
And learn the ways of love my baby
And all that it has to offer
In time you will see that love won't let you down
Ohh, all my love baby

Hey baby it ain't gon' ever change
Between you and your boo
Put a hold on me ever since I held you
What compelled you to be my man
Besides passion and lust
You ran up on a real boo with understanding and trust
Ain't no comparison you leave all the rest behind
You blow my mind undercover
When you workin' my shine
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber
Took me shoppin' all day and at night, you kept it comin'
Made dinner collard greens, candied yams, and steak
Showed me the game how to import birds and chop weight
Caught a case 'cause your boy ran his mouth too much.
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch
But as the days keep passin' keep it laughin' with stacks of letters
Hit you so you don't forget us
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella
Hella playa-haters want your occupation
But they can keep pacin' 'cause
I'm gonna be waitin' on my baby

Chorus:
And all this love is waiting for you
My baby, sweet darlin'
And all this love is waiting for you
Don't worry about a thing just stay down
As long as you can hang I'm-a be around

Ran into your boy had heard he'd spread the word
That you was soft braggin' he collecting your cheese
And pissing me off
The first thought of committing a felony never left
I missed the big breaths you took when we waa puffin' the l
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones
I saw better sl 500's colorful gucci sweaters and leathers
Diamond letters I feel ya boo 'cause I saved the sugar for you
Keep the business runnin' droppin' off keys in cancun
Cash rules and you remain to be the king of my throne
Position takin' flippin' calendar pages till you get home
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin' up my happiness
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation
If I'm incarcerated too you can make it through
Rebel on the jealous who tell us the opposite of that
Forever you and brat
I tried to take the blame but you preferred to handle my fame
So I'm waitin' with open arms to rekindle the flame

Steped into my life, it was so right. I looked at him and
He looked at meeeee(repeat)and then it all became my fantasy.(my fantasy)

Give a shout out to my baby
I wanna tell the whole world about him
Cause he's everthing I wanted
He's out but, he's still in.

Left you at the crib

Happens every tuesday night
You said that you was cool
Your boys was comin' by
(go baby have yourself a real good time)
So I knew I could be wrong

I was thinkin' there's no way it could be you
Not my baby

Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

Chorus:
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl I am
That's the kinda girl I am
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl that I am

Here we go, here we go, here we go again

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Some people just don't understand the things I do
(you feelin' it ""d"", you feelin' it)
Chillin' with the girls or kick it with the fellas
If I choose

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Dumb rules are left for fools
With no attitude I think my way is cool
So let me be me and continue being smooth
Yo left eye what's up wit' that guy?

So yo gettin' back to this dude wit' the foul attitude
Shoot he made another bad move sayin' that
Girls shouldn't wear baseball caps he can go take a hike
Cause it's the style I like yeah it's a trip
Cause somethin' hasn't yet been said
I never talked about them damn fingerwaves in his head
Tight pants and 2 rings in each ear
You know that is dead but it's me instead

Chorus

Here we go again

That's the kinda girl I am
Don't cha know I really don't give a damn
Let me be me for me and not what I'm supposed to be
So I'm gonna do what I wanna do
Cause dumb rules are left for silly fools
That's the kinda girl that I am - ohh!

Here we go, here we go, here we go again

Some people might wonder why we're like that
Cause we're smooth
Smooth you know

Relatively speakin' I am no ordinary dip
Cause I ain't reachin' hipped
Til you be thinkin' I'm flipped
And that is ooooh on the tlc tip

Yo I keep it blazin' it's so amazin'
The occasion that I am raisin'
Mind body invasion
So who you savin' all that love for
Open up your mind explore
We'll make it hard-core
You can be the candy man
I'll be your candy store
Give you just a little more
Than what you bargained for
And if you ask me for some guidance
It's not a minus
I'll break it down to a science
Kitchen appliance
To what extent can you measure the true
Value of my 100 percent
When I'm unpassionate to you
Who thinks dollars and cents
I must confess I need that
Don't wake me up if I'm dreamin'
Because I'll be in that

Be my safety guide before I take you on this ride
Straight into the center
You enter my dimension
No question is protection
Selected in my session
I'm on a quest I will not rest till I break it
But if it's naked
I'll take it with the batteries and bake it
Cuz I gotta get mine and you gotta get yours
But never endin it by sendin it and shut the door
You must be crazy to think
That you can hang with me
I try to escape the inprisonment of those defyin' to me
The epitome of your every dream it seems to me
For intangible fantasy

If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember to tell me
All the things you forgot
If I was your man if I was you man
If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things only your best friend can
Only your best friends can

Chorus
If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you
I mean help you pick out your close
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless but sometimes
Sometimes those are the things
That being in love's about
If I was you one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

Chorus

If I was your girlfriend
I know that you could treat me right
I could see what you see
And hear what you hear
And most of all
I'd feel what you feel

She would do if she knew
That you were comin'
To do what we do
I don't know what
He would do if he knew
That you were comin'
To do what we do

Always wondered if she knew about us
When I met ya you said y'all had broke up
Right on time 'cause I didn't have my love
Me and him was also messed up
That let me fall to you
And from what I could tell you fell too
And I wonder if it would be wrong
If we just kept it on
And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

Chorus

Always thought that he knew about you
When I met you I said we were through
In time my feelings came right back
But I didn't let us get off track
And I got so into you
Went too fast what do I do
When I know I shoulda helped it out
But you just turn me on

And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

Chorus

We kept things pretty tight thus far
Love without the s**
And hundred thousand dollar cars
Ain't it funny how our world should unify
An entity upon itself
That can spread wings and fly
A peaceful coexistance that will surely last
Becomes a reminiscent dream
For those in our past
If they knew just a fraction of all the things we do
They still wouldn't comprehend
The depth between me and you
And I know we
Both had someone that we just kept from
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang but it ain't belong
We know the feelings they don't know

Let me give you a clue
We could be stuck like glue

Are these girls necessary?
Why are they all up on you?
And why do you act like it's cool?

You will see just what I'll do
But if my thoughts are wrong and what you say is true
I'll ask you to forgive before accusin' you
I pray I'll never see the day when you
Decide those chicks should be with you

It's been a minute since I seen you
I've just been killing time
Lettin' all these bitches know
That you gon' always be mine
Disappear then reappear
We held it down through the years
All the crazy shit we've been through
Can't take no more tears
Fell in love when I first met you
Put you all on my team
Introduced you to my crew
Told you my every dream
It was us against the world
Nobody could come between

You get vexed more ''cause I'm the boy next door

And then an hour later I'm at it again
Friend and then I'm ready to go but you don't hear me though
And I'm about to throw just like rainbow
I keep an even flow watch as I do the show
And i'ma flip it and kick it like jeter so

Or seen in court jack

And if you make a mistake he'll never give in

As a look that only nookie gives a rough neck rookie
Jump the hump a rump bump the back hit the front
Take a dump in the stump roll a big fat blunt
And if he's quick to hand it to you don't grab it
He only really want it if he know he can't have it
Chase a rough neck bet you'll say dag nabbit
Mr. butter willie never did catch that dag nab wabbit

Verse 1;
I said If I got nothing else
I got memories of what we felt
I said and laugh into myself, sometimes, nobody
Those silly reasons we would fight
Where no matter who was wrong or right
We were always right there
Sharing this love, sharing this life

Chorus:
'Cause we knew, said we always knew
And no matter what would occur
That we were, meant to be
And it ain't gonna be easy
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be
And we ain't never not know that we were always meant to be
Meant to be

Verse 2:
And all, it'll get dark sometimes we know
Every now and then it's got to rain
But when that rain starts to pound all you gotta do is turn around
And you'll find me right there, holding you up, holding you down

Chorus:
'Cause we knew, said we always knew
And no matter what would occur
That we were, meant to be
And it ain't gonna be easy
That no matter what, baby we're meant to be

From the moment we met, meant to be through the sorrow, through the stress
Meant to be, through life and through death
Hey, we built a love that nothing can test

Always creatin the plan
For me to conquer this land
He said I am what I am
So be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it
Then why should I give a damn huh
Maybe so cause when his life wasn't right
My mother picked up them pieces
And continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me
It ain't no game to me
See mom and dad corrected math
1 and 1 equal 3
4 and 5 I count my sister and brother
Stay alive till we die
And don't you ever be worried
'cause I'm down with a ride
Through peaks and valleys to cresent hills
Tumble down I'll set a new ground for jack and jill
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes

Now I lay me down to sleep
That was then, but this is now
I pray the lord my soul to keep
I let you slip away somehow
If I should die before I wake
If I should die my pain shall stay
I pray the lord my soul to take
I made you what you are today

Now as I look at myself I'm seein' someone familiar
Starin' back at me through every deep crack that's in my mirror
And as I think to myself
I'm hearin somebody else scream at me (shhh....)
I no longer hear from
Could it be the unknown
Sneaking into my zone
Off we roam
My spirituals is not alone
I'm visualizing this invisible clone
It's my own and it's own
Rest assured it's my dome
Maybe I need to go to bed
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head
Nots while I raps
When it hits me (ha ha ha ha....)
But now it's laughin at me
Yo what the hell is happenin'
Please somebody slap me
No way not another physical display
Somethin' must got me backin' off from way back in tha day
But what can it be
I can't recall the memories so if I may ask

I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past

It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday
It's my fuckin' past
I just seen you yesterday

By any means was all it ever seemed to be
This reminiscin' with my past has got me
Caught up in a daydream
Stay in bed with niggas who can pay tha rent
Spending my green on panty hose and tight jeans
I used to be so amused
Cause the tools that I used to break rules
Only seemed to confuse as to whose bein' abused
Place yourself in my shoes
My blessed look of innocence was never refused

Now that I choose to abide
Hello left eye
And put my past to the side
I don't guess I
And kill a piece of my pride
Need to introduce myself
You already said hi
Oh so your the match that lights my fuse
Amuse
Huh, I thought I left you on on that cruise
You lose it
Your man took my place when it threw me in your face
So we drank up all the booze

Sing the blues
And yo we end up on the news

Oooh yea yea
I'll never be the same again

I call you up whenever things go wrong
You're always there you are my shoulder to cry on
I can't believe it took me quite so long
To take the forbidden step
Is this something that I might regret

Come on come on
Nothing ventured nothing gained
You are the one
The lonely heart that can't be tamed
Come on come on
I'm hoping that you feel the same
This is something that I can't forget

Chorus:
I thought that we would just be friends
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now we've opened up the door
Starting to knight him from the one
We'll never, never be the same again
Never be the same again

Now I know that we were close before
I'm glad I realized I need you so much more
And that I don't care what everyone will say
It's about you and me and we'll never be the same again

Chorus

Uh check it
Night and day
Like beach sand to red clay
The us to uk
Nyc to la
From sidewalks to highways
See it'll never be the same
What I'm sayin'
My mindframe never changed
'til you came and rearranged
But sometimes it seems
Completely forbidden
To discover those feelings
That we kept so well hidden
When there's no competition
And you render my condition though improbable
It's not impossible
For a love that can be unstoppable to work
Are fine lines between fate and destiny
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly
And as our energies mix and begin to multiply
Everyday situations they start to simplify
So things will never be the same between you and I
We intertwine our life wishes and now we unify

Chorus

Come on come on
Things will never be the same again
You are the one
Never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
We'll never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Never be the same again
Never be the same again
Oh oh yea
Never be the same again
Never be the same again
Uh huh

Ten months into his life for a clock began that night
A strife she's on the panickin' tip
Get to the hospital quick
Jumped out the car 'fore it hit
She grabbed the baby and slipped to the ground
Saved the day thought everything was ok
To find him covered in blood
This is the story of love

Let me tell you what I know
Know I love you miss you so
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again
Dreaming you are here with me
Look the same from seein' you last
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again

There's an empty space in my heart
When things break down it's all because
Lonely days without you I have to figure out
Now wha' I'm gonna do
Don't mean to cry all the time
I know you're safe and sound
I don't think I could ever be satisfied again

Whatever happened that day
That we lost baby jose
You gained a strength that no man
In this world could take away
And so I kicks this one for you
No tighter wish is true
It's not a day goes by that I don't think
Of little precious baby boo
And ''cause this moment is yours
I she'd my tears through the years till no more
Behind these closed doors
And you can count on me
From now till forever

Flyin' together through the stormy weather

Awaits the sun yes the one

Uhh, yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
From lil' kim, the queen bee

It's ladies night what, it must be angie on the mic
The butter p honey got the sugar got the spice
Roll the l's tight keep the rhymes right
Yo I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh... I'm the rookie on this all-star team
Me and kim is gettin' cream like thelma and louise
But on chrome never leave that brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on then it's on

Bang this in your whips
Pack 'em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a french kiss
I dismissed all you chicks split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance ooowwww
I stay focused in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it y'all just hopeless
And toke this I ain't lyin'
Niggas tryin' to knock me off keep tryin'
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass like a soundtrack new jack ci-tay
Set it off with that eighty-fiftay
Y'all missin' the buck what the fuck
Bump biggie in the truck hand a buck to my several bitches
Lemme see ya do tha bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap mae west to q-b
And I got all my sisters with me

Chorus:
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

Uhh, never the one packin' a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that lay that ass flat
I be the one chokin' ya paragraphs with laughs
Get ya back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin' my ladies from club hoppin' gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at paradise joint
Booty shakin' with the glass in my left one
Right hand sayin' step-son
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
To my niggas straight snitches and to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin' that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin'
To the top and it don't stop

Chorus

Y'all see how these bogus niggas try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin' with good intentions but focusin' on they riches
If it's too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks stay lifted when they thinkin' of me
Cause the rhythm I kick puzzle them like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin' 'em with sluggers off the nine milli luger click
Bitches bust we just, keep kickin' up dust
And you can spread rumors shit is makin me sicker than head tumors
Humor me by huggin' me sayin' you lovin' me
Playa phony niggas be buggin' I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, vv's and m3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the windy city woman still comin' and gunnin'
Straight from the chi
Tonight's the night for all the ladies let's get high

Chorus

Aiyyo kim, heheh, ya know what I'm sayin'
I ain't even gon' leave without sayin somethin' on this track
You ain't gonna use me to just be singin' hooks

Check it out, uh huh, yeah

Oh what a night
You should be like missy 'stead of bein' like mike
I like to ride ponies instead of ridin' bikes
Me and lil' kim got the rhymes to incite

In the pale moonlight
It's my duty
Check two fresh and fruity
Sweet like candy ass
Make a pass for the booty
I fantasize interludes
When I'm in the mood
See me in the nude
No time to rewind
When the bass line rides for two
Feel me in the groove
I rock on and on till the break of dawn
Feet don't stop me now come and sing along
As I get distracted with a two step
Pop that foot in hard
Time to break a sweat
Let it play Mr. Dj
Stimulatin' on the floor
Till I can't dance no more
Gotta react
If the club is packed
Where the party's at
It's Left Eye at the back door (back door)

Tims untied with saggy pants
Not the kind of guy I would give a chance
But he was kinda packin' under circumstance
6 foot 3 s*** as can be
I saw him through the crowd comin' up to me
He said aren't you that shorty from tlc
He told me 'bout the things he would do to me

See just what you're talkin' 'bout

Said he owed me one and tonight's the night
Didn't know if he should get another chance

He didn't know that I peeped him out
Picked up on what a quickie is all about
So went to dinner back to the crib
So I could switch it up and show him how it is

There is one last thing that we must review everybody
Alright, it's called the left pimp dance
Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna put your left foot in front
Leeeeeean to the left
And dip

Just like sweet rivers
I got a taste for flow
My flow's the next show
Lets flip this icy snow
And soulfully quiver
'cause the rhythm knows
How to correlate
With next to vertebrae's glow
I'm runnin' enough days though
Meanin' I kill time
You heard of mayo
Well my cars do real fine
Miracle whip this lyrical chick
On some spiritual shit
This will be a perennial trip
Damn (damn)

Get the monkey up off your back
And when he wanna know where you're at
Get the monkey up off your back
Even if he don't like it like dat
Get the monkey up off your back
You gotta do it to keep 'em intact
Get that monkey up offa your back

Chorus

Gotta get up on
Put that heart aside
It ain't about that lovin'
It's all about that pride
If you do unto him
What he does all the time
That's the only thing for sure
To keep that nickel in line

Ooh

Same damn time every hurt or two
Something can happen to put me in the mood
Keep it inside till I turn dark blue
Trash everything I ever gave to you
Wrote it on the front of your lexus coupe
Didn't want to leave you with a lame excuse
S** so good turns love to abuse
Do you wanna leave I'll put you in a noose

It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes it's so frustratin'
I keep it all in my head
Till I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's 'cause I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out

You gotta let me get it out
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day
Unless I feel like you make me
Shout
You gotta let me get it out
The feeling won't go away
Don't wanna spend another day
Unless I feel like you make me
Shout

Found somethin' in your pocket
And I don't know why
I didn't say nothing' just sat and cried
Got me twisted all out inside
Not too long before the next ride
Over and over and over again
Instead of lettin' out I always let it in
This is where the confusion begins
'cause if it don't make me you don't win
It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes it's so frustratin'
I keep it all in my head
Till I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's 'cause I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out

Baby just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
'cause sometimes I need you to turn me out
'cause that's what lovin' is all about
Baby just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
'cause sometimes I need you to turn me out
'cause that's what lovin' is all about
Yeah

Check it
I knew that it was only time
Before my rhymes
Would dig into my mind
And get crazy out of line
I do my best
To never disrespect
My girls from tlc
All my friends don't let me
Speak my love and peace
It's all about
In this world with a doubt
Is you down for the count
Do your hoes still amount
To the price that we pay
To remain up in this crucial game
Call it a test
A game of chess
Let's play
Me and you one on one
Breakin the ice
Till the water runs
Down my face like a chase
Now do you hear the guns
Here I come and won't quit
Until the job is done
Quiet storms will inform you
That I've just begun
Tippin' the spot till it's hot
If you want what I got
See me down to the dot dot com
And keep it comin' with your best shot
If you're short I care alot
And let's not

It's the same old sound
Missiles gliding families dividing
The american dream
Is quickly declining

From the last time
Nobody wants to stand in the cheese and bread line
Not me see (nah ah)
Recycled generations of love and war
And the question of what!
What we fighting for?
Killin' for oil 'cause we're spoiled with luxury

In any kind of that street crap yap you've been receivin'.

I would doubt it as to callin' a bluff.

I'm gettin' fed up, yo, 'cause words become a quote or somethin' better like a story.
It's far from hunky dory, close to fiction.
Half is true, but then the other is a conviction.

Lonely I'm talking too much

I don't wanna argue no not today
And I'm telling you baby there's nothing left to say
Let me be free and fly away

Spread my wings and soar away
And I'll never return back
To this crazy love life

But there's no need for me to keep waiting
No longer can you be trusted

And I really hate to leave but in this case
You broke my heart and now I feel this way
And I know sombody else is taking my place
Unfortunately I know that I can't stay (stay)

Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason
To be blastin' what da kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but
Had enough of singin' dat same song
See I stayed across da street from da projects
Took out yo momma trash and groceries
To her trunk to keep my pockets
Fat like cellulite only been to jail one week
For some shullbit and I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had da chance to
No I shouldna did dat 'cause if I did dat
Yall would not hear dat fat shit

Toes like dat sellout not callin' no names
But really who's bad
I go through obstacles like a whole box
Of condoms you can't forget
Where you come from

Take a good look in the mirror and tell
Me do you like what you see
Masters of deception corruption and evil
But your always quick to point the finger
At me
Won't somebody tell me

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing
To live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality you just don't know me at all
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me

If we could all agree to lettin'
Our souls become free of that sweet
Bitterness then whose chest would
Have the most seeds
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And this stress on my back
With them caps they be blastin'
Into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that
I'm destined to snap
It's when I feel as though my body's
Able to go my mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch
And then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late it's 'cause I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin'
Of the moon as it rolls around
Into my soundproof dimension

Man... T-boz tried to talk to me
You don't have to believe me
It may have been a big mistake
And if it was my heart will break
I'm serious... T-boz tried to talk to me

So have you ever heard of a group called tlc
With hits like ""ain't 2 proud 2 beg"" and ""baby-baby-baby""
New years day of 1992 I was chilling
With the leaders of the new
At the fox theater venue
Atlanta, georgia where the girls don't ignore ya
Geronimo had two girls... And said this one's for ya
The two were close related... In fact sister kindred
And I was scheming on a way to get her into bed
1992 when I was rhyming for fun
Had the thickest new style... But no demo done
I wasn't feeling down about my past situation
I had only seen tlc on video vibrations
Yes this was just before they blew up
While I was gaming on the girl I had a chance to look up
Tlc walked in with my man yusef
Left eye is the name because she played me to the left
The girl I was with was silly...
But I was trying to get on t-boz any motherfucking way
But what was I to say...
Hey shit I was a nobody
And nobody had ever heard of count bass-d
Or tlc, but my despair turned into glee
When t-boz pushed up and introduce herself to me
My heart went mushy... I know you don't believe me
But t-boz of tlc tried to talk to me

Chorus

Chorus

Yeah I saw you on tv last week
Hello, t-boz my name is count bass d
I was thinking last week while I was watching your video clip
That when I got rich I'd have to kiss your lips
That's how I wanted to step... But I had my doubts
About her finding out about my lack of clout
I guess she saw me with
The leaders and assumed I had a record deal
But I was mesmerized with her s** appeal
Rumors ran free that she loved jodeci
Who gives a fuck about k-ci
He's just as skinny as me
Don't get me wrong... In singing songs nobody's better
But I get around like 2pac and chain letters
But this time I slippped though... Got played like a wimp though
The pharcyde said it fly she kept passing me by
Not even merrill stubing could have played more friendly
Huh... T-boz tried to talk to me yo

Chorus

Chorus

Last time y'all
Females only step to niggas once in a while
And you should react if she seems worthwhile
T-boz was a goddess
I'm honest I wouldn't lie to ya
But I procrastinated like a paper overdue
I know you're saying he's just a crumb
He couldn't get none
But t-boz was a female who was full of sincerity
I know it sounds hard to believe
And I could give a fuck if you believe me but
T-boz tried to talk to me"

And start makin' my own example cause

Chorus:
This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done (yeah, yeah)
This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none

This is how it should be done steppin' into a shade a bit lighter
Now is the time to write a rhyme a rhythmic type of memo
Tick-tack it to the track it is now my demo-kay
What's to do where's to go yo I don't know
Who's to see see ya at the local show
Me and mo takin' a chance and he's dancin'
Round and round the deck as I flow
But what an awkward situation
Cause there's not much crowd participation
For checkin' me out I'm too new it
Gots to be somethin' else another way to do it
So I sit back and think for a minute
Which city needs a little more talent in it
Maybe A. T. L. Is the place packed up left philly gotta hit laface

Chorus

This is how it should be done (hey)

This style is identical to none

This is how it should be done and I'm comin' through
Grippin' the mic spittin' out what's after verse 2
And ready to rock the spot cause I'm on it
They wanna see what I got
Givin' it all and makin' it seem so simple to be myself
Along wit' doin' what I do
Cool they want me not knowin' I'm soon to be the 'l' of tlc
Word up T. B. O. Z. That's t-boz
Saucin' it up is chilli
We three alike all small in height but I'm left eye
Cause the eye is right
So now they thinkin' well is we ready enough
Yeah it's time to get busy
The aftermath is the brightest path so far
Yo cause here we are

This is how it should be done
This is how, this is how

Not everybody knows just how to do it
Some just learn it on the way
Once you get it right, ain't nothin to it
If you wanna get it right, you gotta learn to pace
Make it smooth, take your time
Make it groove, in, out, in
Make it last, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kiss my ---, ah, ah, ah

Chorus:
This is how it works
Wrap your hands around my body
This is how it works
Go due south and
This is how it works
Melt yourself into my body
This is how it works
Kiss my mouth

Some guys think they know the answers
Everybody knows how to make you scream
If most guys took time out their fantasies
Maybe we could stop our make believe
Make it smooth, take your time
Make it groove, in, out, in
Make it last, kiss, kiss, kiss,
Kiss my ---, ah, ah, ah

Chorus

Ready set go, you don't have to know
We can take forever, learn together any flow
Touch me slow, watch it grow
Kiss the tip, gently flow, be my ho and take the show
We can watch it in slo mo, when the sweet & lo drips
Don't forget to let me wet my finger tips
Write love letters back & forth across your lips
Spread my hips, count to eighty, eighty ways, eighty trips
Make it smooth, take you time
One time for you mind, two times if ya tense baby let it unwind
Make it groove, in, out, in
Three counts let it bou--nce to the motherfucking ounce
Make it last, kiss, kiss, kiss
Here we go, now you know, 4th down, let if flow back around come on

Nothing could happen to me

Should live life more carefully

Control my own destiny
I used to look at others
Instead of me blaming me

Don't ask yourself why
Just look to the sky
Believe that soon you'll see the other side

There's a bright road
At the end of the tunnel

Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn

With problems coming your way
Don't ever get discouraged

The way to make things okay

A change in my ways
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
Better holler if you hear me 'cause left eye gon' shine
My eyes don't lie see how they glisten when you pass me by
You and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I've done seen and heard of many places
Then I travelled around the world seen many faces
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you

If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cuz he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body layin cold in the gutter

Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers
And the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it

Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body
Can't handle but all he can say
Is ""baby is good to me""

But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why

I seen a rainbow yesterday
But to many storms have come and gone
Leaving a trace
Of not one God giving ray
Is it because
My life is ten shades of grey
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise him for the seven days

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional
Skies have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries,
My only bleeding hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurine pain
That it keeps them in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tootin caine into your own vein
What a shame you shoot and aim
For some one elses blame
You claim the insane for
This day and time for falling
Prey to crime I say the system's
Got you victim to your own mind

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls

And the lakes that you're used to

Say I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy

Just cause I am what some choose to envy

Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own

So hip hip hooray organizers comin' in
Own a friend like the oj
But what about your friends to the end
Will they run on out his eagle
Or you'll find 'em stickin' close to your side

Or do you slang
Or wear a chain
Or platinum rings
I still maintain
My ghetto side I
Keep my pride

To come upon a girl like me

Funding their clothes and rolls

Shit my baby is still ghetto like hot fries
I come from lovin' niggas
And give 20/20
With his bloodshot eyes
Got turned into gold
Went from two o's to thirty two lows
Which is enough to buy a rolls
Ain't but nobody knows
Stay in my place
Keep my diamonds out of your face

Got to play at my pace

Over there where you're from

You know you're ghetto
When you don't show up in court
For not payin' your child support
Or you too bullshit for me
You act like you're too good to eat

This track is very rare

How long do I let this thing go on
Before I run away
Not begging you to stay
But I'd like it if you could
And you're knowin' that you should
Be down with the one
That's gonna love you baby
So stay and stop drivin' me crazy

Chorus:
What's up
What's up with you and me
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us
What's up
What's up with you and me
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us

You see I'm not tryin'
To ride and pressure you
If it's somethin' you don't wanna do
But I got to let you know
Your position must be known
There ain't no reason to front
So I guess I will be blunt
And just let you know that
I'm walkin' out the door
Unless you tell me right now
What you're gonna do with my love
Oh baby

Chorus

I don't know why
But I've always tried
Why don't you lay down
Why don't you hang up your tie
What's up baby
What's up baby baby baby baby
Oh

Don't be afraid and don't
You fade on my escapade
Fantasy lives within the dream
That we have made
Callin' me up 6 in the mornin'
The break of dawn and
Before I could imagine that you'd be gone and
I think about the times we share
Call it do or dare
Ask me if I'm bein' fair
Do you really care
See me and you like a holiday
Never too late to celebrate in a lot of ways

What's up
We really don't need to play
These guessing games no more
What's up
I gave you all my love you said it was too much
You don't want no more
What's up
You really didn't need to play
These guessing games no more
What's up
I gave you all my love you said it was too much
You don't want no more

It seems like, when I'm with you
Only crazy broads, seem to find you
And I'm thinkin' like, how do they know you
And just what are you into
'Cause I'm diggin' you, if everything is cool
But if you're playing games, it was good to know you
But nigga you were cruel
We could be stuck like glue
But I refuse to be a fool

B-Section [Chilli]:
I wanna get with you but it just seems so crazy
Are these girls necessary?
Why are they all up on you?
And why do you act like it's cute?
I'm not gonna be your boss, you can try and play me
It don't look that way, baby
So let me know who you choose
If I'm here waiting for you

Chorus:
I don't like to play around
That's not how I get down
No foolishness allowed
Who's it gonna be
I'm not stressing over you
So whatcha gonna do
Keep playing you lose
Who's it gonna be

Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh
Ooohh, ooohh, ooohh

[T-Boz]
It doesn't feel right, when I'm with you
Having these broads, keep approaching you
If my thoughts are true, I will be with you
You will see just what I'll do
But if my thoughts are wrong, then what you say is true
I asked you to forgive, before accusing you
I pray I'll never see the day go
And you decide those chicks should be with you

It's been a minute since I seen you
I've just been killing time
Lettin' all these bitches know
That you will always be mine
Disappear then reappear
We held it down through the years
All the crazy shit we've been through
Can't take no more tears
Fell in love when I first met you
Put you all on my team
Introduced you to my crew
Told you my every dream
It was us against the world
Nobody could come between
Passionate, crazy shit
If you know what I mean (let's go)

Por que eu fui nascer?
Por que meu coração é tão solitario?

Se um dia eu partir
Com as asas prateadas
Para uma terra que ainda não conheço
Quero ao meu lado alguém que amo
O tempo passará
A era mudará
Recordarei os dias da juventude
Mas esta será a cidade
Onde meu coração retornará

Apesar de perceber o carinho

Final de amor... Final de uma peça...
Voce é vendedor de sonhos tristes...
Uma peça de felicidade?
Um dia quando se quebrar e desaparecer...

O coração pega fogo de ciúme
Quem está dormindo no seu lado esquerdo agora?
Um amor bonito, é como uma lágrima *

Deixe-me dançar um pouco com as recordações...

Se o amor se põe no crepúsculo
A partir de amanhã prevejo
Que serei mais triste que as lágrimas

E mesmo se alguém me abraçar, serei livre
Não serei sua, mesmo se te amar
Agora esse amor que perdi
É como se eu tivesse perdido um brinco
Deixe-me dançar um pouco com a tristeza...

The ushers are sniffing
Eau-de-cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women.

On a quiet street corner
Free frustration
In our minds and our toes
Quiet stormwater
M-m-my generation
Uppers and downers
Either way blood flows.

Leave me alone.

Nowhere is home.
Inside outside
Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the five fifteen
Out of my brain on a train.

On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking.
On the back of a lorry
Holy hitching.
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping.
Born in the war
Birthday punching.

He man drag
In the glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous
In my high heel shoes
Tightly undone
They know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic
That their heroes are news.

Nowhere is home.

The Who,905,/t/the+who/905_20146806.html,"Mother was an incubator
Father was the contents
Of a test tube in the ice box
In the factory of birth

My name is 905,
And I've just become alive
I'm the newest populator
Of the planet we call Earth

In suspended animation
My childhood passed me by
If I speak without emotion
Then you know the reason why

Knowledge of the universe
Was fed into my mind
As my adolescent body
Left it's puberty behind

And everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door

Automatically defrosted
When manhood came on time
I became a man
I left the ""ice school"" behind

Now I'm to begin
The life that I'm assigned
A life that's been used before
A thousand times

I have a feeling deep inside
That somethin' is missing
It's a feeling in my soul
And I can't help wishing

That one day I'll discover
That we're living a lie
And I'll tell the whole world
The reason why

But, until then, everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every idea in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door"

A legal matter from now on

My mind's lost in a household fog
Wedding gowns and catalogs
Kitchen furnishings and houses
Maternity clothes and baby's trousers

It's a legal matter, baby

The Who,A Little Is Enough,/t/the+who/a+little+is+enough_20246725.html,"They say that love often passes in a second
And you never can catch it up
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned
But it's clear that the match is rough
Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue
But i'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
Just a little is a enough

I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste
Some people want an endless line that's true
But all I have's a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feels like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love

You talk about your life as though it mattered
You get attention 'cos you block the stairs
Bragging about some bottles you have shattered

Well I met a man who really lives
He really does it all
But what really matters is the heart he gives
He makes your talk seem small

When a man is a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to perform like John Wayne in some B feature flick
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
I know a man who's a man

Can't you sometimes crack a smile
Do you think if you did we would run and tell
I know one day your big villian style
Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell

I know a man who was once like you
But he opened his heart
No one is really bad right through
He's just another part

When a man is a man
And he drinks 'til he's canned
He can drop to the floor, he can weep, we won't ask the price
A man is a man
He can fall he can stand

He's a dresser
He's a genius under pressure
I know a man who could tighten your rein
He's a father
He's a brother
He's a rock
He's a lover

He's a man he's a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick
A man is a man

Not afraid of apprearing insane if he can't break a brick
Be a man who's a man"

Better be nice to an old engine driver

Can't believe that I'm with you again

I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap

He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
Creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked
Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.

Nothing to say and nothing to hear
And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride."

We all get it in the end

We go down and we come up again

This is you having fun

Getting burned by the sun

You can always get higher
Just because you aspire
You could expire even knowing.
Don't push the hands
Just hang on to the band
You can dance while your knowledge is growing

(It could happen anytime)
You can't expect to never cry
(Patience is priceless)
Not when you try to fly so high
(Just stay on that line)
Rock and roll will never die

Another tricky day
Another gently nagging pain
What the papers say
Just seems to bring down heavier rain
The world seems in a spiral
Life seems such a worthless title
But break out and start a fire y'all
It's all here on the vinyl

And I'm newly born.

Bell Boy! I got to keep running now.
Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down.
Bell Boy! Carry this baggage out.
Bell Boy! Always running at someone's heel.
You know how I feel, always running at someone's heel.

Some nights I still sleep on the beach.
Remember when stars were in reach.
Then I wander in early to work,
Spend the day licking boots for my perks.

A job like mine.

In recoil from a broken romance
Taking breath after one sudden death
I had a firm grip on my pants

We think we've got real love in our life
It pumps like the pressure in the station hall
As the express-train thunders on by

I fell right in love with you
As the blood came blowing through
I fell right in love with you

Across the room, I saw your eyes
Black-windowed, looking back at me
You held a gun, as children cried
You touched some wires and shattered me

I was blown into the blue
There was nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you

I rose up to the station
Smelt your scent by the door
You'd stood waiting so patient
Just one wave - then no more

I fell right in love with you
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you

It's all right when you're around, rain or shine

Their faces always seem so pale
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight

I know a man who works the night shift
He's lucky to get a job and some pay
And I like every minute of the day

I dig every second
I can laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain

And so you see that I'm completely crazy
I even shun the south of France
The people on the hill, they say I'm lazy

Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Wake up the kids who hope for ghosts
Did you ever cause their dogs to bark
Their guests to curse their noisy hosts

Don't jump in expectin fun
Don't swagger in there with your elephant gun
Don't enter the cage with wavin chairs
Cos I'll tell you something for nothing
There ain't no bears in there (cache cache)
Not a single bear in there (cache cache)

Did you ever pass the police at work
And hope that they might take you in
Did you ever wonder why music hurts
When someone plays it aloof to sin
Did you ever believe that a smile could cure
A happy face keep you warm at night?
Were you ever fooled by laughters lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite?

Chorus: (as above)

Did you ever finally find a place
A soft warm bed in a room of flowers
And when you finally laid down your face
You found you slept for a hundred hours
A hundred hours.

There ain't no bears in there (cache cache)"

Waking up on christmas morning
Hours before the winter suns ignited.

Including heavens generosity.
Peeping round the door
To see what parcels are for free
In curiosity.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.
How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave.

Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently,
And unaware of everything.
Playing poxy pin ball
Picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything.
I believe in love
But how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened.
Only if he's cured
Will his spirits future level ever heighten.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.

Don't you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said
Many, many years ago when life appeared rosy red
No one ever shared your bed
Nothing ever filled your head
Except yourself and little Ted
And scary dreams that you were dead.
Don't you want to hide your face
When going through your teenage books
And read the kind of crap you wrote
About ""Ban the Bomb"" and city crooks
Think about how long it took
To get over that sudden ""Yuk""
When in the mirror you did look
Well now my son you're well in stook

Cry if you want, ooh cry if you want
Cry if you want, ooh cry if you want
Cry if you want, ooh cry if you want
Cry if you want, ooh cry if you want

Didn't you writhe in anger when you saw the man in his big car
Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far
Should have been a famous star
But that ain't what you really are
You could shout your last hurrah
While they are propping up the bar
Maybe things were better then
Before you led a promised life
Rash commitements, heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised
You fall in love with other's wives
Drive 'em nuts with empty lies
Angry 'cos you lost the prize
Forgot the color of their eyes.

Cry if you want, cry if you want
Cry if you want, cry if you want

Let your tears flow, let your past go
Let your tears flow, let your past go
Let your tears flow, let your past go
Let your tears flow, let your past go

Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were
Yesterday, the day before when you were young with much to learn
Aren't you glad it's your last term
No more acting lowly worm
You can make the suckers squirm
When you tell them how much you earn
Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you feel inside
Does your ego save your face ""I had a go - I really tried""
Now you know your leaders lied
Does it stop you acting snide
Or are you still a boy that cried
Tears now surely long since dried.

Cry if you want, cry if you want
Cry if you want, cry if you want
Cry if you want, cry if you want
Cry if you want, cry if you want

And I'm still living at home

Five inches long.
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along.
I'm dressed right for a beach fight,
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling is still
Here in my brain.

The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool.
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way.
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues,
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll let me stay.

Zoot suit, etc.

Why do I have to be different to them?
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend,
We have the same old row, again and again.
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around,
I work myself to death just to fit in.

I'm coming down
Got home on the very first train from town.

That you kicked out of his bed
Says that he cannot forget you
But he does not wish you dead
Leave his gold watch in reception
He will keep the sixteen stitches in his head
Did you steal his money

Did you pinch my trainer football
Say if you half inched it
Thought I heard a female foot fall
While I washed my kitchen

I want to drive, want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in
I want to hump, want to jump, want to heat up, cool down in a dream machine

I'm dreaming... From the waist on down
I'm dreaming... But I feel tired and bound
I'm dreaming... Of a day when a cold shower helps my health
I'm dreaming... Dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself

Drive like a priest and then I'm shooting lights
I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white
I know the girls that I pass, they just ain't impressed
I'm too old to give up, but too young to rest

I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed
Feeling social when the world is sleeping
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel I'm cemented down
I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping
But here comes the morning
Here comes the yawning demented clown

I'm dreaming... But I know it's all hot air
I'm dreaming... I'll get back to that rocking chair
I'm dreaming... Of the day I can share the wealth
I'm dreaming... Dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself
Hey, hey!
The day I can control myself"

Let me get back to the sea.
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,
Let the tide in, and set me free.

I'm flowing under bridges,
Then flying through the sky,
I'm travelling down cold metal
Just a tear in baby's eye.

Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy and let me be calm
Let the tide in, rush over me.

I am not the actor

Recalling other names.
Rippling over canyons,
And boiling in the train.

And all of me is broke

Four rooms I'd like to lie in
Four selves I want to find

Four girls ringing that I'm trying to date
I look in the mirror and see my face

I get four-dimensional dreams
But I have to think before I take a drink
I get hungover times sixteen

There are four records I want to buy
Four highs I'd like to try
Every letter I get I send four replies
And they don't know which one's from me

Four directions and just two feet

But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you

I'm gettin' sick of this universe
Ain't gonna get better; it's gonna get worse
And the world's gonna sink with the weight of the human race

Hate and fear in every face
I'm gettin' ready and I've packed my case
If you find somewhere better, can you save my place?

Fooling no one but ourselves
Love is dying

Here comes the end
Here comes the end
Here comes the end of the world"

So they rode on his head in their furry donkey.

The kids couldn't hurt Jack,
They tried, tried, tried.
They dropped things on his back,
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied.

But they couldn't stop Jack, 'or the waters lapping,
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy.

Burning in my heart

Tearing me apart

This high blood pressure's got a hold on me

And you get beaten up by blacks
Who though they worked still got the sack
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die's denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts
And when a man is trying to change
It only causes further pain
You realize that all along
Something in us going wrong...

He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He was walking up the Holland Park Road
And I stopped him to ask for a light
He practacally froze when I spoke
But eased when he saw my cigarette
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet

With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said ""I know there's no name
For what you go through
But how can you do it alone.""

I crossed the street to the local newstore
Flicked through some cheap magazines
Beside me some schoolkid I saw
Push some girlie mags down into his jeans
The shop girl was watching amazed
Asked me to call for the police.
She screamed at his blushing young face
And he escaped into the streets.

With eyes full of shame etc.

Do it alone, how can you do it alone,
I need your help, so I can do it by myself.
Do it alone, don't have to breathe down a phone
I ain't got a clue, 'bout the things that you do
But how...can you do it alone.

How can you do it.

Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
And wasn't too keen on me sharing
She came out well after an hour
And by that time I was past caring
Some women it seems have the knack
Of attaining that stars in their dreams
They simply relax and lay back
While people like us scratch our jeans.

With eyes full of shame
And I know it must show
I slump - and I fall and I groan
Will somebody explain
What I need to know
How can you do it alone.

How can you do it.

How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself."

He says he likes a man who's dressed in season
But no one else ever stares, he's being so kind

It was more than a handshake then
I know it still is
But there's a plain fact
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs
I get the willies
People know nothing about their own soft gut
So how come they can sum us up
Without suffering all the hype we've known
How come they bum us up

In sleep I'll hide

Far away from the phone and the conscience going on at me
And on at me, and I don't care what you say
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out

Now the walls are all clawed and scratched
Like by some soul insane
In the morning I hungoverly detach myself
I take no blame
I just can't face my failure
I'm nothing but a well fucked sailor
You at home can easily decide what's right
By glancing very briefly at the songs I write
But it don't help me that you know

Won't somebody tell me?

Imagine a past
Where you wish you had lived
Full of heroes and villians and fools

And you will see the end
You will see the end
And you will see the end
You will see the end

Imagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a man of today feeling new

Imagine a soul
So old it it is broken
And you will know your invention is you

And you will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end

I feel no passion
I feel no fear

I'm dizzy with love

In the gloom of this room
Of this cell down here

I know this place
Isn't truly real
And that like my love
It expands and sprays
The light will find me
Will bend toward me
Yet I'm marooned
In a billion days

I'm drunk with you
And I can't explain
Who or where I am
Or how I'm in pain

Rocking and rocking me
Rhythm is shocking me
Just like a child in your fist
You are knocking me
Rocking and rocking
Autistic, caged I am
Rocking and rocking
And rocking enraged

I am drunk with you
And I can't explain
Who or where I am
Or how I'm in pain

In the ether

I wait for you
Hanging in this mist
That I know's unreal
There is nothing there
There's no you, no me
Even though it's crazy
I still appeal

This is heavenly hell

I have no idea
Who there is to blame"

I dream of all the calls I miss.
I try to number those who love me,
And find exactly what the trouble is.

Yet every word I say turns out a sentence.

Just asking for directions
Turn from being help to being questions.

Said you'd hasten my end
He'll choose you over me

Every ounce of my juice

You'll always want
A little more pink
I'll always need
A little more ink

I'll smile and admit
You were never quite enough

To make you complete
You appear in my dreams
With some new courtier
You need me there to see
What you need to convey

You will never play rough
I'm the one who will scream
But it won't be enough

Up here in the precipice
I'm getting close to my nemesis
People fighting each other to jump into my blues

He stays up all night, a vampire that never dies,
With the blood and the moon in his eyes
I hear his voice when I'm comin' down,
Sleep is for fools, whe never see the sunrise,
Who never get to live twice.

I was a face in a magazine,
When you were still playin' with your plasticine,
Now you're doggin' my tail, ridin' the slipstream,
You can take the fans and the enemies
The little girls who squeeze and tease
Then pass on their social disease,
Go get your penicillin.

I know you young and dumb,
I know where you're comin' from.
Don't know where you're goin' to,
But I bin there same as you,
You're running out of ideas,
And new hats to try on.
I know you middle age
Same song, different page,
I know what you're goin' through
Made the same mistakes as you,
All you want is some hope
And a shoulder to cry on.

There's a stranger inside me somewhere
That shadow behind me, don't even look like me.
An echoed apology.
He's a wolf in sheep disguise,
I wake up in places I don't even recognize,
Pretender in paradise.

It's your turn, step up and take it
If you've got the guts to hang on
You can make.

We soared like the sparrow hawk flied
Then we dropped like a stone
Like the tide and the waves
Growing slowly in range
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth

Sometimes at night, I wake up and my body's like ice
The sound of the running wild stallion, the noise of the mice
And I wondered if then I could hear into all of your dreams
I realize now it was really the sound of your screams

But death always leads into life
But the street fighter swallows the knife
Am I so crazy to feel that it's here prearranged?

The music must change
It's gets higher and higher
Smouldering like leaves in the 1
Then it bursts into fire
Its rhythm grows strong
It's so new and so strange
Like bells in the clouds, then again
The music must change

But is this song so different?
Am I doing it all again?
It may have been done before
But then music's an open door

To grow my own food
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through

That stretched as far as the eye can see
That's a whole lot of cornflakes,
Near enough to feed New York till 1973
Cultivation is my station and the nation
Buys my corn from me immediately
And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea

Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging

How calming and balming the effect of the air

Now look here son
The right thing to say
Isn't necessarily what you want to say
The right thing to do
Isn't necessarily what you want to do
The right things to grow
Ain't necessarily what you want to grow
Your own happiness
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know

Well I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse
And my hands are deeply grained
Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing
Just how lazily he took the strain
Well my pick and spade are rusty,
Because I'm paid on trust to leave my square of cornfield bare

It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air

So I stayed out at another late meeting
And she waited up for another arguement.

If you want her, you can keep her
Cause I can only handle one at a time,
You can take her.
I've got someone waitin' in line
And I'd like to
But I can only handle one at a time
One at a time.

I'm moving on to something better,
There must be something better than this,
She's got me so confused
As to who's being used

Call her up right away
You've got her number
And I promise not to pick up the phone
You can pick her up in your clapped out Humber
I just hope it can get you home

If you want her, you can keep her
Cause I can only handle one at a time,
You can take her.
I've got someone waitin' in line
And I'd like to
But I can only handle one at a time

In any amusement hall.

Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
Plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells,
Don't see no lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always gets a replay,
Never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

I thought I was
The Bally table king.
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him.

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall.

Playing so free like a breath rippling by.

Forever we blend it, forever we die.

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar.
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star.

As people assemble,
Civilization is trying to find a new way to die.
But killing is really merely scene changer,
All men are bored with other men's lives.

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar.
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star.

Gas on a hillside, oil in the teacup,
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy.
Distortion becomes somehow pure in it's wildness,
The note that began all can also destroy.

We all know success when we all find our own dreams,
And our love is enough to knock down any wall.
And the future's been seen as men try to realize,
The simple secret of the note in us all.

I listened and I heard music in a word,
And words when you played your guitar.
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering,
And a child flew past me riding in a star.

Today is the day, the sound travels mountains,
Flowing, blowing each man in it's wake.
Destroying itself in the end with vibration,
There's nothing on earth it's challenge can take.

Excepting one note
Excepting one note, pure and easy
Playing so free like a breath rippling by.

Excepting one note, excepting one note
There once was a note, listen
There once was a note, listen

But the five loaves and the fishes ain't going to be much help,

Before he walks the water he wants his bread.

Take a glass of that light brown ale and a purple pill,
If the air don't get you too sure as hell the pill will,
Oh, mommy, mommy, please may I go downtown?

That Sally couldn't go to the meeting.
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping.
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah.
She picked up a book of her fathers life
And threw it on the fire!

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.

The theme of the sermon was come onto me,
Love will find a way,
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
And sneak out anyway!
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
And decided she'd try to touch him,
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday.

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.

She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine.
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying.
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said 'here we go!'

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage!
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!

But soon the atmosphere was cooler
As Tommy gave a lesson.
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum!
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
And brushed him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man,
Threw her off the stage.

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...
Is to be what you'll be.
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
Mingling with her tears,
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ear
She caught his eye she had to try
But couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night.

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face! OOoooh.

Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said
'don't say I didn't warn yer'.
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild!
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile.

She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her Mother said never mind your part...

As he lectured about morality.
Now I guess the family's complete,
With me hanging round on the street
Or here on the beach.

The girl I love
Is a perfect dresser,
Wears every fashion
Gets it to the tee.
Heavens above,
I got to match her
She knows just how
She wants her man to be
Leave it to me.

My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.

I see her dance
Across the ballroom
UV light making starshine
Of her smile.
I am the face,
She has to know me,
I'm dressed up better than anyone
Within a mile.

So how come the other tickets look much better?
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter.
How come the girls come on oh so cool
Yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool?

Come sleep on the beach
Keep within my reach
I just want to die with you near
I'm feeling so high with you here.
I'm wet and I'm cold
But thank God I ain't old
Why didn't I ever say what I mean?
I should have split home at fifteen.
There's a story that the grass is so green,
What did I see?
Where have I been?

Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand"

With a big padlock
All the little kids would shout
When Silas was about

Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
There goes mingy Stingy
There goes mingy Stingy
Money, money, money bags
Money, money, money bags
There goes mingy Stingy

Silas didn't eat, which was just as well
He would starve himself for a penny
He wore old clothes and he never washed
'Cause soap cost a lot
And the dirt kept him hot
All the little kids would shout
When Silas was about

[Chorus:]

In the back of his head
Was a voice that said
""Someone will steal it all
You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box
The thieves will be having a ball""

[Chorus:]

He bought a safe to put the box in
And a house to put the safe in
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure
And his face was very funny
When he counted up his money
And he realized he hadn't any more

I felt almost demure

And I, I will never let go, I'll never let go
'Til the echo of the street fight has dissolved

I will choose nightmares and cold stormy seas
I will take over your grief and disease
I'll stay beside you and comfort your soul
When you are lonely and broken and old

Now I walk with a man in my face

To get another shrink.

But he never betrays what he thinks.

Can you see the real me, doctor?

I went back to my mother
I said, ""I'm crazy ma, help me.""
She said, ""I know how it feels son,
'Cause it runs in the family. ""

Can you see the real me, mother?

The cracks between the paving stones
Look like rivers of flowing veins.
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane.
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house.
Yesterday she passed me by,
She doesn't want to know me now.

Can you see the real me, can you?

I ended up with the preacher,
Full of lies and hate,
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate.

Can you see the real me preacher?
Can you see the real me doctor?
Can you see the real me mother?
Can you see the real me?"

As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand

Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles

I'm a really desperate man

I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good
And when it's bad I cry

But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it, as my tears fall again

There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it, still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves

Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greeds
Just hear it in the sound of time a-passing

It's been too hard living and I'm affraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

I go to the movies and I go around in town
Everybody there keeps telling me ""don't hang around""
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it will

Then I go to my mother.
I say ""momma, can you help me please?
Help me, help me please? ""
She said ""i'd like to-
I really would. But I'm just not able. ""

And I was right back down
Down, on my knees, oh!

I, I heard

Oh, I heard church bells ringing
And I heard, and I, I heard a choir singing
And I, I saw my love walk down, walk down the aisle
And on her finger he placed a ring and ohh

Right now, I wanna have your attention for just a moment
Because I wanna tell you something that happened to me
And people, it wasn't too long ago
It was back in my hometown not too long ago that
That the only man that I'd ever loved got married to another girl

And on the day of the wedding, when I
When I finally decided to go to this affair
I took a seat at the back of the church so that
So that all of my friends wouldn't see the hurt
That I was feeling in my heart

And as I sat there somebody was playing a tune
On the organ kinda soft and sort of sweet
Here comes the bride and I looked up and
And I saw my man walking down the isle with another girl

And as they reached the altar, I heard the preacher say
Said, “Young lady, do you take this man to be your loving
And your wedded husband, to love and to cherish him
Until the day that you die”

She smiled and she said, “I do”, but then he turned
And he looked at my man and he said, “And young man, do you
You take this lovely young lady here
To be your loving and be wedded wife”

“To love and to cherish her until the day that you die”
And he also smiled and said, “I do”
And I wanna tell you something, I wanna tell you that
That it was so hard for me to sit there and to hear the man that I love
Say those very words

When people, I have waited so long and I had struggled so hard
I had worked my fingers down to the bone to please the man
Whether he was right or wrong
He was getting married to another girl

And when the wedding was coming to an end
And all of their friends was having so much fun
Just laughing and, and talking with one another
He had the nerve to walk up to me and you know what he said

I'm gonna tell you what he said, he said
“Tina, Tina darling”, he said, “Even though we are apart”
Said, “I'm gonna always reserve a 'Send a love spot'
In the corner of my heart”
Now that was the corner of his heart, he didn't even stop to think
What was in the corner of my heart

But it was a little too late for that because
People, the wedding was over with and we're marching out of the church
Their friends was throwing rice all over their heads
But as I sit there by my self

And all, all I could do, all I could do was cry, yeah
Said all I could do, and all I could do was cry, yes, it was
Because I, I was losing the only man that I'd ever loved
Oh, and all, all I could do, oh Lord, all I could do was cry

You're much too loose to hold why don't you ask me how I feel

I close my eyes to follow you
To my surprise you're so untrue
And I'm crying I'm dying

Oh I'm waiting in the storm ask me how I feel
When you keep me hanging on why don't you ask me how I feel
The waters run so deep ask me how I feel
When I don't get any sleep why don't you ask me how I feel

And when you're down you lean on me
You're a fool too blind to see
That I'm crying I'm dying

Oh I'm waiting in the storm why don't you ask me how I feel
What the hell is going on why don't you ask me how I feel
When you stay out late at night ask me how I feel
When you think that I'm uptight why don't you ask me how I feel oh

You don't treat me tender no matter what I do
But I'm the great pretender woah ho ho ho

I'm waiting in the storm ask me how I feel
What the hell is going on
When you stay out late at night you never ask me how I feel
You just say that I'm uptight
When you're down I do for you
And now I find that you're untrue"

Playing games with my heart
Hey now listen, I ain't gonna take one more night
You're the one who broke the rules
And I'm the one who played the fool
Now you're trying to tell me it's alright
You should know better than to hurt a friend
You'll never get another chance again

You'll be back where you started
I know you won't admit it but you're broken-hearted
Back where you started
You think it's gonna be easy but it just gets harder, harder

You had a way with words
One look and I was under your spell
I didn't know should I stay or should I run
You can't deny you told me lies
Love'em and leave'em baby, that's your style
I'm not affraid to take life as it comes
You play with fire I guess you'll never learn
You mess with me babe, you 're gonna get burned

You'll be back where you started
I know how it feels when you've been discarded
Back where you started
You think you got it made but it won't get you far, no it won't get you far

People moving out,
People moving in,
Why, because of the color of their skin,
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide.

An eye for an eye,
Tooth for a tooth,
Vote for me and I'll set you free,
Rap on, brother, rap on.

Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher,
And it seems nobody's interested in learning, but the teacher,
Segregation, demonstration, intergration, determination, aggravation, humiliation,
Obligation to our nation.

Ball of confusion,
That's what the world is today, hey.

The sale of pills is at an all time high,
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky,
The cities aflame in the summertime,
And oh the beat goes on.

Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon,
Kids growing up too soon,
Politicians say, ""more taxes will solve everything,""
The band played on.

So, round and around and around we go,
Where the world's headed, nobody knows

Oh, great googamooga,
Can't you hear me talking to you,
Just a ball of confusion,
That's what the world is today, hey.

Fear in the air, tension everywhere,
Unemployment rising fast,
The beatles new record's a gas,
And the only safe place to live,
Is on an indian reservation,
The band played on.

Eve of destruction, tax deduction,
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand,
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills,
Hippies moving to the hills,
People all over the world are shouting, ""end the war!"",
And the band played on.

Great googamooga,
Can't you hear me talking to you,
Just a ball of confusion,
That's what the world is today, yea-yea,
Just a ball of confusion,
Tell ya that's what the world is today, yea-yea,
Just a ball of confusion, oh!"

We stand face to face

And I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do wanna believe
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith
Oh sure babe, anything to please you

You better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
Cause I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
You better be good to me

If it weren't so beautiful, it would be obscene
Drinking with the panthers, dancing for their life

Come and see the players but don't stay for the show
The cats are out tonight, hungry for their rites

Soothes his soul
Use your powers like Delilah
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power

Delilah's power
I said Delilah's power. . .

Think you can do without a woman
Well I don't think you can
'Cause in every land
There's a woman for every man
Use your powers like Delilah
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power

This is the moment when the gods expect me
To beg for help but I won't even try
I want nothing in this world but myself to protect me
But I won't lie down, roll over and die

All I have to do is to forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died

It's easy, it's easy

Until I think about him as he was when I last saw him
And how he would have been were I to be with him today
Tender in his manner and myself consolation
All I ever wanted and I'm throwing it away

It's easy, it's easy as life

All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the content of the familiar kind of start

It's easy, it's easy

And though I'll think about him until the earth draws in around me
And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love
This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption
Redeemed in my allies and in the pantheon above

It's easy, it's easy, it's easy as life"

Love is a piece of cake
And making love is all there is to eat
It's a heart out of a limb
When yoy start to feel forever in a kiss

But you must remember there's no point of refuge
You only have a part in a lover's play
And you could be the one left in the dark

Tina Turner,Great Spirits,/t/tina+turner/great+spirits_20208881.html,"When the earth was young
And the air was sweet
And the mountains kissed the sky
In the great beyond, with it's many paths
Man and nature lived side by side

In this wilderness of danger and beauty
Lived three brothers, bonded by love
Their hearts full of joy
They ask now for guidance
Reaching out to the skies up above

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain truly
Brothers all the same

Give us wisdom to pass to each other
Give us strength so we understand
That the things we do
The choices we make
Give direction to all life's plans

To look in wonder
At all we've been given
In a world that's not always as it seems
Every corner we turn
Only leads to another
A journey ends, but another begins

Great Spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls
With all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain truly
Brothers all the same

Brothers all the same"

I know about love, and I know

I don't even wanna say goodbye - oh no
I just wanna hold on

Women who have made mistakes
Are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
She's never impressed, by those manly advances
I know, I've only just met you
Maybe, I should know better
But when you look at me that way
There's something inside, that's so right

I'm a new pair of eyes everytime I am born
An original mind because I just died
And I'm scanning the horizon
For someone recognizing that I might have been queen
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation

From the gates of the city where the first born died

With my senses of old and the heart of a giant
And I'm searching through the wreckage
For some recollection that I might have been queen
For every sage that falls there's an ancient child

And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
But the rivers won't stop for me
No, the rivers won't stop to me

I look through it all and my future is no shock to me
I look down but I see no tragedy
I look up to the stars till I find my destiny

This is the life you saved laid out before you
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now
Nothing can change the way I feel about you
Better we go on our separate ways
Nothing is left but the endless days
Nothing to cry but your name

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
I will be there

Maybe this time next year we'll be together
You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies
There was a silent dream, we made a promise
We'd be there for each other forever
Aboard like a ship on an ocean's roar
Beating a path to your open door
Nothing will keep me away

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
Each night I pray to God above
You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
I will be there

Don't you look back, don't say a word

Too breathless too helpless
Too restless to explain needing you

There'll be a storm one night
But you will find my place of hiding
We'll watch the lights like children
Leave the fortress hand in hand
I'll be thunder
You'll be lightning
And we'll collide on dry land

There'll be a storm one night
And I will find no other rescue
Lost and far from home
Crying for some guiding light
Too reckless too helpless
Too hungry to refrain from needing you

There'll be a storm one night
The wind will drive me to your castle
And you'll ignite the fire
Just as if everything were planned

I'll be thunder
You'll be lightning
And we'll collide on dry land
No betrayal

You're so crude
But you're so nice
A boy like you could use some advice

You're so cruel
But you're so sweet
The way you're lookin'
When you're lookin' at me

Well, I'm keeping my thoughts to myself
And with what I'm thinkin'
You know it's just as well

I'm a lady
You can't go messin' around with my heart
I'm a lady
Now you need love
Cause your sweet talk
Won't do a thing for me
I prefer my man sugar free
I'm a lady

You're standing too close to me
A sure sign of immaturity
Young man you shouldn't be so bold
And exercise a little self-control

Uh, remember that we just met
You need to learn to walk
Before you jump ahead

I'm a lady
You can't go messin' around with my heart
I'm a lady
And you're attractive
But you don't go saying things like that
You're tryin' to make me forget
I'm a lady

You should have no regrets
Though you lost out on me
And when your friends ask you who you met
You can tell them that she
That she
Was a lady
I'm a lady

I'm keepin' my thoughts to myself
And with what I'm thinkin'
Yeah well maybe it's just as well

Two can make that scene in the movies

And one can take a walk in the moonlight

Is like adding just a pinch of spice

Scared that he'll get caught

Wish that I could break the shell
Take us from our self-made well
Find a way to lay it down

Hey baby, let me walk you home
Let's dance, let's dance
Do the twist and shout, mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
Dance to the song they're playing on the radio
Let's sway
While colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Watch my love for you
It would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance"

When we finally fell asleep
We couldn't have been further apart

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart
Look me in the heart

You try to say that I'm hiding from you
You act like a spy always looking for clues
You've read about my past
But why don't we try to make a new start

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart
Look me in the heart

Remember how good we used to be together
Remember baby, so be tender baby
Remember the love we said would last forever
I know we can make it like that again

Hide in me, confide in me
Oh, don't you think it's time to be
Everything we ever tried to me
So you and me can lay it down

If it's alright with you, we wanna love you
If it's alright with you, I wanna stay with you
And when the morning sun arrives, you decide if you want me to stay or go

I don't know the answer to the easy way way he opened every door in my mind
But dreamin' was as easy as believin' it was never gonna end
And loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Let's not waste one precious moment
Take all of me, I'm still your woman
And love me until the break of dawn

Burdened by the things I've learned
I'm hurting cause I'm too concerned
Nonetheless I confess I yearn
To find a way to lay it down

Lay it down, lay it down
I wish that I could lay it down"

And it always makes me smile

And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what I might say (missing you)

And I'm sending the signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

Since you've been gone away (missing you),
I ain't missing you (missing you)
No matter what my friends say (missing you)

Via telegraph to your soul
And if I can't breach this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

And the moon was out that night
So we let our hearts go dancing
If that thing is missing in my life

Wanna sing about new lovers
Stand up against the odds
Nothing can change a thing that strong
And myself I know my emotions
I got my love to share
And when you need something so tender
What you're looking for is so rare

Chorus
There's not enough romance in this world

You gotta believe in what your heart tells you is right
And I'm here to say that I believe in love

We take a lot of chances playing some foolish games
But that's the only price that you gotta pay
We gotta keep believing hungry hearts run free
Everybody needs a good loving
It's anything you want it to be"

Trying to make a song fit

In the rhythm and the soul reviews I had a dream I guess

And I had to beat the stagefright
I had to cry all night
Trying to make a song fit

I said - girl, get up and get out of this mess
You're gonna be an overnight sensation
Gonna be an overnight success

And all through the badlands
Rocking on the bandstands
It's so hard in the barbands
When there's no one there who understands
And lady luck will pas you by and she will never say yes
You're gonna be an overnight sensation
Gonna be an overnight success

Chasing after fortune and fame

Have a husband and some children

And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

Tell me, do you wanna see me do the shimmy again?

Y' know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
But there's just one thing
You see we never ever do nothing
Nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're gonna do the finish rough
This is the way we do ""proud mary""

And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Listen to the story

 left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in memphis
Pumped a lot of tane down in new orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turning
Proud mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give"

Outdoor concert, watching him play for me
I fall in love again
He says his music is everything
Helpless, caught by the melody
When he begins to sing
Go on, tell me he's like all the rest

And we could lose it anytime

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect

But I believe in working, then I believe in a little help
Cause I'm not a light unto myself
Without a thing of value, why settle for second best
We don't know what's up ahead
And we can't let ourselves forget

Tears will leave no stain
Time will ease the pain
For every light that fades
Something beautiful remains

We're living in a world of stars and dust
Between heaven and all that surrounds us
We're travellers here, spirits passing through
And the love we give, is all that will endure
Hey now, what we had is gone
But I still remember you
Just like a rose after the rain
Something beautiful remains

Tears will leave no stain
Time will ease the pain
For every light that fades
Something beautiful remains

Now the darkness falls, the sun's going down
One by one, the stars are coming out
Tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand
As one day ends, a new day must begin
Hey now, though we are apart
You're here forever in my dreams
Hey now, love is lost and gained
(what you gonna do about it, what you gonna say)
Something beautiful remains

Tears will leave no stain
Time will ease the pain
For every light that fades
Something beautiful remains

And you wonder sometimes how we carry on
When you've lost the love you knew
But it's alright, it's alright
To your own heart be true"

You make me feel like no one else before
You make me wonder how easy it is to love
You make me wonder how easy it is to love.

There's something special about a kiss
It makes me want no other lover
'Cause you make me feel like this
When you're away I want no other.

I never found what I was looking for
I got to wonder if no star would ever shine
I can't explain it but somehow deep inside
I always knew that when it did I'd recognise you.

There's something special about you
When it comes to you there's something special
There's something special about love

Now I know what it's all about
'Cause in your arms is where I wanna be
In your arms is where I always wanna be, 'cause.

Tina Turner,Sometimes When We Touch,/t/tina+turner/sometimes+when+we+touch_20664850.html,"(Dan Hill)

You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I see how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by

At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides"

Sometimes its hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man

And he'll have good times
Doing things that you don't understand

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And tell the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

But if you love him you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him
Oh be proud of him
Cause after all he's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Keep giving all the love you can

Making up for lost time

Except for a flying visit in a black mercedes
No election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomine

So many people hanging on the edge
Crying out for revolution

In which we learn to fly out of our cage!

Makes big mistakes
And the strong with the perfect

And live a lifetime in a day,
Like some butterflies? Not quite the same!
A lifetime in a day,
In which we learn to fly out of this cage!

So what is the smell of summer like? And
What is the sound of your heart when you're running? And
What is to be fearless like? And
What is to have nothing in mind but plenty of space?

Teach me again! Teach me again!
Teach me again! Teach me again!
Please.."

You know the sun is shining
It's raining in my heart
I don't know what to do
Since we've been apart
Why don't you tell me, babe
What is going on
You know I love you darling
Don't want to be alone

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart

You know I can't go on
Feeling this old way
You know my heart is burning
It's burning everyday
You know I love you, baby
No one else will do
Why don't you reconsider
Do what I want you to

They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart"

You come to me, give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak a language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong, take my heart and make it strong, baby

Chorus:
You're simply the best, better than all the rest, better than anyone, anyone
I've ever met!
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms I could be in no better place...

Chorus:
You're simply the best, better than all the rest, better than anyone, anyone
I've ever met!
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control, you're walking away with my
Heart and my soul, I can feel you even when I'm alone, oh baby don't let go!

Ever met!

The difference between us will keep us together

I tell you my love is everlasting
If you promise to give your best every moment
No, you don't have to compromise
Try to live each other's life
We can be ourselves tonight

If we ever come close
If we ever discover
How to hold on and keep our faith in each other
The difference between us will keep us together

If we open our eyes
Don't look any further
Cos we found all we'll ever need in each other
The difference between us will keep us together

There's nothing that I might regret
No don't play games inside your head

The love that a stranger might receive
You cast your spell and I went under

Can'T make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains

We don'T need another hero
We don'T need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome

Looking for something
We can rely on
There'S gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

All the children say
We don'T need another hero
We don'T need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

So what do we do with our lifes
We leave only A mark
Will our story shine like A light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing

We don'T need another hero
We don'T need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

Some boys got the look of a greek adonis
Some boys try to talk you off your feet
Some boys they're gods gift to woman
Some boys think they're sweet enough to eat
Try to change the habit of a lifetime
Don't even try
Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing
You realise

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love

Some guys got lips that you can't help kissing
And some guys got a smile you can't resist
Some guys gotta build a reputation
They just wanna add you to the list
You got a lot of physical attraction
I can't deny
But can you guarantee me satisfaction
While I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting....

What you get is what you see
Ain't nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I don't want your kind of love

So let me see your cards on the table
Before I buy
I always read the writing on the label
So give me reason to believe there's more to you than meets the eye"

Though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
A boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I read it someplace
I've got cause to be

Well there's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

I've been taking on a new direction
And I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

Oh what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?"

Someone to show you the way

Said you were missing me blind
But the truth is I knew you were lying
You were using me time after time

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)
Won't look over my shoulder
'Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

Time to move on with my life now
Leaving the past all behind
I can make my own decisions
It was only a matter of time
Sometimes I look back in anger
Thinking about all the pain
But I know that I'm stronger without you
And that I'll never need you again

When the heartache is over

Look here brother,
Don't you waste your time on me
Don't waste yer time. ..

I've got troubles of my own, I said
An' you can't help me out
So take your meditations an' your preparations
An' ram it up yer snout
""BUT I GOT A CRYSTAL BALL!,"" he said
An' held it to the light
So I snatched it
All away from him
An' I showed him how to do it right
I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I'd look like I was Deep
I said some Mumbo Jumbos then
An' told him he was goin' to sleep
I robbed his rings
An' pocket watch
An' everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future then
As long as he was hanging around,
I said
""The price of meat has just gone up
An' yer ol' lady has just gone down. .. ""
Look here brother,
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
(Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?)
Don't you know,
You could make more money as a butcher,
So don't you waste your time on me
(Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me. ..)

Whos that knocking on my door
Its gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again coming round for more
Well you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin to you
Hot legs, wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school
I love you honey

Gotta most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand
I'm a working man
Gonna need a shot of vitamin e
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat
Hot legs, you scratch my back
Hot legs, bring your mother too
I love you honey

Imagine how my daddy felt
In your jet black says 'bang me' belt
Seventeen years old
Hes touching sixty four

You got legs right up to your neck
Youre making me a physical wreck
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, in your satin shoes
Hot legs, are you still in school
Hot legs, you're making me a fool
I love you honey

Hot legs, making your mark
Hot legs, keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself
I love you honey
Hot legs, you're wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, you're still in school
I love you honey"
Tina Turner,It Takes Two,/r/rod+stewart/it+takes+two_20117613.html,"(Sylvia Moy, William Stevenson)

One can have a dream baby
Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels

One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can have a broken heart living in misery
Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar like an island he's all alone
Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby
It takes two baby
just me and you
You know it takes two

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

One can go out to a movie looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie something really kind of neat
And one can take a walk in the moonlight thinking that it's really nice
But two lovers walking hand in hand is like adding just a pinch of spice

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two

It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two"

But the hands are clapping
And the place is moving
And I feel it in my soul
It's late at night
And I can't sleep
I gotta write some
Rock and roll

It drives me crazy about
Twenty-four hours a day
It's bouncing all around
In my brain

While the world
Outside is quiet
And the children
Are fast asleep
But here inside
I'm rockin' 'n' rollin'
To a crazy beat

You were all wrapped up in a mystery
You looked good to me

And I needed love I wanted it desperately
But oh, real love, you never came to me

I was caught in your game of make-believe
I was lost in your world of fantasy

Look what you've done to me

You were drawin' me in to a spider's web
With your hungry eyes
I was under your power I was in your spell
I was hypnotized

And oh sweet love: you wore such a strange disguise
So neat love: the way I fell for your lies

Said your whole life's in that bottle

Two strikes against him from the start

She tried to keep him tame

Born under a bad sign

To catch a love blow

Though electric air
Is a blinding light show

I see the face
That has no place
But somehow knows
The truth is clear
But hiding here
In the blinding light show
The blinding light show

The place is strange
The colors change
The dancer slows
And shifts his pace
And lifts his face
Into the blinding light show

A naked heart is
Quickly torn apart
And the burning grows
When you try to think
It only makes you sink
Into the blinding light show
The blinding light show
The blinding light show

And while the crowd keeps
Calling out ""Hoorah""
Their greedy hands
Keep clutching out
""Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah""
The aimless mob is calling out
""Hoorah""
And unseen candles
Burning out
""Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah""
The blinding light show
The blinding light show

And the sounds of truth
Ring hollow
In this pretense world of show
And the footlights
Burn their pathways
As the profits come and go
And the seeming some-day singer
Lives the Carney Barker's dream
Selling all by saying nothing in
The language of a scream
The language of a scream

And the blind shall
Lead the sighted
As we lose the candle glow
No one knows tomorrow
In the blinding light show
The blinding light show
The blinding light show"

Man is a hard one, cold as a handgun
Like I was at the start
But I keep lettin' love get the better of me
My head is spinnin', honey
Can't you see what I need

Oh baby, I want you to hear what I say
I'm a fool for you love

Oh baby, I want you to hear what I say
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love"

It's a hard road
A hard road to follow
It's a hard road,
It's the highway to tomorrow

Hey you, man, what do you know?
It's not so easy on the lonely road
Hey man, where do I go?
Nothin' to win, and nothin' to show

CHORUS

Hey you, human sacrifice,
You paid the road, was it worth the price?
It takes, it takes, it doesn't ask twice
You could win the world,
You could lose your life

CHORUS

You waste each precious moment
Chasing rainbows in the sky
The road lies there before you
Are you afraid to try?

You're so clever,
You're so cool
But you're just another number
Just another fool
How you thirst for sweet revenge
But you're the loser in the end

CHORUS

And when it's said and done And the hard road claims you
Even though it won
No one really blames you
The truth gets lost
But the legend will grow
Yesterday's victim...tomorrow's hero"

Runs through you like a stream
The notes the play flow through your head
Like a dream
Like a dream
Like a dream

I sing this song for the common man
For the people in despair
I bring my song into the world
And I sing it everywhere
The simple truth lies waiting here
For everyone to share
So hold on, and I will take you there
Hold on and I will take you there

Lost without a trace
It hold you down and turns you 'round
And puts you in your place
Another day, another dollar
Another pretty face
Another chance to lose yourself
In the endless race

Hold on, even though it seems
Everyone around you has their little schemes
Listen to your heart and hold on to your dreams

Feel it everywhere
Can't you hear the music
There's something in the air
There's a celebration
Deep within a song
Celebrate this feeling,
You know it can't be wrong

You got to break it
Time won't wait for us,
We got to make it
Fate gives you the chance
You've got to take it
Take it

You say that love is holding you down
I watch you walkin' away
I look for something that could turn this around
There's nothin' I can say

CHORUS:
In the middle of the night...I'm calling
Can you hear me whisper your name
In the dying of the light...I'm falling
But it feels like the morning may never be coming again
Never again, never again

Under the table, under the gun
Under the influence of what
We've become
Heavy consequences for the things that we've done
We should have learned to walk before we started to run
Whatever happened to the love that we had? I feel it
Slippin' away
It started good but now it's ending so bad...look at the
Price we pay

CHORUS

Too many people they walk in their sleep
Steppin' on the promises that they ought to keep
Anaesthetic people, they dance in a dream, but
Things are never quite as simple as they seem
You're keepin' all your secrets inside you
They're gonna tear you apart
Let me come and lay down beside you
Open up your heart

Such a strange situation
Thought I heard somebody cry
I found love, inspiration
We had time, so much to share
Came the night, came the darkness
I reached out and she wasn't there

Chorus:
There's a voice in the night
Cryin' in the night
Can't you hear it
Can't you hear it

So much pain, persecution
Disillusion and despair
I think I need some consolation
I think I need someone to care
All my dreams, gone forever
I feel them fade
And drift away
Now I cry, cry, cry in the darkness
Can't you hear what I'm tryin' to say

Chorus

You tell yourself,
Don't be lonely don't be scared
An' everything will be alright
But the darkness comes
An' then you hear
All those voices in the night
In the night

A time will come when you are lonely
When you get scared and too weak to fight
Then you will cry, cry, cry in the darkness
An' you'll be just another
Voice out in the night

Seemed like yesterday that
You couldn't tear us apart

Too many sleepless nights
Too many jealous fights
It hurt the night I told her
Oh baby, it's all over

CHORUS:
It's over, this can't go on,
All over, cause the feeling's gone
Wonder if I'll survive alone again
Sometimes I just want to hold her
But it's over

Young and foolish of heart
We were two gypsies on the run
Into the setting sun
Shattered pictures tell the tale,
Their crying love is a tragedy
Of tears and broken dreams
Just like a sad old song
Who knows where we went wrong
I dread the day I told her
Oh baby, it's over

Triumph,Just A Game,/t/triumph/just+a+game_20226018.html,"Wizards of a modern age cast spells of electric power
But the corporate strings that make them dance
Lead up to an ivory tower
There sit the fates in solitude, far from the public eye
No one ever sees them smile and nothing makes them cry

Welcome to the kingdom, the land of bought and sold
A world of real-life fantasy where truths are seldom told
Try hard to remember all that glitters is not gold
You can pay the piper, but you cannot buy his soul

Chorus:
It's just a game, you're in it all the way
It's just a game, don't let yourself slip away
It's such a shame, I heard somebody say
It's just a game, and all I can do... Is play

What you do choose, now, what do you believe, now
Who are you gonna trust?
All you dreams and fancy schemes
Just crumble into dust

Calm and cool and computerized to calculate and collect
We wait and watch and wonder
Just which puppet they'll select

Like the moth, too near the flame,
Who learned his truth too late
We're all too deep into the game
That is the master of our fate

The poets and the pipers have got their motives
And you've got yours, no doubt
And so the game continues
That's what it's all about...

We might never get the chance to

Just one night
Don't try to fight about it
Take me I'm yours
For just one night

Don't be alone
And think of what
We could have had,

You ever let this moment pass
You can't deny
We see it in each other's eyes
Close the door
Leave this lonely world outside to

Triumph,Killing Time,/t/triumph/killing+time_20227938.html,"Hanging out on the corner,

Playing the radio.

All the things never tried;
Everyday they're dyin'
Just a little bit more inside.

All the lonely people,
Waiting all their lives,
They're empty and they're aching;
You can see it in their eyes.

Time is slipping away, it's just passing them by,
They're wondering why but it's gone,
Gone forever my friend,
And it won't come again
So don't try to pretend you feel
Fine! Killing time, killing time...

You feel it's now or never,
But the words don't seem to come.
The fabric of your dreams
Starts to come undone.
You realize it's over,
Before it has begun.
You're reaching for something special
But that someone never comes.

You're on your own now,
But you're living out a lie.
This killing time is wasting you,
I can see it in your eyes.

Time is slipping away, it's just passing you by,
You're wondering why, but it's gone,
Gone forever my friend,
And it won't come again
So don't try to pretend you feel
Fine! Killing time, killing time...

The time we waste on hate,
Full of anger and jealousy.
The times we act so cruel,
All the times you turned on me.
All those lonely yesterdays
When we were killing time.
I needed you more than ever;
Couldn't you see it in my eyes?

Time was slipping away,
Passing us by, now I could cry
Cause it's gone. Gone forever my friend
And it won't come again;
It's moved on and left us behind...

Time is slipping away, passing you by,
You're wondering why but it's gone,
Gone forever my friend,

And watch as it happens
Here is New York town baby
You don't trust no one
Or you may soon be face to face
With someone's loaded gun

New York City streets
New York City streets

Standin' on a corner in this heavy New York City
Waits a lady dressed to kill she' tryin' to be pretty
Best believe she's hustlin' just to
Make her man a score
Keep him in the finest style that's
What a good girl's for

Chorus

Harlem star in their big black cars
New York City sidewalks
On a young girl's knee
New York City
Gotta get away,
Gotta get away from New York

But you can't seem to make up your mind
There ain't no way to leave all the worry behind
Callin' out for Lady Luck
She just lets you down
Try to take her as she comes Hang on: Turn it around

Chorus:
On and on it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
On and on it goes
Round and round and it won't slow down

Is this the right place -- the right time?
Nobody gives guarantees
How can you tell the sound of opportunity?
Comin' down to the moment of truth
One word could make it right
I wonder if you feel it too
Hey, maybe we're gonna get lucky tonight

That can feel something's wrong
A broken heart, another lonely night
Still we go on and on and on

Or can you lie to yourself like you're lyin' to me
Do you fall asleep real easy feelin' justified and right
Or do you wake up feelin' empty in the middle of the night
You want to think you're different, but you know you never can
You're just another ordinary man

Hey politician, can't believe a word you say
Almighty media, whose truth d'you sell today?
Watchdog of justice, who keeps their eye on you?
Con man, song in hand, who you singin' to?
The more I get to see, the less I understand
I'm just another ordinary man

Chorus:
Ordinary man
Comes a time to take a stand

No rest for the wicked - they get it while they can
The preachers and the teachers and your local Congressman
Everybody plays the game they played since time began
Lawyers and accountant - your media man

Everybody's talkin' but nothin's gettin' said
You're looking for the truth you better look inside your head
I see the flash of lightnin'
I hear the thunder roll
A hungry knive, a slice of life
It cuts another soul

Power finds a way to those who take a stand
Stand up ordinary man

Once I thought the truth was gonna set me free
But now I feel the chains of it's responsibility
I will not be a puppet I cannot play it safe
I'll give myself away with a blind and simple faith
I'm just the same as you I just do the best I can
That's the only answer... For an ordinary man

No such thing as easy answers
You play to win and you take your chances

May you never doubt yourself

Play with the fire
With a hunger that runs in your soul
Burning desire
Is taking you out of control
There's no fighting it
No denying it
Something inside of us
Driving us closer tonight... Into the fire

The risks that we run will keep it alive
She will come again (2nd time-Here she comes again)
Like a burning flame
And you can't stop the pain of desire,
When she calls to you... Etc

A chance will surely come your way
To say the things you need to say
To play like no one else has played

You learn to turn your cheek and swallow your pride
Coming to the wire, fighting fire with fire
Driven on by this burnin' desire

It may not be the best of worlds, but it's the only one I know

Stringing out lives of quiet desperation

Groped in the darkness, searching for a way

I've got one last debt to pay. ""

Waitin' on the telephone
That never, ever rings

Rock and roll band
Blasting heavy metal right
Across the land

I know if we're good
And we see the light
We could tour the you. S. A.
I think we might
Playin' really loud
To overflowin' crowds
Every night
Party with people and rock until
The morning light

It's taken so long
To make it this far
What's another day
Of rock 'n' roll
It's taken so long
To make it this far
What's another day
Of rock 'n' roll

Well, my friends try to tell me
That we're wasting our time
But I'll put our rockin'
Music on the line
We're going to make it big
Just you wait and see
I ain't letting people
Get the better of me
We're going to make
The people get higher
And I know my moment
We got to set the world on fire

Now people got to line
Wherever we go
Trying to get a ticket
To our headline show
We're packing screaming crowds
In right to the door
15, 000 people watch them
Yell for more
Now everybody calls us
Trying to get a minute of our time
Well I think it's safe to say
Nowadays we're doing fine"

I want to play some rock 'n' roll
I want to sing the blues
Yes I know
I feel it comin'
Let the party roll

When the lights go down
We're ready to play the blues
When the lights go down
It's time to light, time to light, time to light the fuse

Oh no
They're screamin' like the 4th of July
Hollywood comes to your hometown
Hammers cocked and ready to fire
I've got itchy fingers
For the trigger tonight
And I'm tired of waitin'
So tired
Let the party roll"

If romance is a race
So I knocked again
An' marched on in
Said ""Baby let me state my case.
Lovers can be cruel but I don't wanna.
Why must you act like a prima donna?""

CHORUS:
She's a woman in love
She's a woman in love
This messin' around is bringing me down
With my woman in love

You say I'm crazy
No good and lazy
But you keep comin' back for more?
If you're after the money, then back off honey
I've been down that road before
So take it or leave it
But baby don't tease it
Your games are such a bore
I don't understand your philosophy
Why must our love be a tragedy?

CHORUS

I don't know which way to turn
Makin' me crazy try to understand
What it means to be a man
Although I seem cruel I'm tryin' the best I can
Sometimes you treat me so low-down dirty
Baby I think we should...
Sit down and talk it over

Shout it from the rooftops
Sing it to the sky
Stand up for one and one for all
I feel the tide is turning as I
Watch the days go down
I can read the writing on the wall

All the faceless
And all the nameless
Up against the wall: they spell it out for you
Are you searchin', hopin', prayin'
Lookin' for an answer?
Can you meet the challenge risin' up at you?

The changing of the guard, means we
Welcome in the new: but
Every summer surely has a fall
The path of least resistance
Has led me right to you
(And) the writing is on the wall

Chorus:
Writing on the wall: writing on the wall
Stand up and be counted: all for one and one for all
The writing is on the wall

I am up here
Walking on a tight rope
But I
Never pause to think
That I could fall

I've got one short dance
On this planet
But I'll carve my message deep into the wall

So shout it from the rooftops
Sing it to the sky
Stand up for all one and one for all
I feel the tide is turning as I
Watch the days go down
I can read the writing on the wall"

I could have been there by your side
You thought you could walk away, but you know that's a lie
This loneliness is hard to hide

It's so easy to surrender, and temptation always finds a way

Can you imagine a place
Free of boundaries and lies
There's blood on the wind
And it's come all of the way from faraway skies
Take me away to a different world
Where everything's fine

Lost in the blink of an eye

I stopped an old man along the way,
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, Hurry boy, It's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

Would you believe when I say

That I could reach out and touch your face
But as I fall from grace
Into whose arms can I lay

It's always much too late
We get the signs
We can't communicate
Or turn back time

So what will be now
Do you feel somehow
Not so together and not quite as strong
Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

I need a healing wind
To cool the flame burning in my sight
It must accelerate
For two wrongs they don't make a right

And all these solitaires, lone victories
Wars fought in isolation, with none to please

The past is done

Pulled myself out of my bed

Then I realized there's no one left to call

Woah woah
Seems like things ain't what they used to be
Woah woah
Can't cry anymore
I'm alone
Woah woah
Where did everyone go?

I try to walk every morning
And no one looks me in the eye
It feels like love just left the world
And I can't help but wonder why

I have that dream again where I begin to fall
And on the way down like the meaning of it all

No things ain't what they used to be
Woah woah
Can't cry anymore
I'm alone
Woah woah
Where did everyone go?

I fell asleep last night and woke up in the fall
Turned my head and blinked and now there stands a wall

Is through

A burning torch for you

Thought I knew enough

Born yesterday
Guess you're not so tough

Now everything seems to have
A smoother edge
But what really changed was
Suspicion in my head
Was I relieved at my naive display
Put to rest a question I never could explain
You could fool me for a hundred years
But now I won't be
Tortured by my fears

I wasn't born yesterday
Thought I knew enough

Can't afford to put them off anymore
But there's nothing to do to make it right
Cause the path of our fate won't be turned aside
Can't expect anyone to understand
But the answer is in your hands

'cause it's borrowed time
When's the dime running out
Yes it's borrowed time
Just so much life
Without a doubt
Only borrowed time
Who decides, I wonder why
I can't say goodbye

Daylight casts my shadow like the rest
Cause the world keeps going on
And I know that from beyond
You feel my helplessness
But if you were standing here
You would laugh about my fears
Like you always did before
You demanded nothing else
Than you ever save yourself
So what am I frightened for
You were the one
To lead the way
Never fooled by the lights
That lead us all astray
And the last one to think
The worst of things
Doesn't change what
Tomorrow brings

Toto,Burn Down The Mission,/t/toto/burn+down+the+mission_20724652.html,"(E. John, B. Tapuin)

You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Can you hear what I'm saying, can you hear what I'm saying

There are those who say might is right, I beg to disagree

I say put down your guns and stop the revolution
I say it's time we make a restitution, yes

I can make a ship sail on dry land
But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you
Next to you, I just can't get next to you

I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I could live forever if I so desired
Unimportant are all these things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you
No matter what I do

I can turn back the hands of time
You'd better believe I can
I can make the seasons change
Just by a wave of my hand
I can change anything from old to new
The thing I want to do the most I'm unable to do
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl, you're the key to my happiness
And I, wo, I can't get next to you

Will she be thinking of him tonight?

You helped me see when I was blind

It's a crime to live my life without you
Serve out my years in darkness
Inside these walls I'd die without you

Afraid of the hurricane I hide in my domain

Please don't forsake me
In these ruins I call home
I can't wait forever
Don't leave me alone

I have a secret if you wanna learn
I will surrender in return

Holding you in tears
Someone finally hurt you
After all these years
Got to get my message to you somehow

Now you're lookin' in my eyes for courage
Too late to think this through

And there's no way out

You're not giving it up,

You got a little too much doubt
Augmentation,
Is what you need
Your generosity
Looks a lot like greed

You might call me crazy

There's no way for you to know

And you don't demand it

And the plans you made
Start falling 'round you
It's such a cruel world

And pull me out

You've got that kind of love
It flows like a fountain
But sometimes love can be unkind
My kind of love you know
It's higher than a mountain

Oh I - It's a tunnel black as night
Oh I - See a rich man with his hand out babe

You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love

Not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

It's time to break some rules
And stop before the fire in me cools

I got my way
Of getting through to you
And I'm going back where no one's been before
Some day
I'll show you something new
I've got my way
To try and wipe the tears from my eyes

I'm half scared to death
Think I'm right but what if I'm wrong
I've got one shot left
The door is open now but not long
The room's full of faces that I've never seen
Like a million pair of eyes looking down
The smoke is blinding me
But I can still see my destiny

Does it have to be this way
Brought up on hypocrisy

They just fade away

Don't be confused by the lies
Of the fools and deceivers
Hope and believe in the things
That we need to survive

We can make it if we'd only take the gift of faith
We can change it if we'd just accept the gift of faith

Take away my dignity
Take away my hope and my freedom
You got a world full of rage
Don't cover me with apathy
Don't buy and sell what I believe in
Don't lock me in a cage

In a world where no one's alone
Trust should come easily
Just reach out your hand
And I'll give you mine

We can make it if we'd only take the gift of faith
We can chage it if we'd just accept the gift of faith

Don't be confused be the lies

I can finally see a light

I'm driving fast as I can

Going back to the place where my heart belongs
Goin' home

You're the one who must surrender
I think they call it responsibility

With only one compulsion
I've got to follow these dreams inside my heart
I'm not looking for a fight
No one's wrong and no one's right
And maybe we all need time apart
So please understand
I'm doing the best that I can

Strangers in time fighting ancient foes
And that only the way we perceive it
Has changed, it still remains
Somehow it's always right against wrong
Always the chance of temptation
But it's never as simple as black or white
Day or night

Ever searching for secrets of life
Missing the moments of being alive
But most important things can't be told
They're in your soul
Put away all your worry and pain
Destiny doesn't change things
When you find out what you really need
How will you know
How will I know

Well we all need a hero
Of mythical size
To explain what we can't understand
And we all need a hero
To sacrifice his soul
Where's the hero
With a thousand eyes
With another foolproof plan
You only can see through
The strange disguise
Any maybe find yourself
Deep inside this living hell
That knows you oh so well, knows you so well

Now we won't need a hero
With a thousand eyes
To explain what we can't understand
We won't need a hero
To sacrifice his soul
Who's the hero
With a thousand eyes
With another useless plan
Now we see through
The strange disguise
So you can find yourself
Deep inside this living hell
That knows you oh so well
Knows you so well."

Naked and yet not knowing it

Innocence caged in sanctuary
There sat the Dragon Lord
Playing solitairy
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen

In a flash the  brave young man appeared
The Dragon Lord will cut him with his tail
Chased him to the stairway
Caught him halfway to the top
Sent him whirling down
Fireballs, summer solstice

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them
Someday I'll be over you"

Pull the covers over my eyes

All the war planes in the sky

Good deeds go unnoticed
Seems like, like there's no change

It used to be we were
All looking out for everybody else
But now it seems the only law is
Every man for himself

Falling down my eyes
It looks like rain

In the courtrooms and halls
I hear, hear it sounding
Through these paper-thin walls
I can hear people lying under oath
Lovers breaking their vows
I don't want to give up hope
Is it too late now

I just survived

I was the king of the world
I had every thing thrown at me,
That the judge and jury could hurl
I was the man of the hour
I would claw and scratch my way up,
To the very top of the tower

Helter skelter
It's a den of thieves
Sea of errors
That a greedy man weaves

A few really bad apples
Always spoil the lot
Rolling blackouts
On everyone's block

I go to work and try to make ends meet
My life is over

We took a chance, we shook it up, and now the world's upside down

All the fire in your heart
And the heat of your touch I'll remember
And you're dancing like a flame
Perfection in motion
It was the masterpiece from the start
Only you and I could have rendered
And I'll never be the same

And a maze in between the real me and the lover
I'm tired of believing that I lost all my senses
I never though my imaginary dream would be so expensive

Love is a man's world
Love is a man's world
Love is a man's world

Love is a man's world (etc fade)"

Was du weisst ich mag
Must ich unbedingt sein
Alles was ich nicht habe hier in Strall der Sonne
Hier komme ich zu alles was ich will und
Berkomme jeden Bauch in Blicken
Der vor mich ist vor mich habe
Teile von der Welt sind die Wrter die ich sage
Hast du noch eine Frage? Fhlts du was ich male
Es geht nicht um die Sachen, es geht um was zu machen
Ich konnte so viel haben
Und zu wenig zu sagen
Ich mag nicht zu flicken...
Mit dir genau in Haus oder in Garten.

You know, cuando tocan tengo que subir,
I like, para que te sientas bien aqu, para siempre.
I like, vivir lo que quiero vivir,
You know, cuando tocan tengo que subir,
I like, para que te sientas bien aqu, para siempre.
Tengo deseos de hacer cosas que no debo,
Pero creo en un lugar al que voy y llego,
Trato de hacer lo que quiero,
Y si no me resulta voy a empezar de nuevo,
En el fondo todos quieren lo mismo, buscan lo mismo
Pero todo esta lleno de sinismo,
Actuan como si la noche no fuera obscura,
Como si hubiera una mentira pura basura,
En la ciudad de la furia slo habita la culpa y lujuria,
Que surca en la vida de los que ocultan,
Pareciera que sufrieran de amnesia,
O estuvieran en estado de anestesia,
Este es mi ultimo aviso de urgencia,
En primera plana de mi propia prensa,
Todo se trata de fiscos de sumisos,
Y un mundo de abismos,
Entre los mismos ser hurmanos,
Que al dinero son adictos en vano,
Ya no se sabe quin es bueno quin es malo,
De que otra forma puedo explicar a la ye-nte,
Sin prejucios no sumisos libres listo.
I like, vivir lo que quiero vivir,
You know, cuando tocan"

I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

Can we go on this way?
There's nothing left to proof
It's not another game
Or another simple move
Do you believe in me
Believe in me at all?
Are you telling me the truth?
Or is it just imagination or the perfect dream
That I'm here with you

Why don't we make believe that we're sorry
Why must we hold it all inside
Where do lovers go when they're runnin' and there's no place to hide

Always with me - the day we met in the foreign rain
You were content and - we went our seperate ways
No matter which way thw wind blows now, hang on to it anyhow
Don't ever say it could never be the same

As it calls out your name

Reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free

Sun's in my eyes

One solitary life

A voice spoke to me
I could swear it was you that I heard
Crying desperately

That these dreams are free

Only takes a moment
But you must acclimatize

Heard the war horn screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the death-card and a shield

You see an angel as she takes you by the hand
We're walking through mindfields
Her lips are moving like she's praying
We're walking through mindfields
She speaks so softly and you want to understand
What she's saying

There's a stairway leading to the sun
I walk it in my sleep
And a ship of fools above the sky
Who've gotten into deep
With a doorway into nowhere
And the path is way too steep
Don't loose your angry soul
It's yours to keep

Where it ends
It's the beginning
And it stays
Right to the end

The reason is unclear my friend
It almost makes me weep
So don't loose your angry soul
It's yours to keep

I must have aged 20 years in the last seven days
Livin on emotion disbelief and rage
I found out the hard way life is what you make
Sometimes you gotta learn to give yourself a break

You can go where you want to go
You can know who you want to know
Take a good look inside you'll see
You can have it all if you just believe

Time moves in mysterious ways
You're dancin to the music while the music plays
Accelerates and then delays
Time moves in mysterious ways

Accidents can happen and they always do
It only takes a twist of fate to turn on you
I was in the wrong place at just right time
I thought she was a lover not a friend of mine

You can do what you wanna do
You can screw who you want to screw
In the end it's the fantasy
Not reality that will set you free

Time moves in mysterious ways
You're dancin to the music while the music plays
Accelerates and then delays
Time moves in mysterious ways.

And once it's inside of me
It's like a symphony
You're on a cloud and can't come down
It's like a dream then you come around

You can go where you want to go
You can know who you want to know
Take a good look inside you'll see
You can have it all if you just believe

You're dancin to the music while the music plays
Accelerates and then delays

Sent to report on political views
It was by chance through a lens that I met you
A Capetown girl with no shoes

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you

Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh

I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains
The loss of lives mining white man's gold

I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories are bought and sold
I know the city would surely be saddened
If what I knew could be told

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart

I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart

Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind

Black and white
Always go together
And on day and night
You're the precious jewel I treasure

Wanting every part of you is not a crime
Could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Leave all

Oh Pamela
Thousands of miles away but always in my heart

Pamela
So don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all
Leave all beind

I still love you little girl
I still love you
And you know it little Pamela
I still love you yes I do
And you know it little Pamela
Come on

Staring through the looking glass
You will meet your own collision
When your conscience comes to ask

Steal the love from those around you
Help yourself to everything
Take the shelter that surrounds you
It leaves you standing in the rain

Tell me if the money can heal you
Do I have to pray to make it end?

On the Spanish steps of Rome
I kept searching through the allies
Kept searching through the catacombes that night
I closed my eyes and threw a coin in the fountain

Like a beggar beneath the moon lit dome
Near the Spanish steps of Rome
I heard a voice as I looked through my fingers

He was a spiritual man

I wanna be a prince, not a king or a warrior
I wanna have a special light in my eyes
Wanna climb up a mountain, find a tree of wisdom
I wanna feel good when I cry

And maybe someday I could be a teacher
I want that karma when you touch my hand
I'll walk through the streets,
Talking to the homeless in winter

I wanna be a spiritual man, yeah

I heard about a man who was born in the desert
He rode for days and nights across the sand
And one day, he came upon an angel
The angel said, ""Hey you, you're gonna be a spiritual man!""

Made up of fire

And why you are here
If you had power
Who would make you disappear

It seems like the worst
Just ain't good enough for you
There's talkin', there's doin'
There's writing
Of things you don't know
The story's the same
But the answer is always unknown

Well-intended lies, contemplating alibies
Is it really you, or is it me I'm blaming
A distant memory flashes over me
Even though you're gone, I feel you deep inside
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

Chorus:
I can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you, girl

There's a window in a heart, I've tried to look through from the start
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking
Someone's broken something new, another altered point of view
Just a certain someone's conscience playing

I held it in my hand, I did not understand
What lives inside the wind that cries her name
Tried to catch a shooting star, what seems so close can't be that far
I'm living in a dream that's never ending

Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few

And the world goes round and round

She goes straight for the heart
She serves it sweet and cold

It's just the only thing that she's ever known

Boy sees girl on the poor side of town
A city princess with her very own crown
He's too young to be taking such a chance
'Cause she walks the streets in the name of romance

Everywhere she goes he's there and she knows
He's just another fool who cares
And the world goes round and round

Stuck my head out for a peek
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognise
Running down my back street
My heart skipped a beat

You better watch out, there's a stranger in town
You better watch out, there's a stranger in town
You better watch out when he comes around
Don't make a sound

Got the morning paper and the headlines read:
""Danger to the queen""
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up
The son of a bitch is mean
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job
Acting like nothing's new
Scotland Yard's still looking for him
But he doesn't leave a single clue

Who's this man who fell out of the sky?
What's he done and where's he live?
How can a man who's a criminal be a hero to the kids?
The old couple swear that the ripper's back
They say it's him all right
The young girl says it's Jesus and he won't be back again tonight
I wonder who's right?

When she decides she can
It's apple dan, he's just the man
To pick fruit off your branches

His cattle off my ranches

And I guess I lost the feeling

For the things that I have done
Do I set my boat upon the sea

So like thunder I am breaking free
In the landscape of the heart
It's hard to tell what's really taken me

Now I see it all through different eyes
This emotion can't be wrong
Past the mountains under empy skies
And the road goes on and on...

I've been living through this poetry
Tangled words and worn out prose
Love is needing, love is bleeding me

Now I see it all through different eyes
This emotion can't be wrong
Past the mountains under empty skies
And the road goes on...

Toto,The Turning Point,/t/toto/the+turning+point_20139774.html,"I went down to the highway
That runs between love and pride
And I tried to get sideways
Across the great divide
But my mind's eye's on the key ring
Crying in misery
'Cause it won't spend one more evening
Staring back to me

It may be by choice
Or a small inner voice
I can't say
When you add up the cost
We all have a cross
How do you write off the loss?

Where do I go from here?
How do I find my way?
When is it loud and clear?
That there's no turning back
No looking back

Where do I go from here?
Nobody gets away
It's a new kind of fix
For the poor and the rich
You never know what's coming next
At the turning point

The rules are unwritten
And nobody knows the deal
Where have I been driven
Are demons behind the wheel?
Yeah, I know my days are numbered
We're only flesh and bone
And I've been left to wonder
How it went so wrong

Is it all tailor made?
Can the sinner be saved?
I can't say
So don't hang your hat
On the knife I'm my back
'Cause nobody treats me like that

Where do I go from here?
How do I find my way?
When is it loud and clear?
That there's no turning back
No looking back

She is watching the detectives, ""ooh, he's so cute!""
She is watching the detectives, when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
They beat him up until the teardrops start,
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.

Long shot of that jumping sign, visible shivers running down my spine.
Cut the baby taking off her clothes.
Close-up of the sign that says,""We never close""
You snatch a tune, you a match a cigarette,
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet.
I don't know how much more of this I can take.
She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake.

She is watching the detectives...

You think you're alone until you realize you're in it.
Now fear is here to stay. Love is here for a visit.
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit.
Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay,
it only took my little fingers to blow you away.

Just like watching the detectives, don't get cute!""

I get so angry when the teardrops start,
but he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.

While my guitar gently weeps

Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps

With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

While my guitar gently weeps

Look at you all...
Still my guitar gently weeps."

How can you touch the sorrow
With a leather gloved hand
When you summon the winds of anger
Just as fast as you can

You crucify an orphan
With the rainbow in your eyes
Then you send out invitations
And address them with his cries

I, I don't even know what's right

I've been branded
I've been stranded
I'm so thankful for what I've been handed
I wish I could say that you're mine

No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding each other while the words all break it
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end

Now I convinced myself that nothing could ever tear me away
And I convinced myself that we'd look back and laugh at this one day
Two lives collidin' baby
We got too excited for our own good

No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding our breath while the truth all breaks it
Move on ya know we'll be stronger in the end

Hey wait hey don't you wanna hear what I have to say
Hey wait hey don't you know that this is where the strong go on

And all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was you

No more - hold on we can make it

How many times will you push me out of your way

Maybe somebody will show me - a better way
Maybe somebody will know me - someday

Inside my dreams, your answering machine
You're always there and everywhere in between

That you wont be there now
But I still have these words that you gave me

Always remember I'm by your side

I got two kids of my own now
They grow up so fast
And how I wish you did not miss that part of who I am
But I keep doing all that I can do
And I will smile when they ask about you
And I will sing to them every day
With voice and the words that you used to say
Will change the world one day

Always remember I'm by your side
Always remember I'm by your side

And while they grow up you will show up
In things they do and say
Like a reflection to a connection
Of who they'll be one day
They will learn to get their wings
And fly through the changes life will bring
So on
And it will go on
And you will go on

And they will sing with the voice that you gave them
Always remember I'm by your side

I loved her just the same
And though I rode a different road
And sang a different song
I'll love her till my last breath's gone
Like a river made of silver
Everyone came running to the scene
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

Late that night she got away
I chased her to the turnpike
Then lost her where the music never plays
And though I rolled upon the stones
And fell into the water
I'll love her till my judgment day
Like a sunrise made of white lies
Everything was nothing as it seems
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh

I hear voices calling all around
I keep falling down
I think my heart could pound right out of me
I see a million different ways
To never leave this maze alive

I woke up in somebody's arms
Strange and so familiar
Where nothing could go wrong
Barely alive or nearly dead
Somehow awake in my own bed
And there you are
Like a highway headed my way
Life is but a dream
I was shot down by your love
My angel in blue jeans

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

It falls into the night
The air is still and he's still calling her, hey Avery
Is there room enough for me, it's been so long
Is there something you should say to me, Avery?

Pity drives him down, his candle burning out
She thought it was the answer
Her pity drives her down, her years are burning out
She thought it was the answer
Her cross still hanging in the corner
She's afraid to take it down
It reminds her she's gotta start life over

Hey Avery, Is there room enough for me, it's been so long
Is there something you should say to me, Avery?

Pity drives him down, his candle burning out
She thought it was the answer
Her pity drives her down, her years are burning out
She's dying from the answer

She wears his picture on a chain
She prays that the pain won't last forever
And I know that she's still praying
That the pain won't last forever

Did I crash or just slide
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up to your wayside
Did I hurt you or just slide in

Every single memory of me and you
Every letter, every note, every dress you never wore under your coat
Thrown away
Brick by brick, we can build it from the floor
If we hold onto each other, we'll be better than before.
And brick by brick, 
We will get back to yesterday
When I made your body shiver and
When you took my breath away, 
You took my breath away.

The sky has made it back to blue, 
Everything that's left is telling us the worst of it is through.
Home has never felt so right, there's nothing in the way.
There's nothing in between us
Knowing where we're going is inside.
Every letter that I wrote, 
Every dress you never wore under your coat
Thrown away
Brick by brick, we can build it from the floor
If we hold on to each other, 
We'll be better than before.
And brick by brick, 
We'll get back to yesterday.
When I made your body shiver
And when you took my breath away.

All the pictures that we've taken
And the songs that we have played
They have all kept track and
Followed back the love that we have made.
Now they're spread out on the
Surface where we can try to congregate
It's not too late to believe that we can get it all again
Brick by brick, we can build it from the floor, 
If we hold onto each other, 
We'll be better than before.
And brick by brick, 
We'll get back to yesterday
When I made your body shiver and
When you took my breath away, 
You took my breath away.

Replaced greed with gratitude
Then replaced a pretty key dude

Never judge a book by it's cover
And never judge an ugly duckling by his mother
The frog prince got kissed, her lips granted his wish
It’s a sad world when your net worth determines your lover, but

And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing Queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours

[Chorus x2]

Calling all you angels [Repeat till fade]"

I would say no way , what kind a game you playing?
My feets in the sand , the sun’s got a plan to make me tan
Oh all I know is the snow can take a holiday
When you get here Margarita wine
Just don’t forget the line
And if you’re feeling so, this mistletoe
Ain’t got nowhere to go
No no, high Sierra goodbye
Christmas island hello

Wrapped in swaddling clothes, the prince of peace
The wheels start turning, torches start burning
And the whole wise men journey from the east

Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

A shepherd on the hillside, went over my flock I bide
On a cold winter night, a band of Angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice say, ""Fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born King""

How a little baby boy bring the people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies
Why a simple herdsmen such as I
And then it came to pass, he was born at last
Right below the star that shines on high

She was mine when love meant nothing to me

Is just another cruel reminder
Knowing that I'll never find her here
Coming home

Jumping up to see if there's anyone here
That knows what I mean

Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Now that she's back in the atmosphere

Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you... Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone

Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the milky way

Would I feel better if I had the keys?

I said why wait your my soulmate
Took her by the hand in the golden state
Now that your mine things are gonna be fine... 

First came love and a baby carriage
Hardly knew the people at my own damn marriage
Where an open bar can open your mind

You shine your light for me to find the way
Just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
Here with me born to be
Every part of you in Half Moon Bay...

We stay inside while the rain clouds form
And thank god for rainy days like these

Just when the time has come to retire
Baby starts cryin so we dance by the fire
Always does the trick you better believe

We all know it's in the stars already
Oh ohh oh ohhhh

You just go to go where it feels like home

Did you give it all you got?

'Cause somebody told you that you're not the one for them

They were cheating on you anyway

Here's to us, we were at the top

The time we had together, ooh
Love is not suppposed to stop
If you forget, I will remember

Did you ever get drunk because of love
Did it put you in a funk when it was over
Did it pick you up high, knock you down low?
Did it make you wish hard that you didn't know
Are you still going hard 'cause I am
Better by far, because of them
And together we will never let 'em get the better of us now

Here's to us, we were at the top
And here's to never knowing when we're not
The time we had together, ooh

If you're up, if you're down
If you're lost, if you're found
Just remember that we're bound to love
If you're up, if you're down
If you're lost, if you're found
Just remember that we're bound to love

And just be glad we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space

He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby

Never gonna let him go

In spite of ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds
Honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
Dancin' in our eyes.

Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs
She takes a lickin'
And keeps on tickin'

He's a wacked out werido and a lovebug junkie

To set this day in a whirlwind rush
After finding out the backseat changed our lives

And here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone

Crazy how that shipwreck meant my ship was comin' in
We talked till the sun went down

I would have wished in '92, for a mermaid just like you
Whoa, just like you, whoa

Shocks scream with envy, they wonder what you see in me
Funny thoughts sometimes can't help but wonder that as well
Now life is a holiday, making up for the years I paid
The way to this heavenly bay... It went through hell

Till I got her, had I known it could come true

Puttin' up a candle to you, they don't have a handle on you, they don't have a scandal on you
Holler back will save you

What do you want do you think I say

Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in
Their hair said hey boy do you wanna score
And you know how it is

I really don't know what time it was
Whoa whoa whoa
So I asked them if I could stay awhile

I didn't notice but it had grown very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind

Just then a police man stepped up to me ask us said
Please hey would we care to get in line
Get in line well you know

They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
He said that his friends would all drop by
Oho oho oho

Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see and baby baby do you like it

There you sit sitting and staring like a bump on a shelf rusting
I'm not trying to fool you

You really don't care if they're coming
Whoa whoa whoa
I know that it's all a state of mind

If you go down in the streets today baby you better
You better open your eyes whoa oh yeah

Folks down there really don't care really don't care don't care really don't
Which which way the pressure lies
So I decided what I'm gonna do now

So I'm packing my bags for the misty mountain where
The spirits go now over the hills where the spirits fly

In the middle of a soup bowl in the sky

You can ride on, it ain't free
Leave a light on, so you can see
How to get back when you go

How to make ends meet
How to lose, how to win
How to stay on the seat
How to use momentum to keep the two wheels straight
How to wait after it feels like you waited so long"

'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from a distant land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's December it
And reassemble it oh yeah

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Chorus
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time

Ho, Ho, Ho
Ho, Ho, Ho
It's Christmas time

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
If Santa Claus would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
And let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

Chorus

I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow when
They believe again

Dishes in the kitchen sink like dreams that never fade
A wild imagination of convicts in the yard
Never enough time to make ends meet
So they put it on a credit card, don't we all?

You may not know just where you came from, but once upon a time
There was a carpenter, a bartender, a broken fishing line
Just south of Royal Teeth in the town that I came from
There were architects and astronauts
But the only one she loved was a prison guard

And that's the only time I ever saw true love

And Erica's a girl I liked in Georgia
Alone and kept me warm up in Eugene
I guess my mother bless her heart
Set the bar too high to start
What's fine enough, for me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard

There's a gate that needed painting, clothes that needed clean
They'd say there's time enough for that when the fun has all been seen
Cause when we're laying on our death bed, a promise we won't say
Wish we would have worked more, baby
Instead of loving you that way, no way

And that's the only time I ever saw true love

Segourney is a girl I met in Brooklyn
Herris got me close in New Orleans
I guess my mother bless her heart
Set the bar too high to start
What's fine enough, for me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard

I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are

Betty is a girl I knew in Charlotte
Charlie left for Sydney yesterday
I guess my mother bless her heart
Set the bar too high to start

The way you disappear,
You don't understand me,
The way I keep us here.

This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own,
This is not your life.

We were only children,
But you knew the game,
And you were busy feeling,
That someone had to take the blame.

But I know how you're really,
When no one's around,
We were only children,
Looking to be found.

This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own.
This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own.
This is not your life...

Even after the fall,
No one ever seemed to care,
And now you come back to call,
And you want me to be here.

I know how to do it on my own,
This is not your life,
I know how to do it on my own,
This is not your life,
And I know how to do it on my own,

Tuesday morning, 
Came alive, 
I didn't know ya
Route 66 is gone, 
And Reagan's here, 
It won't be long

Nintendo comes, 
Live Aid, too, 
Back to the Future
Where were you, 
While I spent all my days
In Catholic school?

In '89, 
The dream begins, 
First in line to California, 
Pete Rose is banned for good, 
The Simpsons come to Hollywood, 
Russia leaves Afghanistan, 
Flight 103 ends Pan Am, 
Bush is here
This is the year
That I feel most alone

No more
Countin' down the hours
No more
Wishin' you were here
I stopped believin', 
Although Journey told me 'don't'
Before I call it a day, 
Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year

In '92, 
A boy is born, 
The skies were blue
In Ohio
Boris Yeltsin chills, 
Freddie dies, 
But Queen is still, 
Barcelona has the games, 
Lady Di is single again, 
Clinton wins, 
And I still dream
That I'll find you someday

In '97, 
A baby girl, 
Adds some heaven to the world, 
Tony Blair tips the scales, 
Elton sings for the Princess of Wales, 
Microsoft buys into Mac, 
My dad has a second heart attack, 
And Train leaves San Francisco
In a thousand-dollar van

No more
Countin' down the hours
No more
Wishin' you were here

Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year

2001, 
The towers fell, 
The World is stunned, 
I wish I knew ya
I was on a plane, 
The world would never be the same
The artificial heart is born--
Ironic when New York's is torn out
Woah-oah-oah-oah

2004, 
Began in May, 
On tour when I met ya
Facebook joins the Internet, 
Oldsmobile joins the cassette
I met your family
It took a while until you kissed me, 
But when you did, 
I finally felt at home

I stopped believin', 
Although Journey told me 'don't'
Before I call it a day, 
Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year
Maybe this'll be my year

2012, 
And all I know
Is everybody comes and goes
Everybody sings and cries, 
Makes the grade and takes the prize
In somethin', nothin', I don't care, 
Because I always know that you'll be here
With me"

In New York martini it literally floored her
And we played Miss America over again
And again and again,

Oh, the light was a New York Christmas baby
Oh, it was the way it should be done
Oh, we saw the sights, tinsel and lights
Looking down the barrel of a gun

The winters gone warmer than last years got colder
And we all have some things about how the time goes
That we rather not know
Oh, the light was a New York Christmas baby
Snowflakes like diamonds in her hair
And we watched them all, sparkle and fall
Something almost true was in the air
Yeah that, was a New York Christmas baby
Yeah that, was the way it was back then
Oh we saw the sights, tinsel and lights
You kissed in the snow and that was when
I feel in love with Christmas once again"

What I’ll give to hear that sweet familiar, here I’m home
Nothing here is Christmas dear, until you come to town

To the smell of burning bridges
And the sound of those alarms in my head, 
We should have stayed in bed

But we held them up for ransom anyway
When the coldest days of winter were
The summers that we took aim at the Bay
And grateful wasn't dead

And like your lips were only made for me to kiss
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this

While the girls all danced beneath a burning man
And the last waltz did somersaults to finish off the Band
Where they began in a wonder Winterland
All we ever wanted was to be alone
Learning how to fly to Sly, trying to find home
Underneath the Family Stone

And just like New Year's Day was made to reminisce
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this

Love and stardust settle on us like a net
While Buckley's ""Hallelujah"" fills our ears from your cassette
While my heart stops beating, and you stop breathing, Juliette

You're the only thing I'm ever gonna miss
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this"

When it rains it pours and opens doors
And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry
And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye

[Chorus:]
And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go

Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

[Verse 2:]
And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before
And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away

[Chorus:]
And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave

[Verse 3:]
Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
But with you I can spread my wings
To see me over everything that life may send me
When I am hoping it won't pass me by

And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me
There you are to show me

Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me

And we tried like hell

I take a deep breath with my hand on the door
Afraid 'cause I'm not gonna see you anymore

I'd say anything, but not goodbye
I will run with your changes and I'm always on your side

Words they'll try to shake you
Don't let them break you
Or stop your world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as I would and let them burn

Like stones in your pocket people try to wear you down
Someone always wants to take the love you've found
So let's runs with these changes and I want you by my side
And there's not a word I've ever heard that would make me change my mind

Words they'll try to shake you
Don't let them break you
Or stop your world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as I would and let them burn

Let them burn
Let them burn
Underneath every word somebody's heart been broken
With or without words we try to forget

Words they'll try to shake us
Don't let them break us
Or stop our world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as I would and let them burn

Words they'll try to shake you
Don't let them break you
Or stop your world, stop your world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good

You made me feel like the next James Bond
Double O seven oh hell, you were heaven to me

But while you were saying what I wanted to hear
You started breaking ground on a new frontier
Always making love but never to me

So get on your way to making someone else feel low
Then higher than they ever thought they could go

And think about stuff
These eyes got too wide seen too much of life's goodbyes
Should have spent less time making loot
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you

And everybody upstairs, everybody down stairs
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

'Cause I'll be hanging out with you

Not Jimi Hendrix, Jesus or the dude
Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles
You not Chris Farley Mr Rodgers oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom

Life is good, but love it's better
Even Bieber ain't forever
We all got to go you know
So you might as well go in style
Everybody prayin, everybody singing
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

'Cause I'll be hanging out with you

Not Gilda Radner, Buddha or the dude
Who had pop rocks and soda at the same time
You, not Jesse James, Paul Newman and oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom.

I'm not making light of things
But who's to say who's right with things like this
There's so much that we miss
Tryin so hard to be rich and famous
Pretty and thin, to win
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young

So forget everything and just be with me here now
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot

You, not Etta James, Bob Marley or the girls who won my heart along the way
You, not Sitting Bull, Ella or Bach and I almost forgot
You can finally meet my Mom
You can finally meet my Mom
You can finally meet my Mom
You can finally meet my Mom

No Steve Jobs, or Ty Cobbs, Al Capone or any other mobs
No Whitney Houston, Chet Baker, Andre the Giant or the Undertaker, just you.

You're black and beautiful, yellow, tan
You're white as light and soft as sand
With greens and greys and oh for days
A silver lining on the way you cover everyone
Just like a morning sun
You turn me into someone I would rather be

Ooo- I love your every color
ooo- I love your everything
You wear the day around you
Like it's yours to stay around you
Maybe I could stay around you too
If that's alright with you

You're coffee brown and bubble gum pink
And oh I think the shade of you is on the brink
Of changing all the ways I see the world
I could drown inside a single drop
Of all the kinds of things you got
And all the kinds of things I'm not

Might just give me a chance to see
From way up where you are
Above the silent stars
Just dancing in the sky

You're better than any rainbow
You're brighter than the sun
You look like my first day of summer
When my spring is on the run
You're gold and more gold
And you're platinum too
With snow toned, copper attitude
I don't know what I'd do without you
I don't know what I'll do about you"
Tim Minchin,Angry,/t/tim+minchin/angry_21049744.html,"I don't think... I think I repress a lot of stuff
Like, not just my anxiety and stuff
But my anger and things... Like...
I- I'm really non-confrontational
So I tend not to tell people when I'm feeling cross
With them and whatever, and I think surely... I suffer
Because I don't wanna... Hurt other peoples feelings or
Something.

I went and saw a psychologist recently and talked to
Him about this, and he agreed that I need to find a way
To express myself more... You know, when I feel angry
With people.

So what he said I should do was write my feelings down.
That way... Expressing myself without confrontation.

So I've done that, I've written some of my feelings
Down in a poem. I think it might help if I could do it
For you guys.

The poem is called Angry... Or, or or... In brackets
Feet...

Bit nervous...

Sometimes... Sometimes I get a bit angry,
But you couldn't tell.
No you couldn't tell,
Unless you looked real closely.

Sometimes I get a big angry.
But it's alright,
Yes it's alright,
Because I keep it out of sight.
Inside,
Deep inside.

I breast-fed until I was 9.
Which my... Quack... Doctor, says is fine.
And he also thinks I'd deal with anger better
If I wrote about myself in a poem or a letter.

My mother was a... Real fucking bitch... Caring lady.
She taught me all I know.
Although I was a little slow,
She never gave up,
She never let me... Slap... Down.
Although she spent a lot of time
At the neighbours house when my dad was out of town.

I didn't walk 'til I was 7,
Or talk 'til I was 10.
But neither did Napolean,
According to my... Quack fucking... Doctor.
Who has certificates in frames
To substantiate his... Dodgy fucking... Claims.

My father left my mother,

For the love of a... Poontang... Nother.
And I have a... Bastard... Brother
Who I've never really known.
Because m'dad moved out to colac
And he doesn't have a... Bullshit you fat c***... Telephone.

In primary school I had trouble making... Ashtrays...
Friends.
An issue which has become somewhat of a trend.
The origin of which I cannot pretend
Has not perplexed me.
Although my... Quack, fucking... Doctor says it's cool
And that loads of... Fat freaks... Fuck you!... Kids at
School
Have problems with communication.
And that a course of medication
Would be wise,
And combined with more honest self-expression,
Could help me with my issues with emotional repression.
And at 90 bucks a session,
I think I'll take the... Thieving, quack, bastard...
Lovely chaps advice.

So I quite like... Porn... Photography.
And books on... Guns... History.
And I'd like to be a... Politician... Vet.
And I feel as I get older,
I'm more in control of my violent tendencies
And when I die... Kill... Die
I'll have no regrets

And I feel that all this writing is really... Poofy...
Exciting,
And my... Quack, doc, quack, fucking... Doctor would be
Proud.
Because I feel a lot less angry,
And I'm saying stuff out loud,
And I'm letting anger out.

Like today in our last session;
When I taught the... Quack... C*** a lesson.
'Cuz he said I'm not progessing,
Said I wasn't moving forward.
So I said, ""well let's see how you move without your
Fucking legs. ""

And I tied him to his chair,
And I pulled out my machete.
And I listened to him beg,
And then I cut his fucking feet off.
And while he lay there bleeding,
I used his feet...
To kick him in the head."

I won't be fooled by her vulgar charm
It is the easiest trick in the book
Music's the worm and beauty's the hook
And I'm sure you would swallow her whole
But I'm not here to satisfy souls
For...

Beauty is a siren
Trying to draw me from my chosen mission
I won't be tempted by her seductive singing
On principle, I refuse to be party to her abuse
It is not my job to squat in the gutter
Sharing the teat with you beauty-drunk suckers
You paid to see satire and rage
I swear I won't let beauty set foot on this stage
For...

Beauty is a harlot
A spotlight-hogging, superficial starlet
She will toy with your defenceless heart and leave you
Tear-streaked when the lights come on
You look around to find her gone
And despite your size, you've not a clue
That as you fell for her, she stole from you
For...

Beauty is harlot
She will lie with any two-bit artist
And for all those other bloody bastards

But she comes so hard

I love cheese, but it's plain to see
That cheese... Doesn't love me
I am such a fool in love
I just cannot get enough
But it's an unrequited love
I can feel it in my guts

I spend the nights, tossing and turning
My stomach is churning
My heart is a-burning
My nightmares are turning upon me and shame me
To drive me insane, oh the pain, I complain, on my brain
And I wake up, with sweat on my brow
I know I gotta give it up and I must do it now
But instead in the morning when my wife is gone
I find myself back on

And I know that it's wrong but I'm soon navigating
To real mature stuff and skanky old ladies
Feeding my fetish for fettered old fetta
Photos of friesian on beds of bruschetta
The worse they smell, the more they swing
The faster the speed, my mouth gets wet, oh god

Oh god, oh god!

'Cept perhaps last night's half-wheel of post-midnight double cream brie
Trying to replace my fondues with fon-don'ts
Trying to develop strength of will, but I know that I won't
I have found love is never fair
We should be such a marvellous pair
But each time I bring her home she goes and renders me comatose
And leaves me with self loathing slumped on my chair

I cannot camen-bear it anymore
E-damn you, mon amour
Everytime I lead you through the door
I end up curled up on the floor
Oh god, my poor heart is too sore, so no more

But before I give you up, I just need one more tiny taste
To leave you like this, would be a criminal waste
Just one more tiny taste, darling please
Just one more little sliver of C-H-E-E-S-E

And then I could have linked it to the ups and downs of existence
I could've flown in in a 'copter
Rode in on a chopper
Drop down on a wire
Emerge from a fire
There's only one place for the genuine stars
And that's hanging out in bars

Nothing ruins comedy like arenas
That is a well-established fact
But your enjoyment is not as important as my self-esteem is
My ego's the only thing you can see clearly from the back

But I'm quite famous now, so suck my balls
I've sold my tickets, my job is done, fuck you all
Who cares about quality? This is not about you, this is all about me
And my tiny little penis, and flogging dvds

So bring it on, bring it on
Fuck the punters, bring it on
I am a rockstar, motherfucker
And I won't be one for long

So bring it on, bring it on
You gotta make hay in the shining sun
You gotta rock all the way up
'Cause the only place to go from here is down

But I'm trapped for now
And the fact for now
Is there's no escaping this
I'm wearing baseball caps to hide my face
So the paps don't snap my kids
All I ever wanted was to sing my little songs
But now I'm pregnant in Hello Magazine
And I'm overweight in Cosmopolitan

So bring it on
Before too long my wife and kids will be gone, gone, gone
And I'll have wanked myself to death
In the penthouse suite of the Four Seasons
So bring it on, bring it on
Phone the hookers, stoke the bongs
I am a rockstar, I've got my own orchestra
I can do what I fucking want

I thought fame would make me happy
But she's a fickle, cheap romance
No one even listens to my lyrics
They just wanna see me dance

I'm in a cage (all the real stars are hanging out in bars)
I'm in a cage (hanging out in bars)
I'm in a cage (all the real stars are hanging out in bars)
I'm in a cage (hanging out in bars, bars, bars...)"
Tim Minchin,If I Didn't Have You,/t/tim+minchin/if+i+didnt+have+you_20761885.html,"Yeah, yeah
If I didn't have you

If I didn't have you to hold me tight
(If I didn't have you)
If I didn't have you to lie with at night
(When I'm feeling blue)
If I didn't have you to share my sighs
(Share my sighs)
And to kiss me and dry my tears when I cry

Well I really think that I would...
Have somebody else

(If I didn't have you)
If I didn't have you, someone else would do

Your love is one in a million
(One in a million)
You couldn't buy it at any price
(Can't buy love)
But of the 9.999 hundred thousand other loves
Statistically, some of them would be equally nice
(Equally nice)
Or maybe not as nice but, say, smarter than you
Or dumber but better at sport or tracing
I'm just saying
(I really think that I would)
Probably
(Have somebody else)

Yeah

(If I didn't have you)
If I didn't have you someone else would do
(Someone else would surely do)

If I were a rich man
Diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-ee
I guess I would be with a surgeon or a model
Or a rellie of the Royals or a Kennedy
Or a nymphomonical exhibitionist heiress to a large chain of hotels
If I were a rich man, maybe I would fiddle
Fiddle-diddle-diddle with the rich man girls

I'm not saying that I'd not love you if I was wealthy or handsome
But realistically there's lots of fish in the sea
And if I had a different rod I would concievably land some
Even though I am fiscally consistantly pitiable
And considerably less Brad Pitt than Brad Pitiful
Am I really so poor and ugly that you reckon only you could possibly love me?
And I
(Really think that I would)
Probably
(Have somebody else)

(If I didn't have you)
If I didn't have you, someone else would do
(Someone else would surely do)

And look, I'm not undervaluing what we've got when I say
That given the role chaos inevitably plays in the inherently flawed notion of ""fate""
It's obtuse to deduce that I've found my soulmate at the age of seventeen
It's just mathematically unlikely that at a university in Perth
I happened to stumble on the one girl on Earth specifically designed for me

And if I may conjecture a further objection, love is nothing to do with destined perfection
The connection is strengthened, the affection simply grows over time
Like a flower
Or a mushroom
Or a guinea pig
Or a vine
Or a sponge
Or bigotry
... or a banana

And love is made more powerful by the ongoing drama of shared experience
And the synergy of a kind of symbiotic empathy or... something

So I trust it would go without saying
That I would feel really very sad
If tomorrow you were to fall off something high
Or catch something bad
But I'm just saying
I don't think you're special
I-I mean, I think your special
But you fall within a bell curve
I mean, I'm just saying I
(Really think that I would)
Probably
(Have somebody else)

I think you are unique and beautiful
(Unique and beaut)
You make me happy just by being around
(Being around)
But objectively, you would have to agree that baby when I found you
Options were relatively thin on the ground
(Thin on the ground)
You're lovely but there must be girls as lovely as you
And maybe more open to spanking or table tennis
I'm just saying
(Really think that I would)
Probably
(Have somebody else)

I mean I reckon it's pretty likely that if, for example
My first girlfriend, Jackie, hadn't dumped me
After I kissed Winston's ex-girlfriend Neah at Steph's party back in 1993
And our variables would probably have been altered by the absence of that event
To have meant the advent of a tangential narrative in which we don't meet
Which is to say there exists a theoretical hypothetical parallel life
Where what is is not as it is and I am not your husband and you are not my wife

And I am a stuntman living in LA
Married to a small, blonde Portuguese skier
Who, when she's not training
Does abstract painting
Practices yoga
And brews her own beer
And really like making home movies
And suffers neck down alopecia

But with all my heart and all my mind, I know one thing is true
I have just one life and just one love and, my love, that love is you
And if it wasn't for you, darling you

(Really think that I would)
Probably
(Have somebody else)

(If I didn't have you)
If I didn't have you someone else would surely do"

Tim Minchin,If You Really Loved Me,/t/tim+minchin/if+you+really+loved+me_20772796.html,"If you really loved me the way you say you do
If you love me half as much as I love you
You would pluck a planet from the sky
You'd use a star to dot the ""I""
In ""I love you"", that is what you'd do
You'd take a dreary day and you would paint it blue
If you loved me unconditionally
These are the things that you would do for me

Because I need you
Like a fish needs the sea
Like a fire needs oxygen
Like a flower needs a bee
And if you really cared for me
You'd let me video you while you wee
Standing up in the bath - I shouldn't even have to ask
Perhaps you'd even store a little more in a flask
These are just the things that people do
When their love for one another is true

We go together
Like a cracker and Brie
Like racism and ignorance
Like bling and R&B
And if you really want to show you care
You'd let me wear your underwear
When we go to your mum's, for a bit of harmless fun
I just like talking about your childhood with lace between my buns
There's no reason for a big to-do
If you love one another, it's true

We go together
Like a bird and a nest
Like Internet and kiddie-porn
Like guns and the us
And if you love me like you say you do
You'd purchase thirty cockatoos
And teach them to fly in formation in the sky
And shit the words ""Tim is God"" on my ex-girlfriend's Hyundai
Sure, it might be easier with doves
But shirking challenges is not what love's all about
Love is not all wine and roses
Sometimes it's handcuffs and cheese
No one said love is for free
And if you agree with that
You'd sing me passages from the Koran
Wearing nothing but your Bob the Builder hat
To the tune of Waltzing Matilda
I just love the combination of Islam, nationalism and builder

Because I need you
Like a tick needs a tock
Like bananas need pyjamas
Like a nun needs c***
But if you want to put your love for me first
You wouldn't go through childbirth
You'd agree to adopt, so that you could stay thin
We'll get a Chinese kid - it could teach us Mandarin!
And communists don't make as much noise
And they're really good at sharing their toys

Because I dig you
Like an Aussie digs pies
Like born-agains dig Jesus
Like Jesus dug guys
And if you love me unconditionally
You'd do my tax return for me
Cos it's way overdue, and I just don't know,
I guess I'm self-employed but do I still pay as I go?
And does the threshold apply to me?
And should I register for gst?
And if you love me unconditionally,
Would you let me video you while you wee?

Tim Minchin,Inflatable You,/t/tim+minchin/inflatable+you_20660593.html,"This is a love song.

Your love for me is not debatable
Your sexual appetite's insatiable
You never ever make me waitable
Delectable, inflatable you.

You don't have problems with your weight at all
You never steal food off my plate at all
I never have to masturbate at all
Unstoppable, inflatable you.

You never seem to menstruate at all
So you're not angry when I'm late at all
I feel permanently fallatable
Unpoppable, inflatable you.

With you in my arms I feel we could just fly away
With the right kind of gas I might even try it some day
In this ocean of life I'm never afraid I might drown
We could just float forever whatever the weather
Whenever my inflatable lover's around.

Your thighs and buttocks are so holdable
You always do what you are toldable
And if we argue you just foldable
Controllable consolable you.

My mates all reckon you are suitable
I took you around to watch the footable
And Steve and Gary said you're rootable
Refutable, commutable you.

You're never sensitive or tickly
When I rub you my skin goes prickly
It's know as static electricity
Felicity when I'm kissing you.

Your skin is so smooth I couldn't afford you with hair
You have all the holes real girls have got plus one for the air
Your problems are simple, I don't need my Masters in Psych
To know if you get down I just perk you right up
With a couple of squirts from the pump off my bike.

You never wake up when I snore at all
A trait which I find quite adorable
You have a box and you are storable
Ignorable, back-doorable you.

Any sexual position's feasible
Although you don't bend at the knees at all
Your hooters are so firm and squeezable
Increasable, un-creasable you.

You don't complain about my hairy back
Or about the inches that downstairs I lack
You're not disgusted by my furry crack
Burt Bacharach... Jack Kerouac... Oooo...

Now birth control is not an issue
I clean it all off with a tissue
I bet my jealous friends all wish you
Were insatiably inflatably theirs.

Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
And I won't let you down."
Tim Minchin,Lullaby,/t/tim+minchin/lullaby_20917883.html,"Sleep, little baby, sleep now my love
The Milky Way's shining high up above
When you grow up, you will learn all that stuff
But for now, close your eyes
Close your eyes

Sleep, little baby, try not to squawk
Tomorrow and tomorrow you'll learn how to walk
To love and laugh, to make toast and talk
But for now, beddy-byes

Your blanket's hand-knitted with pure angora wool
Your nappy is dry and your tummy is full
Of enough antihistamine to chill out a bull
Yet still all this gringing

What more could you want for? I just cannot guess
You constantly complain to me; you should feel blessed
There are children in Africa, starving to death
And you don't hear them whinging

What more can I do to put a stop to
This mind-numbing noise you are making?
Where is the line between patting and hitting?
When is rocking ""rocking"" and when is it ""shaking""?

I don't know what else I can do to try to hush you
My heart says ""I love you"", but my brain's thinking ""fuck you""
And hoping a child trafficker will abduct you
At least then I'll get a few hours in bed

I've shushed and I've cooed and I've even try to sing
""Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da"" in the exact voice of Ringo
Now all I have left is to hope that a dingo
Will sneak in and rip off your fat bitching head

Hush little baby, don't say a word
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird
In the hope you get avian flu
The nice folk in A&E will take care of you

That's it, close your eyes, shhh, not a sound
I can barely see your tiny belly moving up and down
One thing they don't mention in the parenting books:
Your love for them grows, the closer to dead they look"

Tim Minchin,Mitsubishi Colt,/t/tim+minchin/mitsubishi+colt_20772802.html,"He looks at me intensely
Eyes contact lens green with artifical envy
Cocks his head and fixes me with a condescending stare
Flicks his bleached, blond tipped hair
And theorises thus:

""You know what I reckon?""
Pause for effect
Adjusts his tackle as if it's semi-erect
I feel I'd better give him what I know he expects:
""What do you reckon?""

A hand on the shoulder
An avuncular wink
Sips his lemon drink
Spits out the pips
Hands on hips
Licks his lips
Like a wolf near a flock
Yet again adjusting his fantasy c***
He delivers his philosophy

""I reckon it don't matter
It don't mean squat
What you earn or what you got
Or the style of your hair
Or what you wear
It matters not

""Like what do you care
That I live on a hill with views of the beach?
That my chick and my dogs have an en-suite bathroom each?
That I've already reached my first million and I'm only 26?
You're as thick as two bricks
If you think you can fix
What is broke in your life with money
And the funny thing is
And I shit you not
That I'd give it all up like that! ""

He leaves me to ponder his wisdom for a bit
And with a click of his fingers
Beckons the blondest, bimbo-est barmaid
And grinning ridiculously
Orders a G and T
And a beer, for me
And before I can escape
He's back saying,

""Cos mate, the thing is
All of that crap
It's all superficial
It's all just a front
Anyone can be a rich c***
But the thing we all want
Can't be bought with dosh
You know what I mean, boss?
Cos you don't give a toss
That when I want to get slim
I've got my own private gym
And a personal trainer called... Danielle or fuckin' Darlene
She's got tits
Like those chicks
In Ralph magazine

""And it's not like you care
That I own the controlling share
Of an overseas company
That builds accounting software
It matters not one bit
I mean who gives a shit
That I earn six hundred grand
And drive a brand new land rover?
You know I would hand it all over like that! ""

He pauses for a beat
Long enough for me to retreat to a seat
And sit, elbow on the bar
And contemplate this guru
With his white teeth and big car
And ponder silently my belief
That genius comes in many a form
And that this postulating, peroxided porn-star prick... Ain't one of them

My specultaion cut short
As he reforms
Like Terminator ii
And before I have time to abort
He descends upon me and snorts,
""I guess what I'm trying to say
In my own little way
Is that I reckon that musos and artists and that
Well, I reckon they're great
I know some people reckon you guys just sit on your bums
And don't get out of bed til the pizza man comes
And smoke cones
And take crack
And whack off all day
But I don't care what they say
And I don't listen to people
Who say that all actors are gay
Not that I don't think that's ok
As far as I'm concerned
Although it's not my bag
If you wanna be a fag
Be a fag y'know?
Who am I to say
Where you come
And where you go
In the privacy of your own homo?
Ha-ha! Homo!
Ha-ha! Homo!

And my eyes start to glaze
And through the haze of my anger
I notice his G and T is gone
And he's starting to dribble
As he dribbles on and fucking on

I don't know much about music
But I know what I like
And I reckon I'd throw it all in
To be like you Jim. "" ""Tim. ""
""I mean you might be poor in monetary terms
But what you earn spiritually
What makes you what you are
Just means so much more
Than what you earn from a really nice car
Or a tennis court
Or holidays in Greece
Or a house on the beach
Or stock market shares
Or twenty-one pairs
Of Calvin Klein undewear
Do you understand? You are a wealthy, wealthy man
I mean I don't want to piss in your pocket
But I've gotta say
Before I get on my way
That honestly, and I'm not having you on
I reckon on day you could play the piano as good as Elton John! ""

The cops are still mingling
Though the crowd's shuffled out
I've got ice on my hand
Where my fist met his mouth
And although I explained
That it wasn't my fault

For aggravated assault
So before it gets worse
I reckon I'll bolt

There is a word that we still hold taboo
A word with a terrible history
Of being used to abuse, oppress and subdue
Just six seemingly harmless letters
Arranged in a way that will form a word
With more power than the pieces of metal
That are forged to make swords

A couple of Gs, an R and an E, an I and an N
Just six little letters all jumbled together
Have caused damage that we may never mend
And it's important that we all respect
That if these people should happen to choose
To reclaim the word as their own
It doesn't meant the rest of you have a right to it's use

So never under estimate
The power that language imparts
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But words can break hearts
A couple of Gs - jeez, unless you've had to live it
An R and an E - even I am careful with it
An I and an N - and in the end it will only offend
Don't want to have to spell it out again...

Only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger
Only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger
So listen to me if you care for your health
You won't call me ginger 'less you're ginger yourself
Only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger

When you are a ginger life is pretty hard
Years of ritual bullying in the school yard
Kids calling you Ranga and Fanta Pants
No invitation to the high school dance
But you get up and learn to hold your head up
You try to keep your cool and not get het up
But until the feeling of I'll is truly let up
Then the word is ours and ours alone

Just because we're sensitive to UV
Just 'cause we're pathetically pale
We do alright with the females

Yeah I like to ask the ladies 'round for ginger beer
And soon they're running their fingers through my ginger beard
And dunking my ginger nuts into their ginger tea
And asking if they can call me ginge
And I say, ""I don't think that's appropriate!""

'Cos only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger
Only a ginga can call another ginga, ginga
And all the ladies, they agree it's a fact
Once you've gone ginge, she can't go back
Only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger

Yeah go ginge, go you funky ginge
Yeah, funky ginger mofo

Yeah, you can call us bozo or fire truck
You can even call us carrot top of blood nut
Yeah, you can call us match stick or tampon
But fucking with the G-word is just not on

If you're a ginger-phobe and you don't like us
We will stand up to the fight if you want to fight us
But if you cut yourself you might catch gingivitis
So maybe you should shut your funky mouth

So if you call us ginge you can't whinge if your injured
If you don't have a tinge of the ginge in your minge

Only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger
And you know my kids will always be clothed and fed
'Cos Papa's gonna be bringing home the gingerbread
And they'll be pretty smart because they'll be well-read
And by ""read"" I mean ""read"" and the other kind of ""red"", woo! 

Only a ginger can call another ginger, ginger
Only a ginga can call another ginga, ginga
Just like only a ninja can sneak up on another ninja

Yeah, only a ginger, only a ginger, only a ginger, yeah
Are you all listening-a, I'm not pointing the finger
I just happen to sing-a
I'm just remindin' ya

That only a ginger can call another ginger...

Tim Minchin,Rock 'n' Roll Nerd,/t/tim+minchin/rock+n+roll+nerd_20761109.html,"He doesn't have a problem with drugs
He just doesn't get them
He's fine that his mates have tattoos
But he thinks they'll regret them
He likes going to pubs
But he hates when the music's too loud
He tends not to go to rock concerts
Cos he can't stand the crowds
But all he's ever wanted to be
Is a rock star on mtv
But he knows that it's not fucking likely
He's just turned thirty

He knows that he will always be
A rock 'n' roll nerd
He'll keep writing songs the world will never hear
And though they won't be heard
He'll just keep writing
Oh yeah

But you see the problem is
He always dreamt of being a star
But he learned piano instead of guitar
Which in the nineties didn't get you very far
So while all the other kids were learning Stairway
He was the piano to their forte
But he was convinced one day
He'd rock their fucking asses
Be an icon for the disenfranchised masses
And grow his hair long
And rebel against the state
But just for now that'd have to wait
Cos he's running late for his morning classes

And he will always be
A rock 'n' roll nerd
He'll keep playing gigs that no one knows about
And though it sounds absurd
He'll just keep playing
Oh yeah

But you see the problem is
There's not much depth in what he's singing
He's a victim of his upper middle class upbringing
So he can't write about the hood
Or bling bling
So he sits and imagines his girlfriend is dead
To try and invoke some angst in his middle class head
But the bitch is always fine at half past nine
When they go to bed
And he's not spent a single night in prison
He has no issues with nutrition
He has no drinking problem
And no drug addiction
Unless you count the drugs they put in chicken
And marijuana always tends to make him cough
He doesn't look good with his t-shirt off
And when he tries to act tough you can tell he's trickin'

While his mates all go out late
Popping pills and having fun
He goes home and showers
And gets a good eight hours
He gets his thrills from his morning run
And while his mates all go on dates
Taking speed and drinking cans of Jim Bean
He stays home and cooks
Curls up with a book
With the girl he's had since he was seventeen

Cos he's never really been part of the scene
Give him guns 'n' roses, he'll take Queen
He's more into Beatles than The Stones
He's more Stevie Wonder than Ramones
And he's never owned a panel van
He's never shot a Panterra fan
He doesn't know the difference between metal and thrash
He couldn't tell you nothing about Axel and Slash
He likes Ben Folds to the Jackson Five
He knows all the words to Staying Alive
And though he wants to be all grungy and cool
He spent eleven years in a motherfucking private school

So it don't matter how he tries
He cannot hide behind his rock 'n' roll lies
Cos you've either got it or you don't
You'll either rock it or you won't
Yeah, you've either got it or you don't
Yeah, you'll either rock it or you won't

He knows that his music lacks depth
But it just can't be helped
He has nothing interesting to say
So he writes about himself
But he doesn't want to seem self obsessed
So he writes in third person
In an attempt to seem more rock 'n' roll
But he suspects it's not workin'
And deep in his heart he knows
He will never be Bono or Bowie
And even if he was quite pretty
With small pants like Kylie

He knows that he
Will always be
A rock 'n' roll nerd
He'll keep writing songs the world don't care about
And though it sounds absurd
He'll just keep writing
Oh yeah
You can criticise him
But he won't care
Cos he wants to rock, and he will never be deterred
But he'll always be a fucked up little, try-hard, wannabe rock 'n' roll nerd
Rock 'n' roll nerd"
Tim Minchin,Seeing You,/t/tim+minchin/seeing+you_21096145.html,"Drove out of town, took a right onto a northbound highway.
Was it really only yesterday.
If I had known what now I know maybe I
Would have taken a moment.
Maybe looked over my shoulder.
Maybe shed a tear.
Now I'm here.

A storm rolled in, overwhelm you sometime late this morning.
Think I ignored the warnings.

I spent a lifetime seeking signs, reading lines, 
Trying to forecast the future.
Always staying a day ahead.
Well that was the idea.
Now I'm here.

I thought I'd seen it all, was sure by now I knew this place.
I swear that I knew every hair, each line upon your face.
I thought the only way to better days was through tomorrow, 
But I know now that I know.
Yes I know now that I know nothing.

But I'm here.
And I'm fine.
And I'm seeing you,
For the first time.
I'm alright,
And I'm seeing you,
For the first time.

Tim Minchin,Some People Have It Worse Than Me,/t/tim+minchin/some+people+have+it+worse+than+me_20772795.html,"Well I wake up in the morning at 11: 47
And I can't believe I have to face the horror of another fucking day
And the magnificent magnitude of my morning erection
Merely mocks me like the sun in it's optimistic greeting of the day
Managing to manifest a modicum of motivation
I meander to the kitchen make a mission out of mixing Nescafe
But the milk is going off and coffee by itself is bitter
And there's ants all through the sugar and the supermarket's miles a-fucking-way

My life is pretty sad
But I know that I should be glad
I could be a starving Ethiope
Or a policeman in Baghdad
Policeman in Baghdad
Bagdad

At 11: 53 I instigate the day's ablutions
In the hope my constitution can be altered by some action on the bowl
But the total non-existence of colonic animation
Seems to me the perfect metaphor for the utter constipation of my soul
By 11: 59 I have decided that my life would be immediately improved
By a carefully written list of short-term goals
But by 12. 05 my list consists of one-dot put some pants on
Two-dot go to the shop, buy some prunes and Panadol

My life is pretty shit
But I know I shouldn't whinge about it
I could be a Palestinian
Driving buses on the Gaza strip

Yeah how bad can it be?
Some people have it worse than me
I could be an Ipswich prostitute
Or Gary Glitter's family

I have no right to cry
Some people have it worse than I
I could be a thalidomide kid
With something in my eye
Something in my eye
My eye

At 12: 30 I realise I'm feeling so dejected
That I've totally neglected the beginning of the Jerry Springer show
So I settle on the sofa try to focus an iota of my motor-neurons
On the brilliant insights for which Jerry is known
And although on any other day a show entitled ""Midgets, Midgets, Midgets""
Would excite me like a virgin at her year eleven ball
Today those little jelly-wrestling fellas fail to free me of my misery
Instead they simply serve to make me feel three foot tall

But how bad can it be?
Some people have it worse than me
I could be a junior life saver
On a Banda Aceh beach

Or a woman in afghanistan
Or a Jew in the Klu Klutz Klan
Or the architect of the World Trade Centre
Or a bobcat driver in Bam Iran

I could have my identity mistaken
As a bomber in an underground station
I could be a peace-loving speech-writer
In George W's administration

Yeah, I know that I don't have the right
To be unhappy with my life
I could be Hitlers mother
Or Shane Warne's wife

Yeah, I know that I shouldn't be bitchin'
I could be in a worse position
I could be a 3-nippled naturopath
In the days of the Spanish
In the Spanish inquisition

I know I have no right, no right to cry
Some people have it much, much worse than I
I could have a serious nut allergy
And be shipwrecked on an island with a crate of Snickers bars,
A jar of Nutella and a fresh baked pecan pie
Some people have it worse than I!"
Tim Minchin,Storm,/t/tim+minchin/storm_21019617.html,"Inner North London, top floor flat
All white walls, white carpet, white cat
Rice paper partitions
Modern art and ambition
The host's a physician
Bright bloke, has his own practice
His girlfriend's an actress
An old mate of ours from home
And they're always great fun
So to dinner we've come

The fifth guest is an unknown
The hosts have just thrown
Us together as a favour
Cause this girl's just arrived from Australia
And has moved to North London
And she's the sister of someone
Or has some connection

As we make introductions
I'm struck by her beauty
She's irrefutably fair
With dark eyes and dark hair
But as she sits
I admit I'm a little bit wary
Because I notice the tip of the wing of a fairy
Tattooed on that popular area
Just above the derrière
And when she says ""I'm Sagittarian""
I confess a pigeonhole starts to form
And is immediately filled with pigeon
When she says her name is Storm

Conversation is initially bright and lighthearted
But it's not long before Storm gets started:
""You can't know anything
Knowledge is merely opinion""
She opines, over her Cabernet Sauvignon
Vis-à-vis
Some unhippily
Empirical comment by me

""Not a good start"", I think
We're only on pre-dinner drinks
And across the room, my wife
Widens her eyes
Silently begs me: ""Be nice""
A matrimonial warning
Not worth ignoring
So I resist the urge to ask Storm
Whether knowledge is so loose-weave
Of a morning
When deciding whether to leave
Her apartment by the front door
Or a window on her second floor

The food is delicious and Storm
Whilst avoiding all meats
Happily sits and eats
While the good doctor slightly pissedly
Holds court on some anachronistic aspect of medical history
When Storm suddenly insists:
""But the human body is a mystery!
Science just falls in a hole
When it tries to explain the the nature of the soul""

My hostess throws me a glance
She, like my wife, knows there's a chance
That I'll be off on one of my rare but fun rants
But I shan't, my lips are sealed
I just want to enjoy the meal
And although Storm is starting to get my goat
I have no intention of rocking the boat
Although it's becoming a bit of a wrestle
Because - like her meteorological namesake -
Storm has no such concerns for our vessel:

""Pharmaceutical companies are the enemy
They promote drug dependency
At the cost of the natural remedies
That are all our bodies need
They are immoral and driven by greed
Why take drugs
When herbs can solve it?
Why use chemicals
When homeopathic solvents
Can resolve it?
It's time we all return to live
With natural medical alternatives. ""

And try as hard as I like
A small crack appears
In my diplomacy dyke.
""By definition,"" I begin
""Alternative Medicine,"" I continue
""Has either not been proven to work
Or been proved not to work
You know what they call alternative medicine
That's been proved to work?
Medicine. ""

""So you don't believe
In any natural remedies? ""

""On the contrary actually:
Before we came to tea
I took a natural remedy
Derived from the bark of a willow tree
A painkiller that's virtually side-effect free
It's got a weird name
Darling, what was it again?
Maspirin?
Baspirin?
Oh yeah, aspirin!
Which I paid about a buck for
Down at the local drugstore. ""

The debate briefly abates
As our hosts collects plates
But as they return with desserts
Storm pertly asserts

""Shakespeare said it first:
There are more things in heaven and earth
Than exist in your philosophy
Science is just how we're trained to look at reality
It can't explain love or spirituality
How does science explain psychics?
Auras, the afterlife, the power of prayer? ""

I'm becoming aware
That I'm staring
I'm like a rabbit suddenly trapped
In the blinding headlights of vacuous crap
Maybe it's the Hamlet she just misquothed
Or the eighth glass of wine I just quaffed
But my diplomacy dike groans
And the arsehole held back by its stones
Can be held back no more:

""Look uh, Storm, I don't mean to bore ya
But there's no such thing as an aura!
Reading auras is like reading minds
Or star-signs, or tea-leaves, or meridian lines
These people aren't plying a skill
They're either lying or mentally ill!
Same goes for those who claim to hear God's demands
And spiritual healers who think they have magic hands

""By the way
Why is it okay
For people to pretend they can talk to the dead?
Is it not totally fucked in the head
Lying to some crying woman whose child has died
And telling her you're in touch with the other side?
That's just fundamentally sick
Do we need to clarify that there's no such thing as a psychic?

""What, are we fucking two?
Do we actually think that Horton Heard a Who?
Do we still think that Santa brings us gifts?
That Michael Jackson hasn't had facelifts?
Are we still so stunned by circus tricks
That we think that the dead would
Wanna talk to pricks
Like John Edward? ""

Storm, to her credit, despite my derision
Keeps firing off clichés with startling precision
Like a sniper using bollocks for ammunition

""You're so sure of your position
But you're just closed-minded
I think you'll find
Your faith in science and tests
Is just as blind
As the faith of any fundamentalist. ""

""Hmm, that's a good point, let me think for a bit...
Oh wait, my mistake, it's absolute bullshit.
Science adjusts its beliefs based on what's observed;
Faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved
If you show me that, say, homeopathy works
Then I will change my mind
I'll spin on a fucking dime
I'll be embarrassed as hell
But I will run through the streets yelling
'It's a miracle! Take physics and bin it!
Water has memory!
And while it's memory of a long lost drop of onion juice is infinite
It somehow forgets all the poo it's had in it! '

""You show me that it works and how it works
And when I've recovered from the shock
I will take a compass and carve 'Fancy That' on the side of my cock! ""

Everyone's just staring now
But I'm pretty pissed and I've dug this far down
So I figure, in for a penny, in for a pound:

""Life is full of mystery, yeah
But there are answers out there
And they won't be found
By people sitting around
Looking serious
And saying 'Isn't life mysterious? '
Let's sit here and hope
Let's call up the fucking Pope
Let's go watch Oprah
Interview Deepak Chopra

""If you're going to watch telly, you should watch Scooby Doo
That show was so cool
Because every time there's a church with a ghoul
Or a ghost in a school
They looked beneath the mask and what was inside?
The fucking janitor or the dude who runs the waterslide
Throughout history
Every mystery
Ever solved has turned out to be
Not magic

""Does the idea that there might be truth
Frighten you?
Does the idea that one afternoon
On Wiki-fucking-pedia might enlighten you
Frighten you?
Does the notion that there may not be a supernatural
So blow your hippy noodle
That you would rather just stand in the fog
Of your inability to Google?

""Isn't this enough?
Just this world?

""Just this beautiful, complex
Wonderfully unfathomable, natural world?
How does it so fail to hold our attention
That we have to diminish it with the invention
Of cheap, man-made myths and monsters?
If you're so into Shakespeare
Lend me your ear:
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily
To throw perfume on the violet is just fucking silly
Or something like that
Or what about Satchmo?!
I see trees of green
Red roses too
And fine, if you wish to
Glorify Krishna and Vishnu
In a post-colonial, condescending
Bottled-up and labeled kind of way
Then whatever, that's okay
But here's what gives me a hard-on:
I am a tiny, insignificant, ignorant lump of carbon
I have one life, and it is short
And unimportant
But thanks to recent scientific advances
I get to live twice as long
As my great great great great uncleses and auntses
Twice as long to live this life of mine
Twice as long to love this wife of mine
Twice as many years of friends and wine
Of sharing curries and getting shitty
With good-looking hippies
With fairies on their spines
And butterflies on their titties

""And if perchance I have offended
Think but this and all is mended:
We'd as well be 10 minutes back in time
For all the chance you'll change your mind. """
Tim Minchin,Thank You God,/t/tim+minchin/thank+you+god_20917884.html,"I have an apology to make
I'm afraid I've made a big mistake
I turned my face away from you, Lord

I was too blind to see the light
I was too meek to feel Your might 
I closed my eyes; I couldn't see the truth, Lord

But then like Saul on the Damascus road, 
You sent a messenger to me, and so
Now I've have had the truth revealed to me
Please forgive me all those things I said
I'll no longer betray you, Lord
I will pray to you instead

And I will say thank you, thank you
Thank you, God
Thank you, thank you
Thank you, God... 

Thank you, God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum
I had no idea, but it's suddenly so clear now
I feel such a cynic, how could I have been so wrong?
Thank you for displaying how praying works: 
A particular prayer in a particular church
Thank you Sam for the chance to acknowledge this
Omnipotent ophthalmologist

Thank you, God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum
I didn't realize that it was so simple
But you've shown a great example of just how it can be done
You only need to pray in a particular spot
To a particular version of a particular god, 
And if you pull that off without a hitch, 
He will fix one eye of one middle-class white bitch

I know in the past my outlook has been limited
I couldn't see examples of where life had been definitive
But I can admit it when the evidence is clear, 
As clear as Sam's mum's new cornea
(And that's extremely clear! )

Thank you, God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum
I have to admit that in the past I have been skeptical
But Sam described this miracle and I am overcome! 
How fitting that the sighting of a sight-based intervention 
Should open my eyes to this exciting new dimension
It's like someone put an eye chart up in front of me 
And the top five letters say: I C, G O D

Thank you, Sam, for showing how my point of view has been so flawed
I assumed there was no God at all but now I see that's cynical
It's simply that his interests aren't particularly broad
He's largely undiverted by the starving masses, 
Or the inequality between the various classes
He gives out strictly limited passes, 
Redeemable for surgery or two-for-one glasses

I feel so shocking for historically mocking
Your interests are clearly confined to the ocular
I bet given the chance, you'd eschew the divine 
And start a little business selling contacts online

Fuck me Sam, what are the odds
That of history's endless parade of gods 
That the God you just happened to be taught to believe in
Is the actual God and he digs on healing, 
But not the AIDS-ridden African nations
Nor the victims of the plague, nor the flood-addled Asians, 
But healthy, privately-insured Australians 
With common and curable lens degeneration

The story of Sam's has but a single explanation: 
A surgical God who digs on magic operations
No, it couldn't be mistaken attribution of causation
Born of a coincidental temporal correlation
Exacerbated by a general lack of education
Vis-a-vis physics in Sam's parish congregation
No it couldn't be that all these pious people are liars
It couldn't be an artifact of confirmation bias
A product of groupthink, 
A mass delusion, 
An Emperor's New Clothes-style fear of exclusion

No, it's more likely to be an all-powerful magician 
Than the misdiagnosis of the initial condition, 
Or one of many cases of spontaneous remission, 
Or a record-keeping glitch by the local physician

No, the only explanation for Sam's mum's seeing: 
They prayed to an all-knowing superbeing, 
To the omnipresent master of the universe, 
And he quite liked the sound of their muttered verse.

So for a bit of a change from his usual stunt 
Of being a sexist, racist, murderous cunt
He popped down to Dandenong and just like that
Used his powers to heal the cataracts of Sam's mum
Of Sam's mum

Thank you God for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum! 
I didn't realize that it was such a simple thing
I feel such a dingaling, what ignorant scum! 

Now I understand a prayer can work: 
A particular prayer in a particular church 
In a particular style with a particular stuff 
And for particular problems that aren't particularly tough, 
And for particular people, preferably white
And for particular senses, preferably sight
A particular prayer in a particular spot
To a particular version of a particular god

And if you get that right, he just might
Take a break from giving babies malaria
And pop down to your local area
And fix the cataracts of your mum!"

Che was a bit of a homophobe, Che was a bit of a homophobe

He's a lovely, funny fella, he gives soundbites galore

And the Buddhist line about future lives is the perfect way to stop the powerless rising up
And he tells the poor they will live again, but he's rich now so it's easy for him to say

Into black and into white and
Into real men and fairies
Into status quo and scary
Yeah we want the world binary, binary

And your dog has a bigger carbon footprint than a four wheel drive
Yea your dog has a bigger carbon footprint than a four wheel drive

Into science and supernatural
But it's actually naturally not that white and black

You'll be

Tim Minchin,The Good Book,/t/tim+minchin/the+good+book_20788854.html,"Life is like an ocean voyage and our bodies are the ships
And without a moral compass we would all be cast adrift
So to keep us on our bearings, the Lord gave us a gift
And like most gifts you get, it was a book

I only read one book, but it's a good book, don't you know
I act the way I act because the Good Book tells me so
If I wanna know how to be good, it's to the Good Book that I go
Cause the Good Book is a book and it is good and it's a book

I know the Good Book's good because the Good Book says it's good
I know the Good Book knows it's good because a really good book would
You wouldn't cook without a cookbook and I think it's understood
You can't be good without a Good Book cause it's good and it's a book
And it is good for cookin'

I tried to read some other books, but I soon gave up on that
The paragraphs ain't numbered and they complicate the facts
I can't read Harry Potter cause they're worshipping false gods and that
And Dumbledore's a poofter and that's bad, cause it's not good

Morality is written there in simple white and black
I feel sorry for you heathens, got to think about all that
Good is good and evil's bad and goats are good and pigs are crap
You'll find which one is which in the Good Book, cause it's good
And it's a book, and it's a book

I had a cat, she gave birth to a litter
The kittens were adorable and they made my family laugh
But as they grew they started misbehavin'
So I drowned the little fuckers in the bath
When the creatures in your care start being menaces
The answers can be found right there in Genesis!
Chapter 6, Verse 5-7!

Swing your partner by the hand
Have a baby if you can
But if the voices your head
Say to sacrifice your kid
To satiate your loving God's
Fetish for dead baby blood
It's simple faith, the Book demands
So raise that knife up in your hand!

Before the Good Book made us good, there was no good way to know
If a thing was good or not that good or kind of touch and go
So God decided he'd give writing allegoric prose a go
And so he wrote a book and it was generally well-received

The Telegraph said, ""This God is reminiscent of the Norse.""
The Times said, ""Kind of turgid, but I liked the bit with horses.""
The Mail said, ""Lots of massacres, a violent tour de force.""
If you only read one book this year, then this one is a book
And it is good, and it's a book!

Swing your daughter by the hand
But if she gets raped by a man
And refuses then to marry him
Stone her to death!

If you just close your eyes and block your ears
To the accumulated knowledge of the last two thousand years
Then morally, guess what? You're off the hook
And thank Christ you only have to read one book

Just because the book's contents
Were written generations hence
By hairy desert-dwelling gents
Squatting in their dusty tents
Just because what Heaven said
Was said before they'd leavened bread
Just cause Jesus couldn't read
Doesn't mean that we should need
When manipulating human genes
To alleviate pain and fight disease
When deciding whether it's wrong or right
To help the dyin' let go of life
Or stop a pregnancy when it's
Just a tiny blastocyst
There's no reason why we should take a look
At any other book
But the Good Book
'Cause it's good
And it's a book
And it's a book
And it's quite good!

Good is good and evil's bad
And kids get killed when God gets mad
And you'd better take a good look
At the Good Book"
Tim Minchin,The Pope Song,/t/tim+minchin/the+pope+song_20917882.html,"Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, he's a fucking motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker he's a total motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck him, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucking Pope

Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, he's a fucking motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker he's a total motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck him, fuck the motherfucker
Fuck the motherfucker, fuck the motherfucking Pope

Fuck the motherfucker, and fuck you motherfucker
If you think that motherfucker is sacred
If you cover for another motherfucker who's a kiddy-fucker
Fuck you, you're no better than the motherfucking rapist
And if you don't like the swearing that this motherfucker forced from me
And reckon it shows moral or intellectual paucity
Then fuck you, motherfucker, this is language one employs
When one is fucking pissed about motherfuckers fucking boys.

And I don't give a fuck if calling the Pope a motherfucker
Means you unthinkingly brand me an unthinking apostate
This has nowt to do with other fucking godly motherfuckers
I'm not interested right now in theological debate
There are other fucking songs and there are other fucking ways
I'll be a religious apologist on other fucking days
But the fact remains if you protect a single kiddy fucker
Then Pope or Prince or Plumber, you're a fucking motherfucker

And I don't give a fuck what any other motherfucker
Believes about Jesus and his motherfucking mother
I've no problem with the spiritual beliefs of other fuckers
While those beliefs don't impact on the happiness of others
But if you build your church on claims of fucking moral authority
And with threats of hell impose it on others in society
Then you, you motherfuckers, can expect some fucking wrath
When it turns out you've been fucking us in our motherfucking asses
Our motherfucking asses

So fuck the motherfucker, and fuck you, motherfucker
If you're still a motherfucking papist.
If he covered for a single motherfucker who's a kiddy-fucker,
Fuck him, he's as evil as the motherfucking rapist
And if you look into your motherfucking heart and tell me true
If this motherfucking stupid fucking song offended you
With it's filthy fucking language and it's fucking direspect
If it made you feel angry, go ahead and write a letter
But if you find me more offensive than the possibility
The Pope protected priests when they were getting fucking fiddly
Then listen to me motherfucker - this here is a fact
You are just as morally misguided as that motherfucking
Power-hungry, self-aggrandized bigot in the stupid fucking hat"
Tim Minchin,The Song For Phil Daoust,/t/tim+minchin/the+song+for+phil+daoust_20788808.html,"This is a song for Phil Daoust
Occasional Guardian newspaper journal-oust
I never ever ever mentioned your name
Or the review that you wrote, when I was new to this game

But now the time has come
I think I've dealt with my feelings at last
I really wanna forgive ya, Phil
Yeah, I wanna put the past in the past-a

Oh, and as this is London town
I thought I outta take the opportunity
'Cause there's a pretty good chance
Somebody out there will know you
Maybe they will pass on a message for me

Just wanna say, Phil Daoust
Occasional Guardian newspaper journal-oust
That it's been three years since you wrote it
And time is very healing
But I still wanna cut big chunks of flesh out of your stupid face
And make your children watch while I force you to eat them
Yeah, I wanna make your children watch you eat your own face-meat

Ding dang, ding dang dong
This is my Phil Daoust song
Everybody sing along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I hope one of your family members dies
Phil, ding dang dong
I've written you this special song
To help you get the attention
You obviously, desperately lack

And I know that you're a smart man
And with such a fine mind, I guess it has to be hard
To resist throwing narcissistic, intellectual tantrums
In the supermarket aisles of your self-regard

Just wanna say, Phil Daoust
I know it must be really hard to be a journal-oust
While a deadline's always looming, and the pressure to be entertaining
So maybe you should quit and get a job that you'd be better at
Like killing yourself, you fucking cunt

Ding dang, ding dang dong
This is my Phil Daoust song
Everybody sing along
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la
I hope something you love catches on fire
Phil, ding dang dong
I've written you this special song
To show how far I've come along
In my efforts to be more mature in the face of negative feedback

You fucking poo-face"
Tim Minchin,White Wine In The Sun,/t/tim+minchin/white+wine+in+the+sun_20769322.html,"I really like Christmas
It's sentimental, I know, but I just really like it
I am hardly religious
I'd rather break bread with Dawkins than Desmond Tutu, to be honest

And yes, I have all of the usual objections
To consumerism, the commercialisation of an ancient religion
To the westernisation of a dead Palestinian
Press-ganged into selling Playstations and beer
But I still really like it

I'm looking forward to Christmas
Though I'm not expecting a visit from Jesus

I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun

I don't go in for ancient wisdom
I don't believe just 'cos ideas are tenacious it means they're worthy
I get freaked out by churches
Some of the hymns that they sing have nice chords but the lyrics are spooky

And yes I have all of the usual objections
To the mis-education of children who, in tax-exempt institutions,
Are taught to externalise blame
And to feel ashamed and to judge things as plain right and wrong
But I quite like the songs

I'm not expecting big presents
The old combination of socks, jocks and chocolate's is just fine by me

Cos I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
I'll be seeing my dad
My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
They'll be drinking white wine in the sun

And you, my baby girl
My jetlagged infant daughter
You'll be handed round the room
Like a puppy at a primary school
And you won't understand
But you will learn someday
That wherever you are and whatever you face
These are the people who'll make you feel safe in this world
My sweet blue-eyed girl

And if my baby girl
When you're twenty-one or thirty-one
And Christmas comes around
And you find yourself nine thousand miles from home
You'll know what ever comes

Your brothers and sisters and me and your Mum
Will be waiting for you in the sun
Whenever you come
Your brothers and sisters, your aunts and your uncles
Your grandparents, cousins and me and your mum
We'll be waiting for you in the sun
Drinking white wine in the sun
Darling, when Christmas comes
We'll be waiting for you in the sun
Drinking white wine in the sun
Waiting for you in the sun
Waiting for you...
Waiting...

I really like Christmas
It's sentimental, I know..."
Tim Minchin,You Grew On Me,/t/tim+minchin/you+grew+on+me_20772798.html,"You grew on me like a tumour
And you spread through me like malignant melanoma
And now you're in my heart
I should've cut you out back at the start

Now I'm afraid there's no cure for me
No dose of emotional chemotherapy
Can halt my pathetic decline
I should've had you removed back when you were benign

I picked you up like a virus
Like meningococcal meningitis
Now I can't feel my legs
When you're around I can't get out of bed

I've left it too late to risk an operation
I know there's no hope of a clean amputation
The successful removal of you
Would probably kill me, too

You grew on me like carcinoma
Crept up on me like untreated glaucoma
Now I find it hard to see
This untreated dose of you has blinded me

I should've consulted my local physician
I'm stuck now forever with this tunnel vision
My periphery is screwed
Wherever I look now, all I see is you

When we first met you seemed fickle and shallow
But my armour was no match for your poison arrow
You are wedged inside my chest
If I tried to take you out now I might bleed to death
I'm feeling short of breath

You grew on me like a tumour
And you spread through me like malignant melanoma
I guess I never knew
How fast a little mole can grow on you"

Got my drink on the rise, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city

Texting these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not getting that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped control just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearing the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talking with the same hoes

Anybody wanna motherfucking die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Coming through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said fuck that nigga
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult

And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick
I did work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem, plus the issues, I can't solve them
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'
Nigga please! Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred, shit
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy

What the fuck they want? I'm drunk as hell
Fuck work today, I wanna get some tail
Damn my little nigga graduated, man, I wish him well Now there's no more breaking them pies
And making that bail for them scales
Step across that fence and that's your life
When I run that town, that whip about town size
Four chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice

Que será, será, so the story goes
On and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute
Tours and shows and groupie whores
Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot
Though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room
That everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
Will he make it? Was it worth it?
Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?"

Told this girl I only fuck two dimes at one time
So she came back with a 9.5, I said ""fine""
Fuck it, close enough, open up, let me plug up your socket
Keep some weed in my pocket in case you get out of pocket
Uh, we chilling by the pool and bitches wanna get higher
Told her my name was Chip and she told me I was a liar
I'm hot, bitch, I'm on fire, she don't even think I'm me
And I really do this shit, how the fuck you think I eat?

Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth
Got what you need, blow that dope, don't get too high
From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come take this ride
Let me tell the tale of how God turned Scott
Over one lost trip to the sky
Let me tell the tale cause you throwed the tail
When you said I could make it this high
Who knew? God dammit who knew?
The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
You can really identify when you lookin' in your eyes
You ready to ride, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that roll
How Scotty entired that juice
Had my back against that wall
Every summer felt so cold
My daddy ain't comin' home 'til fall
That's why my pimp game so moist
Had that du-rag and all
Had a 20 year old bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
On the south side of that HOU
Hollup, let's take it back to that room
No car but still had drop
Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot
I'ma ride for all of my niggas

Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I deserve it
Lord knows we don't get tired, did more dirt than a derby
Momma worked for AT&T and we still ain't get that service
She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous
Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent
If a bitch don't want me, don't need them still got my Jergens
And you can keep them herpes

Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?

We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror
A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better
We niggas new slaves, I do say (Fuck, fuck)
Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany (Fuck, Fuck)
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze (What?)
Had me trickin' 40k for some grades (What?)
Just to make 40k for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day

I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain (Make it rain)

They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty

Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn’t working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can’t wait
In the moonlight, you can’t see my eyes
And when I’m off the things I can’t think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can’t choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon

Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed in the cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don’t wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I’m on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can’t be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can’t fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

I’m headed to the moon cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I’m pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I’m on E, you don’t know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain’t no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and I’m doing my dance

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I played the drums, she rolled the joints
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat above your crack
And on your cat you be right back

And what it do when they wanna be your friend now
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to go from scrappin' pockets, making his demands now

Let's lose each other's mind

Can all you get.
Sit on the lid and spoil the rest.
That's the way that's the best.

Lookin' out for number one.
Forget the price as long as it's fun.
And have the most toys when it's done.

That's alright and that o.k.
It feels good so I'll just live for today.
That's alright and that's o.k.

All the boys and all the girls.
They play the game and they count the spoils that's the way of the world.

Choose today who you will serve.
Hot or cold if you've got the nerve.

Naked in this cruel world

Tears dripping on my pillow thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance unless she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E
Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon"

They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The rav four turned into a Rover
Til' it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat all day, itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it

No no no no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us

Know that I'm gone, but one thing

I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of Vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind

Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told 'em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

This one here for the executives, fuck you and all your relatives
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, piss on your grave
Piss on your grave, piss on your grave, nigga behave

Us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waitin' for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, ""Bitch, get back in the door""
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it
My, my, my, my, look at little Scotty now
The same fuckers that used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud
I pull my zipper down and whip it out

We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch
And lead the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of they metamorphosis
Not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But whatever it is, it's better than here
So fuck you and fuck this

The soul of a bastard was never sold

Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance
To say ""fuck you"" to the ones that say ""fuck you""

And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?

Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em

But I'm way too young to be the old him

Till I climb to the top of the podium
So wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm
Might gotta rake up a nigga

Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (just ask the lonely)

Sorry baby, I don't play

And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me

Pussy, nigga, you's a pussy-nigga (you just a pussy-nigga)
You be doushin', I be pushin' ether
Bitch, you fuck-boy cunt
Won't be satisfied 'til I see ya'll suffer in the sun
Chiefin' while I'm beefin', turn me odds to evens
My lawyers are some heathens
Beat it blowin' on some on reefers
If you didn't want a war, then why you'd wage it then?
I only wear jeans, I could fit a gage up in
I'm so high right now, look like I'm in Japan
Amazing, junkie jit came up major in
Trench team, ten deep, red beam, laser tag
Bring it, what you got?
Police and pistols don't phase your man

Just to drown out all these thoughts, I try all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside, it's tryna come alive
'99, take AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, it's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in a lead
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' off the nose bleeds
And she hit that booger, sugar 'til her nose bleed
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever got a whole week
But she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe
Yeah, this right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spit, I’m diabolical
Ya feel me?"

Fuck the money, never leave your people behind
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes

Is it a coat of old paint that's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last open conversation you had? oh no
And did you see the void in the past, and can you ever see it comin' back?
Well can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

10 A.M., it’s Ransomnia
She see the dust, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight, we up out of here
Don't go home, cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth but can't eat right?
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, 'cause you'll never know

Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity

Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, boy I'm tied like an ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is and he never hung with the saints
It makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

They walk with none of the repercuss but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life"

See all this gold right behind me, now that shit ain't no mirage
And she crazy like she Fonzy cause I won't have no menage
When I see me on the concrete man I swear I almost died
Somehow I jumped straight out my car seat not even I parked that shit outside
That bitch had me running down a dark street
How I made it out alive I don't know I must be slonky

Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving

All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop (Hmm)
It's a new world order (Hmm)
Never had my head on my shoulders (Huh)
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your preacher told ya? (Uh)

Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
Cause we got a little bit of Tango (Yeah)
Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill (Um)
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga

Okay, lil mama
I still ain't heard from lil mama
We go back to Angliana
When you was studying in college
But I called you and brought you
Out to Santa Monica
Believed in you, I was your sponsor
I got love for you, but I'm not in love
Gave me affection
Girl, I was lost, she gave me direction
Went through fuckin' you with no protection
All my blessings
Girl, you one of all my blessings
You think I don't care about you?
Girl, you better call my best friend
I got time to waste
Girl I got time to waste
Girl, I cancelled everything
Just to get back on the same page
To finish the story
But you would rather ignore me
Your mama called to check on me
But you won't even pick up the phone, shit
God damn, you feelin' yourself
Out in Hollywood, you got a nigga with some wealth
You ain't free tonight, I bet he call somebody else
Tryna tell you I'm the last real nigga left
You can hit me if you need help
With your love problems, with your money problems
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em

Eh, to them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter
I guess it's all survival but please be careful
I gave up on the Bible long time ago
I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids
And dumped them in the creek up from where I live
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza
And said he had a label recruitin' people
Put that on my grandma and everythin'
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me or could've been you too
What a memory in me, needing to lose
What's gon' patch up my inner tube
So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

To add the miles piled up behind me

But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart
For me to drive away with
I begin to understand why God died.

The demons sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw Him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what He had planned
And then I said I'll take the grave
Please just send them all my way

I began to understand why God died

As we're waiting for the morning to begin
But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside I saw it held your heart

I haven't found a drop
Of you

As I hold the water
In the palm of my hand

The waves of the water
Mean nothing to me
But I try my best
And all that I can to
Hold tightly onto
What's left in my hand

How tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down
And the water will drain

That I let another day go by.

I want to be afraid but it seems that these days
I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther
My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my Father
Am I screaming to an empty sky?

Empty sky, no way that's me, 'cause one half of my heart is free.
Empty sky, no way that's me, 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep."

All of us related for something we just been through, 
Taken for granted trust is damaged and now we panic, 
Livin empty-handed living lives like we can manage,

Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded,

I pass the test with colors flying,

They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, 
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick on please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive a
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

Come to You,
In the very cloths that I killed
Killed You in and now I know
I'm alone.

I walk to You,
Rain falls from You.
Can You wash me?
Can You drown me?

I wanna be a lot of things, so much is pent up inside me
I want to be strong, too long I've sat here undecidedly.
Planning strategy, half of me knows it's all just a fallacy.
Failing miserably, drastically, then I crash dramatically
Into a wall. I've been here a hundred times before,
Yet I still ignore the dark red blood stains on the floor,
And I'm back in front of You, Lord, with blood on the floor.
Is the blood mine or Yours? Don't wanna do this anymore!

Back and forth between being me and who You're calling me to be.
You see a man free who thinks he has to buy a key to a door,
But he can't 'cause he's poor and he can't
Fall down anymore 'cause he's already on the floor and
His bones are broken and all and this is his call, 
As he is torn and he will cry and try
Nine times and realize nine crimes but he has more than nine lives 
So he picks himself up and goes climbing for the prize

Again...

Here I come,
Again to You,
Just to show that blood soaked through,
Through my bones and all I own,
Is there a way for me to grow?

I walk to You,
Rain falls from You.
Can You wash me?
Can You drown me?
Please...

Every time I feel a selfish ambition is taking my vision,
My crime is my sentence, repentance is taking commission,
It's taking a toll on my soul, I'm screaming submission and
I don't know if I'm dying or livin'

'Cause I will save-a face for name-a sake, abuse-a grace,
Take-a aim to obtain a new name and a newer place,
But my name-a is lame-a, I can't walk and I ain't the same.
And my name-a became a new destiny to the grave and,

They say the ocean 's blue; but its black right now.
In the dark on the sand looking down at my crowd 
Depression and drowning singing out at four parts.
Lightning reveals where the ocean stops and the sky starts.

I've been told by the sky and the ocean that I win,
But it's hard to see where the ocean stops and sky begins,
The random shocks of light remind me of what is true,
But right now the ocean is blacker than black,
The sky is too."

But he's never really won a prize before.
He goes to lock the door.

He is falling

The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

We all need you now.

Someone said where you going
Someone said to you goodbye
They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the time.
We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.
And we blame it on the times.

Oh he is falling

Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.

We all need you now

I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame

Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.

But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway, if it was our way,
We’d have a tempo change every other time change,
Cause our mind’s changed on what we think is good,
I wasn’t raised in the hood.
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness,
If it wasn’t for this music I don’t know how I would have fought this.
Regardless, all these songs I’m hearing are so heartless,
Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless,
Honest, there’s a few songs on this record that feel common,
I’m in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'.
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency,
My creativity’s only free when I’m playing shows.

I’m sorry if that question I asked last,
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat,
In a gas mask, if you ask Zack,
He’s my brother, he likes when I rap fast.
But let's backtrack, back to this,
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is,
There’s another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this.
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality,
If you get in between someone I love and me,
You’re gonna feel the heat of my cavalry.
All these songs I’m hearing are so heartless,
Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless.

And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways.
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
Cause Sundays are my suicide days.

I don't know why they always seem so dismal.
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle.
Whether it's it the weather or the ledges by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense.
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depres-...-sing thoughts.
I do not have writers block my writer just hates the clock.
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.

And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent.
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence

I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions.
They're trying to eat me, red blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win.
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind.

But I know, we've made it this far... Kid.

Stay with me. No, you don't need to run.
Stay with me, my blood. You don't need to run.

If there comes a day,
People posted up at the end of your driveway,
They're calling for your head,
and they're calling for your name,
I'll bomb down on them, I'm coming through.
Do they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you,
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah.

We glorify those, even more, when they

We give them the highest of praise, and hang their banner from a ceiling
Communicating, further engraving

Don't get me wrong
The rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion
In spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And, could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that ""it"" does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated"

To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,
I go up to the ceiling,
Then I feel my soul start leaving, like an old man's hair receding,
I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking,
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free,
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands,
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness,
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.
I'll stay awake, 'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.
Why am I not scared in the morning, I don't hear those voices calling,
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out,
I swear I heard demons yelling, those crazy words they were spelling,
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.
But I'll tell them,
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans, I'm insignificant,
Please tell them you have no plans for me,
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake,
As the trees they await and clouds anticipate,
The start of a day when we put on our face,
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace,
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,
Desperately yelling there's something we need,
I'm not free I asked forgiveness three times,
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you what I'm sing towards,
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four."

But now I’m insecure and I care what people think.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,
How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from?
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one.
It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam.
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

It just hit me as I lay my head down, 
No one around, 
In the dark cold night, I hear a sound
In my head keeping track of everything you've ever said.
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed.

It's four, crack the door to the hallway of my dreams, 
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me, 
Forcing me out, 
Making me think about you and how you're gone.
I see four o'five with teary eyes and then I write this song.

[Chorus]
And I just can't believe that it has to be this way, 
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day, 
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight, 
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight.

And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say, 
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today, 
'Cause everyday, I walk past the place you left five days of the week, 
And now it's ten after four, and I am taken by sleep.
[End Chorus]

Spending hours on end
Deciding what I'd say to a friend
If I ever saw 'em again, 

'Cause I don't know if I know, and don't wanna come across the wrong way.
'Cause I don't know if I know, but I know I wanna see your face today.

Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down.
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things, 
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath.

[Chorus]

I'll sing a song to you, my friend.
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.

And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way you're by my side until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, ""Don't be afraid.""
I said, ""Don't be afraid.""
We're going home.

I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless beast of death I've made for you
A mortal writing piece of song
Will help me carry on

So the hearse ran out of gas
A passenger purse and grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully planned taxi cab
A cab, had it cleared out back
And two men started to unpack

Driving once again
But now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
""I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day

Then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more,
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the brother we're searching for

Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead
And then one turned around to say,
""We're driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone. ""

I said, ""Don't be afraid."""

Lost his mind

To be alone
Find a wife
And build yourself a home
You have learned
Way too soon
That your dad is now a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now,
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
Cuz your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmare and your frights

No not when I have a lover like you

I haven't eyes for anyone else
I'm thinking of you and nobody else
I haven't eyes for anyone else but you
Yooouuu....

She may be all on my case
Want to kiss me on my face
Put my hands on her waist
Take me back to her place
I would happily follow
But not when I have a lover like you.

I haven't eyes for anyone else
I'm thinking of you and nobody else
I haven't eyes for anyone else but you
But yooouuu....
But yooouuu....
But yooouuu....

There ain't nobody here who can cause me pain or raise my fear

[Verse 1]
You got to serve something, ain't that right?
I know it gets dark, but there's always a light
You don't have to buy in to get into the club
Trade your worries
You gotta show up if you wanna be seen
If it matters to you ma, it matters to me

Not a whole lotta time for me or you
Got a whole lotta reasons to be mad; let's not pick one

And I got no choice but to get right up when the song comes through

With our weapons and our love
And I use them both to cover up

As a mood swing was headed down

Apart from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me
Where I'm going
The part you'll see
How true it is and how back then
It possibly was impossible for you or me to know it

Your touch was nothing more
Than a child's goodbye and hello
It always left me feeling
Worse when it was time to go

Apart from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me
Where I'm going
The part you'll see
How true it is and how back then
It possibly was impossible for you or me to know it

And most of us out there got fooled
Cause the gold it glittered in the night
We chased it fast like drunk buffoons 
The banker lived the artist died

And all our clothes were washed in gray
All our buildings and our cars
As the fluorescent light of day
Bleached the sky and took the stars

Apart from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me

Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads,
No need to keep stressing from our everyday life on our minds
We have got to leave all that behind

Well, I have got a sister,
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
And her daddy is an engineer,
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
We have got to leave all that behind

I have worries to give to the sea
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems

Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
A screaming bloom

What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
Except this is right
We just had to leave all that behind"

Beside the yellow line

'Bout five years ago,
I came about this way
But I doubt they'll know my face
The land hasn't changed
The stars still pierce the black
And I'm glad that I came back
Beside the yellow line

The mind of a girl,
It's hard to understand
But I guess 'cause I'm a man
Her heart fears are unknown
Until I am gone
Gotta leave her all alone
Beside the yellow line

And the call of the road,
Unlike the railroad tracks
Unlike the airplane's path
Her voice floats through the land
And it takes me by the hand
So once again I stand
Beside the yellow line"

Anesthesiologist fiddle and faddle
You all blue and your mama like a rattle

Of five diying soldiers on the front lines
With nobody's singing in nobody's ears
No one's disappointed, nobody hears

I know a lady, promise her name
The price of her visit suffering and pain
And we gladly waited and we gladly paid

Like a summer that I spent,
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes.
I returned to my home,
With a heart part made of stone,
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew.
From the east it comes,
Her love and the rising sun,
And I pray each time they come, it's not the last.
You see I've got strong,
I made it through what came along,
But I can't move on for the beauty of the past.

Came across a pretty girl,
For about a month she was my world,
And I held her hand, and swore we'd never part.
I moved on, she stayed behind,
I said I'd call, she said she'd write,
We lost touch the moment I drove off.
I left town like a gambler with,
The sense of cashin' all the chips,
Before I lost them all on a bad deal.
I made believe I was in a race,
Drove ten thousand miles in seven days,
While writing a book called ""Being A Free Man"".
Met more people than the president,
The good times came and the good times went,
And I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs.
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they know,
And wrote a book called ""People Don't Know Nothin"".
(no matter what they tell ya, man)

Once I spent my last dime,
And counted the ratio of miles to time,
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise.
I had driven my car around the world,
Ended back in the town with the girl,
So I wrote a book called ""Life in Prison"".
(Volume. 1)
I see that girl every now and then,
And we drink to having such good friends,
And apologize for the way it did not last.
Funny thing that it's all true,
And I'll always love November Blue,
But I turned her down for the beauty of the past.

With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes.

The world is closing in on me, I think it's time I go

And I listened as you said to me you'd rather die than grow
Die than grow, die than grow

Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Don't let romance and beating hearts change what we came to do
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you

So I watched as those who ask for love, demanding some respect
Became the last in line to have what they come to expect
As what nobody taught them that they so rightly deserve
And the hums of their misfortune peaked, the hardest lesson learned
Lesson learned, lesson learned

Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you
Don't let romance and beating hearts change what we came to do
Anita, my Anita, I was born to follow you

To watch us fall is why they came
And fall we did, to the call of the highway
Don't go home, don't look ahead, don't look behind
Everything we were is dead

And I drank from there as the colors rang out loudly from your eyes

See I'm as true as I try to be and I must say my girl.
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world.

But when I left your house that morning in that ragged thunderbird
Tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard.
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it years ago.
And since a year ago can't drive past, without turning down that road.

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is.
When you kinda love two girls to figure out which one you miss.
Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes.
Well I kinda loved two girls but now I've kinda lost 'em both.

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life.
Place it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night.
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do.
Would surely float against the slightest wrong I ever did to you."

Well I'm gonna keep on waking
And rising up before the sun
And lying in the dark wide awake
When everybody else is done

And sleeping in their beds so peaceful
Dreaming with the love they choose

No celebration
Divorce separation blues 

Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he

And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came

Well neither one of us
Really wanna hear the town
We try to keep our friends at bay
Try to keep the gossip down

Well some folks just want the dirt
And don't even care if it's true
But then again who cares who's talking
I'm worried for myself and you

And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came

They say one of every two
Bound to be set aflame
Every level of resentment
Responsibility and blame
Well now I'm bound to break a promise
One I made to God and you

I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues 

I've got the tough education
No celebration
Bad communication
Worse interpretation
Love deprivation
Pain allocation
Soul devastation
Cold desolation
Life complication
Resuscitation

Does he hold you? Does he hug you? Does he keep you near?
And as you lie together, does he whisper in your ear?
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?

In the evening, those tired evenings, at twilights first glare
Does he lay in your lap? Do you play with his hair?
And when he falls asleep, Do you just stare?
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?

Late in the night when you fear the unknown
Does he warm up your mind? As you chill to the bone
I do love you, I do feel you, Each day and night
But I can't tell right from wrong, or fear from insight
But you always knew everything and that is what is clear
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?"

Down with the glistening shine.

It's in with the new and out with the old.
Out goes the warm and in comes the cold.
It's the most predictable story told.
It's in with the young and it's out with the old.

Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.

A belly full of high dollar wine.
A fat hand and a fat wallet, too.
Things change and get strange with this movement of time.
It's happening, right now to you.

Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.

It's a real bad time to bring up the truth.
Though we've searched, we've found no fountain of youth.
Not in Spain, no where near, not anywhere close to here.

Oh, there's nothing good, because nothing lasts.
And all that comes, it comes here to pass.
I voice my pain, but the change will not last.
All that comes, it comes here to pass.

A field of cars and people; rows of concrete, paint, and steel
Manhattan is where it grew

And I thought to cut it from it's stem
And take it from the cracks between bricks that it lay in
And save it from city strife
Away from the city life

Then someone they whispered in my ear
A county girl can't be made out of anybody here
Don't touch it, it loves you not
Don't touch it, it loves you not

Cause blue birds don't fly without their wings
And when we put them in a cage the world can't hear them sing
So selfish when greed sets in
Possession, the king of sin

And people don't ever let you down
Forever find a way to kill whatever life they've found
A heart beat and I want it too
Manhattan is where she grew

So I left and I let the flower be
And yesterday saw the flower on cable tv
Much prettier than here with me
For all of the world to see
Much prettier than here with me"

Sooner then my fate was wrote
Perfectly it slit my throat
And beads of lust released into the air.
When I awoke you were standing there.

I was on the mend when I fell through.
The sky around was anything but blue.
I found as I regained my feet
A wound across my memory
That no amount of stitches would repair.
But I awoke and you were standing there.

There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end.
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them.
There's no falling back to sleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready, 
I'm rested and I'm ready to begin.
I'm ready to begin.

I went on the search for something real.
Traded what I know for how I feel.
But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
Upon the darkness I was trapped
And as the last of breath was drawn from me
The light broke in and brought me to my feet.

There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end.
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them.
There's no falling back to sleep
Once you've wakened from the dream.

Which is the poison and which is the wine?
The scent and the colors are so much alike
And how much of each will it take to decide,
When your at the table alone?
Where do you go when it's perfectly clear?
You might find your way but you won't find it here
What makes it easy to sound so sincere,
When you know that you don't care?

Never was content

It was hostel moves and hotel rooms
Watch my friends promote their dooms
From Pontiac to Newport News
Nothin' made much sense

And I had to leave a few behind
When they replaced the apple wine
With cocaine and codeine pills
I knew I was done

And I didn't really say goodbye
They'll walk their path and I'll walk mine
I will find other ways
To tear my body down

I am staying here with you
I've done all I know to do
They say ""stand up straight and take your eyes
Off the wooden floor""
No, I didn't find what I was looking for
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood
Still I had to go
From Fisher Road to Hollywood

They taught some bigger words to me
At the university
Only it's a curse to speak
Without some regard

For the one I'm talking to
Do I sound like a friend to you
Do we even speak the same
Language anymore

I am staying here with you
I've done all I know to do
They say ""stand up straight and take your eyes
Off the ballroom floor""

Said we can't use the songs we wrote

Three thieves left
One got smart
I saw him leaving in his car
From the road
I heard him scream
It lacks originality

Two thieves left
They both agree
They live and die off melody
One just fell dead
On his back
When we listen to the track

One thief left
He went to jail
He left a mile on paper trail
He's in for life
He doesn't care
It's worth the songs that put him there

And every case that's made

It's me this time
And I'm trading fun for right
Will I regret the notion later?

Geraldine's the name that comes to mind
When I go back to reminiscing
Abilene's a woman for my childhood
I spent the evenings kissing

I'm a fool for dreaming her alive
And loving something cold and rocky
The homophobic gentlemen
They'll barricade but their efforts couldn't stop me

You said it wasn't a problem, that there was nothing wrong
With putting my work, my art, and my songs
Before spending time at the wedding
As I listened over the phone-line, you talked and you sounded so sad
Alone in a room full of strangers, some dude saying I treat you bad
Who is this guy and what does he know?
Apparently more than I do

I wanna be good to you
I wanna be there for you
And when I come home, will you still want me to?

The child has disappeared

You're either working on yourself or you're lookin' after babies
Takin' care of your old man or your old lady

See, you can only live one day at a time
Only drive one hot rod at a time
Only say one word at a time
And only think one thought at a time
And every soul is alone when the day becomes night
And there in the dark if you can try to see the light
In the most pitch black shape of the loneliest shadow
Well then you ought to sleep well
'Cause there's hope for sure
Well I don't know about all that being true but
I do know this

You say I wouldn't know you now,
Well I didn't even know you then

And so I go out friday night and talk to anyone I can.
If they can see me they can hear me run my mouth.
I tell them all I'd love to see you once again
Or maybe just run into you hanging out,
Hanging out.

You know (you know)
I lie (I lie)
So it comes as no surprise
When I (Admit)
That I (That I)
Don't really want to reunite.

So I guess it's kinda funny how
I loved you so way back when.
You say I wouldn't know you now,
Well I didn't even know you then.

Lighting up your living room high on the mantle
I could bring some romance without any scandal
And then when you were done you'd just put me out

I wish I was a tune you sang in your kitchen
Putting your groceries away and washing your dishes
I could float around your tongue and ease the tension
And then when you were done you'd just quiet down

But if I get too close
Will the magic fade?
Would I turn you off or away?
If I pull you in
Would I push you out
Of something here you care about?
I'm at a loss for what to do
I'm drawn to you

I wish I was a sweater wrapped around your hips
And when it got too cold into me you'd slip
And when the sun came back you would hang me up
And I would watch you while you undress

But if I get too close
Will the magic fade?
Would I turn you off or away?
If I pull you in

Will you take it
Will you keep it
Will you read it

I love you

Although I know it's not something that you were asking me to do
And I know we are young but we won't always be, so marry me
Let's not be that predictable young couple changing, moving on

Confident enough to honestly believe that nothing out there stopping me 
Especially not someone who's not loving me
Now listen here I told you I could live on with out loving you
I was bluffing then, but it seems that just might have been the truth
Well my dad told me, ""One day son, this girl will think of what she's done 
And hurting you will be the first of many more regrets to come.""
And he said, ""If she doesn't call, then it's her fault and it's her loss.""

Push my feelings all aside
I will rearrange my plans and change for you.

If I could go back
Then that's the first thing I would do
I swear that I would
Do my best to follow through
Come up with a master plan
A homerun hit a winning stand
A guarantee and not a promise
That I will never let your love slip through my hands.

If it's the beaches
If it's the beaches sands you want then you will have them
If it's the mountain's bending rivers then you will have them
If it's a wish to run away then I will grant it
Take whatever you think of
While I go gas up the truck
Pack the old love letters up
We will read them when we forget why we left here..."

The boss wants it done, but he’ll have to wait

Probably not much of anything

Still I can’t resist, to let my thoughts stray. What harm will it do?

If we're together, we're way past that
And I've already asked her
So in January, we're getting married

She's talking to me with her
Voice down so low I barely hear her
But I know what she's saying,
I understand because my heart and hers are the same.
And in January, we're getting married

And I was sick with heartache
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn
When I met her
But we would both surrender.
True love is not the kind of thing you
Should turn down.
Don't ever turn it down.

I hope that I don't sound too
Insane when I say there is darkness
All around us.
I don't feel weak but I do
Need sometimes for her to protect me,
And reconnect me
To the beauty that I'm missing.
And in January, we're getting married

No longer does it matter
What circumstances we were born in.
She knows which birds are singing
And the names of the trees where they're performing
In the morning
And in January, we're getting married
Come January, let's get married"

To flag my life down

Why do you amaze me?
Why do you fool me into thinkin' that I'm kind of in love with you?

She's good as a mystery
A salesman for misery
And I am bankrupt
In debt to my knees

Big brown eyes and curly hair
I wonder if she sees me stare
I can't say why I've fallen
Babe, please have mercy

Why do you amaze me?
Why do you amaze me?
Why do you fool me into thinkin' that I'm kind of in love with you?

We sink like a ball and chain
If I knew more than your first name
Those eyes you got can't fool me
I know how this goes

We'd wrap ourselves in conversation
You tell lies and try my patience
Bite my tongue in frustration
Or you slap my face

Why do you amaze me?
Why do you fool me into thinkin' that I'm kind of in love with you?"

We climbed the ladder to the top of my house
Never letting go of your hand
The sky trades the moon for the sun my girl
The sky trades the moon for the sun

And I gave to you my ugly brown coat
You made it pretty when you put it on
Warmth in the early morning chill my girl
Warmth in the early April

Then you said you'd trade the love of a man
Tears fell soft from your face to my hands
Said you'd trade your heart for mine my girl
I traded my heart for those days

And you made it clear it was strictly a deal
Of springtime love and that's how I should feel
So I set the clock back an hour my girl
I set the time a just right

You see somewhere back there when I was boy
Furious I had become by the point
That men are just liars and thieves of sorts
Men are just liars and thieves

But I still believe and I stand by my words
I don't know what you have seen or you've heard
But somebody's lying to you my girl
Somebody's lying to you

You really made me believe I could stay
Part with you actions in part what you said
But that was just foolish pride my girl
And those are only feelings inside

So I'm going back to the place where we met
I'm going to find the beer bottle we left
Wedged in the limbs of the tree that we sat in
Wedged in the magnolia tree

Well we hid for days like a proud pair of thieves
Too sure we were right too stubborn too leave
Wasted with the moment we lifted my girl
Stolen forever with you"

He thinks his house will clean
If he shares with me mine

I used to grab at truth with those same strong hands
Then when I got sick through the thin and then the thick
I turn my back and I let myself live

Well the nights only get longer
Before your sun will shine
Leave the clock alone my brother
Your enemy is time
Remember what the ramblin man said
On his way back home
Don't hang your head much longer

From this highway
East of Roanoke
We had a moment
That felt like summer
Now in slumber
I can see your smile
We drive for miles
Through corporate Ohio
Rest stops in West Virginia
Traffic in Washington dc
But of all the scenes that I see
Played out this window to the left of me
The thought of you it shines
The band plays on, I keep the time

We play in the night time
Awake before sunrise
Wipe the sleep from my eyes
Coffee my best friend
You dance between classes
Complete difficult assignments
Wonder where the time went
Out drinking with your friends
We see a lot of beauty
Some becomes ordinary
Mountains, and canyons, and prairies
Sunset over Chesapeake Bay
Dear, dear Carla
It's only that I'm askin'
Make time more easy for the passin'
If I knew I would see you again
Of all the beauty that I see
Out this window to the left of me
The thought of you it shines

The time is marked, between the lines
Hmmm... I keep the time"

Spoke among hers
Wretched in the tongue of their world
We're not of that world at all
We will never be

Wouldn't it be fine to stand
Behind the words we say in the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell in paradise
Right here on Earth

Keep it, use it
Build it, move it
Planes can touch our time will prove it
Watch us fly as loud we can

A frozen heart and frozen shoulders that is what I’ve got

Who thinks to himself
“I’ve got to get back to the man that I was when I was a dreamer
With a partner in crime named Brandy Mcgill
A girl with a love of life bigger than normal who still wonders when her life will begin
Her best friend Maria who seems to have everything tells her she probably just needs a vacation away from the stress of her husband’s vocation

While Maria is talking, Brandy is drifting, staring at John who just got the job
Busing tables to pay for Community College
An Associates degree in x-ray technology

John is too old to still be in college
He doesn’t like class and sometimes does not go
Long story short his family was broken

He was freed from a past life as a kid on Skid row

He notices Brandy but stares at Maria
Her beauty well practiced in casting a spell

Imagining her naked he spills dirty dishes
On the lap of an elderly woman named Belle

A lady who won’t live to see her next birthday
But shares a warm smile regardless of that

The mess that unfolds completely surrounds her
Not one bit of urgency enters her soul

She reaches for Roy, her husband forever
In love and connection, her small hand he holds

And nothing comes of it but a manager’s anger
Not for the mess, but her father’s remark
About a bad grade she had as a child

So she takes her revenge out by firing John
Who now wonders when his life will begin

Ain’t it confusing to search for the will and learn when you find it that you’ve lost your way

Long story short he saw a commercial that said that the 20’s are the prime of your life

But that doesn’t seem to be true at this moment as he cleans out his locker and calls his best friend
Who’s too busy to talk cause he’s prepping with lawyers to keep money from his ex-wife

The mother of their only son who’s naturally drawn to guns and sharp objects who now has no father except for on weekends two times a month

No need to worry, I’m told we’re protected by the men passing laws in the house and the senate from people who mix up the truth and reality with movies and games and ridiculous scenarios

Long story short, best I can tell, children can’t be left to raise themselves"

Farther from how you thought they would
Do you still want my hand?
Do you think I'm still your man?
I'll change everything I can.
Matrimony...

Holy plans and holy gifts
Holy shit what did we get
You said you've got plans of your own
You're gonna work and I'll stay home.
Do you still want my hand?
Do you still think I'm your man?
I'll change everything I can.
Matrimony...

My dog is loud and my dog is wild
We're too young to have a child
Can you keep the dog next week?
I'll be gone the next three.
Do you still want my hand?
Do you still think I'm your man?
I'll change everything I can.
Matrimony...

I ain't through I ain't walking out
Leaving ain't what I'm about,
You may scream and I may shout.
But baby I love you."

He speaks from The Good Book and his hand
And helps all people when he can
But me and God don't need a middle man

Well I found God in a soft woman's hair
A long days work and a good sittin' chair
The ups and downs of the treble clef lines
And five miles ago on an interstate sign
My God, my God and I don't need a middle man
My God, my God and I don't need a middle man

Now I don't doubt that The Good Book is true
What's right for me may not be right for you
To church on Sunday I'll stand beside
All the hurtin' people with the fear in their eyes
And I thank the Lord for the country land
Just like pa I thank him for my hands
And I don't know if my soul is safe
I sometimes use curse words when I pray
My God, my God and I don't need a middle man
My God, my God and I don't need a middle man
My God, my God and I don't need a middle man
My God, my God and I don't need a middle man"

You don’t come around here anymore
Worse than that
Nothing’s really helping I’ve been thinking
’bout drinking again

It’s alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don’t go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there’s hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone

Her name became
The flame unto the fire
A magpie on the wire [...]
I fell into the hive
Shamelessly alive until the dawn [...]

It’s alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don’t go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there’s hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone

But we can go ahead
If no one notices
What’s the point of it?
I have to ask

How you learn to see
Hope inside of me
When you’re soon to be
On leave at last

Hurt so bad
More than I expected that it would
Worse than that
It seems to be lasting just a little
Longer than it should

It’s alright
If you finally stop caring
Just don’t go and tell someone that does
Cause even though I know there’s hope in
Every morning song
I have to find that melody alone
I have to find that melody alone
I have to find that melody alone
I have to find that melody alone"

Don't go revengin in my name
One person dead from such is plenty
No need to go get locked away

When I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over long
I'm comin' home

I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents love the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They seem to let the other go

A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said I love you and I'm proud of you both
in so many different ways

If I get murdered in the city
Go read the letter in my desk
Don't worry with all my belongings
But pay attention to the list

Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember, there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember, there was nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name"

Did you sleep?
Not a wink
Well neither did I

I've never been too good at readin' in between the lines
So babe spell it out but you don't have to shout when you're talking to me
Do you care?
Are you there?
Well neither am I

Don't lock your door everyone is poor between the lines
And I could never steal the sadness you feel when your changing you mind
Oh my dear
Can you hear?
Well neither can I

I want to live and I want you to live happy and free
But I don't know how to seperate the now from what used to be
Will you sleep?

To welcome you back or push you away
But wait we're not there yet
And though I'm losing the bet

I felt so surprised
When she arrived
Wearing a smile
Smiles soon turn to tears
Out on her back pier
After all the love how did I end here

It used to be a man’s world, but all we did was fight

I’m glad it’s finally in the hands of the women and the girls
I can’t wait to see what they do with what’s left of the world

Ladies, I’m sorry, but we couldn’t seem to learn
How to live in peace, so Rome had to burn

And we cared about clean air, but there was money to be made
And breathing is nice but it don’t compare to getting paid

It used to be a man’s world, but we didn’t treat it right
It used to be a man’s world, but all we did was fight

I’m glad it’s finally in the hands of the women and the girls
I can’t wait to see what they do with what’s left of the world

Please I beg your pardon, but we got a bit confused
Some of our brothers thought our sisters were born for getting used

Then we made the assumption that’s how it should be done
And then tried to excuse ourselves in the name of fun

Don’t get me wrong, hope ain’t fully gone
Scores of decent men built the rode I’m standing on
But a lot of it has crumbled through prideful mistakes
And ashes cover much of what the flood he didn’t take

I know that we are giving you a lot to straighten out, the silver lining broke away from the thunder cloud

And it took us a few thousand years to make a mess so fine
I bet y’all sort it out in less than half the time

It used to be a man’s world, excess in the extreme
It used to be a man’s world, but we ran out of steam

We couldn’t seem to reach the grace that’s born in every girl
Still I hope that I can lend a hand in this new woman’s world

Let me know if I can help out, in this new woman’s world"

And if I was stayin', would you stay with me
And if I had money, would it all look good
And if I had a job now, like a good man should
And if I came to you tomorrow, and said let's run away
Would you roll like the wind does, baby would you stay

My heart is dancin', to a November tune
And I hope that you hear it, singing songs about you
I sing songs of sorrow, because you're not around
See, babe I'm gone tomorrow, Baby follow me down

I don't know why I have to, but this man must move on
I love my time here, didn't know 'til I was gone
November shadows, shade November change
November spells sweet memory, the season blue remains
November spells sweet memory, the season blue remains

Your yellow hair is like the sunlight, however sweet it shines
Bit by the cold of December, I'm warm beside your smile

To me it's perfect
Just wanna do you right

And I've known others
And I've loved others too
But I loved them cause they were stepping stones
On a staircase to you

Sometimes I act foolish
I don't know what to do
Please babe try not to judge me
For my offering is true

And I dream of children
We can call our own
Watch 'em run around in the front yard
From the front porch of our home"

I'd work my day to come home to you, oh yeah
You could do whatever you wanted to, uh huh
With you big brown eyes and your curly brown hair
I'm doin' the best I can do just to try to not stare
My God your loveliness

Got a feeling you maybe won't like the news, oh no
Ya ain't going like it when you have to choose, oh no
If you and me were born to never be apart
I can feel it in my mind, I can feel it in my soul, in my heart

Oh baby please come around
Oh baby please come around
Oh baby please come around

Was that your man, he's you fiancee, oh yeah
Another one ties the knot each and everyday, uh huh
I've got to get up the nerve to pick up the phone
It's you sweet mama, I'm a-goin' carry you back home
Way out to Old Wyom

I probably shoulda thought about lettin' you know, uh huh
If I love you like I do I should've told you so, uh huh

It's just my knees gettin' weak when I try to say

Oh baby please be mine
Oh baby please be mine
Oh baby please be mine

How could something so beautiful think about me?

Try on my trusty ramblin' sack

The Avett Brothers,Once And Future Carpenter,/t/the+avett+brothers/once+and+future+carpenter_20976584.html,"I ain't from Texas, but I made my way from Dallas
And I know the lonesome sound is following
I ain't a gambler, but I can recognize a hand
And when to hold, when the queens are staring back at me
Once I was a carpenter, man my hands were calloused
I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight
But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry
And I left the timbers rotting where they lay

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
Well we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given, I wont be scared to die

And I don't come from Detroit, but her diesel motors pull me
And I followed till I finally lost my way
And now I spend my days in search of a woman we called purpose
And if I ever pass back through her town I'll stay

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black dress drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
Well we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die

And my life is but a coin, pulled from an empty pocket
Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind
And hope and fear go with it, and moon and the sun go spinning
Like the numbers and fruits before our eyes

Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind
Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind

Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
And when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
And when the black cloak drags upon the ground
I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
Well we're all in this together
If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die"

Stars fallin' from high forgotten sky
I was a one-line wonder in my own love song

I keep a little journal by my bed
Dreams help me find the words I haven't said
Like when a little girlie said goodbye to me

From behind a screen door
I won't see her again I'm sure
Didn't I say I need you
I tried to move on but I can't
I tried to think of bad times
Good memories are all I have

I love you but I can't remember why
I'd love to find a reason to deny
I was a one-hit wonder in my own hometown

And I guess I might have made a few mistakes
But maybe that's exactly what it takes
To get a little happy in this big sad world

How many have you made
And which of those have you laid on down to die
Well didn't I say I need you
I tried to move on but I can't
I tried to think of bad times
Good memories are all I have"
The Avett Brothers,Open Ended Life,/t/the+avett+brothers/open+ended+life_21070154.html,"[Verse:]
Pack a change of clothes and a pillow for the road
For when you drift off to sleep
Put the sketches and the notes in the box labeled 'burn with furniture'

We will watch the fire burn the whole entire house we built
Down to ashes
From the mirror we'll admire how the flame quickly retires
We won't waste a long goodbye on the smoke or foolish lies
That finally passed us

[Chorus:]
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing

[Verse 2:]
Let's find something new to talk about
I'm tired of talkin' about myself
I spent my whole life talkin' to convince
Everyone that I was something else

And the part that kinda hurts is I think it finally worked
And now I'm leaving
I get the feeling things have changed
But the mystery to me is where and when along the way
Did anyone decide that they believed me

[Chorus:]
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing
I was told to keep an open-ended life
To never trap yourself in nothing

[Verse 3:]
When we settle down in another nowhere town
Let's tell our neighbors
We won't be here long and we'll be quiet
But don't go askin' any favors

I can't stand the unexpected uninvited visits
From too many strangers
My trust has dwindled down
And I can leave just as abruptly as I came here

[Chorus:]
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
To never trap yourself in nothing
I was taught to keep an open-ended life
And never trap myself in nothing"

There was a time I could breathe

Though we might never see this moment again
May you find all that you need
An easy way to forget about me
May you forget about me

My dreams are lies
That I have tried to ignore

From my dear brothers ragged six string
Singing the songs we're embarrassed to sing

Whispering to your friends and watching me

Hoping your man is nowhere to be found

Quietly act like you love me until I leave Feltre
And when you learn of my return
Watch what the townspeople say

Riding in your cargo van
Driving your mom's cargo van
If you only knew how charming it was
The lure of your folks cargo van
The lure of your folks cargo van

Be clear with the facts
Leave me a letter to there

And you are the culprit, I am the same

For you to fall in love with me
Give me a life, give me a life
Give me tonight, it's only right

Thirty days alone with the savior
An angel, a devil, rapture and smoke
And I'm careful, just not to say that I miss you

Asked around and heard that you did too
Two drunken years and push came to shove
I met love, love left me blue

You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life

And I'm all right, yeah, I think I'm fine
My savior lives in telephones
And I just dream of you and step outside
Dial up and hope that you're home

You're rising like a sun
That waits up all night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life

Hold on a minute, yeah, I do love you
Sometimes I guess that ain't enough
When you come round you put me through
And I thank you, oh, so much

Another year, maybe, three or four
Maybe five or six or even more
You'll find another man to take my place
And I'll see you on the good Lord's shores

You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone, but you did.
I can still hear the song, 
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong, I was right- so I walked away, 
And left you there, alone-
I got so tired of talkin on the telephone, 
How many times would we say the words goodbye

I made mistakes, and one was telling you that I'd be there, 
When telling time had come, 
I should've said I didn't care.
Ohh, the time I would have saved, 
If I had been less willing to accommodate, 
You'd been a little less likely to cry.

You go back to the high life, 
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known, but now I know-
There'll be no word from you, 
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.
The way you cut the rope, 
That kept you dangling from such pitiful amounts of hope- 
I would have cut it too."

I suspect it was your friends
Or was it a stranger
Convincing you that this was the end

And I would like to thank you
For coming round and doing this
My nights have been pretty painful
Losing that pain was always the trick

You always said that I was lying
That I was just a selfish man
But I all ready gave it all away
So you can let go of my selfish hand

So bye bye bye bye bye
I ain't got time to watch you cry
Cause I've been drinking seven hours now
Sympathy is a waste of my high

And I would like to say it hurts me (but it don't)
That I don't know just what to do (but I do)

No I never want to hurt our family

No this is not just about me
And I don't know a plainer way to say it Babe
And they may pay us off in fame
Though that is not why we came
And I know well and good that won't heal our hearts

We came for salvation
We came for family
We came for all that's good that's how we'll walk away
We came to break the bad
We came to cheer the sad
We came to leave behind the world a better way

Now if I'm walkin' through the rain
And I hear you call my name
I will break into a run without a pause
And if your love laughs at your dreams
Well it's not as bad as it seems
Either way one of them has got to go
And if you take of my soul
You can still leave it whole
With the pieces of you own you leave behind

We came for salvation
We came for family
We came for all that's good that's how we'll walk away
We came to break the bad
We came to cheer the sad
We came to leave behind the world a better way

And I would give up everything

And see you shine so bright in a world of woe
And they may pay us off in fame

And if it compromises truth then we will go

About us that we never knew

And just like every word they say
And we will hold hands as they fade

Shame, boatloads of shame
Day after day, more of the same
Blame, please lift it off
Please take it off, please make it stop

I felt so sure of everything
My love to you so well received
And I just strutted 'round your town
Knowing I didn't let you down
The truth be known, the truth be told
My heart was always fairly cold
Posing to be as warm as yours
My way of getting in your world
But now I'm out and I've had time
To look around and think 
And sink into another world
That's filled with guilt and overwhelming

Shame, boatloads of shame
Day after day, more of the same
Blame, please lift it off
Please take it off, please make it stop

It gives but doesn’t match how much it takes
Growing stronger and loud
I lived it but now I’m wanting out

I built the fence I hung the sign
Blood red letters say keep in mind
Of where I’ve been so don't come in
How long can you live in shame
And drop a life long curse on your own last name
The trouble is I'm used to it

It's the questions that keep me turning back
To see those rumors turn to fact
Wondering lonely and scared
I live the tragedy I share

I built the fence I hung the sign
Wine red letters say keep in mind
Where we’ve been so don't come in
How long can we live in shame
And drop a life long curse on our own last names

To aggression
Are you to assess what I've been? What I am? Or become?
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
It can be to
Attack those around 'cause you're
True to color, a town, a time, or a place?
It's not you, it's not mine
And besides it is gone
And you never will find it again

I just ask let me be
I won't give the chance to be my enemy

Just begging me to stay

To catch the moonlight on the graves

You're a canopy bed
You're June to August
You're the back and forth sway of the hammock all day

The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow.
The record will stop the record will go.
Latches latched the windows down,
The dog coming in the dog going out.
Up with caffeine and down with a shot.
Constantly worried about what I've got.
Stretching my work but I can't make a stop
And my confidence on and my confidence off.
And I sink to the bottom and rise to the top
And I think to myself that I do this a lot.
World outside just goes it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes...
And witness it all from the blinds of my window.
Three, four

I'm a little nervous 'bout what you'll think
When you see me in my swimming trunks
And last night in New York I got raging drunk
Remember one time I got raging drunk with you

Now, I can recall a time when we made the city
Streets our playground, swimming in the fountains
Filled with cigarettes and bottles
Sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone

Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because the damned alcohol
Beacuse what ever at all

Now I've grown to aware of my mortality
To let go and forget about dying
Long enough to drop the hammer down
And let the indolence go wild and flying through

When death finds your bed
And you are gone

And if I had seen, the way it would be
I'd hushed your cries, when you came to me
If I could do what I did to you
The same to me that I would love for you to see
That I sleep with remorse
And regret hangs round my door...
For ever more.

If I had known the lowering tide
Was lowering with the way you felt inside
If I had known all hope was gone
A broken heart and a broken home
That pierced, my lover's past
And carved a lonely path...
For her to walk

If folks like you would let it be""

Will you understand, when I am too old of a man?
And will you forget when we have paid our debt
Who did we borrow from? Who did borrow from?

I wanna have pride like my mother has
And not like the kind in the bible that turns you bad
I wanna have friends that I can trust
That love me for the man I've become and not the man that I was"

I'd walk away from this old farm

There ain't no cows left for milking

There ain't no chickens laying nothing

I would find somebody

I'm convinced that nothings true
Just cause love worked out for you
Don't impress me no more

I got dreams but nothing to hope for

Keep your distance I mean no good
Lady, lady,
I'm broken-hearted and I think the world should
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too
Ya'll should be broken-hearted too

If I could I'd give all my pain to you"
The Avett Brothers,The Weight Of Lies,/t/the+avett+brothers/the+weight+of+lies_21393977.html,"Disappear from your home town
Go and find the people that you know
Show them all of your good parts 
Leave town when the bad ones start to show

Going with a woman 
A pretty girl that you never met
Make sure she knows you love her well
But don't make any other promises

The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
When you run make sure you run 
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere

I once heard the worse thing a man can do is draw a hungry crowd
Tell everyone his name in pride and confidence 
But leaving out his doubts
I'm not sure I bought those words
When I was young I knew most everything
These words have never meant as much to anyone
As they now mean to me 

The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
When you run make sure you run 
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you down

The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
So when you run make sure you run 
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere

The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town 'cause
Nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
So when you run make sure you run 
To something and not away from 'cause
Lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you down"

We were just fighting when winter began
The coldness of our words competing with the wind from the north

Still they make me shiver but in a very different way
The pages of the calendar kept turning away
I have some better words now, but it's too late to say them to you

My dream of all dreams and my hope of all hopes
Is only to tell you and make sure you know
How much I love you and how much I always did

And yes I know you loved me I could see it in your eyes
And it was in your struggle and it was in your mind
And it was in your smile you gave me when I was a kid

Feels like no one understands
And now my only chance
To talk to you is through my prayers
I only wanted to tell you I care

Every night after and every day since
I find myself crying when the memory hits
Sometimes it knocks me down, sometimes I can just put it away

Down in my mind where I don't care to go
The pain of a lesson is letting me know
If you have love in your heart let it show while you can

Yes now I understand
But now my only chance
To talk to you is through my prayers
I only wanted to tell you I care
I only wanted to tell you I care"

Down a long dirt road in a pickup truck

Couldn't leave the city lights it just ain't right

I was born out west of Cheyenne town
While my ma and pa was ramblin' 'round
I'm a rambler too, but I'm country bound
I'll travel till my country home is found
And I will travel
Yeah, I will travel
I will travel 'till my country home is found

Well a country song on the radio
Country star but what do you know
He's a city boy singin country tunes
I'm a country boy with those city blues
So I will travel
Yeah I will travel
I will travel 'till my country home is found

Well Chestertown (lets go), Albany (lets go), Neptune (lets go), Pittsburgh (let's go), Cleveland town (let's go),...
Etc...

I've got the wheels to ride and the wheels to run,
Some say I got ramblin' in my blood
No pretty girl can slow me down
I'll travel 'till my country home is found
So I will travel
I will travel
I will travel till my country home is found
Yeah, I will travel
I will travel

Well I killed poor Jed Bryce in a bad laredo fight
I killed him with my bare hands for the girl I loved that night
Jed's brothers out to get me, he's coming with his gang
And I'd rather shoot it out by God than let them watch me hang

Bullet in my shoulder, blood running down my vest
Twenty in the posse and they're never gonna let me rest
'Till I became a wanted man, well I never even owned a gun
Now they own me like a mountain cat and I'm always on the run

She had spangles on her wedding dress,
She had laughter in her voice
And when they tried to put their hands on her,
My heart left me no choice
Now was she really worth it, I guess I'll never know
She'll be drinking someone elses rye, when I'm six feet below.

The Avett Brothers,We Americans,/t/the+avett+brothers/we+americans_1719751.html,"I grew up with reverence for the red white and blue
Spoke of God and liberty reciting the pledge of allegiance

Learned love of country from my own family
Some shivered and prayed approaching the beaches of Normandy

The flag waves high and that’s how it should be
So many lives given and taken in the name of freedom

But the story is complicated and hard to read
Pages of the book obscured or torn out completely

I am a son of uncle Sam and I struggle to understand the good and evil
But I’m doing the best I can in a place built on stolen land with stolen people

Blood in the soil with the cotton and tobacco
Blood in the soil with the cotton and tobacco
Blood in the soil with the cotton and tobacco

A misnamed people and a kidnapped race
Laws may change but we can’t erase the scares of the nation

Of children devalued and disavowed
Displaced by greed and the arrogance of manifest destiny

Short-sighted to say it was a long time ago
Not even two life times have passed since the days of Lincoln

The sins of Andrew Jackson, the shame of Jim crow
And time moves slow when the tragedies are beyond description

I am a son of uncle Sam and I struggle to understand the good and evil
But I’m doing the best I can in a place built on stolen land with stolen people

We are more than the sum of our parts
All these broken homes and broken hearts

God will you keep us wherever we go
Will you forgive us for where we’ve been?

We Americans

Blood on the table with the coffee and the sugar
Blood on the table with the coffee and the sugar
Blood on the table with the coffee and the sugar

I’ve been to every state and seen shore to shore the still open wounds of the Civil War
Washed blind hatred bounce back and forth seen vile prejudice both in the south and the north

And accountability is hard to impose of ghosts of ancestors haunting the halls of our conscious

But the path of grace and good will is still here
For those of us who may be considered among the living

I am a son of God and man and I may never understand the good and evil but I dearly love this land because of this and in spite of We The People

We are more than the sum of our parts
All these broken bones and broken hearts

God will you keep us wherever we go
Can you forgive us for where we’ve been?

I say things I don't want to say
I do things I don't wanna do
I talk mean to you
But if I think
I just might get something out of this
My parents taught me to learn when I miss
Just do your best
Just do your best

It's the only way to keep that last bit of sanity
Maybe I don't have to be good but I can try to be
At least a little better than I've been so far

But when I drink
I hear things that aren't really there
I feel things when I shouldn't really care
Have fist fights with the air
But if I think about someone besides myself
I lived through the silver and the bell
With something to tell
Just do your best

It's the only way to keep that last bit of sanity
Maybe I don't have to be good but I can try to be
At least a little better than I've been so far

But when I drink
I spend the next morning in a haze
But we only get so many days
Now I have one less
Just do your best

It's the only way to keep that last bit of sanity
Maybe I don't have to be good but I can try to be
At least a little better than I've been so far
Oh, at least a little better than I've been so far"

So bright that you forget you have never had a home

I gave the world my best, brought back to you the rest, and in return you loved me more

How do I return all that I took from you
And all the life you gave to me

When you learn you can earn the love you're waiting for
It’s already yours

There is no reason we should doubt
The broken hearts will rise again

The mending touch of something grand
Isn’t that what it’s about?

The blind are charging through the night
Guided by the steady hand

I gave the world my best, brought back to you the rest, and in return you loved me more

How do I return all that I took from you and all the life you gave to me

When you learn you can earn the love you’re waiting for

You slipped through my hands
Like I did through my Dad’s
Like a river that passes
The rocks that it’s on
I’m bracing for loneliness
I know it’s comin’
Who will I hold when you’re gone
Now who will I hold you’re gone

[Verse 1]
Now happiness comes
And it seems much like money
People gather around it
When it’s gone they go runnin’
I’m trying to be here
Lift up to the now
But the past has to come
And it pulls me back down

Like I did through my lover’s
Like a river that passes
The bed that it’s on
I’m bracing for loneliness
I know it’s comin’
Who will I hold when you’re gone
Now who will I hold when you’re gone

[Verse 2]
Now these victims of love
Most hopeless of all
The unfortunate prisoners
In an infinite war
They turn on themselves
It’s pure sabotage
Silver spoon babies with Tupperware hearts
Silver spoon babies with Tupperware hearts

You slipped through my hands
Like I did through my Mama’s
Like a river that passes
The rocks that it’s on
I’m bracing for loneliness

Now who will I hold when you’re gone
Who will I hold when you’re gone

A million colors fill my eyes
The Roman candles and the stars
Calendar says July 4th
But it's still winter in my heart

They say flowers bloom in Spring
Red and Golden, Blue and Pink
They say seasons turn in time
Theirs our changing, why won't mine?

The floating, yellow leaves of Fall

The air in there is frigid cold

The blood wiped away to hide
How evil you grandfather was 'fore he died
But war can make monsters out of us all
I'm sure I'd become one if I was called
And then it would be my blade
Here at this yardsale

The guitar I am holding is way out of tune
The neck it is warped and the saddle is through
I wonder if sweet music ever was played
From the hands of a boy to a girl in the shade
From this rickety ghost of a song
Here at this yardsale

A dollar for anything here on this quilt
A price tag for hands from which all things are built
A blanket of voices speak pleasure in shame
Flowers of plastic and fruit of the same
A basket of nothing at all
Here at this yardsale

So if I had the money I'd buy everything
And cover the whole lot with good gasoline
And burn it for all that I care for the past
And rid mother earth of what never should last
And give her the present of ash
Made of a yardsale"
