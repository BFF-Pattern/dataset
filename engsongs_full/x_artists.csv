Of polystyrene foam
And fell into a swimming pool
Filled with fairy snow
And watched the world turn day-glo

I wrenched the nylon curtains back
As far as they would go
And peered through perspex window panes
At the acrylic road

I drove my polypropolene
Car on wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a wimpy bar
To have a rubber bun

The X-rays were penetrating
Through the laytex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves
Fell from the rayon trees"

Alcohol, drugs and rock n' roll
Come on doggy doggy let's go for a stroll
Before and after human growl so foul
And now animal and left to howl

A dog in Sweden, a man's best friend
Remember all those trends you set
And now you are a housewive's pet
Sit down bad boy, don't bow wow wow
Drink this milk from the sacred cow

Look at my bow wow sitting there
Sniffing scratching without a care
Once upon a lifetime peroxide hair
What a heavy load to bear

What no meat?
My bloodthirsty little bow wow
Hypnotised
Another family tree
Remember?

You may have been a king
You may have been a queen

Still segregating 'cause we insects are too proud.

A sign goes up to say hey we're twin towned.
The dough is rising but no bread will be baked.
The fur is genuine but the orgasm's faked.
We're spending millions to learn to speak porpoise,
When human loneliness is still a deafening noise.

Accompanied by truncheons keeping time on human skulls.

These weeds of fear,
Are choking our conviction,
Life's like a jig-saw,
You get the straight bits,
But there's something missing in the middle.

All of a sudden,
We find the cupboard's bare.
All of a sudden,
We find heaven's not there.
All of a sudden,
We find the sun's gone cold.
All of a sudden
We find we're more than old.
All of a sudden,
We find that we've lost love,
So please don't push or shove because,
It's too late,
It's too late,
In all your hurry you've accidentally locked the gate

What can we do?
Trying to stem the flow of sand is useless.
It's up to you start holding hands,
And watch the balance redress,
Life's like a firework,
You're only lit once,
And you must stand and radiate correctly.

All of a sudden,
We find the cupboard's bare.

It's more a way you have to give.

And they're not the salted kind

He cures mutes and alcoholics

To conjure a new world
While this one is slowly washed away

Dancing out there through my window
To the backdrop of a slow descending grey

When it rains it rains
All the colors in my paintbox

Pour ourselves a glass of stout
And let our Rael Brook shirts hang out
Nothing makes us more content
To let us wallow in a bit of nonsense

We're all so frivolous tonight, tonight

Let's reveal our childlike nature
And leave our stocks and invoices to rot
Let's go to pot

Tell our jokes about mothers in law
But watch him jump when she comes through the door
Oh the party goes with a swing
When we talk about the trivial things

We're all so frivolous tonight

But there's always one
Who wants to talk shop
We'll drive him through the door
With a broom or a mop

Let us tell our favourite story
About some poor chap who put it on display
Hip hooray
And let the girls gather in their slacks
To talk about husbands hairy backs

Some might think we're a bit of a shower
But this could be our finest hour

We're all so frivolous tonight, tonight
We're all so ridiculous tonight."

Gulping in your opium so copiously from a disco
Everything you eat is waste
But swallowing is easy when it has no taste

They can fix you rabbits up
With your musical feed
They can fix you rabbits up
Big money selling you stuff that you do not need

Funk pop a roll for fish in shoals
Music by the yard for the children they keep
Like poseable dolls
The young to them are mistakes
Who only want bread but they're force-fed cake

Funk pop a roll the only goal
The music business is a hammer to keep
You pegs in your holes
But please don't listen to me
I've already been poisoned by this industry!

All I could get me was here,
Stuck in the dirt ankle deep, riches crashing in our atmosphere
No parachute hangs near

And I don't want to find myself this way again
I don't want to pick the thorny rose
I don't want to let love spoil the day again
But it may again, who knows
I don't wanna be here

All I could get me was found
Gretel skips home and I rode on my hands and knees upon the ground
Our candy house melts down

I don't want to pick the thorny rose
I don't want to let love spoil the day again

All I could get me was low

I remember many things, but
Most of all, I remember the sun
Squinting at the sun through eyes
Screwed up by a fireball
Tarmac on the road is soft
Chaff burns in a smokewall
Yes, I weeping, a teardrop attack
I give emotion at the drop of a hat
When I remember days at school

Fuelled our bodies, kindled fire in our minds
Burning scars soon disappear
Like heat that hangs like water on the road
But most of all, I remember the sun."

All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts

There may be no golden fleece,

I was in a land where men force women to hide their facial features,
And here in the west it's just the same but they're using make-up veils.
I've seen acts of every shade of terrible crime from man-like creatures,
And I've had the breath of liars blowing me off course in my sails.

While war is polishing his drum and peace plays second fiddle

Russia and America are at each other's throats
But don't you cry
Just on your knees and pray, and while you're
Down there, kiss your arse goodbye

We're the bulldog on the fence
While others play their tennis overhead
It's hardly love all and somebody might
Wind up red or dead
Pour some oil on the water quick
It doesn't really matter where from
He love me, he loves me not
He's pulling fins from an atom bomb

This phenomenon happens every 20 years or so
If they're not careful your watch won't be the
Only thing with a radioactive glow
I'll stick my fingers in my ears
And hope they make it up before too late
If we get through this lot alright
They're due for replay, 1998"

Gives us sleepyheads, sleepyheads,
The road ahead it takes us to our bed,
Sleepyheads, sleepyheads,
Our minds they race but our bodies are dead.

Just like looking for footprints
Looking for footprints

The lights are twisted,
Each one is misted,
To far and counting,
Head nod in twenty.

Many sleepless nights will follow
Some may lose but some succeed

What they want is...
Love at first sight

Make a play of lust intention
Only just one thing in mind
Make a slip could be forever
Wedding bells, the shotgun kind

Love at first sight
What they want is...
Love at first sight

Mouse takes the bait
So soon as he leaves his seat
There's no escape, very soon their eyes will meet

Love at first sight [etc.]

Take your partner to surrender
Then your misdemeanour's done
Sacrifice of maidenhood
But little boys must have their fun

Love at first sight."

Shilling for the fellow who milks the herd
Shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping
How can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?

Deep under winter snow
Deep lay the lambs
And tonight by the full moon's glow
Flask of wine on my feather bedding
We will drink and prepare for wedding
Soon my darling, soon my darling

People think that I'm no good
Painting pictures carving wood
Be a rich man if I could
But the only job I do well is here on the farm
On the farm
And it's breaking my back

We will borrow your father's carriage
We will drink and prepare for marriage
Soon my darling, soon my darling

All I could think of was what a lovely way for me to go
I never really realised that

Just like the struggling summer flies that
I was drowning no matter how sweet or how slow

Have I been such a fool
Have I been sitting on your stool
While you cracked the whip
While you cracked the whip

I danced imprisoned in your drumbeat
Your tune of spring had me whirling like a mad march
Merry hare
It never really came to mind that

The strings of your instrument were strangling me
Inside their snare

Have I been such a fool
Have I been sitting on your stool
While you held the hoop
While you held the hoop

Now that I'm out and I'm shouting in doorways
Freed from a love more like murder
I should be singing but in liberation
Feel like a ship with no rudder

Have I been such a fool"

Melt the guns,

Children will want them,
Mothers supply them,
As long as your killers are heroes.

Will fiddle while Rome burns,
Acting like modern-time Neros.

The you S of A,
Hey you,
Yes you in particular!
When it comes to the judgement day and you're standing at the gates with your weaponry,
You dead go down on one knee,
Clasp your hands in prayer and start quoting me,
Cause we say...
Our father we've managed to contain the epidemic in one place, now,
Let's hope they shoot themselves instead of others,
Help to civilize the race now.
We've trapped the cause of the plague,
In the land of the free and the home of the brave.
If we listen quietly we can hear them shooting from grave to grave.

And never more to fire them.

From lines across their hands
A song as new as new moon
As old as all the sands
Shrank to stagnant from Atlantic wild
Lost that child 'til mermaid

Summoned by drum rolling surf
As laughing fish compel
The young boy woken in me
By clanging diving bell
Breakers pillow fight the shore

Waving with comb in hand

You're writing your diary in innocents' blood
You're vain and you're ugly, you're no Robin Hood
You don't steal from the rich to help the poor
You just take life from both and what is more
You break your bread and drink
But post-confession you'll still stink of
Terrorism

Terrorism
But you're Sikh, Jew, Muslim and Christian, you say
Now which religion will you wear today?
And in whose Bible do you find your cause
That says bomb children in department stores?
I hope your god is pleased
To see all creation on their knees for
Terrorism

Terrorism
Angel of death with black woolen mask
Freedom they bring you is a long wooden cask
They never doubt that right is on their side
When right is rifle-shaped where can you hide?

Where I questioned the fishes all about it

Carried me through your hair
Up from suffocate seaweed
The perfumed cushions cascading

Pushed me into your skin

Giddy with planets parading
I swam down to the bottom of the sky

Spreading wisdom and cash around
Fed the starving and housed the poor
Showed the vatican what gold's for
But he made too many enemies
Of the people who would keep us on our knees
Hooray for Peter Pumpkin
Who'll pray for Peter Pumpkinhead?
Oh my!
Peter Pumpkinhead pulled them all
Emptied churches and shopping malls
Where he spoke, it would raise the roof
Peter Pumpkinhead told the truth
But he made too many enemies...
Peter Pumpkinhead put to shame
Governments who would slur his name
Plots and s** scandals failed outright
Peter merely said
Any kind of love is alright
But he made too many enemies...
Peter Pumpkinhead was too good
Had him nailed to a chunk of wood
He died grinning on live tv
Hanging there he looked a lot like you
And an awful lot like me!
But he made too many enemies...

Ihr manipuliert und stellt hier die Weichen um uns zu beklauen und euch selbst zu bereichern
Wenig sehen diese Krise hier klar und das obwohl eigentlich schon viels geschah
Das eindeutig beweist das ihr Leute bescheißt und das Motiv nie Liebe war
Ihr verfolgt all eure Ziele brutal denn es geht um Profit und das ""wie"" ist egal
Füare viele bedeutet es'ne riesen Gefahr wenn man nicht ma'mehr weiß wie man Miete bezahlt
Wir lassen uns wirklich ne'Menge gefallen und probieren den Gürtel immer enger zu schnellen
Und auch wenn wir fast schon ersticken lassen wir uns immer noch von diesen Pennern belallen
Die finden an ihren Lügen gefallen denn diewahrheit kommt bei ihnen grundsätzlich zu kurz
Doch sie werden entlarvt und was sie danach erwartet ist ein babarischer hässlicher Sturz

Xavier Naidoo,Abschied Nehmen,/x/xavier+naidoo/abschied+nehmen_20151791.html,"Und Gestern drang die Nachricht dann zu mir
Ich weiss nicht, aber es zerriss mich schier
Denn keiner kann mir sagen wie es geschah
Keiner unsrer Leute war noch da
Du lagst ganz gut, das hat man mir gesagt
Warum hab ich dich nie selbst danach gefragt
Du httest ein Grosser werden knnen
Und irgendwie wolte ich dir das nicht gnnen

Refrain:

Und ich wollte noch Abschied nehmen
Das werd ich mir nie vergeben
Mann, wie konntest du von uns gehen
Jetzt soll ich dich nie mehr sehen

Verzeih mir all die Dinge, die ich sagte
Nur weil mich wieder irgendetwas plagte
Verzeih mir und den Jungs, dass wir nicht da waren
Vergib mir, dass ich nicht mit all dem klar kam

Refrain 2x

Was machen wir jetzt ohne unsern Held
Wir vermissen dich und ich scheiss aufs grosse Geld
Du bist weg, was ntzt der ganze mist
Mein kleiner Bruder wird fr immer vermisst"

Aus ihrem Haus
Und sieh was du getan hast, wie viele
Jahre du sie geschlagen hast
Wre es nicht gerecht, wenn du jetzt
Ihre Last zu tragen hast
Und wenn du Fragen hast
Vielleicht werden sie lange
Schmerzenleiden
Vieles war und ist nicht zu vermeiden

Ist und war

Wir warten auf wahre Begebenheiten

Xavier Naidoo,Autonarr,/x/xavier+naidoo/autonarr_21224601.html,"Erst im Auto konnte ich laut Musik hören. 
Denn im Mietshaus konnte ich damit niemand stören.
Plus, mein Vater war ein Schichtarbeiter. 
Also war ich zuhaus grundsätzlich leise.

Und darum bin ich so ein ausgewachsener Autonarr, 
Weil ich so auffällig gerne Auto fahr'
Weil ich unheimlich gerne was erfahr' 
Und meinen Gedanken häng ich im Auto nach.

Meistens fahr ich im Jahr 250.000 Kilometer 
Aufgeteilt in ein goldenes Punktesystem.
Es gab Jahre, da konnte man meine Punkte vom Weltall aus funkeln sehn.
Diese Punkte entstehn' wie ein schwarzes Loch 
Doch ich entkam dem Sog der schwarzen
Löcher gerade noch denn ich fahr' gern Bus, wenn ich muss.

Und darum bin ich so ein ausgewachsener Autonarr, 
Weil ich so auffällig gerne Auto fahr,
Weil ich so unheimlich gerne was erfahr 
Meinen Gedanken häng ich im Auto nach.

Das mit dem Auto ist für mich spirituell 
In dir drin führst du ein leises Gespräch und
Draußen bläst der Wind laut und schnell. 
Im Auto fühle ich mich verbunden mit anderen Menschen.
Ich nenne uns gerne die „InCarNation“
An einem weit entfernten Tag beamt dich das Ding mit dem Faradayschen Käfig

Und darum bin ich so ein ausgewachsener Autonarr, 
Weil ich so auffällig gerne Auto fahr'
Weil ich so unheimlich gerne was erfahr' 
Meinen Gedanken häng ich im Auto nach.

Baby, bevor du gehst
Ich werde es erst glauben knnen, wenn
Du nicht mehr vor mir stehst
Jetzt ist es wohl soweit, du wirst nie
Mehr wiederkehren
Glaub mir, es tut sehr vielen leid
Alldenen die dich so verehren
Deine Ketten sind verschweit, keiner
Wird dich wiedersehen
Jetzt wo du fr immer verreist, werd
Ich noch mal zu dir gehen
Damit musstest du rechnen, nicht nur
Ich hab es geahnt
Denn du hast nicht den deinen Taten
Entsprechenden Weg fr dich gebahnt
Wie doch alle an dich glaubten, alle
Strmten zu dir
Die, die so viele beraubten, teilten mit
Dir ihre Gier
Herr, lass mich auch mit denen streiten
Die ihr ewigen Ruhm prophezeiten, denn
Sie logen und phantasierten, fr die, die
Mit ihr die Welt regieren
Jetzt steht bald keiner mehr fr
Dich ein
Du bist Tag und Nacht allein
Es kann nur noch wenig, sehr
Wenig Leben in dir sein
Die Verkufer und die Kufer deiner
Waren, sieh sie dir an
Denn jetzt fliehen sie I'm Scharen
Sie sind ihres klaren Verstandes
Beraubt
Denn sie hatten mit der Sicherheit
Des Todes so fest an dich geglaubt"
Xavier Naidoo,Bist Du Am Leben Interessiert Ft. Tone,/x/xavier+naidoo/bist+du+am+leben+interessiert+ft+tone_20651027.html,"Höare nicht auf, füare das zu leben an was du glaubst,
Glaub an dich und schöpfe Vertrauen und Kraft aus deiner Familie,
Die Nacht füare Nacht deine Seele bewacht und dich liebt,
Ganz egal was du tust, was geschieht, die dich wie eine Hülle umgibt,
Wenn du dieses Glück hast hast du fast gesiegt, fast gesiegt
Manches Leben läuft schnell, es ist nicht immer hell,
Es ist schwer was zu sehn und I'm Dunkeln zu gehn,
Doch sei dir bewusst: deine Vorfahren hatten schwerste Wege
Und wenn dein Herz noch füare sie schlägt dann weisst du genau,
Dass ihr Blut durch dich fliesst, es macht dich sogar schlau durch
Talente die du kriegst, die sich dein Clan vielleicht vor 300 Jahren
Durch schwere Arbeit hart erwarb,
Auf was du jetzt zurückgreifen kannst,
Zurück in der Zeit, back in time
Du verfügst über Wissen von mehr als 10. 000 Jahren
Frag deine Ahnen, deine Vorfahren
Sie heissen Vorfahren obwohl du vor fährst
Sie können nur ahnen wo du sie hinfährst
Hast du den Plan oder bist du verkehrt?
Dann kehre in dich, lass dich gehn,
Du musst deine Seele von innen sehen.
Du musst die Familiengruft bei Tag begehen,
Obwohl du nicht tot bist frag ich dich
Bist du am Leben, bist du am Leben, bist du am Leben, bist du am Leben, bist du am leben
Bist du am Leben interessiert? Hast du dieses Wunder schon kapiert?
Kannst du die alten Lieder singen, die tief in deiner Seele klingen,
Bist du am Leben interessiert? Hast du dieses Wunder schon kapiert?
Kannst du die alten Lieder singen, die tief in deiner Seele klingen?
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!
Das ganze Volk soll sie singen.
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!

Wenn eins deine Sinne verwischt, weil der wärmste und hellste Stern am Himmel erlischt
Du den Mut und all die Zuversicht verlierst
Und spürst, dass irgendwas in dir zerbricht
Dann höare auf die Stimme die spricht,
Hinder sie nicht, denn sie weiss wie sie geht
Und zeigt dir den Weg zurück nach Haus du kennst ihn auch
Erinnere dich an das was du längst weisst, und was eigentlich keine Frage ist
Du bist nicht schwach, du weisst wie stark du bist
Also ruf das wach, was eingeschlafen ist
Das Leben ist schwer zu durchschauen und fühlt sich unreal an, so als wäre es ein Traum
Und man weiss nicht wirklich, wer Freund oder Feind ist und es fällt schwer zu vertrauen
Aber mach dir bewusst, dass du all diesem Frust vielleicht noch sehr lang standhalten musst
Du brauchst ein starkes Herz, aber kein Hartes, sonst wird es kalt in der Brust
Eins haben Feiglinge nie erkannt: Man kann wachsen am steigenden Widerstand
Also sei wie ein Krieger, Mann, nimm wieder am Leben teil und peil deine Ziele an
Denn auch wenn deine Umstände widrig sind kannst du Pläne zu schmieden beginnen
Egal wie gross die Risiken sind, all dein Einsatz wird sich lohnen, denn es gibt viel zu gewinnen
Du spürst das tief in dir drin, wenn die Melodien dieser Lieder erklingen,
Deine Seele umarmen und die Tränen der Wahrheit zu fliessen beginnen siehst du den Sinn

Ob alt oder jung, ob blind ob stumm, die ohne Zeit oder die mit Geduld
Sieh dich an, schau dich um, auch du bist ein Mensch aus Fleisch und Blut
Aber auch wie das Küken aus der frischen Brut, spürt ihr wie der Krieg uns nicht gut tut
Eine ganze Generation schöpft Mut, die ganze Generation einer Nation
Setzt sich den Frieden wie auf einen Thron, die ihr den Krieg liebt, was wisst ihr schon?
Ihr liebt eure Kinder nicht wie Tochter und Sohn, Liebt eure Kinder wie Korn, Rind und Huhn
Ich sag dir Liebe hat damit nichts zu tun, wer den Krieg liebt erntet von mir Hohn
Lautes Gelächter und lauteres Drohen, in Form von Liedern, die Herzen durchbohren
Mögen die in der Hölle schmoren, die Selbstmordattentäter auserkoren
Um ihre Drecksarbeit zu tun, mögen sie nie in Frieden ruhen.

Bist du am Leben interessiert? Hast du dieses Wunder schon kapiert?
Kannst du die alten Lieder singen, die tief in deiner Seele klingen
Bist du am Leben interessiert? Hast du dieses Wunder schon kapiert?
Kannst du die alten Lieder singen, die tief in deiner Seele klingen
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!
Das ganze Volk soll sie singen.
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!
Das ganze Volk soll sie singen!
Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbringen!"

Deep down inside it's true
I keep wondering what went wrong
'Cause in my heart you belong and I am

Crying, hurting inside over you
I am crying alone and blue
Don't you know that I am dying
To be with you instead of crying

Oh, all the yesterdays we shared
Are in the past like you've never cared
Now that time has passed us by
Thoughts of you make me wonder why
Oh, and...

Since you've been gone no one
Can take your place
Next and all alone my heart's
An empty space
I long for that day you'll come
Back to me
Oh, God I pray that you will, till then I am
Crying, oh"
Xavier Naidoo,Danke,/x/xavier+naidoo/danke_21224625.html,"Uns bleibt nichts zu tun, außer danke zu sagen
Denn ihr habt Großes geleistet in diesen Tagen
Und die Zweifler verstummten nach wenigen Stunden
Ihr habt euch hochgeboxt denn ihr ward ganz unten
Und wer so kämpft wie ihr, darf auch mal verlieren
Die Menschen lieben euch, das wird euch motivieren
Und mit 'nem bisschen Abstand, sieht ihr was ihr geleistet habt
Ihr hieltet das ganze Land emotional auf Trab
Der 4. Juli dieses Jahres war kein schlechter Tag
Der 4. Juli war nur einfach nicht euer bester Tag
Mann, ihr habt Argentinien geschlagen nach 'nem langen Spiel
Neues Spiel neues Glück denn dieses Leben bietet viel
Ihr habt uns soviel geboten eure Namen sollen klingen
Lasst uns ein Lied für euch schreiben und eure Namen singen

Wir salutieren vor Kapitän Michael Ballack
Du hast trotz deiner Schmerzen krass geballert
Hast hart gekämpft den Elfer reingeschossen
Als ich deine Tränen sah sind auch meine geflossen

Der nächste deutsche Held heißt Torsten Frings.
Spielt Mittelfeld und man weiß er bringt's.
Er war auserwählt, wurde ausgezählt.
Mann, wir waren geschockt, Torsten du hast gefehlt

Dann der famose Miro Klose, immer gut für ein schnelles Tor
Wirbelt auf wie die ?
So was wie du kommt zu selten vor

Vorname Lukas, Spitzname Poldi
Glaub mir Lukas wir hatten voll die geile Zeit dir zuzusehen
Kämpfe tapfer, gib uns die Chance weiter auf deine Tore durchzudrehen.
Es ist schade, Jens Lehmann, dass man dich Zuhause nur selten sehen kann
Hast uns nicht enttäuscht, aber zittern lassen
Wir waren beunruhigt, du gelassen
In deiner Ruhe lag echt die Kraft
Du hast dein Tor zu unseren Herzen aufgemacht

Vor dem blauen Auge war schon der verletzte Arm
Doch das erste Tor Deutschlands schoss Philipp Lahm
Doch spielen zu sehen war ne’ Offenbarung
Philipp nie vergessen wir deinen Namen

Hier kommt die Bastion Schweinsteiger
Selbst wenn er fällt spielt er den Ball weiter
Wer soll dich stoppen jetzt geht’s erst los
Übernimm das Spiel und stell den Gegner bloß

And we can't forget Per Mertesacker
Du machtest manchen Stürmer zum Kofferpacker
Hast den Job erledigt und dich so verewigt
Manch' ein Gegner denkt bestimmt, he is a motherf

Christoph Metzelder war Feuermelder
Und Feuerlöscher der Spielfelder
Der Gegner kommt, den Gegner stellt er
Stürmer sind für ihn wie Bäume und Bäume fällt er

Auch Sebastian Kehl wurde ausgewählt
Und war in kürzester Zeit vom Kampf beseelt
Er hat sein Bestes gegeben und machte sein Ding
Und auch seinen Namen werden wir in Zukunft singen

Wir haben uns so gewünscht, dass Bernd Schneider
Dieses eine Tor macht doch es wurde nichts leider
Aber Kopf hoch Bernd wir haben dich mehr als gern
Als du spieltest flogen Funken du bist ein Pfundskerl

Und Arne Friedrich war uns erst zu friedlich
Dann war er wie neugeboren und schließlich
Sah man die Tür vorm Tor, sie schließt sich
Arne Friedrich, Deutschland liebt dich

Ey yo David Odonkor rennt blitzschnell zum Tor vor
Spiel deinen Pass und bereit noch so ’n Tor vor
Es hieß, wer ist dieser David, er ist unbekannt
Jetzt wär' das ganze Land gern mit dir verwandt

Du bist 'ne deutsche Bank, Tim Borowski
Die Gegner wollen siegen, doch du schockst sie
Wir wollen dich spielen sehen und noch oft mit dir siegen
Wenn die Pumpe fast stillsteht, kommst du und dann pocht sie.

Und auch Robert Huth machte sich gut
Und tat was ein guter Mann auf dem Spielfeld tut
Er brachte sich ein und man sah seinen Mut
Danach wieder auf die Bank, Robert ich zieh meinen Hut

Mike Hanke auch dir gebührt Dank
Ein Stürmer hat kein leichtes Leben auf der Bank
Ich hab auch ein Trikot und zwar die Nummer 9
Und das nächste Mal wirst du uns mit deinen Toren erfreuen

Die Zukunft gehört auch Marcell Jansen
Ich seh' schon die Stürmer bei dir antanzen
Raub ihnen die Chancen und den Mut
Und tu’ was ein Mann in unserer Abwehr tut

Und waren Stürmer vor Jens Nowotny gestanden
Der Jens, der stoppt sie und weist sie in die Schranken
Ich möchte mich bei dir für den Bereitschaftsdienst bedanken
Du hast für's Spiel gebrannt und ins Ziel geflankt

Und auch Thomas Hitzlsperger, war oft befreit vom Spielfeldärger
Doch auch dir gebührt Dank an den Spielfeldrand
Hätte das Mittelfeld gewankt hätten wir dich getankt
Und dann hättest du trotz Rückstand zum Tor geflankt

Es grenzt fast schon an Wahn, dass wir Oliver Kahn
Nicht im Tor, sondern am Spielfeldrand sahen
Doch dank dir Olli Du bist wirklich ein Meister
Und hast unendlich viel für Land und Mannschaft getan

Timo Hildebrandt saß nur am Spielfeldrand
Doch halt dich bereit bald kommt deine Zeit
Wo dieses Land nach dem Elfmeterschiessen deinen Namen schreit

Oliver Neuville unser Trumpf fürs Spiel
Hat ein wichtiges Tor zur rechten Zeit erzielt
Elfer versenkt, was für'n Geschenk
Klar, dass man für ewig an dich denkt

Ich danke dir herzlichst DJ Asamoah
Wegen dir kamen meine Songs in der Kabine vor
DJ und Stürmer we want more
Gerald Asamoah schieß' dein nächstes Tor

Und Dank Jürgen Klinsmann’s großer Vision
Träumten wir dann doch vom Sieg und hatten ihn schon
Erheben dich auf’s Neue, auf den Fußballthron
Geh jetzt bitte nicht, wir verdoppeln deinen Lohn
Ihr seid Träger der Würden Andy, Olli, Jogi, Jürgen
Wir würden euch und euren Helfer gern noch einiges aufbürden
Also bleibt uns erhalten die EM steht vor der Tür
Denn schließlich habt ihr uns gerade fast zum Sieg geführt
Vielen Dank dafür, es hat uns tief berührt,
Ich dank' dem Herrn für Euch alle, Ehre wem Ehre gebührt"

Xavier Naidoo,Der Geist Ist Willig,/x/xavier+naidoo/der+geist+ist+willig_20650417.html,"Der Geist ist willig - aber das Fleisch ist schwach
Ich werde alles tun damit ich es gefügig mach

Refrain
Der Geist ist willig - aber das Fleisch ist schwach
Ich werde alles tun damit ich es gefügig mach
Ich halt mich tagelang wach um in der Bibel zu lesen
Wenn ich mein Heil gefunden hab dann hab ich Zeit zum genesen

Verwesen will ich nicht nicht sterben hab gnade mit mir Gott
Erhalt mich meinen Erben denn die Toten können nicht füare dich werben
Nich jetzt und nich hier lieber leid ich alle Qualen
Denn es zehrt mich nach dir ich bin dir treu ergeben
Wer will seine Stimme gegen mich heben
Wer geht ins Gericht mit mir
Gott entreiss mich meinen Feinden denn es zieht mich zu dir

Refrain 2x

Dein Weg ist mein Weg,
Deswegen lass nich zu dass sie siegen
Ich will am Ende vor dir stehen und nich am Ende vor dir liegen
Schwiegen auch alle, ich nahm es ernsthaft wahr,
Das ganz in meiner Nähe mein Schöpfer lag,
Der mir zu Leibe rückte,
Dessen Hand schwer auf mich drückte,
Mich verrückte und so wurde ich verrückt
Es ging näher zu ihm, da brannte mein Fleisch
Und ich wollte fliehen, doch wie konnt ich fliehn
Ich musste knien,
Er prüfte meine Nieren und mein Herz,
Schnitt mich tief in meiner Seele mit einem Messer aus Erz
Schmerz drang tief in mich ein
Und ich selbst wollte mich dem Untergang weihen
Angesichts der Wahrheit mir nichts mehr verzeihn
Doch er riss mich aus dem Reich der Toten
Er entriss mich meinen roten Blutlachen
Und den Fängen der Despoten
Und den Fängen der Despoten"

Und es greift auch noch an wenn du in Frieden schläfst
Und lässt dich sinnigerweise träumen das du Felder mähst
Es ist ein Sturm der bläst wenn der Herr erscheint
Es ist ein Tag dunkler Wolken an dem die Sonne nicht scheint

Solange habt ihr unser Leben wehement verneint

Und ihr werdet selbst dafüare sorgen das von euch nichts mehr existiert

Das dem Herrn nicht gefällt

Denn er ist König auf dem Zion, der mächtigsten Erhebung dieser Erde

Alle Branchenführer in Europa werden glanzvoll sterben,
Wie ein Held in der Oper. Ihr habt zu viel gewollt
Und jetzt kriegt ihr gar nichts sorry Telekom aber das war nichts
Trotz eures Hochsommers man sah nichts denn eure Satelliten
Wurden viel zu schwer und fallen einer nach dem andern ins Meer
Wer tut euch das an, der Herr selbst ist der gute Mann
Und am besten geht ihr geduckt denn jetzt wird Lava gespuckt
Bis jeder Leib am Boden liegt und zuckt
Jetzt guckt nicht so entgeistert
Es ist klar das er eure Kinderhürden spielend meistert
Er hat eure Firmen mit Steckbriefen zugekleistert,
Eure Arbeiter haben es gesehen
Man wird den Schneeball in den Hochöfen schmelzen sehn
Man wird vor Leichen in den Strassen auf Stelzen gehn
Doch der Herr lässt jetzt die schärfsten Winde wehn
Und seine tapfersten Krieger werden auferstehn
Der mächtigsten Erhebung dieser Erde auf das uns schwindlig werde

Ich so etwas krieg, aber jetzt

Taught to win

I've changed my face
I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be the last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up
Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

Duck dich im Leben nur dann, wenn sie scharf schießen
Ich mein' echte Patronen und nicht ihr lautes Niesen
Du bist viel stärker, als du vorgibst, ich kann's spüren
Du wärst imstande, Menschen so tief zu berühren
Sie aus ihrem Elend herauszuführen
Und wenn du hören würdest, was ich sage, sicher etwas spüren
Wie dring' ich zu dir vor? Ich brauch' deinen Rat
Bring' einen gebrochnen Mensch zurück an den Start seines Lebens

Disturbing this endless flow

Niemand, der mich qult
Niemand, der mich zerdrckt
Niemand, der mich benutzt, wann er will
Niemand, der mit mir redet nur aus plichtgefhl
Der nur seine eitelkeit an mir stillt
Niemand, der nie da ist
Wenn man ihn am ntigsten hat
Wenn man nach luft schnappt, auf dem trocknen schwimmt
La mich los, la mich in ruh
Damit das ein ende nimmt
Gib mir mein herz zurck
Du brauchst meine liebe nicht
Gib mir mein herz zurck
Bevor es auseinander bricht
Je eher, je eher du gehst
Um so leichter wird's fr mich
Fhl' mich leer und verbraucht
Alles tut weh
Flugzeuge in meinem bauch
Kann nichts mehr essen
Ich kann dich nicht vergessen
Aber auch das gelingt mir noch
Gib mir mein herz zurck
Du brauchst meine liebe nicht
Gib mir mein herz zurck
Bevor es auseinander bricht
Je eher, je eher du gehst
Um so leichter wird's fr mich"

Until you came and walked my way
I just don't know what to do
Need to have a different view

Tell me about who you think I am
Have I been that type of man
That talks things you don't understand

Now I know I've been too good
That's what you never understood
I hope some day you'll understand
The helping touch of a loving hand

Don't say good-bye
Don't say good-bye
Let me take you away
And then we'll fly

I really started hating you
'Cause you did what you wanted to
I just want to break apart
Have I had an artificial heart?

They tell me that you'll take my heart
If one day I just let you start
But broken hearts are not for me
Especially when it's mine you see

You hurt me, hurt me, make me cry
When I found out that you can lie
You close the door and away the key
Closed doors won't let you hear my please"

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor falls, the major lifts
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
Its a cold and its a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the Name in vain
I don't even know the Name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, but it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah"

Doch du willst deine Trauer nicht erwähnen
Du willst stark sein, du musst fühlen
(Can you hear it coming, can you hear it coming? Come on)
Du darfst jetzt nicht stehen bleiben, komm schon
Du musst auch den Rest des Weges gehen
Fast alle, die wir kennen, sind I'm Scheideweg
Und sehen sich kurz vor dem Abgrund stehen

Mit gebrochenen Herzen
Mit dem Pfeil in der Brust (mit dem Pfeil in der Brust)

Wenn wir für einander einstehen
Dann könn' die bösen Geister heim gehen
(Halte durch, halte durch, halte durch)

[Strophe 2]
Was nützen uns die Durchhalteparolen
Wenn wir geistig verkümmern und verrohen?
Durch zig tausende innere Katastrophen
Ich find' niemals die passenden Strophen
Wie traurig muss euer Lied sein?
Man müsste viel schreien
Das Leid passt nie rein
Kein Lied kann so tief sein

Vielleicht find' ich eine Melodie für die
Mit gebrochenen Herzen
Mit dem Pfeil in der Brust (mit dem Pfeil in der Brust)

Für die, die nicht wissen, wo sie hin sollen
In deren Becher randvoll Gift soll
Die man da hin rafft, da hin mordet, hin foltert
Ich glaub nicht, dass unser Schöpfer das gewollte
Wie traurig muss euer Lied sein?
Man müsste viel schreien
Alles Leid passt da nie rein
Kein Lied kann so tief sein

Von der Wiege in den Sarg

I'd be waiting- waiting for a lifetime and more
If that serious alliance lies ahead
Let every necessary word be said
Remembering the blood that we've shed
Keep it mind that there are things we must forget
Beware of tragedy left right and center
Don't allow hell on earth to enter
Get rid off all the damage in your head
Remember there's an enemy in your bed
The jokes on me for sure
But then wishes and hopes come true for sure
It's you for sure, out of the blue for sure
It's you for your past rich and poor towards
That hard encore
I've walked on the african sands like the kosan
The original man from lands sacred
Battled zulu tribes for the passion of word play and swam
The zambezi butt naked
Seen the sun rise in the east and set in the west
Plotted stars charts and directions for god to manifest
From the peaks of the pyramids I left tags in dark gaves
That gave humanity clues on how to star gaze
I've seen a snake she'd it's skin like the seasons and change
I've seen world rearange in a flash
Now for this cash they rape our lands strictly for wealth
It's left me stranded in a spiritual realm all by myself
Headed to mecca I stopped and spoke swahm with tribes
Chanted native dialects over the hill I felt vibes
Threw my hands in the sky then beat them hard on a
Drum over the horizon I waited for freedom to come
But the ships just keep sailing and whips just keep cracking
I wonder where I am so I begin back tracking through the
Solomonic dynasty I read the kebra tr took mt swift
Across the mains like I was riding on a zebra the ashante
Draped me in robes or royalty the shona tribe blessed me-acapo"

When he get struck by the arrow of Cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman
And sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

There is more to love than this
Love is more than just a kiss
Will we take it to that step?
Will we do more than just connect?
And will you bring the thunder in my life?
And the fire in my eyes?
'Cause then there, will be days of pleasure where
Everything far will be so near

And lighting (lightning) like this
I have never been struck by (struck by)

There days I can't stop saying your name
And I am looking for ways never to part from you, have

From your hair follicle to your finger nail cuticle
Struck by the arrow of Cupid, this love is deep rooted
Like someone took my heart, sampled it and looped it

I'll slay a thousand dragons to save my little princess
A walking gift from God, you are my shining star
The diamonds and gold that most men be mining for

In every man's life, there comes a time
When you got struck by the arrow of cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty by a woman
Yes, sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

Xavier:
There is more to love like this
Love is more then just a kiss
Will we take you to that step
Will we do more than just connect
And will you, bring the thunder in my life
And the fire in my eyes
Cause then there, will be days of pleasure and
Everything far will be so near

Hook: Xavier
I have never felt thunder (thunder)
And lightning (lightning) like this
I have never been strucked by (strucked by)
A wonder (a wonder) like this

Xavier:
Ich k? Nnte tagelang nur von dir erz? Hlen
Ohne deinen Namen auch nur einmal zu erw? Hnen
Unter Schmerzen oder unter Tr? Nen
W? Rde dein Name als meine Linderung dienen
Jede deiner Bewegungen ist erstrebenswert und
Jede Stunde mit dir ist so lebenswert

Nichts ist vergleichbar mit dem was du gibst
Mit dem was du zeigst, wie du lebst und wie du liebst

Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts
Das so sch? N ist wie du

Sch? Ne Tage mit dir sind kostbar
So kostbar wie der Weg zum Morgenstern
Ich zelebriere sie wie einen Festtag
An dem ich immer wieder neues von dir lern

I'm Moment ist das sch? Nste dich zu kennen
Dich zu kennen ist wohl das Beste das ich hab
Verzeih mir aber dieses sag ich nochmal:
Deinen Namen zu nennen ist wohl das Sch? Nste was ich sag!

Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts
Das so sch? N ist wie du

Ich kenne nichts, ich kenne nichts

Ein Fremdling allen Freuden
Leb' ich fortan dem Leiden
Und du? Und du?
Vielleicht auf ewig vergisst Luisa mich
Vielleicht auf ewig vergisst sie mich

Mir fehlen die Worte zu beschreiben, was ich hör und was ich seh'
Es ist unglaublich, ich begreif' nicht, was ich hör und was ich seh'
Ich übertreib nicht, ich beschreib' nur schlecht
Mir fehlen die Worte
Echt, ich will es nur versuchen, dieses an dein Ohr zu rufen
Ich warte bis du kommst
Ich werde warten bis du kommst

Raum und Zeit sind aufgebrochen
Jede Richtung können sie nehmen und du kannst mit ihnen sprechen
Ich werde sie verstehen
Ich werd' mich dorthin begeben
Wo sie gerne von dir reden
Ich werd' dein Rufen hören und nichts wird mehr stören
Wir werden uns verbrüdern, wir werden uns verschwören
Ich warte bis du kommst
Ich werde warten bis du kommst
Eine ernstzunehmende Unsterblichkeit kommt auf uns zu
Und ich muss sie begreifen und greifen musst auch du
Ich komm nicht zur Ruh
Viele Geister beißen zu
Man verliert Herzblut
Das kann ich dir nicht wünschen
Ich wünsche dir Mut und hoff', es geht dir gut

Du würdest Augen machen, deine Ohren würden lachen
Du könntest dir alles anhören „Geigenspiel zum Schrei des Drachen“
Unzählige Klänge könntest du jetzt sogar selber machen
Musik ist jetzt beliebig geworden wie 1000 andere Sachen
Ein richtig neues Ding will und wird hier scheinbar keiner schaffen
Musikalisch gesehen entwickeln wir uns zu Menschenaffen
Ein richtig neues Ding will und wird hier scheinbar keiner schaffen
Du solltest wieder runterkommen und 'nen neuen Brand entfachen
Was soll ich sagen, du hast alles schon geschrieben
Deine Nachwelt ist dir eine adäquate Antwort schuldig geblieben
Du Wunderkind, sag uns, wo die Wunder sind
Vom Lärm umringt sind wir für die Wunder blind
Und gewillt blind zu bleiben
Doch deine Musik kann ein Weg daraus sein
Kann ein Weg daraus sein
Bild dir nichts ein, es sollte so sein, Herr Mozart

Ich werd' dein Rufen hören und nichts wird mehr stören
Wir werden uns verbrüdern, wir werden uns verschwören

But my peace comes from knowing I found you now
That´s deep
I don´t wants this moment to end
Let´s transcend to higher level
We´re god condemned, yeah
There is still hope and right now you will witness
Like the newspaper pictures
Better yet like the bible scriptures
The best part is knowing that he there with us
So deep it´s not too late, don´t cry
'Cause you know there is a plan

Let me stand by your side and be there to the end
What we have is something I will defend
Give me your hand
Hold tight, just trust
Even though it´s come to this we´ve got us

And let you Niggers stop me now
You tell it like it is
Better find out
Before your charms out
God bless success never forsake the soul
When I cut your neck
Leave a little peace of the skin so your head wont fall off
Refrain:
Ich stimm die Klagelieder an wie die Frauen auf gefallene Mnner
Du kannst Gift drauf nehmen, dass ich hier so einiges verndere
Und keiner kommt an mir vorbei
Ich dresch schon Kilometer weit vorher verbal auf ihn ein
So muss es sein, wenn du weit wie ich mein
Wer ist grer als mein Gott?
- Ich kenn keinen. Geh heim! (2x)
Und ich muss nicht mal fluchen um ber euch zu triumphieren
Und verwandle euch mit einem Lcheln zu wirbellose Tiere, denen
Ich auf regennasser Strae leider nicht ausweichen kann
Aber was geht mich das an?
Denn du bist selbst Schuld daran
Sag nicht ich htte dich nicht gewarnt
Ich habe ausschlielich mit der Hilfe des Herrn geplant
Jetzt wirst du entfernt, du fallender Stern
Denn du hast nichts dazugelernt
Nicht mal dein Schwert zu fhren
Deswegen bekommst du meine Klinge so schmerzhaft zu spren
Die Gebhren, alle meine Kampfknste
Wnsche, dass ich dich nicht ber dem Feuer dnste,
Den Schweinen zum Fra vorwerf,
Whrend ich die Klinge fr den nchsten schrf
Nerv auf Nerv reie ich entzwei
Denn ich bin mit Leib und Seele dabei
Aller guten Dinge waren doch drei
Ich habe darauf geachtet, dass ich dir zwlf mal so viel verzeih
Doch nun ist sie vorbei deine Schonzeit
Und von hier bis zum Ende deines Lebens ist es nicht so weit
Du knntest alleine laufen und es selbst tun
Oder ich rei dich per Totschlag aus deinen schei Schuhen
Entscheide dich, aber mach schnell
Denn ich hab keine Lust auf ein allzu langes Duell,
In dem ich keinen Gegner habe.
Mit der Hilfe des Herrn zerquetsche ich dich wie eine Kchenschabe
Blut klebt wie Honig an einer Wabe,
Whrend ich mich an den reinen Worten des Herrn labe.
Refrain (2x)
Und ein Hammer htte ich noch zu bieten
Aber vorher komm ich noch mal verbal auf alle kleine Nieten
Was keine Miete zahlt, muss raus
Sagt man doch, auch wenn ich den Spruch noch nicht gehrt hab,
Mir klingelt er noch I'm Ohr
Mein Name ist Mohr, Sarotti Mohr
Und ich geh halt gegen dich vor - jedes Mal wie I'm Chor
Ich hab Groes mit dir vor
Und mein Sprachrohr bringt harte Worte gegen dich
Du zappelst am Haken wie ein Fisch,
Den, obwohl ich kein Fisch ess, zum Essen zubereit,
Des einen Freud ist wohl des anderen Leid.

Deren Wesen mich müde macht wie eine Wiege.

Du, die mir nicht sagt, wenn sie wacht um meinet Willen.
Wie, wenn wir diese Pracht ohne zu stillen in uns ertrügen.

Du nur du,
Wirst immer wiedergeboren.(x2)

Sieh dir die Liebenden an,
Wenn erst das Bekennen begann,
Wie bald sie lügen.
Du machst mich allein,
Dich einzig kann ich vertauschen,
Alle Weile bist du es,
Dann wieder ist es das Rauschen,
Oder es ist ein Duft ohne Rest.
Ach! In den Armen habe ich sie alle verloren.

Du nur du,
Wirst immer wiedergeboren (Du nur),
Du nur du,
Wirst immer wiedergeboren (Du wirst immer wiedergeboren),
Du nur du,
Wirst immer wiedergeboren,
Wirst immer wiedergeboren,

Halt ich dich fest (immer wiedergeboren).

Du bist noch immer mehr als Gold wert
Klingst immer noch wie Liebe
Beständig mehr als ich je wollte
Strahlst nach wie vor wie Licht
Du bist noch immer mehr als Gold wert dauernde Perspektive
Gibst ständig mehr als ich je wollte
Ich glaub das ändert sich nicht"

I was told, that she would never love me,
But still I hoped the love I felt it could be trusted.
So my case soon came to justice.
I found out they had taken my rights long ago
And what they gave in return wasn't nearly so.
But how could I've known never was I shown,
Little had I grown inside I was torn.
But her life's my concern
I long have ignored the fact that I love you
But I can't anymore - oh my lady.

Chorus
Oh my lady, gone for a year,
She told me maybe once she could stay here with me,
Oh she's alive in my heart, in my mind, in my soul,
There's a glow in my heart in my mind, in my soul.
There's a glow, there's a glow, there's a glow,
There's a glow - there's a glow.

Where my lady are you now.
A love so sacred still not allowed - life is hard.
Sometimes, life can be dreadfull
And this life I guess is more than a handfull.
In this war, we can not use weapons.
And in this war we can only learn lessons.
They had taken unripe fruits from the tree
And I learned my lesson when they gave them to me,
More could I see, clouds under me.
I saw wars upon land I saw wars under sea.

Chorus
Oh my lady, gone for a year,
She told me maybe once she could stay here with me,
Oh she's alive in my heart, in my mind, in my soul,
There's a light in my heart in my mind, in my soul.
There's a glow, there's a glow, there's a glow -
There's a glow."

The life I lost

There is one way to redemption

My one way road to redemption
Everybody has the answer for their actions
I don't wanna remember how it all happened
I know I was a part of it

I know I was the start of it
Oh oh It's hard to remember all the pain I caused
I wanna put it into, the life I've lost
Where's my way out of this?
How long have I doubted this?

Oh oh There is one way to redemption
I'm on the runway - with my wings on
Is there someone, with these lights on?
My one way road to redemption

If you forgive me, maybe I could
I know you got to leave me, cause baby, I would
But this is hard to bet
There's only one way to get me from here to there

This event horizon, is slowly rising
These dark clouds hold my tears inside them,
Till they rain down on me,
To let forgiveness rain down on me

There is one way to redemption
I'm on the runway with my wings on
Is there someone with these lights on

My one way road to redemption?
Yeah

Forgive me for I need redemption"

In every man's life, there comes a time
When he get struck by the arrow of Cupid
By the love of God, or the beauty of a woman
And sometimes this love, brings thunder into your life
And it brings the storm, sing about it

There is more to love than this
Love is more than just a kiss
Will we take it to that step?
Will we do more than just connect?
And will you bring the thunder in my life?
And the fire in my eyes?
'Cause then there, will be days of pleasure where
Everything far will be so near

I have never felt thunder (thunder)
And lighting (lightning) like this
I have never been struck by (struck by)
A wonder (a wonder) like this

There are days where I can stop talking about you
There days I can't stop saying your name
And I am looking for ways never to part from you, have
Everything changed and you still stay the same

I've never seen, and there's never been
Anything, with the beauty of you

Yo, yo, yo
Aiyo, shorty, I've never met someone so beautiful
From your hair follicle to your finger nail cuticle
Struck by the arrow of Cupid, this love is deep rooted
Like someone took my heart, sampled it and looped it
To a song that's endless, passion brings the tempest
I'll slay a thousand dragons to save my little princess
A walking gift from God, you are my shining star
The diamonds and gold that most men be mining for

Days that we share are like treasures
A treasure like fire is to mankind
My hands will try to carry you to ever
But since I've seen you, you've bright heaven to my mind

I've never seen, and there's never been
Anything, with the beauty of you"

Aber es ist verheerend, ihr habt keinen Funken Anstand mehr

Deutschland ist ein Land mit Ehre
Ein Land mit Fehlern, sogar mit schweren
Und trotzdem muss ich jetzt aufbegehren
Ich habe Lust bekommen, mich euch gegen euch zu wehren

In der Schule wart ihr doch die Mauerblümchen
Die Streber, die Psychos, die Mamasöhnchen
Und dann geht's ab in die Politik
Klar, dass Ihr 'n Hass auf's Volk schiebt

Ihr habt den Karren tief in den Dreck gefahren
Und zur Strafe nenne ich jetzt eure Namen
Wenn euch irgendwas nicht passt
Soll euer Chauffeur euch nach Mannheim fahren

Ihr habt den Karren

Ich reize euch auf's Blut, nein, ich trinke euer Blut
Denn als Vampiranha mache ich mich echt gut
Und ihr wünscht mir den Tod wie euch das tägliche Brot
Doch unsere Fehde hat erst begonnen und ich bring euch in Not

Eure neuen Lakaien greifen zu alten Methoden
Wo sind die Springer der BILD-Zeitung, ihr habt so kleine ***
Was macht Angela Merkel bei Elfriede Springer?
Ich schwöre euch, die beiden Damen drehen Wahlkampfdinger

Du sagst, niemand hat diese Krise vorausgesehen
Wenn du das wirklich ernst meinst, musst du leider nach Hause gehen
Denn für was haben wir dich bezahlt, dass du uns nur getäuscht, deinen Beruf verfehlt

Ihr habt den Karren

Ihr habt den Karren

Schreiber kommt zurück und verkauft eure Ärsche mit gutem Recht
Er hat schließlich dafür bezahlt und, wie ich finde, gar nicht mal schlecht

Jetzt wollt ihr alles nach der Wahl verhandeln
Und erzählen ""Demokratie ist gerecht""
Alles nach der Wahl, weil ihr Schiss habt ohne Ende
Leisler Kiep, Kanther, Kohl, alles korrupte Hände

Die BASF wollte ihre Leuna wieder
Uns verkaufte man die Wende als  „Das Volk ist Sieger""
Söhne allesamt, und Rassisten
Ich flehe euch an, bitte setzt mich hoch auf Todeslisten
Liebt Fräulein Koch den Dalai Lama wegen den alten Faschisten
Was ist'n?

Ihr habt den Karren

Ihr habt den Karren tief in den Dreck gefahren
Und zur Strafe nenne ich jetzt eure Namen
Ein Mannheimer Bürger klagt euch an
Und ihr habt Deutschland schon viel zu viel angetan

Willkommen bei Angela Merkels korrupter CDU
Natürlich war die Regierung Kohl käuflich, so wie du
Schreiber bricht euch allen das Rückgrat, und wir schauen zu
Ich kann nichts Christliches erkennen in dem was ihr tut

Das C muss raus aus der CDU
Bleibt nur DU, kurz, du bist raus
Also, macht 'nen Schuh, du bist raus
Und du schaust jetzt zu

Wie die Jungs von der Keinherzbank, die mit unserer Kohle zocken
Ihr wart sehr, sehr böse, steht bepisst in euren Socken
Baron Totschild gibt den Ton an, und er scheißt auf euch Gockel
Der Schmock ist'n Fuchs und ihr seid nur Trottel

Noch dümmer als Bernanke, Trichet und King
Deutsche Bänker, unser Schandfleck, lieben jedes krumme Ding
Um den Deutschen das Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen
Haben die, die Geld verloren haben, es nicht anders verdient

Ich werf' euch alle in 'nen Topf, denn so macht ihr's ja mit uns
Ihr gebt doch eh keine Kredite mehr, an Schmidt, Hinz oder Kunz
Und an uns ja sowieso nicht, denn wir machen ja Kunst
Obwohl, ich glaub wir haben noch nie so viel Papier wie ihr verhunzt

Ihr seid notorische Steuergeldverschwender
Große Schaumschläger, ekelhafte Blender
Fast so eklig wie eure Cousins, die schlechten Manager
Undurchsichtig wie gierige Banker

Doch am schlimmsten von allen finde ich immer noch ***
Bewirb dich um 'ne Stelle im Land hinterm Ärmelkanal
Verdammt nochmal, ich sag's nochmal
Verlassen Sie auf der Stelle den Parlamentarsaal!

Ihr müsst raus aus dem Reichstag
Und wenn ich euch da rausklag
Ihr sollt haushalten und euer Maul halten
Aber würdet ihr nicht so viel labern
Dann würd' man euch für faul halten

Raus aus dem Reichstag
Und wenn ich euch da rausklag
Ihr sollt haushalten und euer Maul halten
Aber würdet ihr nicht so viel labern
Dann würd' man euch für faul halten

Lang nicht mehr

Sagt hier längst keiner mehr
Alles neu
Alles Alte verkehrt

Manche vergruben ihr Wissen in Pyramiden
Die wir schon fragen müssten, um Auskunft zu liefern
Ich frage mich, ob wir die Fragen verstehen
Die sich auftun, wenn wir diesen Fragen nachgehen
Es sind Fragen, alt wie die Zeit, die vergeht
Die vom Winde verweht in der Erde liegen
Jeder bangt um seine kleine Zeit
Der Zeit bangt vor den großen Pyramiden
Glaubt nicht, was alle sagen, es ist gar nichts entschieden
Die Wahrheit ist auf der Strecke geblieben
Könige und deren Nachkommen verschwiegen
Zeugen sind unter der Decke geblieben
Könige sind ihrer Schlacht fern geblieben
Später wurden ihnen dann große Taten zugeschrieben
Von gewonnenen Kriegen und berauschenden Siegen
1000 Jahre später erfährt man, das alles waren Lügen
Um die Macht an sich zu reißen, muss man viele betrügen

Es ist lange her
Niemand spricht mehr davon
Lang nicht mehr
Alle tot oder auf und davon
Schiff Ahoi
Sagt hier längst keiner mehr
Alles neu
Alles Alte verkehrt

Was, wenn wir nicht die erste Hochzivilisation sind
Was, wenn wir nur ein müder Abklatsch davon sind
Lass mich davon sing, lass mich dir nah bring
Was, wenn die Pyramiden schon 70.000 Jahre alt sind
Und was, wenn viele Daten in den Schulbüchern falsch sind
Denn Geschichte ist nur das, worauf man sich einigt
Unschöne Wahrheiten alle bereinigt
Neue Grenzen gezogen und Völker vereinigt
Mythen geschaffen und ran an die Waffen
Es gibt Länder zu erobern und Reiche zu schaffen
Neue Heroen und neue Lakaien
Doch die Kleider des Kaisers sind immer noch rein
Das Gold des Pharaos hat immer noch Schein
Man schafft immer noch Holz für den Tempel herbei
Es sei, wie es sei, es ist, wie es war
Manches ist wirklich schon seit einer Ewigkeit da

Es ist lange her
Niemand spricht mehr davon
Lang nicht mehr

Eine gute Frau, ein guter Mann
Und auf dieser Welt so unerwünscht
Wie man unverwünscht sein kann
Bitte stumpf nicht ab, halt die Ohren auf
Denn Rettung naht gewiss aus einem hohen Haus
Zieh deine Rüstung an, du weißt welche ich meine
Zieh deine Rüstung an, so eine hat keine

Du fragts dich, warum bist du hier, in dieser dunklen Welt
Mach dir endlich Licht, mach es endlich hell
Es liegt wirklich an dir und was du draus machst
Es liegt nicht an der Welt, weil die Welt darüber lacht
Die Welt liegt uns zur Last
Die Welt treibt uns zum Hass

From the time I was little youth and baby
They taught me things I never want to learn hoping maybe
I could be the next one to get their job done
But somehow I always knew that they were shady
Whether it was just a charming man or pretty lady
I never took for granted anything they gave me
'Cause their system is designed to keep us in mental slavery
In my younger days I used to look up to heaven
Wonder why the angel never come why God not send me
Till I learned to look a little deeper to me brethren understanding

Storys über Sehnsucht, Angst und Einsamkeit
Über Schweiß und Tränen, über Freude und Leid
Über Luft und Liebe auf den ersten Blick
Pech und Glück hey yeah!

Songs sind Träume
Manchmal Träume
Déjà-vus von etwas, was noch wahr werden soll
Songs sind Länder
Fremde Länder
Wo man immer schon hin wollte

Hu!
Hu!

Oh!
Songs sind Träume
Manchmal Träume
Déjà-vus von etwas, was noch wahr werden soll
Songs sind Länder
Fremde Länder
Wo man immer schon hin wollte yeah yeah
Wo man immer schon hin wollte 
Wo man immer schon hin wollte, hey"
Xavier Naidoo,Stand By Me,/x/xavier+naidoo/stand+by+me_21223597.html,"When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me, so

Darling darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain
Should crumble to the sea

No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me, and

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me, oh stand by me"

Xavier Naidoo,Söldnerlied (Drogen Und Gold),/x/xavier+naidoo/s+ldnerlied+drogen+und+gold_21223947.html,"Bitte teil dir deine Kraft sehr gut ein
Denn das Ende deiner Reise wird lange nicht in Sicht sein
Das Licht dringt ein, dein Licht wird scheinen
Du musst verzeihen aber das muss schon sein

Und so laufen oder rennen oder fahren wir gen Horizont, gen Horizont
Und wir saufen und wir raufen und wir kaufen und Drogen und Gold, Drogen und Gold
Weg von der Front, weg von der Front
Weg mit dem Sold, weg mit dem Sold
Das Leben ist prall, das Leben ist prall
Das Leben ist voll, das Leben ist voll

Jedes Leben hat Höhen, jedes Leben hat Höhen

Jedes Leben fällt tief, Jedes Leben fällt tief
Jede Familie ein Anrecht auf einen Abschiedsbrief
Abschied vom Frieden, Abschied vom Frieden
Abschied vom Leben, Abschied vom Leben
Abschied vom Lieben, Abschied vom Lieben
Abschied vom Nehmen
Es ist schön, weit zu reisen, wenn man schöne Ziele hat
Doch wie ein Geier zu kreisen, hab ich langsam satt
Die Schlachtfelder dieser Welt sind mit Blut getränkt
Die Machthaber dieser Welt mischen Blut mit Geld

Und so laufen oder rennen oder fahren wir gen Horizont, gen Horizont
Und wir saufen und wir raufen und wir kaufen und Drogen und Gold, Drogen und Gold
Weg von der Front, weg von der Front
Weg mit dem Sold, weg mit dem Sold
Das Leben ist prall, das Leben ist prall
Das Leben ist voll, das Leben ist voll

Und so laufen oder rennen oder fahren wir gen Horizont, gen Horizont

Xavier Naidoo,That's The Way Love Is,/x/xavier+naidoo/thats+the+way+love+is_21222747.html,"Two people take a vow to be together
And live and love each other forever.
They promise to love a lifetime
Funny thing
Then they change their minds.
They both go their seperate ways
And love is just a memory.
But a young heart doesn't stay sad long
Another love soon comes along.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

Two people don't get along
Deep down in both have feelings very strong
They try hard to conceal it.
Their hearts burn 'cause they both know they can feel it.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

Lovers leave without a reason
Feelings change just like seasons.
In love nothing's for certain
There's no use in pretending what's behind the curtain.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

And sometimes it's so unfair
when the feeling's no longer there.

That's the way love is

And sometimes it's gratifying
Love's feeling just ain't no denying.

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

It's just the way love is"
Xavier Naidoo,The Game,/x/xavier+naidoo/the+game_21223587.html,"I looked up you name to start a new game
And it won't be the same, I know
Show me your heart before this game starts
And we'll never part, I know
I don't care who wins, cause it's like needles and pins
And my brain will rinse,
I know, I know

Don't forget this game we play is real
And if you win you know how I will feel
I'll win this game
I say
You'll win this game you pray

We start to fight along through the night
How will this game end, who knows, who knows
You're coming down hard, so hard
Tearing my plan apart
You kill me again, you know

Thought I had it made, had it made
In my throat there is a blade
And I know it's too late,
I know

I knew along the way this game is real
I knew that I would feel just how I feel
My heart and soul you stole and thrown it in the cold

Come on and let me win
Come on and let me win
You just got to let me win
You just got to let me win

I knew this game is real
I knew this game is real
I knew this game is real
I knew this game is real
I wanted to play this game

I wanted to play this game

And the game is real
And the game is real
This game is so real

Xavier Naidoo,This Is Not America,/x/xavier+naidoo/this+is+not+america_20315696.html,"Wenn sie vorbeigeht, dann scheint es wie ein Feuerwerk.
Vor einem Himmel ist es sie, die ich bemerk.
Ihre Kniglichkeit ist nur einen Knig wert.
Und ich bin wenig kniglich.
Sie sieht mich einfach nicht.
Wenn sie tanzt, dann tanzt alles, ihre Hften und Arme.
Alles erhellt sich I'm Licht, dieser Tag.
Sie hat die Anmut und die Reinheit, die die anderen nicht haben.
Sie hat alles, was ich nicht hab.
Sie sieht mich einfach nicht.
Je mehr ich mich ihr nher, desto ungeschickter bin ich.
Mein Krper, meine Stimme, mein Gesicht.
Es gibt Grenzen, die man trotz Millionen von Soldaten wegwischt,
Aber unsere berwindet man nicht.
Er hat Stil, ist delikat, bedient sich Gesten so zart.
Das leichte Leben dieser Welt ist seine Art.
Er ist so sehr auch das, was er nicht zu sein vermag.
Doch die Frauen wissen nicht von diesen Dingen, wenn er spricht.
Sie sieht mich einfach nicht.
Man kann so vieles ndern, wenn man zu kmpfen bereit
Ist, aber nicht diese Ungerechtigkeit.
Wenn sie vorbeigeht, dann scheint es wie ein Feuerwerk.
Vor einem Himmel ist es sie, die ich bemerk.
Ihre Kniglichkeit ist nur einen Knig wert.
Ein Anderer als ich. Ich bin wenig kniglich.

Xavier Naidoo,Tropfen Für Tropfen,/x/xavier+naidoo/tropfen+f+r+tropfen_21225757.html,"Mehr als peinlich berührt von ihrer Analyse
Zieht er sich zurück und denkt lange nach
Alles, was sie sagte, ist wahr, doch er kriegt keine Krise
Geht zu ihr zurück, küsst sie noch einmal
Und er sagt: „Danke für die wahren Worte, auch wenn sie eine Qual waren!
Ich selbst hatte meine Sinne nicht beisammen
Jetzt schüttel' ich den Staub ab und gehe weiter
Anders ausgedrückt, ich fange nochmal an!“

Tropfen für Tropfen, Stein für Stein
Manchmal muss es der lange Weg sein
Träne für Träne, Schweiß und Blut
Was lange schmerzt, wird endlich gut
Was lange schmerzt, wird endlich gut

Sie kehrt die Scherben auf und läuft zu ihm rüber
Stellt sich in den Türrahmen und schaut ihn liebevoll an
„Vielleicht hast du ja recht und es ist meine Eifersucht
Denn einen Mensch wie dich will ich einfach nie verlieren!
Auch wenn es besser wär' zu gehen, würden wir noch eine Chance verdienen!
Denn einen Mensch wie dich will ich einfach nicht verlieren!
Auch wenn es besser wär' zu gehen, würden wir noch eine Chance verdienen!
Einen Mensch wie dich will ich einfach nie verlieren!“

Tropfen für Tropfen, Stein für Stein (Tropfen für Tropfen, Stein für Stein)
Manchmal muss es der lange Weg sein
Träne für Träne, Schweiß und Blut (Träne für Träne, Schweiß und Blut)
Was lange schmerzt, wird endlich gut
Was lange schmerzt, wird endlich gut

„Und danke für die wahren Worte, auch wenn sie 'ne Qual waren!
Ich selbst hatte meine Sinne nicht beisammen
Jetzt schüttel' ich den Staub ab und gehe weiter
Anders ausgedrückt, ich fang' von vorne an!
Ich fang' von vorne an!“

Tropfen für Tropfen, Stein für Stein (Tropfen für Tropfen, Stein für Stein)

Es ist schöner als ich es mir erträumt hab

Am liebsten wär' mir die Zeit bliebe stehen

Wer hätte das gedacht, ein Traum aus
Dem man nicht aufwacht
Ich bin die Sorge los wie find' ich
Diesen Menschen bloß
Meine Seele jubiliert, weil sie niemals
Den Mut verliert
Mich aufzufordern raus zu gehen um
Mich nach dir umzusehen

Und
Es ist schöner als ich es mir erträumt hab

Und
Am liebsten wär' mir die Zeit bliebe stehen

Und
Es macht alles gut, was ich je versäumt hab

Und
Vielleicht sollten wir gemeinsam weitergehen

Verlier' kein Wort darüber, heb dir alles auf
Dein Wort war unverfügbar, deine Nähe auch
Und jetzt ist alles hier, was vorher nie hier war
Und das was weit entfernt war ist jetzt wieder nah

Und
Es ist schöner als ich es mir erträumt hab

Und
Am liebsten wär' mir die Zeit bliebe stehen

Und
Es macht alles gut, was ich je versäumt hab

Vielleicht sollten wir gemeinsam weitergehen"
Xavier Naidoo,Und Wenn Ein Lied,/x/xavier+naidoo/und+wenn+ein+lied_20650545.html,"Und wenn ein lied meine lippen verlässt,
Dann nur damit du liebe empfängst.
Durch die nacht und das dichteste geäst
Damit du keine ängste mehr kennst

Sag ein kleines stückchen wahrheit
Sieh wie die wüste lebt
Schaff ein kleines bisschen klarheit
Und schau wie sich der schleier hebt
Eine wüste aus beton und asphalt
Doch sie lebt und öffnet einen spalt
Der dir neues zeigt
Zeigt das altes weicht
Auch wenn dein schmerz bis an
Den himmel reicht

Ref.:
Und wenn ein lied, meine lippen verlässt,
Dann nur damit du liebe empfängst
Durch die nacht und das dichteste geäst
Damit du keine ängste mehr kennst

Dieses lied ist nur füare dich
Schön, wenn es dir gefällt
Denn es kam so über mich
Wie die nacht über die welt
Schnellt gefahr aus der dunkelheit
Bin ich zum ersten schlag bereit

Ich bin der erste der dich befreit
Und einer der letzten der um dich weint

Und wenn ein lied (1x)

In unserer sanduhr fällt das letzte korn
Ich hab gewonnen und hab ebenso verlorn
Jedoch missen möcht ich nichts
Alles bleibt unser gedanklicher besitz
Und eine bleibende erinnerung
Zwischen tag und nacht legt sich die dämmerung

Und wenn ein lied
(2x)

Damit du keine ängste mehr kennst
Damit du keine ängste mehr kennst"

Mit dem was er glaubt oder
Mit dem was er wei?.
Doch der an den ich glaube,
Ist auch der den ich preis'.

Refrain:
Vielleicht h? R'n sie nicht hin,
Vielleicht seh'n sie nicht gut,
Vielleicht fehlt ihnen der Sinn
Oder es fehlt ihnen Mut.

Ich versuche zu verstehn,
Was andere in Dir sehn.
Warum sie Kriege anfangen
Und in deinen Augen Morde begehen.
Warum sie Menschen dazu zwingen,
An einem Virus zu sterben.
2000 Jahre nach Dir,
Liegt hier alles in Scherben.

2x Refrain
....

Vergib mir meine Schuld,
Dann wenn ich Dich seh.
Solange trag ich meine S? Nden,
Wenn ich schlaf und wenn ich geh.
Ich will keine Versprechen,
Die mir Menschen geben,
Die sie dann wieder brechen,
So sind Menschen eben!
Alles was z? Hlt,
Ist die Verbindung zu Dir
Und es w? Re mein Ende,
Wenn ich diese Verbindung verlier!

Sind wir zur rechten Zeit am rechten Ort
Und alles ist arrangiert, ich bin dankbar dafüare
Weil ich jeden Tag mit meinen Brüdern und Schwestern
Das echte Leben spüare

Was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Dazu bruachen wir keinerlei Waffen
Unsere Waffe nennt sich unser Verstand

Und was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Nur wir müssen geduldig sein
Dann dauert es nicht mehr lang

Die anderen können lachen
Keiner lacht mehr als wir
Was soll'n sie auch machen
Wir sind Ritter mit rosarotem Visier
Ein Leben ohne Euch macht wenig Sinn
Kein Leben, kein Geräusch dann wäre ich wie blind

Was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Dazu brauchen wir keinerlei Waffen
Unsere Waffe nennt sich unser Verstand

Und was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Nur wir müssen geduldig sein
Dann dauert es nicht mehr lang

Es liegt noch was vor uns
Das Leben liegt vor uns
Spürst du die Vorhut
Aufkommenden Frohmut?

Was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Dazu bruachen wir keinerlei Waffen
Unsere Waffe nennt sich unser Verstand

Und was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Nur wir müssen geduldig sein
Dann dauert es nicht mehr lang

Wir haben wieder Wind in den Segeln
Und es spricht jetzt nichts mehr dagegen
Unser Ziel zu erreichen dann viele
Zeichen zeigen wir sind überlegen weil wir auf dem richtigen

Weg sind auch wenn uns
Gerade Probleme begegnen
Wir überstehn den Regen
Werden die Nerven bewahren und es irgendwie regeln

So wie wir's immer getan haben
Doch ohne inneren Fahrplan
Wär'n wir verloren und müssen einsehen
Dass wir uns I'm Kreis drehen so wie in einer Kartbahn

Also lasst uns dafüare dankbar sein dass es nicht so ist
Wir sollten in Zeiten wie diesen nie aus den Augen verlieren was das wichtigste ist füare so viele ist das Leben'n ewiger Wettstreit in dem es jenseits von jeder Korrektheit nur darum geht den ersten Platz zu

Belgen in Best Zeit, doch egal was die Leute lallen die
Ungeduldigen die stolpern und fallen
Denn Erfolg mit Gewalt zu erzwingen wird ihnen nichts bringen und genau das sollten wir schnallen

Was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Dazu bruachen wir keinerlei Waffen
Unsere Waffe nennt sich unser Verstand

Und was wir alleine nicht schaffen
Das schaffen wir dann zusammen
Nur wir müssen geduldig sein
Dann dauert es nicht mehr lang"
Xavier Naidoo,Weck Mich Auf 2016,/x/xavier+naidoo/weck+mich+auf+2016_21226145.html,"Wir leben in 'nem Land, in dem mehr Schranken stehen als es Wege gibt, mehr
Mauern als Brücken, die Stimmung ist negativ
Und die Alten fragen warum rauch ich täglich Weed
Und warum sind ich und meine ganze Generation so depressiv?
Wir sind umgeben von lebenden Toten
Umgeben von Schildern, die uns sagen betreten Verboten!
Umgeben von Skinheads, die Türken und Afrikanern das Leben nehmen
Während Bullen daneben stehen, um Problemen aus dem Weg zu gehen
Umgeben von Jasagern, die alles nur nachlabern
Denen kaltes, dunkles Blut pumpt durch die Schlagadern
Umgeben von Kinderschändern, die nur Bewährung kriegen
Genau wie die scheiß Nazis, deren Opfer unter der Erde liegen
Hat dieses Land wirklich nicht mehr zu bieten
Als ein paar Millionen Arschgesichter mit 'ner Fresse voller Hämorrhoiden?
Die meinen, dies Land sehr zu lieben, doch sind nicht sehr zufrieden
Passt zu eurem Frust oder warum seid ihr hier geblieben?
Ich muß mich von euch ganzen Schlappschwänzen abgrenzen
All den ganzen Hackfressen, die mich jeden Tag stressen
Es sind die gleichen Leute an der Spitze, die sich satt essen
Und Minderheiten werden zur Mehrheit und trotzdem vergessen

Weck mich bitte auf aus diesem Albtraum
Menschen sehen vor lauter Bäumen den Wald kaum
Man versucht uns ständig einzureden
Dass es noch möglich wär', hier frei zu leben
Weck mich bitte auf aus diesem Albtraum
Menschen sehen vor lauter Bäumen den Wald kaum
Ich und du und er und sie und es sind
Besser dran, wenn wir uns selber helfen

Ich bin der Typ, der kurz nach Beginn der Party schon geht
Weil ich nicht feiern kann, solange ich in Babylon leb
Wir haben miese Karten, regiert von Psychopathen
Verwaltet von Bürokraten, die keine Gefühle haben
Kontrolliert von korrupten Cops, die oft Sadisten sind
Verdächtige suchen nach rassistischen Statistiken
Gefüttert von Firmen, die uns jahrzehntelang vergifteten
Informiert durch Medien, die's erst zu spät berichteten
Scheiß auf'n Unfall im Pkw, Schäden von THC, wir hab'n bald alle BSE
Und du schaust noch auf dein EKG, bevor dein Herz stoppt
Und denkst auf'n dickes Steak hätt' ich trotzdem jetzt Bock'
Verdammt nochmal! Gehirnwäsche pur, rund um die Uhr
Und Vater Staat schlägt und vergewaltigt Mutter Natur
Die scheiß Politiker dienen der dunklen Seite wie Darth Vader
Und haben 'nen Horizont von circa einem Quadratmeter
Keine eigene Meinung, doch zehn eigene Ratgeber
Die schwachsinnigen Scheiß reden als hätten sie'n Sprachfehler
Hoffen, die braven Wähler zahlen weiterhin gerne Steuergelder
Doch ich bin hier, um Alarm zu schlagen wie'n Feuermelder

Weck mich bitte auf aus diesem Albtraum
Menschen sehen vor lauter Bäumen den Wald kaum
Man versucht uns ständig einzureden,
Dass es noch möglich wär', hier frei zu leben
Weck mich bitte auf aus diesem Albtraum
Menschen sehen vor lauter Bäumen den Wald kaum
Ich und du und er und sie und es sind
Besser dran, wenn wir uns selber helfen
Was sagt wohl Merkel dazu? Ich glaub, ich ruf sie mal an
Sag zu ihr schau dir doch unsere Jugend mal an
Ein Drittel starrt mit offenem Mund auf ihre Playstations
Das zweite Drittel feiert im Exzess als Rave-Nation als hängig
Abhängig von teuflischen pharmazeutischen Erzeugnissen
Weil sie nicht wussten was diese scheiß Drogen bedeuteten
Das dritte Drittel hängt perspektivlos rum auf deutschen Straßen
Kids mit dreizehn Jahren ziehen sich schon dies weiße Zeug in die Nase
Die keine Ziele, aber nur Träume haben und das sind meist teure Wagen
Sie planen ihr Leben nicht weiter als heute Abend
Denken zur Not geht es wie bei Nintendo noch neu zu starten
Scheißen drauf, ob sie bald sterben wer will schon alt werden?
In diesem Land, in dem mehr Schranken stehn als es Wege gibt
Mehr Mauern als Brücken, die Stimmung ist negativ
Und die Alten Fragen warum rauchen ich täglich Weed
Und darum sind ich und meine ganze Generation so depressiv

Weck mich bitte auf aus diesem Albtraum

Wie schn's wr sein reich zu teilen und seinen kindern leben zu schenken,
Doch jeder tag gibt mir neu zu denken,
Knnt nicht mit ansehn wie ihr dann meinem fleisch und blut, lgen beibringt auf euren schulbnken,
Wozu menschen erzogen werden, kinder belogen werden,
Verzogen mit falschen werten zu sklaven von oben werden,
Das sind keine drohgebrden!
Der scheiss ist ernst wie 16jhrige drogentote,
Die sterben trotz methadon und rzten,
Es dreht sich alles um zahlen in den brsenmrkten,
Funktionieren so wie roboter:
Effizient, doch mit kaltem herzen,
In dieser welt wo wir ware sind, die gewinn ansetzt,
Leb ich in zeiten wo's internet die eltern frs kind ersetzt,
Wahrzeichen explodieren jetzt, denn keiner will unterdrckt sein,
Wer jetzt noch kinder hat und ruhig schlft bei nacht muss verrckt sein!
Ich widersetz mich euch so wie malcolm am fenstersims mit techs
Noch bin ich ganz relaxt,
Doch es wr was los wenn ich kinder htt!
+rap+
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Dann wrt ihr in gefahr
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Wrde euer schlimmster alptraum wahr
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Msste ich euch bedroh'n
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Dann knntet ihr nicht sicher wohn'n
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Wrt ihr in gefahr
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Wrde euer schlimmster alptraum wahr
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Dann msste ich euch bedroh'n
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Dann knntet ihr nicht sicher wohn'n
Ich hoffe ihr versteht mich
Noch steh' ich allein
Doch falls es sich mal ndert
Fllt mir das alles wieder ein
Also macht besser plne
Die besten wren lang nicht gut
Und falls ihr nichts ndert
Spende ich euer blut
...
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Wenn ich schon kinder htte
Wrt ihr in gefahr
Wrde euer schlimmster alptraum wahr
Ich msste euch bedroh'n
Ihr knntet nicht sicher wohn'n"

Wer weiss schon, was der morgen bringt,
Er kreist schon mit dem Morgenwind
Und Ahnt, Dass wir in Sorge sind,
Doch er weiss auch wir sind alle Blind, alle Blind

Lass dich retten, wenn der morgen anbricht
Lass dir sagen es ist Land in Sicht
Wir wurden so oft gewarnt,
Ich sag dir Babylon ist enttarnt,
Als die, die unsere Zukunft pland und die,
Die ihr Ende nicht ahnt

Was willst du sehen? Feuer und Himmel?
Noch vor hundert Jahren war der Himmel nicht Feuerrot
Was willst du sehen? Jesus auf einem schimmel?
Er ist füare unser Leben gestorben und am Kreuz hängt der Tod

Es muss nicht soweit kommen, wie es kommen wird
Doch ich weiss auch, dass seine Schrift sich niemals irrt
Man Liest sie und ist wohl leicht verwirrt,
Doch es scheint als hätten wir uns I'm Himmel verirrt"

Wirklich? Denn es geht nicht um

Und ich hab keine Antwortparat
Lasst sie leben, wenn sie leben
Lasst sie sterben, wenn sie

Weben in denen wir uns verfan-
Gen und fallen sollen

Wir der Wind und das Meer
Und wenn wir uns treennen
Sieht uns der Morgen vielleicht
Nie mehr
Wie schwer wird es sein uns zu
Finden wenn wir nichts mehr se-
Hen und wie sollen wir uns dann
Verbinden wenn wir getrennte
Wege gehen Reit euch zusam-
Men und lasst keinen allein
Der, den du verjagst
Wollte eigentlich nur dein
Retter sein
Vielleicht sind wir in diesem
Land nur um das Kommende zu
Berstehen die Arche liegt noch
Auf Sand bis die Wolkenbrcke
Niedergehen Schick nicht einen
Weg denn du weit nicht was er
Kann vielleicht ist er mutiger
Vielleicht ist sie klger als
Jeder Mann"

Xavier Naidoo,Wo Komm Ich Her,/x/xavier+naidoo/wo+komm+ich+her_21223161.html,"Von oben bis unten von rechts nach links, 
Dann wieder von unten nach oben und von dort beginnt's. 
Von links nach rechts, Soldaten vor Beginn des Gefechts 
Vor die Arbeit ist der Schlaf gesetzt. 
Im Schlaf erwartet dich ein Traumgeflecht, 
Das dich vielleicht in den Zustand des Paradieses versetzt. 
Manchmal ist es jedoch ein Traum, der dir die Hölle ersetzt. 
Setz dich über die Angst weg, sie hat gar keinen Zweck, 
Außer sich zwischen dich und dein Ziel zu stellen. 
Deinen Traum zu erfüllen, deinen Gott zu kennen, deine Freiheit zu lieben, 
Gut von Schlecht zu trennen, deinem Nachbarn zu helfen in der schlimmsten Zeit, 
Sei dazu bereit, in seiner schlimmsten Stunde, 
Nach der ärgsten Bedrohung der vernichtenden Kunde, 
Aus deinem Mund muss dann die Liebe sprechen, 
Gib ihm kein Versprechen, denn dann brichst du kein Wort 
Und hilf dem Menschen besser gleich vor Ort.

Jetzt ist mein Ehrgeiz geweckt, vorher hielt ich mich bedeckt.
Ich will jetzt wissen warum, weshalb und wo komm ich her.
Auch wenn es viele erschreckt, ich will von dir nicht mehr weg.
Du hast so vieles was ich sonst niemals woanders bekäm'.

Du sagst du hast so vieles gehört und so vieles gesehen, 
Ich sag' dass wir von vielem leider nichts verstehen. 
Vom Frieden nicht, vom Lieben nicht und auch die Armen kriegen nichts, 
Bis auf dass man sie liegen lässt, als hätten sie die Schweinepest. 
Als wär' ihr Leben das feinste Fest, lebt ein kleiner, feiner Rest der Welt ein exklusives, ausgelassen und laszives Luxusleben, mit wenig Sinn, 
Währenddessen rafft HIV Afrika dahin.

Meine Wege ziehen mich zur Liebe hin mit den Händen am Mic. 
Ich schreibe diesen Brief für uns alle, hey, denn das Ende ist nicht weit.
Ich denke, es ist Zeit für 'ne Wende, hör ich handel' und schreib'. 
Und erhebe die Stimme, besinn' mich und spreche die Zeilen. 
Durch gebrochene Träume zwischen Häuserblocks und Beton.
Hey, ich setze die Segel, neue Wege, ich segel' davon. 
Ich will die Veränderung, Bewegung, ich dreh' das Ventil. 
Es gibt Türen für neue Ziele, ey, doch wir sehen nicht soviel, 
In 'ner Ellenbogengesellschaft, in der das Geld uns vergiftet. 
Man sieht nur wenige Hände reichen, als sei es nicht wichtig. 
Ich fühle, dass diese Flügel der Liebe einfach kaputt gehen. 
Ich will es nicht glauben wie das Heute Züge in die Luft gehen. 
Ich gehe gegen die Regeln, denn Hoffnung wird nie ersticken. 
Mein Ehrgeiz wurde geweckt, um 'n bisschen Liebe zu finden. 
So fight' ich weiter bis Ende, bleib cool und falte die Hände. 
Such Gutes im Menschen und hoffe ohne blutiges Ende.

Jetzt ist mein Ehrgeiz geweckt, vorher hielt ich mich bedeckt.
Ich will jetzt wissen warum, weshalb und wo komm ich her.
Auch wenn es viele erschreckt, ich will von dir nicht mehr weg.
Du hast so vieles was ich sonst niemals woanders bekäm'.

Meine Stadt liegt mir mal so arg am Herzen, 
Ich nenne sie in fast jedem Song und huldige ihr in Versen 
Und wo ich herkomme gehen die Menschen ihren Weg in Quadraten, 
Die Mentalität ist einmalig yo ich könnte darin baden, 
Ich sage zusammen schaffen wir es immer etwas zu ändern, 
Die rebellierenden Gedanken bringen Krawatten zum kentern, 
Doch nur dran denken was zu ändern ist der Abgang für viele, 
Wir müssen aufstehen, Schrei
Ich bin die Exekutive, ich bin kein MC, 
Ich bin Prophet, Wort ist die predigt, 
Machte den Fehler, schaute weg, dachte das Ding ist erledigt, 
Manche Probleme lösen sich auch wenn mal Gras drüber wächst, 
Doch in dir drin bleibt die Gewissheit 
Nichts getan und sie schwächt, 
Jetzt habe ich meine Kraft gebündelt und ich nutze sie für mich, 
Meine Familie in meim' Herzen, nutze das gleiche für dich 
Und du wirst sehen Komplikationen haben gestern gelebt, 
Sprich ruhig darüber, die Quersumme bleibt der Mensch 
Der hier steht und geht's net gut, Musik ist besser als Medikamente, 
Glaube an Hoffnung, Ohren auf wenn ich die Heilung mitsende, 
Achte Respekt und schenke jedem eine offene Hand, 
Nur Tiere handeln nach Instinkt, doch der Mensch hat Verstand.

Jetzt ist mein Ehrgeiz geweckt, vorher hielt ich mich bedeckt.
Ich will jetzt wissen warum, weshalb und wo komm ich her.
Auch wenn es viele erschreckt, ich will von dir nicht mehr weg.
Du hast so vieles was ich sonst niemals woanders bekäm'."

Als ich dir den Weg zeigen musste
Wer hat verloren? - Du dich?

There's someone, who needs you
Someone who needs you Jeanny

Wir müssen weg hier, komm

Du hast ihn gekauft
Und ich hab es gesehen
Zuviel Rot auf deinen Lippen
Du hast gesagt: ""Mach mich nicht an!""
Aber du warst durchschaut
Augen sagen mehr als Worte
Du brauchst mich doch, h??

Niemand wird dich finden

Newsflash
Das Bundeskriminalamt hat jüngst seine neuste Statistik über sexuellen Missbrauch in Deutschland ver?ffentlicht. Aus dieser geht hervor, dass es sich bei einem Drittel der knapp 250 000 erfassten F?lle um sexuelle Gewalt gegen Kinde handelt. Laut BKA dürfte die Dunkelziffer aber deutlich h?her liegen. Es wird vermutet, dass jedes Jahr über 200 000 Kinder unter 14 Jahren sexuell missbraucht werden.

When you see me
You know it's about to be another crazy night
X-Raided - Loc
Back up in that ass Bitch
If you slipping
That's what your motherfucking ass get
My gun is like my dog
And I be yelling sick 'em
Give me 24 feet
Or be another victim
I ain't got no regard for none of them Busters
I don't need no reason
And ain't nobody coming to save you
Cause it's open season
I squeeze the trigger and feel it kick a little
I'm looking at you in your eyes
While your face is splitting down the middle
Now here's a riddle
Do you got a answer for this
What do they call it when your body stiff... 
Rigimortis
Niggas pouring out 'Ol-E for thy dead homies
But I ain't pouring out shit
Cause I didn't know him
And ain't no love for him
So while you reminiscing me
And my Niggas is yelling rest in piss bitch
We can take it to the next level
Pick your weapon
Make the grave diggers know to include a shovel
And dig a hole deep enough for you to meet your maker
X-Raided Loc - number one Life Taker
Everybody dies

[Chorus: x2]
Ain't no way around it
They search for the fountain of youth
But they never found it
And on that day I die
Ain't nobody going to cry
Everybody wants to go to heaven
But don't know why they want to die

[Verse 2:]
Now they hunting for me like they did Frankenstein
Gang of niggas
Like that Lynch Mob; Pogo sign
They got torches, rope, and ride pumps
I could either be a soldier
Or a quiet punk
But I ain't never been nothing but a Block Banger
Young Rider
Packing me a brain hanger
So don't side
Or it'll be another homocide
I like your glass house
Nigga, get your ass out
About to pass out
And shit your drawls

Cause I got that phat.44 caliber magnum pointed at your jaws
Got my hair in a afro puff
Cause I'm in a rage
I know you feel me baby
We on the same page
The 12-gauge will put you on your back
We'll get along better when you dead
Cause I'm a necropheliak
I'll peel your cap
Until your brain is showing
So I could see what the fuck you was thinking about
Cause evidently you ain't knowing
Can't nobody fuck with Raided
With this slow shit
So I'm going to have to labotimize you with the whole clip
To let you know that I'm the number one life taker
X-Raided seding motherfuckers to meet their maker
Everybody dies

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I'm getting vicious late at night
Like Ebeniezer Scrooge
Dead homies coming back to tell me that to do
Paranormal activity
Like on Poltergeist
Or the invasions of the people that came to snatch your life
I can't explain it
And I really don't see no need to
Cause you could feel me if you drunk and off that weed too
Them little voices getting get in my head
Thinking it's time to murder
So if you slipping
When I'm tripping
Then I'm going to have to serve you
I'm sicker than a nigga that spent his youth in Nam (Vietnam)
That's why my psych trying to make me take Synnacuam
But fuck being calm
I'd rather tear up shit
Let everybody know X-Raided Loc is in this bitch
I'm a nigga that you can't handle
And every night I see the frame of death
In the flame of a candle
Telling me to turn the nine on myself
But it ain't enough liquor on the store shelf
To get me drunk enough to contemplate a suicide
You or me
Who would I rather kill
You decide
But keep in mind
I'm the number one life taker

Sending y'all niggas to meet your maker

Dead on Arrival, at the hospital, he died in his draws
And a rider falls every day, no more retaliatin'
But best believe we go to war...

[First Verse]
I had a dream that the Lord Almighty snatched my soul
Saw a tombstone with my named etched in gold
Heard my Mama cryin' ""Baby don't you leave me this way""
Heard my homies say ""Come back and represent EBK!""
So many homies, in a journey, I decided on mine
Nine millimeter slug through his shirt blew out his spine
Coulda beat my thug to the draw, quicker than Jesse
Hollow tips, had the crime scene bloody and messy
Now bless these souls of the infants that died at birth
Never witnessed the sickness that plagues the Earth
For what it's worth, rest in peace to the ones that failed
At least there ain't no stress, unless that ass is in Hell
Unleash grief, on the enemies I put in the grave
To be continued, when I see you, on judgment day
It'll be a venue, when hot shit is all I desire
Even if I get sentenced to burn in eternal fire
So consumed by this rage, I'm predictin' revenge
Got me ridin' for my homies through committin' sins
When will you feel me? Not until we all dead and shit
My headstone read ""Nefarious"" that's all and that's it

[Chorus:]

[Second Verse]
The car hit the corner, felt the slug enter my chest
Burnin' like some brimstone initiatin' the process of death
I felt my soul slippin' into that dark abyss
My body lettin' go, bowel movement and then I piss
My soul lifts, closed eyes, lookin' down at the scenery
Thinkin' ""Oh no that can't be me with intestines layin' in the street""
Send the sheet, cover me up, stuff me into the body bag and close it
Feel my body bloatin', I feel my body floatin'
I know my enemies gloatin', smokin' blunts and celebratin'
""X-Raided Loc is dead!""
Just maybe either Heaven or Hell is waitin', now my vision's fadin'
Purgatory is my home
My soldiers heard the story, so now it's on nigga

[Chorus x0. 5]

[Third Verse]
Now don't you cry for me, fuck pourin' out your rum
Round up the thugs and watch slugs pourin' out your gun
And it's begun, enemies best to run from dusk til' dawn
Got a vendetta, seekin' revenge like that nigga from spawn
You a pawn and I'm the King, but you the one that's in check
Black roses on your grave, ultimate disrespect
Collected obituary pages for the lives that's ending
Step into the mortuaries daily, so many funerals attended
I never intended to be a thug but destiny drug me in
Grim Reaper already got a grave to plug me in
No way around it, one of these days I'm gonna have to meet the creator
Nobody on Earth is perfect, I hope God ain't a playa hater

I'm have visions like Frank Lack the milleniums dead
Wakin up in this cell thinkin why am I here
Can you tell me how many times can one man die
Mr. Kavorkian, please give me one more try
I'd rather rest in peace than live my life in this living hell
Real niggas living bad while them fake niggas livin well
Bustas is picking on me, what can I do about it
I'm gonna ride and you rhyme and when I spit it I shout it
No doubt about it it's misery but these niggas aint knowin
Got me in this penitentiary tryin to keep me from flowin
So I'm going 51-50 local bitchmade busters
By all means necessary nigga
? motherfucker
I heard that if I die it's a casualty to war
I know you niggas is dissapointed but I'm back once more
The disciple will judge what the fairness is
Playa haters wanna bury the snitch

[Chorus:]

Had me dead on arrival
No chance for survival
I know everybody gotta die
But when it's my turn to go I wanna go out with a BANG
Fuck pain and suffering, shoot me in the brain

[Verse 2:]

Now there aint no way up out the game when you in to deep
Bullet holes through the brain put me in to sleep
Put you out your misery like you the Lazy Duff
If I get to heaven first I'm gonna wait for ya
When you with 25 like the only way to escape
Is to run for the gates and let em hit you with eight
Right in the middle of the door I blow my brains to pieces
And send me straight to gangstas paradise with the trigga releases
I rest in peace and at last lord that's all I ask
Throw me in a casket and throw some dirt on my ass
Lets get it on but no more pain and no more expectations
I know my dead homies up there waitin

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3:]

Dead on arrival no chance for survival
I know everybody gotta die
But can you tell me why I'm having visions of slugs
My head penetrated
Them niggas murdered X-Raided
Guess who retaliated
You risk the game to the broad
It was your decision
My designated assassin got infared vision
He did it quiet no mention the murder on the news
Game over you knew the rules
Callin all soldiers
Load up the clips and your holdsters
50, 000 dollars reward on wanted posters
Ride til you die puttin it down like you supposed to
It's the beginning of the ending
Game over can you feel it
Tension is in the air
Scaring niggas to death producing heart attacks
A black spread with green dots your pulse is fading
Flatline cuz your ass is hating

X-Raided Loc never was a choir boy
Ya folks got a gang of priors
Maybe that's why one-time's be triflin
Tryin to give a young nigga 35 to life
When I ain't even done nothin wrong officer
I have no info to offer ya
He asked my name, So I came off the brain
Told him, ""I am John Doe and this is my hoe Jane""
He said, ""Smart mouth nigga, Don't make me do ya""
Put my thumbprint in his high tech computer
My name came back with a warrant, felonies
Now they got me downtown, Spread my anus, buttocks
I'm like, ""What the fuck is it now?""
They say I robbed a liquor store
They know where, when and how and it's foul
Got ya boy tore up from the floor up
Mom's in the courtroom lookin like she bout to throw up
It's a strong armed robbery, Strapped in the commission
Pre-trial conference, D. A. Got a proposition
He said you'll lose at trial
You'll get the 38, L on top
Take the deal, He'll give me 5
Half and most of the charges dropped
Hopped on the deal quicker than Flash
Sad, I admit that but two and a half ain't bad, I got get back
Sentenced me to five, Two I gotta bring
Only strike one, Swing batter-batter, Swing

Cause when you get your 3rd felony
That's 50 years you gotta bring
It's a deadly game of baseball
So when they try to pull you over
Shoot 'em in the face y'all

Now I'm fresh out, Un-rehabilitated
Raided doin hella good and my P. O. Hates it
Hates dick, She's a dyke lesbian bitch
Can't wait to violate for me for some petty ass shit
I gotta get a job, So I'm fillin applications
Fightin the temptation of slang nation
Minimum wage don't get it
Five bucks an hour don't cut it, Raided aint with it
Fuck it, Went and struck it rich on the dope sack
The homie gave me two, Told me to bring him four back
Now it's time for me to start havin things
Got me a coupe and painted it candy-apple green
It gleams, Clear coat sprayed on thickly
Fools out to get me cause my shit is lookin sticky
I'm at the club and I can feel them suckers scopin
I'm knowin they plottin on me
But I'm still hopin they won't try me, Unless they wanna die
They'll be drippin more blood than Mrs. Simpson was
Sure nuff, Ain't a bluff, Here them suckers come
Got me reachin up under the panel to handle the. 44 Caliber gun, Ugh
Spun him around with a fat Magnum round
Got him on the ground makin funny sounds, Ugh
I got a problem, witnesses
Ten positive identification's

I'm all swole, Five years later
Fresh out the pen, Loc'd up, I'm X-Raided
X-Raided Loc ready to have me a ball
Fuck my P. O., I'm goin awol
They all can suck my dick
I'm sick and tired of goin through all this bitch-made shit
Got two strikes right now as we speak and peep
I'm not gonna let you muthafuckas do me
A petty with a prior will buy your fate
With Wilson in office, You gets no date
So I'm putting my belongings on Greyhound bus, Number 22
Headed to another state, Me and my crew
Unpack my shit, Stack my grip
California and Pete Wilson can suck this dick
If you already didn't know, You couldn't trust his bitch-ass
Look how he did Polly Klaas
Used her death and the family's name
To gain more votes and political fame
And it's a shame, I'm the one they sayin is a monster
Juvenile delinquent, Steppin out of sequence
Fuck that, I ain't goin out like a punk
That ain't my style, Rip him from his ass crack to his nutt sack
Now they wanna kill a nigga like me
I blast one, Blast two, Strike three, Yellin...

Mama told me I was a gift to the whole world
Cause she pushed me out and had a nut
That made her toes curl, Yeah
She said Look at his pretty eyes
What a beautiful smile
He's a bouncing baby boy
What a beautiful child and he hardly ever cried
So cute and peaceful
Until he turned 16 and started shootin people
Now he's murderin innocent folks and bangin his gang

Blocstar Entertainment. Com, Welcome
It was 1991 when I came to the game
And I was ill before Cypress Hill was insane in the brain
Let me explain the real
Give you a little history about the siccness
And what it was really meant to be
Now what it meant to me
It was gangsta, shit so pure
It was sick with no cure, Literally
Wasn't no middle with me
And to spit it, You had to live it, Represent it with me
Hear the genisis, Reminisce with me
The trinity in the beginning
It was Sicx, Lynch and me
Lynch was in the Gardens
Sicx stayed in the middle of The Creek
When I was freestylin to Dr. Dre instrumental beats
I was rhymin about car chases and nines sprayin clips
When Scarface was a Geto Boy and his mind was playin tricks
When Pac was doin the humpty dance with Digital Underground
I was bangin Blocc Crip, Puttin niggaroes underground
By the time I met Sicx
I was sick with the spits
He introduced me to Lynch
We started producing the hits
That ""Niggaz in Black EP"" and endangered ""Nigga Deep""
In 1991 we hit the streets in Sicx's Caprice

[Verse 2:]
South Sacremento, California
Garden Blocc, On Florin Rd. In the Tower Records parkin lot
We hit the neighborhoods where niggaz like to spark the glocks
And if they hated, Stomped 'em out if they was hard or not
And I was 16, Havin wicked and sick dreams
And witnessin Crips schemes on missions to get cream
Seein apartment managers evictin indigent fiends
Whose kids will never know what legitimate innocent means, scream
Elicited by sick scenes
It was live and explicit and as vivid as visions on split screens
In the Cadillac Apartments on Stockton & Riza Way
Where old man from pj was slangin 3 Ki's a day
Where all the G'z would stay when they came to Sac from East L. A.
And all the G'z would say that I would be a G someday
Cause I was down for the gun play
Raised and squeezed the K
And instead of savin me
Mama getting on her knees to pray
When Brotha Lynch told me to chill
Sicx told me deal
The homie C-Bo told me to get scrill for studio time
The only homie in the crew to ever tell me the real was Big Tony
He told me to be true to the rhymes
But I was youthful and blind
Black Market gave me a deal
Told me to build but homie I was out of my mind
J-Dogg and Slim handed me nines and they trained me to kill
And that's what I did, The truth is deeper than you can define
Why should I lie when it's evil and the truth is divine?
I don't write fiction, nigga
All I do is shoot from the mind
My addictions to benjamins, liquor, cars and chronic
Fuckin bitches when I should have been at Enharmonic layin vocals
Instead of runnin the streets sprayin the. 44
What can I say? Forgive me God, I was just loco
I heard J-Dogg was murdered by the Meadowview Bloods
Niggaz hit their hood at 2 in the morning to settle it cuzz
Kicked the door down, Pitch black, Entered the house
Saw it on the news the next night
Injured a spouse, Died at the scene
Cried and screamed the night that I'd seen all the reports
Somebody's mama died
In the course of gang bangers seekin revenge
Cockin them hammers, It was a woman, A grandma
Shot in her pajamas, Arrested at trial
God, I was just a child
With a talent to rhyme because God blessed the child
It was an accident, An absolute tragic event
Didn't even know she was dead 'til after the hit
I could never kill a niggaz mama, man
They're all that we've got
I swear to God, On the Blocc
I did not fire that shot
But I'm responsible, So I accept responsibility
I'm a product of society and my moms stability
Rather the lack there of
I'd sacrifice my life
And give anything to be able to go back there, cuzz
To reverse the slug, Reverse the spurts, Even if it hurts
God, Reverse the blood and reverse the hearse
God, Reverse the curse and rebirth the her
I mean it all, I didn't even have to rehearse a verse
Screamin Lord forgive me
All the bangin that I did
Hey, All of the pain that I inflicted as a kid
Hey, Judgment day
Consider this before you curse me
I was only a child, So Lord have mercy
Forgive me, All the bangin that I did
Hey, All of the pain that I inflicted as a kid
On my judgment day
Consider this before you curse me
I was only a child, So Lord have mercy

When I was a child, I thought as a child
When I became a man, I put away childish things
Ya heard, No more games, man

No more games

And a joint in my mouth
Straight fuckin with that Cisco, It got me 'noid

Now I'm sprung out, stuck on the killa tip
Trippin like a muthafucka but now I'm through with it
Got on the phone said,

His neck was broke and his spinal cord was popped

But I survived, what other options do I have?
Can't blame it on my Mom, can't blame it on my Dad
I make my own decisions, I chose the path that I walk
But me and my father never had that ""man to man"" talk

I be down witcha; winter, spring, summer, fall
I'm ready to ride every time that my homie calls
I never stall on ya dawg, through it all, thick or thin
We went from boys to men in the same hood
So it's all good, even when you actin' bitchmade
It's still on, I'm a ride when you right or wrong
Standin' strong, no matter what the situation in
And if you die, will provide for your wife and kids
That way you live, forever
However, a nigga's never gonna let 'cha rest in peace till we back together
Fuck restin' in peace, I'm in an up roar
What other reason does a nigga have to live for?
If you ain't ready to ride for what we believe
Then get the fuck out the game, it's time for you to leave
Cuz only niggas is willin' to put it all on the line
And ride with us when it's killin' time
I got yo back loc

X-Raided mad at the world, ready to go to war
So tell me what y'all mothafuckas waitin' for?
Put on your boots, and lace 'em up
Dawg, tell me which tree you wanna chase 'em up
It's an organized congregation, committee of the wicked
If you ain't ready to ride, then nigga you can't kick it
So get the fuck up out the set, you high powered coward
Before your bitch ass get devoured
At any given hour my soldiers is bound to loc up
The warriors gonna ride, and all you bitches gon' choke up
But that's the only way to separate the real from the fake
Don't ask me why, bitch a bitch... [?]

And can't no white Lac' creep up on my Caravan

You never know who's plottin'
Be ready for the drama
And recognize when you slip you slide till' you die

Tryin' to have me in a casket
My nigga I ain't lyin
Get that ass kicked
If you come to close to the head colas
Tryin to have you gone
Takin your dome smooth off your shoulders
Somebody shoulda told ya
Soldiers march till' the bass kick
It's like nasa, you gotta give me space bitch
Enemy cliques, orbit the hood like satellites
Knights stayin'
Cause they can settle through wars, battles, and fights
They'll try to get you
Especially if you havin' cash
Hatin to see you with hoes
And shit they never had
You mad cause you broke
But whose fault is that
Them jealous fellas
Is the reason that I brought a strap

[Hook: X-Raided, (Dott Dogg)]
They say fellas is hella jealous in Sac Town
So I don't fucc with 'em
They Say fellas is hella jealous in Sac Town
I know what's up with 'em
Nigga, fellas is hella jealous in Sac Town

Yeah... Nigga...

Niggaz' always on the dick
Everytime I see ya
Bitch ass nigga... Yeah

[X-Raided]
Ths ain't no game
Studio gangsterism promoted sayin' they ridin'
But residin in Southern Dakota
You get checked
Cause you neglectin' your duties as a warrior
You get no respect
I only got love for the neighborhood destroyers
That put it down with a passion
If you got funk, you got action
No hesitation who we smashin'
And the destination's your barrio
You better be ready
Make your brain look like spaghetti
Then we faster than Mario Andretti
It's on in a major way
Playa hatas watch your back
It's your day to pay
We ain't gonna play nigga
We serious as a heart attack
Bustin' through offensive line
Breakin' your Quarter back
Concusion sustained
Bringin' the pain like Reggie White
And every night we strapped ready for a deadly fight
Like Daniel Boone, packin' the big gun that goes boom
Premeditated, niggaz hate it cause I'm Raided
It's your day of doom

[Hook: X-Raided, (Dott Dogg)]
Nigga, fellas is hella jealous in Sac Town
So I don't fuck with 'em
Nigga,

X-Raided,Land Of The Lost,/x/x+raided/land+of+the+lost_21329923.html,"First Verse:

Many muthafuckas didn't make it,
Other niggas locced up 'cause they couldn't take it,
The ghetto got it's claws in my back tryin' to keep a nigga down,
I'm cryin' out for help, but help ain't nowhere to be found,
So what can I do?
Pursue other avenues to get revenues,
Tryin' not to be the next boy on the Channel 3 ten o' clock news,
Facin' interrogation, fuck an explaination,
It's time for declarations with exclaimations,
I'm sick and tired of muthafuckas in my business,
All up in my mix like sugary cool-Aid worried about who I paid,
And who I didn't, I'm tired of spittin' happy raps, 
I'm ready for representin',
My fifty collar clips spit happy caps,
It's gettin' hard to be a G, P.D. want to see me rot
In the penetenairy doin' centuries OH MY GOD!
What do I do?  Where can I go?  What can I say?
I'm in the Land, of the Lost, with no escape

Chorus:

Stuck in a whirlpool gettin' drug down,
We was four deep but I'm the only one now,
How long will I last before I fall off?
Runnin', for my life, in the land of the lost
Stuck in a whirlpool gettin' drug down,
We was four deep but I'm the only one now,
How long will I last before I fall off?
Runnin', for my life, in the land of the lost

Second Verse:

Christmas missed us again,
Poppa robbed 7-11 so now he sittin' in the pen,
Ain't no presents up under the tree for me,
No toys to enjoy, 'cause Mama's unemployed,
Your boy had to face reality at an early age,
StepDad beatin' on Mama 'cause he had a bad day
The drama was thicker than Hill Street Blues,
Wanted to get a .22 and buck him, so you can see it on the news
Now my shoes was holey, pants was old,
Birthdays was fucked up, all I got was clothes,
A lil' Bebe kid, young Pro-Wing sporter boy,
Wearin' turtlenecks, and thick-ass corderouys,
Never got along in Junior High, got bagged on, beat down,
Hoes laughed at me,
But I tried to be cool, I tried to fit in,
But then I said ""Fuck it!"" 
and started comin' to school with a Mack-10,
Got a nigga for his Nikes and his Starter coat,
I got another for his bike, got another for his loccs,
Robbed the same 7-11 as Poppa,
I went and bought a coat down, and some khaki suits, now I'm proper,
Blocc ah-, filliated at only fourteen,
I'm doin' what I want and can't nobody say a thing,
And it seems like I'm out of control,
I don't know where I'm headed, the Land of the Lost got my soul

Chorus

Third Verse:

My Mama said there would be days like these,
The Ghetto on my back beatin' me down to my knees,
Disease, infected,
Children, neglected,
Everywhere I look, I don't see nothin' but crooks,
I rejected, the knowledge that my Mama tried to give,
I told her ""It's my life and I'm the one that's gotta live"",
Mistaken prone, thinkin' I'm grown, doin' whatever I want to,
Nigga's on his own, all alone, no one in my corner,
I got a job at Dairy Queen servin' double burgers,
Moonlightin' as a Bloccer servin' double murders,
My first check was only fifty bucks,
So fuck Dairy Queen, I got back on my the scene,
And stacked some real green,
But opportunies is limited, it's either sell drugs or fast food,
And you know which one I choose,
'cause it's win, lose, or draw, in sickness, in health
It's [1.5 second pause] represent the turf,
'cause don't nobody else give a fuck,
The only love I ever felt, came from the homies and myself,
I want wealth, and power, no matter what the cost,
That's all that's on my mind, in the Land, of the Lost

X-Raided,Legend Of Ice Cold,/x/x+raided/legend+of+ice+cold_20789905.html,"[Intro]
Story for my niggaz from the ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
Story for my niggaz from the ghetto's and slums
And every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums

This is a story for my niggaz from the ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
Ghetto's and slums
This is a story for my niggaz from the ghetto's and slums
And every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums

[Verse 1]
Hey, This is a story for my niggaz from the ghetto's and slums
Every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums
It's so hot, You would swear it's where the devil is from
It's rock n roll but the only heavy metal is guns
Roses often placed on coffins for the dead at receptions
Somebody filled his head with more Led than Zepplin
Kept his weapon in his holster, When he was supposed to shoot it
Guess the truth is he wasn't half Loc'd as reputed
You might refute it
Imma tell you the whole story, Compute it
Imma paint a picture in your mind
Take your time, Review it, I can't dispute it
This nigga was a dangerous thug, He was a 'Rip
But he would bang on his own gang and the Bloods
He was deranged in the brain
Sick and insane and it showed
A tickin time bomb conditioned and trained to explode
Like somebody injected nitro in his veins and they froze
So naturally, Ice Cold was the name that he chose
He was big swole nigga, His arms was 20 inches
A scar on his left cheek from 150 stitches, Razor residue
Had a feud with a dude on Meadowview Road and 29th
Who drew a knife and then he sliced
The night in question, It wasn't less than 9 o'clock on the dot
Ice Cold was ridin around with a 9 Glock and a plot, Dirt broke
But you know how we do it in Sac
We put in work, Loc
In the streets pursuin a jack
He saw a black 'Lac truck
As it stopped at the intersection on Franklin and Florin Road
He headed in it's direction
Followed it down Franklin until it made a right on Mack
And when that turned into Meadowview Road
It was time to make it crack
Driver was on the phone, So he didn't notice it comin
When Ice Cold got out the car holdin chrome, He started gunnin
Target was the driver's head
The first slug shattered the window
The second left the driver dead as the slug battered his temple
Blood splattered the window
Ice Cold didn't give a fuck
He just slowly moved closer
Took a look in the truck
Passenger was a child, About 11, Maybe, Not even
Had a hole in his chest
He was wheezin but still breathin
Not even the nigga Ice Cold was willin to kill a kid
So he said, ""Good luck lil' man, You might live""
He stripped the money and jewelry from the victim and cut
True to his name, Not the slightest twinge of guilt in his gut
The kid was still in the truck, Too terrified to move
Looked to his left
And saw that his big brother lied in a pool of his own blood
In desperation, Picked the phone up
Not realizing the left side of his brother's face was blown up
He dialed 911, Said, 
""Send me an ambulance, My brother is hurt""
""And if you don't hurry, He won't stand a chance""
Operator pleaded, ""Talk to me, Please, Just keep fightin""
Then the kid started cryin and said, 
""Help me, I think I'm dyin""

[Hook]
Picture this, 5 surgeons tryin to keep you alive
You done lost too much blood
You're too weak to survive
They keep fightin, Ordering pints for transfusions
Got your arteries exposed with clamps attached to 'em
Black screen, Green dots, Your pulse is fading
You're getting closer to Satan
Your mama hopin and prayin that you can make it
But the doctor started shakin his head
""Nothing more that we can do""
And then he stated, ""He's dead""

[Verse 2]
5 years past, Ice Cold is still bangin
Representin Garden Blocc
Showin no signs of changin
Never got arrested for shootin the kid and his brother
Unsolved mystery, The truth was never discovered
The kid recovered from his injuries, Eventually
After years of being physically and mentally in misery
His memory was vivid
He could close his eyes and visualize
The minute he realized his brother was dead
He couldn't get it out his head, Just couldn't understand
And in homage to the killer, Took the name ""Lil' Man""
Listen, The nigga Ice Cold was stickin to the thug thang
Gettin G'z, Flippin them Ki's in the drug game
A nigga from the Blood gang named Damu who had big crack
Got followed home one night
Duct taped and kidnapped
Butt raped and bitch slapped by a nigga in a mask
Who had a Mizzac and asked, ""Where the muthfuckin bricks at?""
Wouldn't give up the coke, Damu was a rida
So Ice Cold started pullin out his toe nails with a pliers
It was gruesome, He grabbed his baby
And threatened to shoot him if he didn't give up the birds
So Damu produced them
Ice Cold emerged from the lick with 10 chickens
And 150 Thousand cash that he found stashed in the kitchen
He went on a mission with intent of strictly stackin his paper
Ice Cold never looked back after that caper
But life was slow for Lil' Man
His cash was gettin short
The only thing on his mind was graspin and gettin more
Havin flashes of smashin and robbin a liquor store
Blastin the clerk like O-Dog and dashin to hit the door
Standin on a bridge askin, ""What am I livin for?""
Havin thoughts of jumpin off and smashin the river floor
Often askin Jesus, ""What you hatin a nigga for?""
Please tell me, Why have you forsaken a nigga, Lord?
Whispers from Satan, 
""Fuck prayin and fuck patience""
""You want it? You take it""
""Fuck waitin and fuck playin""
At the point of breakin
Lil' Man decided that he had it up to here with being broke
Got his strap and hit traffic
He stopped at a red light on Mack Rd. and Stockton Blvd.
By the Motel 6, The parkin lot was full of cars
A blue Lexus coupe, He couldn't help but spot it
As it headed toward the exit
He grabbed his Tek and cocked it
Followed at a distance, Palms all sweaty
Hands shakin on the stearin wheel, But he felt ready
No turnin back now, On Florin Rd. and Power Inn
It's the turnin point of the story
Homie, Now it begins
Lil' Man opened up his car door and rose
Gun in hand, Ran to the side of the Lexus and froze
The driver was dark skinned, Familiar scar on his cheek
They made eye contact, Hearts started to speed
Ice Cold floored the gas pedal, Lil' Man started gunnin
Ice Cold lost control, Lil' Man started runnin
Crashed into a phone pole, Air bags deflated
Lil' Man opened the door
Grabbed his throat and stated, 
""Yeah, Bitch-ass nigga, I know you remember me""
""Look into my eyes, Let me refreshin your memory""
""You the one who shot me in the chest and murdered my brother""
""You should of killed me, Nigga, You stupid muthafucka""
He beat him with the butt of the gun
And at the height of the pain
He put the barrel to his head and shot him right in the brain
Man murdered Ice Cold, Took his life in the rain
What goes around comes around
That's just life in the game

It's been on every day since they cut the umbilical chord
Been on a mission since my circumcision
Destined to be hard-core
74 the year the Steelers whipped on Minnesota
July 30 was the day that mama had a soldier
My big sister older than me by four years
Fed me when I was hungry and dried up all my tears
But I was a mama's boy spoiled to the core
Fifteen years later I became X-Raided
Hard headed and don't regret it
My mama told me to chill but I ignored her when she said it
Cuz by the time I was fifteen, I felt like I was twenty
Always wanted more even though I had plenty
I was honor be? No matter what mama say
Kickin it with Joshua, my Terry O, and Johnny Ray
Acting crazy cuz crazy was my nature
Gangsta rituals hereditary
Sometimes it's scary cuz I think I hate ya
What could I have done to get myself a better life
Go to college and have some kids after I met a wife
I'm a non believer but leave it to beaver
Cuz in the neighborhood I grew up being what?
It wasn't nothing but a gang of niggas like me
One put in the grave, the other in the penitentiary
It wasn't nothing else to destroy except for myself
The creation of my mama's pride and joy

[Chorus: x2]

1974, The president was Nixon
The cut the umbilical chord and did the circumcision
I was eight pounds, eight ounces
A bouncing baby boy
America's nightmare, my mama's pride and joy

[Verse 2:]

Now mama I never meant to cause so much pain
Gettin suspended from school, stealing cars, and running with gangs
I only wanted to be a man but never knew how
Only if I knew then what I know now
It would be a different story you would be glorified
Treated like a queen and put up on a pedestal way high
I can't deny it, I did wrong
But mama I tried to be strong, but I didn't fit in
Didn't belong
And papa didn't stick around to keep us safe and sound
Dysfunctional family and nobody to handle me down to do whatever
Thought I was clever but I ended up
Stuck in the penitentiary with forever
And a minute don't go by that I don't reminisce about the days
Mama held me in her arms keeping me out of harms way
Can you tell me, how did mamas baby become a killer
Who turned this African into an American nigga
With rage in my soul
Tearin me apart got me mad at the world with so much pain in my heart
From the start
Columbus and his boys was on a mission to destroy
Mama's pride and joy

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3:]

I wish my life didn't turn out the way it had
If I could only do it all again but at last
It's too late for all that coulda shoulda woulda mess
And I'm way too strong to be walkin around sad and depressed
But I get mad when I think about the way it is
And the way it was when me and my big sister was kids
Who's to blame
It's a shame
I'm so confused and deep in my soul I feel the pain
Mama it's true, I don't know where I came from
Where am I headed
When will it all be? Instead of hectic
My childhood was non existent
My sister had to be a woman at sixteen with no assistance
Where was your god when my life was going down the drain
Late at night didn't you hear me calling out his name
Or was it meant for me to be a black sheep when all I wanted to be was
Happy
Now how hard could that be
For mama's pride and joy

When you seen my nina, You should've ducked
Just knowin a nigga like Lunasicc don't be givin a fuck
So uh, I lit it up, Now I'm gettin up out of that bitch
Tearin my bucket down, Skid marks from my four Vogue's
Burned up on the fuckin ground
I left him dead, His bloody head left on the concrete
There he lay when the ak spray, Brains lookin like hamburger meat
I'm gettin ghost like Casper but I'm not that friendly nigga
I'm that Lunasicc bastard, I'm hazardous to my own health
Just any minute, I just might grab that 9 millimeter
And blast my own self
So we can take it to the next level
I'll go to hell and give the grim reaper a 100 more people
Yellin, ""Fuck the devil!""
So we can take it to the crossroads muthafucka
Even then my 9's stay loaded, Killin all you bustas
Fill it up with hollow tips, Clip pop, nigga drop me one
Fillin all you devils up with them hot ones
Kickin down doors with X
Shoot my gat and fuck a discussion
All I want is the cash
If there aint none, Imma blast
Killin your doctor, Your ambulance driver and your nurse
You walkin to your funeral
Cause X-Loc blew up your hearse
You's a victim of the Lunasicc
Hella quick to blast

X-Raided,"Money, Power, Respect",/x/x+raided/money+power+respect_21330369.html,"I gave you money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made you a star, platinum cards, scar up your foes
Had your back, through it all, my love never expired
Down to do it all, I did it, no matter what you desired
All I required, was that you keep it real with me
And any man that crossed your path would have to deal with me
He was in it in the beginning and through the start of it all
On 24th Street, rappin' for guns and smokes
Write bars everyday, stay battlin' niggas
On the corner, in the hood, dismantlein' niggas
I was watchin' you, vowed that you could excel at somethin'
Instead of sittin' in the dank house steady inhalin' somethin'
So I snatched you up, put you at the right place at the right time
Open mic night at the club, with the right bass and the right rhymes
Got discovered, your chance of a lifetime, got a contract big
Now you pushin' cassettes and compact discs
Doin' videos and shows too fast
With your crew, thirty deep, smokin' O's and hash
But you didn't want to sign autographs, no respect for your fans
You forgot where you came from, you think you the man!
I gave you money, then when your second album dropped
Dubbed you with bad reviews, low sales, and this was the plot
You got dropped from the label's roster and lost all that you gained
Not a peep to your name 'cause you disrespected the game

I gave you money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made you a star, platinum cards, scar up your foes
I was there, through it all, my love never expired
Down to do it all, I had your back, no matter what you desired
All I required, was that you keep it real with me
And any man that crossed your path would have to deal with me
But is you still with me?
Livin' in debt forever eternally
Then turn to me
Get your head together

You gave me money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made me a star, platinum cards, scar up my foes
You had my back, through it all, your love never expired
Down to do it all, you was there, no matter what I desired
All you required, was that I kept it real with you
And any man that crossed my path would have to deal with you
I feel it's true

Then why you go against the grain?

That's what children do

That's why I had to commence the pain
To convince your brain, to never circumvent the game
You'll be resented, don't be tempted by illusions of fame

For in this game, I'm choosin' to follow the rules and change
Loosenin' my steelo, bruised my ego, assumed the pain
Losin' my people

They're evil, you don't need 'em to live
They have no love, and love is what you need 'em to give
It's me and you against the World

I finally figured that out
Blowin' trees and crushin' girls is all them fools about
I'm choosin' a route that'll definitely lead to bigger clout
Like the Isley Brothers what I discovered makes me want to shout
What can I do with the respect of a man whose respect is worthless?
How can a man who has no purpose in life serve me a purpose?
Just want to hurt me, they vicious and merciless

What's your mission?

Collectin' money in surpluses, my only intention
My only henchmen is the game, keep him near to my heart

Mention my name and I'll appear

Yeah, til' death do us part

I gave you money, power, respect, cars and gold
Made you a star, platinum cards, scar up your foes
I was there, through it all, my love never expired
Down to do it all, I had your back, no matter what you desired
All I required, was that you keep it real with me
And any man that crossed your path would have to deal with me
But is you still with me?

Close ya eyes and envision what the scene was
Hit a nigga with an ar-15 slug
And then I grab the loot
Absolute
We had to shoot
Cause he was lookin at a nigga with a mean mug
And the theme was we was in kahoots
He played games shot his ass dead in the brain
Had the liquor red fluid
Was a bitch and I knew it
When it came down to it he was scared to bang
That nigga dared the game
To get his ass with his actions
Been through it many times before
He was down to side
But how many of them niggaz
Really gonna be down to ride when it's time to roll
Ain't got no time for distractions
Money over bitches
Cause them hoe's ain't nuthion but some agravators
Unnessary temptations
Instagatin' situations
By makein hoes swell up like activator
My nigga jumped out the lincoln Navigator
Packin more heat it's the Cash And Tango
Dot-Dog hit the corner with the infared
On you in the blue 99 dodge durango
You don't wanna test this
Fuck around and get stranggled
Till they leave you breathless busted

But don't get it cardiac arrested
It's to late for retractin ya'll statements
Ya'll mutha fuckas done wore out my patients
On my momma I'm a make sure ya hood gets rolled on
More than some triple-gold-daytons
Nigga you don't know what you facein
Up and tied in the ups
Take a dance on the x-side
With mad men and they medalions
Even all funny style niggas with a trail
Get they neck tied

Take you outta the game
Cause you a rookie makin mastakes

You'll fumble the ball 4th quarter down seven
Infiltrated ya game
Workin for the state
Lookin for dirt
But all ya shookin ass found was seven
Desintergrated ya brain
Me and Dot-Dog crumpled them all
Like a 6 pointer earth quake
Bent you outta shape
Stapped a fifty pound weight to his chest plate
Dummped his fake ass in the lake
Sleepin with the fishes
Cause me and my niggas get vicous
And hittin it with us
Is impliable to bullets and bitches
Impossible
Have ya momma visitin the hospital
Trama center where ya delayin-ma fittles
I'm soon to be layin in bed
Body bruised green purple to red
Like a bag of skittles
And I'ma pack a little 380
Creep into the room
Infa beam circle on ya head

Based on a true story
Niggaz wanna hang your wife
Feds find a corpse in a two story building
No head no hands
Ain't no checkin dental records
Or the the finger prints
As for Identifyin the body there ain't no chance
Got the cops shot
Leavin niggas propped up
In fucked up positions
Like dean koonts hide away
I'm a psyco and my motto is
All of ya bitch niggaz gotta die today
I'm takin off whereever I go
If you in the car with me

Up in the peneteniary but tapes still drop
Who would've thought I'd be back?
Takin' this shit up to another level
And rehabilitated X-Raided the muthafuckin' rebel
Time to, settle the score like the Fugees

Back down to thee, what?

Shit that makes niggaz load up their rugers and ride Cuz
Get in your hooptie if you from the four

And I'm at the top of the twenty sack in forty eighty baby

Reputed to be the hardest in town and is undisputed

So you can respect my way of closing people lyrically
Rappers be plantium and call on me level high skill is my criteria
With prize for smashing on men for the inferior
It's nefarious not biggie, nas or jay-z
Fact not non-fiction I'm truly living this ghetto legacy, it was blast for
Me
Wen the source neglected the don killuminati
Can shoot a stri lyric unease so they can ride past me
I'm a vigilante equipped with infinite lyrical arson
Deliberate and intentional this is war I hope you taking it
Personal not reversible, dispersible
I need a batik semi automatic
Blasted, blast quik x-raided the rhyming achromatic
I done had it up to here with these pathetic fabricated war stories
Being spit by these over exaggerated master of cermony's
Polly prolly want a cracker cause you parrots parrot all you hear
Prepared your day of reckoning is all to near

If you disrespect that my c*** take back and shoot till it jams

Optimist prime suspects knowing I'm the illest lyricist

From the highest elevation on earth can top this
I'm relentless steadily brain bashing weak mc's
Please I question if you really klack gats and push key's, unexpectedly
The rap game dictated ya'll tragedy, heavy arterially
Infiltrated what you claim flawlessly game tight I profess my ghetto star
Exquistely
I'm pulling hoe cards of all wack rapper's within this industry

Neglect yo bitch kids I, fuck her with them in the room

We got our own set of laws in the land of the lost
But y'all call the cops when it gets hectic
Snitchin' on a homie when he suspected
Tellin' everything you know
Now your marked for death, anywhere you go
It ain't safe to show your face in the ghetto
Cause if it got around, everybody knowin' you a hoe
Don't be actin' down now
Your days are numbered like a calendar
Cause we gonna blow your ass up like the challenger
We hold court like the wild west, gun fights
May the best man win, and it's to the death
You can't slip

Another unsolved mystery for homicide to pursue

So let the streets be the prosecuter, judge and jury

You can say what you want to say
But every dog has his day, so you gonna pay
You can't run, can't hide, ain't nowhere to go
And if it ain't a bald head, then I got a fro'
That's on the four
Niggaz know I gives a fuck what they speakin' on
I take flight late at night
Smash on in a brougham, mask on, my dome blast on your home
If you the homie
Then you know we mash on you when you wrong
Stand strong when it gets rough
Fuck breakin' down
Niggaz catch rounds when they switch up
You weak belly bitch, softer than a jelly fish
Half heart, half money now, don't be actin' funny style
Now tell me this, where you learn the game from?
And which cartoon did you get your name from?
Cause you a character like Robin Givens
Like Eastwood in the neighborhood, you ""Unforgiven""

What you did in the dark came to day
You can play now, but later on you gotta pay nigga

But when it got hard, niggaz called the ceeznops
Instead of ridin' you provided all the info
To put it simple nigga you's a heeznoe

Now X-Raided's back up in this bitch leavin' niggas in your way
Spittin' fire
Why you done woke up the dragon?
Thought the loc was through so niggas startin' braggin'
About who can fuck with X now really
Who put Sac on the map was it you don't be silly
Will he make the beats up? Nigga what?
And 24th Street rip
But even blood niggas got dubs on my shit
And thug niggas on the south side
Slam X-Raided loc when they out ridin'
I'm the king of this Sac-Town scene and you peasant
I ran shit in the past well in the future and the present
Yo Meek attempt to diss me you's a boy
I knew you back when you was broke wearin' Bugle Boys
Now you got tattoos ooh! You big killa
I won't hesitate to slap you, you still a bitch nigga
Which nigga wanna war with the hardcore
Load up you.44 playa what cha waitin' for
Lay a motha fucka face down
With bullet holes in your clothes
Decapitated and naked from the waist down

Endless blue sportin trigga tottin menace

I know y'all busta remember me
Pumpin' slugs in your dome lobotomizin' your memory
It's him or me when the wars on
My new tapes out now the south areas' a war zone
I send letters from the pen to my true locs
It's time to ride my nigga go out and shoot folks
Incarceration ain't workin'
My body's locked but my souls on the streets lurkin'
Perkin' niggas like Folgers, motivatin' soldiers
To make you set look like yo set got wrecked with bulldozers
How many marks can I take in one day?
I'ma need a little help don't trip it's on the way, hey! 
Display your corpse in the window like a mannequin
Why damagin'
You got no wind and it's plain and simple
Name 'em cripple
Get savage when I aim my pistol
Flame a missile through your temple till your brain gristles
Dead issues

I consume fake rappin' mark niggas like Brut
Chew 'em up spit 'em out piss on 'em when I'm through
You used to be a rip now you claim damu
You dog niggas didn't know but nigga I do
I knew you's a hook like a U-turn
Put your ass in a urn cremated nigga burned
Howard Stern couldn't clown a nigga worse than Raided
Let loose a few verses had you cursed and faded
Like Madusa on the loop I'm turnin' true to the stone
Spittin' brimstone burnin' motha fuckas to bone
If it's on I'ma show you how to end this shit

I had a heart full of pride and had to set it aside
As I was nailed to the crucifix and stabbed in my side
Impaled, toothpicks jabbed in my eyes
Niggas cry but the truth is they're glad that I died
Inhale, conversatin' with Satan himself
Starin' in the mirror lately got him hatin' hisself
Inhale, green smoke like it's oxygen
Rise up out the grave, gotta get my props again
I pray for the day that I could say I got revenge
Got a vendetta cuz I been hated by lots of men
My rage, just way too strong to contain
I'm sinkin', but I'm way too strong to complain
I'm cheatin' the reaper every time he come for me
When I die, will you nigga cry, ride, and die for me?
I'm creepin', prepared to take a breath without thinkin'
Of consequences, of starin' in the face of death without blinkin'
The Unforgiven X-Raided, take my name in vain!
Nefarious nigga, feel the need to explain the game
To various niggas that got it twisted up like cornrows
I'm sick of this bitch shit, I'm comin' for you mark hoes

Nigga I can't stop now, came too far to turn back
Flames burnin' in my brain, my heart done turned black
I opened my mouth to speak and I don't recognize my own voice
And when I close my eyes to sleep, dream of wildin' with my homeboys
And wake up, the image lingers
When he throw up the set it make me wanna break up the niggaz fingers
Blow up the set twice a day, fake nigga I respect not
Load up the Tec and spray your life in one day nigga
I detect cops and you look like a bitch
You shook like a nigga that done did somethin' wrong
False form ass nigga
Get on and blast nigga
Did harm to the last nigga speakin' on my name
And I got these East Coast muthafuckas sleepin' on my game
I sleep even though my brain got me ready to seek and destroy
What? You speakin' on my joy? You speakin' on my pain
And it's been seekin' out my brain
Through this pen to this paper to this track
To the dat and in your ears, nigga for years
Yeah....

Chorus

[X-Raided]
When I die don't come visit me at my grave
I'll come up out the casket
Like ""Night of the Living Dead"" to get that ass bitch
Ride 'til a nigga dead like Killa Tay on Crip
We got to admit you deserve respect but on Crip
You niggas gay Cuz we bloods like Dracula
We'll turn a nigga round me
You weak thugs will have hurtful necks around me
We jump niggas like strangulations
And got a gang of patience when it comes to killin' lames
Layin', waitin' all night for an opportunity to spill your brains
Either you or me, gotta be one, holla at 'em
And I'm comrades with clouds so get decapitated or bombed in crowds
And never capture Raided I mob around
Turn your skin black and blue and orange by the time it's found
Tied and bound and tarred down
Two-faced, many faces better kept
Before we chop you up in suitcases
And disappear without any traces
And we all got game!
Paid with flames, all got game!
Knock y'all brain, Mad Man we all got fangs, bitch!

Yeah, X-Raided Locc
Back up in this bitch, nigga
I aint dead yet (dead yet)

[Verse:]
187 gang related, I'm accused
After every court date my face is on the news
They say I wrote a song about a murder that I committed
Maintain innocence, Nothin but coincidence
I admit, It looks shady from the outside lookin in
Situation is serious, So folks don't comprehend
17 years young back in '92
Facin 25 to life for somethin I didn't do
My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part
And they gon' use the lyrics against me
When my trial gets ready to start
My words being misinterpreted
Nothin but the D. A. Tryin to prove premeditated
They got the Raided stuck, Majorly crossed up
The D. A. Got a fucked up witness and my lawyer is a drunk
Sittin in the county
It's three years already done went by
Pressuring my homies, tryin to get 'em to testifizzy
Snitching ain't no joke, It's hazardous to your health
Point one finger at me, You're pointing three back at yourself
Homies got convicted of murder in the first degree
And aint no doubt about it, They gone do much worse than me
Take me in the court room, In front of an all white jury
With the family lookin me with barely concealed fury
Lawyer standin next to me, prepared to represent
Help me get convicted cause to him
I'm guilty till proven innocent

They wanna gimme Deuce-5 to life
Why they wanna gimme Deuce-5?

[Verse 2:]
Open up the front page of the Sacramento Bee
Read the article that Dan Mcgrath wrote about me
He has his own opinion, It's his job to write it
I say he's being biased and completely one sided
The media write their stories for the public to consume
And any chance I have of gettin a fair trial in Sac has been doomed
Any potential jurors mind is being contaminated
Readin all this bullshit that they write about X-Raided
I never told nobody to go out and kill somebody's folks
Blamin it all on me and the song I wrote is a complete joke
They're lookin for a motive, Searchin in the dark
Puttin a noose around my neck and a bullet through my heart
Just because I'm capable of killin don't mean I kill
Just because I'm capable of killin don't mean I will
Wish the family knew, Gotta find a way to make 'em feel me
I didn't do it but I gotta ride
Because I'm guilty till proven innocent

Why they wanna gimme 25 to life?
They tryin to gimme Deuce-5 to life (cuz I'm guilty till proven innocent)

Why they tryin gimme Deuce-5? (cuz I'm guilty till proven innocent)

I'm knowin I'm gon' end up in the pen
Waitin on appeal, Hopin that I win
Me and Baby Regg fightin this fucked up case
Like Dooney and D-Dubb tryin to get these years erased
In Sac, It ain't no love when you from the Garden Blocc
Maniac, C-Money, Baby Snake and Lil' Venom already got washed
I'm tryin to keep my head up but my load is gettin heavy
Makes me want to do like Sicx, Take Tylenol and get it over with
But instead I just maintain, Do everythin to keep my composure
Representing the hood to the fullest, Ridin like a soldier
I told you fools the I ain't going out like the average
Didn't kill your folks but if you run up then I gotta locc up like a savage
On yo ass, bitch, Aint nothing personal thang, It's all about survival
And I'm going to be 125 years old before I die, If I can help it
You made your threats, I felt it but I aint dead yet
All you niggaz talkin about
What you're gon' do when you see me
I'll be on the weights, wearin state boots and my beanie
Wishin it didn't have to be this way but it's reality, I'm strapped
Based on the fact I'm guilty till proven innocent, nigga

Feel the flames
For my loved ones to excel in this game
Then let it burn
Let it burn

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord that my soul he keeps
Nobody weeps when a G dies
But like Maya Angelou still we rise
Mama tried to keep me home at night
But despite her attempts
I hung with the macks and the pimps
Sidin' with the Rip's
Not cuz I like blue if you like red
I did it cuz I never did like you
And it said the good die young
I don't recognize myself what have I become?
Can you tell me why am I headed for a dead end?
Why I got another dead friend?
Why they surround me- dead men?
Everywhere I look right and left
Flip another page in the book of life and death
It's comin'- I feel it breathin' down my back
It got me runnin' Grim Reap ain't cuttin' no slack
What can I do where can I go
Lord forgive me for all I did cuz I didn't know
And when my heart beats it's last tick
Somebody sat these three words in my casket:
Lord have mercy

[chorus]
Lord forgive me for all the wrong that I did
All of the pain that I inflicted as a kid
On Judgement Day consider this before you curse me
I was only a child so Lord have mercy
Forgive me for all the wrong that I've done
All of the pain I inflicted when I was young
On Judgement Day consider this before you curse me
I was only a child so Lord have mercy

Should I die before I wake
Don't she'd a tear Mama cuz I finally escaped
No more drama no more blood sweat and tears
No more pressure from my peers
And no more fears
I rest in peace- how long will it last
Fore I have to answer for what I did in the past
Illin' - willin' and dealin' cops always after me
I call it survival and you call it misanthropy
But let the record reflect circumstances were suspect
But you couldn't care less- mann
While I struggle to survive
You turned your eyes- plugged your up ears
Ignored my cries
Now Ms. America sayin' we scarin' her
But she can give me Liberty or Death- I'm darin' her
Either one'll set me free- that's all I wanna be
But that aint what y'all wanna see
You'd rather see me killin' up my own in the ghetto
Or sellin' blow to anybody Black, Brown, or Yellow
But forget that- I'm tryin' to get my head right
Even if it mean I gotta get dead tonight
Lord have mercy forgive me

[chorus]

Forgive me for the blood that his body bled
And all the tears that his Mommy shed
Book says 'Thou Shalt Not Kill'
But I done seen more blood spilled
Than the vets on Hamburger Hill- it's real
Post War Syndrome- went to see my homie
But his Mama told me that the homie been gone
Everytime I turn around it be another body on the ground
With fresh gunshot wounds but he didn't hear a sound
When he came out the room
Nobody told him he would be dead so soon
But the gauge went boom Ms. America,
I know you got a cure for AIDS
But we need a cure for Raid who on a rampage
Can you feel it- the tensions in the air thick
Hate got me so high I'm gettin' airsick
Got my people broke lookin for a buck to borrow
Doin it one day at a time fuck your sorrow
Fuck tommorrow I want revenge
I got a Beretta named Vendetta
Time to answer for your sin- man
When you meet your creator- tell him I apologize
But I gotta ride Lord have mercy forgive me...

Bitches only jocking X-Raided cause I be flowin
That's why I'm showin 'em love and affection
In they silky sections, my erections
Spitten milky secretions in they directions
When you in they presence, they say you king
But when you aint around they clown like you a peasent
Fuck givin the bitches presents
Diamond rings and things of that nature get you pussy for sho
That hoe will date ya then deflate your ego
But they got you hero zero to show for all your actions
You went to jail wit no bail an now aint nothin crackin
Bet back when you was free, you thought you had a solid female
But now you can't even get a visit, and gotta beg for mail
Movin lika a snail when you tryin to get her to handle somethin
And late at night she got c** drippin out her bellybutton
That good for nothin bitch is useless for a convict
I'm nuttin up on hoez, nigga fuck that c** shit

Three strikes tryin to wipe out my whole race
Now here comes yo wife since you done got your time
Saying that she can't hang. Bitch is you out yo mind?
She got everything you own
Vehicle, clothes, even yo home
Not a penny on yo books cause tha bitch is gone
They send you to The Branch, then from there out to Tracy
And one of the homies hook you up with his bitch Stacy
She's white, overweight with bifocals
But she's sending letters wit money orders through the postal
You dedicated to love an married her quick to hit that ass
On the first congical visit she had you cummin hella fast
You lost your pretty bitch but you gained a ugly soldier

[Verse 3:]
Now this is for the homies that got them Nike wearing hoes
Ponytails in they hair sportin other bitches clothes
Ruggish, thuggish, raggedy like them up at the type that
Wakes up in the mornin put on some sweats an be like fuck it
Nigga don't lie, you know I just detailed yo baby's mama
The type of bitch that's even qiucker than me to start some drama
Like a comma, puttin pauses in yo sentances
Ya'll can't even get along irreconcilable differences
That bitch is famous
From so many nameless dicks that penetrated
And she's gameless
That's how you know she's never been with Raided
She's aimless, where is you headed? Bitch is you knowin?
Gettin on my nerves like my bunkie when he's snorin
Immediately get rid of her at this moment
And shake her like Jordan does a basketball opponent
Cause if you ever fall or take a loss
Nigga that bitch is gone
That little leech'll find another nigga to lean on
She's a forty ounce swigga, weed smoker
Needin to get that shit up
Her beer belly overlapping, needin to do some sit ups
She's lazy as can be anll never make no progress
So shake that hoe that's all I can suggest, nigga

I'm givin' it to you old school style, no album cover gimmicks,
No intros, no shout outs, nothin' but straight lyrics,
If you in your car buckle up,
But if you don't like what I'm sayin' when you see me knuckle up,
No studio gangsta stories or tall tales full of fiction,
I'm spittin' the life of a nigga that's full of indecision,
Don't know which way to go,
At the crossroads,
It's time to elevate the game,
Cuz they spit the same ol' same,
Cuz a nigga done grew up,
Through some shit that'll make the average nigga fold up,
Thought I had it sowed up,
But hold up, you know what?
I realized the World wouldn't give a fuck whether I'm here or not,
And that's contrary to all that other madness that you hear a lot,
Ain't no bigger figures, just us niggas,
Sometimes they give us action,
This shit is crashin' back to Earth like Michael Jackson,
It don't matter how much scrilla,
You got, you still a nigga,
They either assassinate your character, frame ya, or they kill you,
I don't blame you, if you don't feel the, game I wrote,
We've been brainwashed, unconscious prisoners ever since we left the boat,
Subliminal messages from bands to reject this shit,
But they can't hide the truth no matter what they try to do,
My judgment day is everyday,
fuck what they say,
And make 'em pay,
Grab your H. K., and dragon slay,
And make a day,
Would you rather ride or stay a puppet?
In the ghetto makin' crumbs, why they makin' scrilla by the bucket,
But fuck it,
To each his own,
But to me it's on,
fuck the chest, forget the vest, I'm aimin' for enemy domes,
Cuz only the strong, survive, one life to live,
Let us around,
What's that sound? It's goin' down

Chorus:

Fuck all y'all,
fuckin' with my mind,
Until you all fall,
Misanthropy
fuckin' with my mind,
You can't understand yours,
Now can you understand my,
Misanthropy?

Second Verse:

I did four hundred years in Hell,
Now they tryin' to give me twenty-five to life in the cell,
Got'cha boy on the run and if they catch me it's over,
Rollin' in a Nova,
Three-fifty packin' a forty-caliber Mag importer,
Declarin' war, on the system,
Askin' for help, but the muthafuckas didn't listen,
They tried to get killed, but now they label me a killer,
You lived by the scroll, but you gone die by the scrilla,
Neither of you can see the pain in my eyes, fuck a disguise,
I wear it on my shoulder like a bass,
Causin' casualties like M*A*S*H,
Been a soldier in the truest sense,
Born and raised in a war zone, it's always on,
And you can die in an instant,
As infants grow up to be convicts,
Knew how to shoot a gun since the age of six,
Little lunatic,
Papa didn't wanna raise a punk,
Beat'cha til' you hate it, his ass grew up and beat'cha while you ride punk,
I'm unapproachable, can't nobody tell me shit,
I got my mind made up, fuck a psychiatrist,
I don't need nobody tryin' to tell me what I'm thinkin',
The ghetto is stuck on quicksand and it's sinkin', it's goin' down

[Voice Taped From A Speech]
We are peaceful people,
We are loving people,
We love everybody who loves us,
We're non-violent with people who are non-violent with us,
We are not non-violent with anyone, who is violent with us

Third Verse:

>From day one the odds was against me,
Nate one have love for a nigga, so the Devil tried to tempt me,
To loc up, revolt, rebel,
Said ""You might as well,
You already, livin' in Hell""
I got, somethin' in my soul tellin' me ""Nigga this shit ain't right"",
The Lord never answered, but I prayed with all my might,
So fuck waitin' patient, it's a virtue I don't have,
I got money on my mind and I want my shit in cash,
fuck a forty acre and a mule,
I want everything that you owe me, it's time to pay your dues,
I was used, and abused, for centuries,
But when they mention warfare, they never mentioned me,
But can you picture me?
On top of the World? Runnin' shit with a major attitude,
Madder than that prophet bitch,
With a clip full of shit,
Tearin' your ass to pieces, when the trigger releases,
You're deceased and you got them P. D's, D. A's, judges and polices,
Peep the thesis,
We gets, hot like volcanic lava,
I'm down to slide a niggas drama,
Speedin' shit up like some java,
fuck a comma,
It don't pause, I'm steady unloadin',
Unstoppable nigga the glock goes plop-plop on that ass,
And suckers steady foldin',
I'm hatin' men like the lesbians,
Always down for drama doin' shit just thesbian,
Only love my Mama, traumatize your ass with the quick,
Better come prepared if you try to ride or try to diss my clique,

Accept it, it's what I protected
No excuse, nothin' else respected

You gone need the sounds to bring you back from where you rested
May God Bless it

And we know that you weak ass bunglin' bitches is who we snatchin'

Shots to the head make a hollow sound
Got away with murder, paranoid! I push this bottle down

They say I wrote a song about a murder
I maintain my innocence, it's nothing but a coincidence
I'll admit it looks kind of shadey
From the outside looking in
The situation is serious but people don't comprehend
I was 17 years young back in '92
Facing 25 to life for something I didn't do
My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part
And they're using the lyrics against me when my trial gets ready to start
My songs are being misinterpritated
It ain't nothing but the D. A. Trying to prove premeditated
They've got X-Raided stuck, majorly crossed up
The D. A. Got a fucked up witness and my lawyer is a dump truck
I've been sitting in the county, three years have already went by
They're pressuring my Locs, trying to get them to testify
Snitching ain't no joke, it's hazardous to your health
When you point one finger at me, you're pointing three back at yourself
My homies got convicted for murder in the first degree
Ain't no doubt about it, they'll try to do worse to me
They take me in the court room in front of an all white jury
With the family looking me with barely concealed fury
My lawyer standing next to me, prepared to represent
And help me get convicted cause to him
I'm guilty till proven innocent...
Why they trying to give me deuce-5 to life?
They trying to give me 25 to life cause I'm guilty till proven innocent...

Motherfucker you don't stop (and you won't stop)
Nigga it don't stop (and it won't stop)

[Verse 1: X-Raided]
I'm fin' to get retro on y'all
Kick some of that twenty-fourth street sickness, infect the shit
And speed it up like petro on y'all
Hot enough to roast meat like a microwave
I spit it the pycho way
Dedicated to my niggaz that fuck, drink and smoke their life away
And I'm stuck in zones hazardous
Known to cut you deep enough to crush your bones
And then I throw that knife away I had to bust
Viciously, cannibus got me readily amped up and animus
?? Da pity when you discuss me with animosity
Enemy tones are disrespectful
But my velocity is to swift for you
Nigga you?? Step slow, like penny hardaway
Injury prone I run up in enemies' homes wit tec's
Aint no otha set to do it any harder way
Than shootouts at high speed and thigh weed
And some nights I might bleed
But for life I'ma keep it trunk tight for my G's
You might squeeze a trigger
But ain't no vilence reported
I work with silencers when I creep so the restort is distorted

[Chorus:]
My nigga vengeance is mine
Taking my name in vain and it got me sick in the mind
Shaking a gain with pain and when I'm tempt to spit nines
Be insane to change cuz, fin' to get mines
What, vengeance is mine
Nigga vengeance is mine
You been taking my name in vain and it got me sick in the mind
Shaking gain with pain and when I'm tempt to spit nines
Be in-sane to change cuz, fin' to get mine
What, vengeance is mine

My degrees is too hot for thermometers
I don't need a heater
When I walk in the room water boils 'cause I keep a fever spitting flames
I'ma spirestarter, flitting brains
And when it comes to insane shit, don't nobody supplies harder than this madman
Cream puff killer, you seem rough nigga
But I already accomplished shit you dream of nigga
And one of my accomplices get?? To the??
Twisted like dreads
Put a fist to the head
'Til it puncture your brain, spit 'til you dead
Pump you with game, tryin' to pump you with pain
But you insist-ed to wake a sleeping dragon, a
Nigga that speaks with madness punk in the game, the
Smokes out my nostrils
Should've been discreet now I'm hostile
To fade me nigga's six times impossible
Nigga you responsible
For this rhyme, self-inflicted wound
?? With better I'm sittin in the room
Butt-naked tryin' to slit your wrists, was doomed to fuck with 'Raided
And that's being nice to you nigga
You know what's up with 'Raided
Don't make me do this twice to you nig-Ga...

First Verse:

X-Raided up in this bitch, bout to disrupt some shit,
Ain't from the pound, but I'm still down to Kurupt some shit,
Interrupt your shit, cuz I'm always in a rush to spit,
Like an axe, when I rap, I splitter up your clique,
You better relax, be a witness or a participant,
Eddie Gaffin' laughin' at the co, wonder where the Sergeants went,
See we flow, but it's way more bigger than that,
Ransom note, deliver the gats and all them wack ass tracks,
So we slit his throat, it's malicious, but the game's vicious,
And niggas know, we'll do anything that gains us riches,
We quick to flow, but we just as quick to bark that heat,
Start that beef and Dott Dogg will pause that heartbeat,
We hard to beat, like Schwarzanegger in movies bout factual
Burning niggas like third degree,
Critical surgery,
When I'm mad, you hoes burglary, intrudin' your home,
Stole everything like clepto includin' your dome,
Left your ass chewed up, gaze blast, mid-section blew up,
Bet you all five homicide detectives threw up,
Suit up, in coca sacks then I smoke a bag,
They make me get my focus back, then I choke the gat

Chorus:

When it came to gettin' that money I did whatever it took,
Fuck dividin' the power, wanted every cranny and nook,
Understand me nigga, my family is full of thugs and crooks,
Kings and queens protected by knights, bishops, and rooks

Second Verse:

You better look into my eyes, can't you see the pain?
I'm tired of lies, bitches and niggas playin' games,
This is my ghetto prayer, Lord can you hear me?
Protect my family from player haters, don't let 'em near me,
No need to fear me, I'm only human,
Pursuin' dreams for greenbacks with more schemes, than J. Are. Ewing,
I mean that sincerely,
Love my alcohol and tetrahydracanebanol dearly,
Consumin' twenty pounds yearly,
Clearly I'm out for the cash, nothin' else in my vision,
Takin' chances, makin' decisions that could keep me in prison,
But circumstances keep demandin' me to break these laws,
Writin' lyrics strong enough to, penetrate these walls,
Dott Dogg, don't feel I'm guilty,
As charged, I'm filthy really,
Down for the cause, and I'm comin' raw til' they kill me feel me,
With slugs to the dome, ain't no love so it's on,
And if you ain't thuggin' with me nigga, then I'm thuggin' alone,
I'm a ruggish bone like Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie and Flesh
Art of War to the last breath, nigga ride to the death,
We hardcore, Dott Dogg and Nefarious,
Mad man, Black Market til' they bury us

Chorus (2x)

Third Verse:

I'm constricted on y'all ass like a python,
I'm ready to spit some venom, turn this mic on,
Run up in em,
Checkin' them niggas like a chess board,
Cuz they be hatin', what'cha think I sport a vest for?
Premeditatin',
Yes Lord I got my eye on'em,
When they try to get me I'ma have a fat surprise for 'em,
Got some advice for 'em,
You better recognize, Raided ain't down for none of that bullshit,
Got a full clip, and this man eater won't hesitate to pull it,
And deliver the bullets to your chest like a mailman droppin' off letters,
Fat hole in your sweater,
Smash out with all your cheddar,
Met a nigga that had much game, deeper than the abyss,
Taught me such thangs as how to get fame and keepin' cash in my fist,
Now I insist to get my scrilla scratch,
How real is that?
And I'm quick to peel a niggas cap,
Is you feelin' that?
Move swiftly when I see the cops, cuz I ain't scrillin',
Muthafuckas wanna see me drop, but I ain't willin',
You a pawn in my book,
Busta market a hook,
Saw the fear in your eyes the first time that I looked,
I'ma treat y'all niggas like powdered cocaine it's time to get cooked,
I'm Michael Jordan, you the average guard about to get shook"

Packin' it sellin' it nigga pay, keepin' the change Raided,
Deep in the game crack, sellin' it nigga track
Hit the bell and it hold back on the scene
Wid felons greens inhalin' the smoke
Sub-machines full ah violence on foes
In the club shoot beams and walk,
Lookin' for fiends sellin' souls to the cops red,
Died in his shirt hurt, silence is proved dead
I'm a soul to the block nigga that think violence is cute
Chase niggas in hot pursuit, nine's is mute
Silencers screwed on the nose of the barrels
That cry murders youth,
Throw holes in devils like po' do
Cause riots and urge my loc if to ghost you
Madman motherfucka we lootin' this mansion
Cause you lyin', rhymin' wid passion but no truth
Bad hands is dealt, like gamblers in Vegas
Milk wives and niggas amplifiers invade the,
Scrambler Motherfuck it he called yo convo
Red or blue if you cut the wrong one the bomb blow
We roll super thick like fire ants
Troop wid heat like we bought gun stores wid my advance

Catch 'em slippin' on dubs jack, then I'm strippin' it

Off branch talkin' bout what they gon' do to this nigga
But I ain't feelin' them niggas
So I'm killin' them niggas
Don't you try to tell him now these

Y'all know how I do, and know what I does
Set trip ain't no love, let 'em know what's up cuz

Fuck the haters and the cops
Tell them niggas give you props
And I only got my love for my thugs and bitches
And all I got for enemies is some slugs and stitches

[Verse 3:]
You'll get lost in the mix nigga, swallowed in the game
You get the flossin' it slippin' it up wildin' wid the pain
Like Baby Layne, catch you in the mall and stomp ya brain
Cause I want yo chain I'm sick and don't want to change
My niggas is followin' the same groove we,
Stick to the scripts stick to the Crips
All them other fools get dicks to the lips
So I share no blunt, my bitch bought Nikes and boxers
Don't wear no pumps, buy me a glock and report it stolen
Holdin' my chips to the roll of the die
Wid the loot like Scrooge Mcduck tuck yo jewels
Or my crew push up the conversatin' choose to buck
Momma waitin' for me to rise,
Motivation to my girl be demise
You hear me nigga be advised I do whatever it takes
Get together wid snakes, go to hell and sit forever and bake
Look in my eyes you can see it if you willin' to try
True indeed no disguise for what I'm feelin' inside
Who but me?

I gather myself and try to write nicely, but I ain't feelin' that way

Prison crap, fuckin' bitches, gettin' high, and killin' cats""
But I'm insistin' that I'm spittin' facts
And y'all niggas is spittin' lies to feel alive
While I'm livin' in prison
Couldn't feel that I'm committin' convictions
What the Hell am I supposed to write?
How could I compose nice?
When I'm sittin' in this cell at night like
And steadily socializin' with
Every soldier, sodomist, murderer, rapist
Burgler, racist,
And drug dealers and thug niggas caught up with three strike cases
Man I'm faced with bein' in a cage with niggas that love hatred
That embraced it, and can taste it
And ain't, feelin' no disgrace
Would be willin' to pull your heart out and replace it with a cold one
More should, show love, for the young ones to the old ones
And where they come from is irrelavent
But they're gettin' here so face it
Gotta come up in, if you think you wouldn't be up in, chill
Revelation, I ain't got no patience for this fakin'
Hate me and then you can reflect reports straight crip
Blue and gray bitch
Y'all niggas sport pink and turquoise
I'm laced with gunpowder from up out of A. 44 caliber???
Say sin, see my face sin
Sick to see cuts and disgrace men
To replace men, but they gotta...

Burning there for love

Well i can still remember
A couple of years ago
When the smoke and flame called my name
It was a burning house of love

That rusty nail over our front door
Is where i hung our tears in the rain
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds
To see what luck can bring

Cause you're in your bed, i'm in mine

Title: The Heist (Part 1)

[Jadakiss]
At the table sayin' a prayer holdin' hands
And we got two stolen Benz everything's according to plans
If anybody in the fam gets pinched
Don't worry 'bout your kids control your wench
Don't worry 'bout the money it's gon' get rinsed
And don't worry 'bout me I won't approach the bench
Now let's roll out and get that paper retho
It might look easy but it's not sweet though
It's either do this shit now or don't eat yo
This is real life this ain't no tv show
Word up- backed out
With the macs out
'Nuff clips to shoot four duffels full of loot
22 Dilinger a piece for the boot
Couple of bombs
Remote for the alarms
Outside still runnin' two big black 1500s
Me and Styles wasn't blunted
Must be your point to deal with money
Even though I was nervous somehow it was still funny
I hopped in one son hopped in the other
Word to mother both trucks burn rubber
Figure we could blanff with a mil or two
In a tentacle
I pulled up behind chemical
Doors locked Styles left the other one
Down four blocks it's on now ready or not

[Styles]
Synchronize your watch feed time to cops
Get the rocks out the safety deposit box
Kisses here and up all the guards on watch
And the first thing I grab honey in the fotch

Click above to visit our sponsors

Split for nothing
You get the same you hit the button
Before we hit the safe
Where's the videotape
Gotta look it in the face- forget it
I want your eyelids in the bag got your seven digits
Money and death- what you pick?
And don't be a prick your life is worth more than chips
Money is paper and the banks built bricks
All of a sudden I heard a different gun's clip
I couldn't be hit
Cuz I didn't feel shit
So I duck into cover
Yell for my brother
I yell yo

[Jadakiss]
Then I yell yo back
You can bounce now dog I filled up two sacks
Here's the dough keys to the truck go get in it
Cuz time is our life and we ain't got a minute
I looked outside and I saw the Lieutenant
And I thought to myself, ""Damn, Styles is finished!""
We ain't come this far for this shit to happen
Damn, nigga better get the Captain
Heard six shots 'bout three hit the Captain
Heard a few more but by then they attacked him
Area surrounded parking lot packed in
Just knocked my man off now I was trapped in
But you know I'm going out in a blast
With this last pineapple like they use in M*A*S*H
And as soon as enough cops've filled up the room

Everybody yelling ""hurry up, hurry up!""
But I'm waiting for you, I must go slow
I must not think bad thoughts

What is this world coming to?
Both sides are right but both sides are murdered
I give up, why can't they?
I must not think bad thoughts

The civil wars and the uncivilized wars
Conflagrations leap out of every poor furnace
The food cooks poorly and everyone goes hungry
From then on it's
Dog eat dog, dog eat body, and body eat dog
I can't go down there, I can't understand it
I'm a no good coward
And an American too, a north American that is
Not a south or a central or a native American
Oh, I must not think bad thoughts

I'm guilty of murder of
Innocent men, innocent women, innocent children
Thousands of them
My planes, my guns, my money, my soul
My blood on my hands
It's all my fault
I must not think bad thoughts

The facts we hate
You'll never hear us
I hear the radio, it's finally gonna play new music
You know the british invasion
But what about the
Minutemen, flesheaters, DOA, big boys, and the black flag
Were the last American bands to get played on the radio
Please bring the flag, please bring the flag
Glitter disco synthesizer, night school
All the noble savage drum drum drum
Astronauts go back in time to hang out with the cave people
It's about time, it's about space
It's about some people in the strangest places
Woody Guthrie sang about B-E-A-T-S, not B-E-A-T-S

X Ambassadors,Bad Husband,/x/x+ambassadors/bad+husband_21204317.html,"We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I’m confused
Because

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got, thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn’t mean
The words that we meant that we didn’t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin’ still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"

That baby you got devotion in every little motion

But here I am in this bathroom, hopin' you'll come back soon
Knees on the floor, prayin' to a Lord I don't know
I don't know how to pray
'Cause if I did, I'd be worthless, all I know is curses
You let me down, still, I'm feelin' guilty somehow
So here I go, ""Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, what do I do?
I've got, I've gotta ask a favor from you
And I know, I know we've never spoken before
But I hope you hear me, oh, Lord
Please let my brother live
And let me learn to forgive
And why do bad things happen to good people?
That's all, I guess, amen""
And God said—

...where you're definitely not the same person you were as a kid, but then you sort of come back full circle when you sort of start to become comfortable with who you are (Right) and less trying to be something or someone.
Yeah, do you guess that was kinda your, at the basis of, like, a part of your struggle as a kid, like trying, feeling like you don't know yourself?

To reach the goals of these soccer stars

It’s nice to pray in front of Christ the Redeemer

My God bigger than your God down here
Whom shall I fear?

Especially when your own country treats you like an infidel

Will I lay by your side
Just to say that I'm yours

Swallow my soul
Draggin me down
And there's blood on the covers
From the curses we uttered
To each other
You played your part in this
Why play hide and go seek?
Safe behind your veneer
Does it bury your burden baby?
Makes it all disappear
But those marks on your thighs
Don't they sting when you bleed?

And the way I'll forever be

Chasing my shadow
Chasing my shadow
Wherever I run, wherever I go
Will I ever stop wanting more?
Chasing my shadow

[Bridge]
Power lines through the city
And Bowery looks so pretty
How far I've come, how far I've gotta go
And all I need is killin' me, it's killin me
As soon as I get what I wanted before
It's not what I want anymore

[Chorus]
I'm chasing my shadow
Chasing my shadow (Chasin' me)
Wherever I run, wherever I go
Will I ever stop wanting more
Chasing my shadow (My shadow)
Chasing my shadow
Chasing my shadow"

Pouring out liquor in the pouring rain
Let it go cold

Everything’s changed, everything’s changed

All my people in the same old bars
All my people with the same old scars
But everything’s changed, everything’s changed
Say what you, say what you will

I’ve been living in the dark for a long, long time
But I see better at night

Baby, ‘cause you, you are my shining star
Because you, you are my shining
You are my shining star
And I’ll hold you closer if you go supernova
You will be, you will be
Forever my shining, ever my shining star
Forever my shining, ever my shining star

Everything’s changed, everything’s changed
Your money don’t talk
But the money don’t rain
Everything’s changed, everything’s changed
The same old lovers with the same old games

I’ve been living in the dark for a long, long time
But I sleep better at night

Knowing that you, you are my shining star
‘Cause you, you are my shining
You are my shining star
And I’ll hold you closer if you go supernova
You will be, you will be

In a little house out on the edge of town
We got married and swore we'd never part
Then little by little, we drifted from each other's hearts

First I thought it was just restlessness
That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep
In the end it was something more I guess
That tore us apart and made us weep

I'm driving a stolen car
Down on Eldridge Avenue
Each night I wait to get caught
But I never do

She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote
When our love was young and bold
She said last night she read those letters
And they made her feel one hundred years old

And I'm driving a stolen car
On a pitch black night
And I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright
But I ride by night and I travel in fear
That in this darkness I will disappear"

I hope that I see her again
But this time I won't think twice I will say hi,
And also ask what's her name? And how she's been
Ever since the sunny Friday afternoon

If I ever get the change to...
Talk to her let her know what's really going on
But the possibility seems so hard,
There is almost nothing I can do but any ways..

Almost dancing everything
Every moment of her life
She is taking me with her
With the music in her heart
She is breaking every ice

She is talking with the world
A far-traveled bird
Her soul's her home

See how light are all her moves
Just follows her own rules
But she is not alone

To its scent that has never been

All the colors to unfold
All the magic we behold
In the life we share in fantasy

Be the salt inside the wounds of your most ordinary life

Come closer - what you want is what you see
Desire - but you won't dare talk to me

So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional man
So clean and shy - get it while you can
And yes, what I am is not what you see
Your interest's somewhere else
Your carnal longings make you all the same

Writing letters, sending mails
Offering me your honest interest in what's inside of me
No sins on your mind, of course
Pretend to intellectualize another wasted girl resource

You tell me - you knew what I need
So sorry - for the hypocrit I feed

So pure a lie...

Just a number in a game - you tell me I had a name
Creation of an industry - and not what you might think to see
Glorify an icon's shrine - whose image of me is not mine
Not to save you from your mess - tell you you may kiss...

So pure a lie..."

Steal them all away

Caress you- grievous
Infest you- with lust
Ending soon- chaos

Consume the drugs we sell to you
Keep you begging for more
And soon you will forget
The world you were longing for

Childish dreams- sinful
I have seen- passion
Fearlessly- chainless
All this hope is forever lost

O Euphoria... 
Neverworld's End

We sell you a false dream for your own
So we can control your fantasies
There's no hideaway this world is ours
Given in to our plastic paradise

Endlessly traveling the plains of my dream

Let the child fade away, just memories stay

Falling we're falling with closed eyes
Losing now losing our old disguise

Do you know we reached somehow the end of every story
Welcome to the final show it's here in all it's glory
You can run but all you flee is a life of sorrow
Time will tell what kind of fate will be waiting for us now"
Xandria,The Lioness,/x/xandria/the+lioness_20533440.html,"Cerulean sky over dessert fields and sand veils
And underneath a lioness is stalking narrowing rings
Feel her coming near, she smells the blood, her prey is near
So see her, hear her, feel her, be her

The lioness is hunting us
So beautiful and dangerous
Her embrace is murderous
Beware of the lioness

Do you feel her gentle touch
Her sweet caress hurts just as much
So take care, take care of her
The lioness will win

So close you hear her purring
So close she smells your fear
Not close enough to lose yourself
Beware - the lioness is near"
Xandria,The Lost Elysion,/x/xandria/the+lost+elysion_21007559.html,"For the lost desire, the star of once been higher
Light the face of dead worlds, forever in my heart

For the lost Elysion

Rivers of red run through the land
Cover the ruins of once golden past
When starlight was strong and I did belong
To the almighty light

Burned are the homes where dreams could be born
The whispers of hope, into hate they are torn
Letters to fate, tears like a blade
Wisdom of Shar-Ilya

For the lost desire... 

Secrets are lost, arbors are crossed
The doors of this house will forever be closed
Nothing remains, all full of stains
The colours are fading away

This world full of fear, of lies in my ears
This peace is so false, only greed is sincere
Oh how I wish to be once released
But nothing will turn back time

For the lost desire... 

Born from grace and silence, blissful sound of sirens
For the lost Elysion can never be found again

Silence fell down, broken the crown
Now it will never be anyone's own
In this weary world, it's cruelty unfurled
Frozen until we die

Trying to hold a piece of this gold
Back in my heart till it all will be sold
So I hold the key to open and see
The world behind the lies

I can almost create the picture before my eyes again
But most of it has been washed away for years
Gone for being able to live in this world"

May the winds do once rise again
May the magic be strong to stand
For the dark and the light to come
Soon to an end to give a new way

Over the mountains from the tower above the world
Secrets were given for in his hands to unfold

Will the winds do once rise again?
Will the magic do lead his hand?
For the dark and the light to come
Soon to an end to give a new way?

For this contest to end
Not from hell or heaven sent
To renew the beauty of all
All of the kings have to fall

It's been a long way from the forsaken prison
Seeing the downtrodden ones serve false masters
The rivalry of gods must end here once and for all

Knowing the desire for the crown will lead nowhere
Down there in the fire of the forge it has to burn

Now the winds do rise again
Now the peace will come to the land
For the dark and the light to come
Now to an end to give a new way

We wait for you only - release our world, unfold it
The beauty, the broken - come forth for us and heal it
Be the one, you nameless - and leave us with our freedom
Our freedom"

And of the sunk ships that I found

I am like the endless ocean...

Through the rough sea's current
My blue heart's drawn to your caress
I'll give you salty kisses
How do you like my glittering dress?

Sail your vassels
Human plaything for my waves
Seawards, seawards
Sail your vassels
'Til my seabed is your grave

By what once was sleeping
In the shadows of my heart

Too close to breathe he came to me
Under my skin, making me high
I didn't look for what I see
To less to live too much to die
Of love

Though both they are gone
You left me grey and without a core inside
And I left myself by leaving you angry this night"

It's so hard to see my face
In the mirror's cold disgrace
I wonder what is this I have become
A childish forlorn wish
So easy to seduce
Seems like it's just one step to fall down

Be the valentine... 

I can hardly write these lines
Cause I already have signed
My name across the wall of prayers

Now I listen to my name
Sounding like a blame
I close my eyes and start to sing my song

Be the valentine... 

If I'm looking back behind
To long forgotten times
There's something that is burning on and on

Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis! (x4)

They die in harmony with greed and treachery

She sees the pray and she's aware
The times are hard but she don't care

She's a vampire
Desire darker than black
She's a vampire
Reach higher, no turning back
Her wings are curtains of the night
She knows no wrong or right

Dead are the places where this goddess has been
Cold is the skin that this creature has seen
Her universe is an ocean of blood
Her dining table the cradle of mud

She sees the prey and she's aware
The times are hard but she don't care

She's a vampire
Desire darker than black
She's a vampire
Reach higher, no turning back
Her wings are curtains of the night
She knows no wrong or right

The night is blind, the mistress she is calling you
To be by her side forevermore
Follow her until her thirst is sated
An immortal lie, heartblood

Can't help yourself, she's got you paralyzed

So would you kiss the sun goodbye?
And give your life to never die?

She's a vampire

Who betrayed and who deceived?
Loss of what I once believed

Feel I'm in a dream- scary scenes rush before my eyes
Wake up in a scream- this is real
Where's my paradise?
Downed my circumstance- innocence crushed under this load
Will it ever end, where's my life?

Disastrous certainties once felt
My vast collection of a better time to tell

Knowing my worst enemy
Weak and helpless- is this me?

Makes her dance with a nobody

Eating gherkins by the fistful
From the jar in His front pants pocket
Brine and peppers building up
On the rings around his fingers
Her boob gets so floppy
She uses it as a fan to wave away his sickening B.O.​
Now rubbing it off with a brick
Dust for his panettone

Every frog hops right up into her butthole
Every frog eats a single butthole flea on its way in
She brown box squeezes them all into froghost!
A flock of erect dicks on bat wings
Pee-pees into her sleeping face
And pointlessly tries to fuck a blue sky
At the witch execution, they all hope to be called up

They've had enough!

I hate my husband, I hate my children
I'm going to hang myself

Wash down your hope in that car

I'm going to hump a cop

Wake up wake up
The wish you made is plucked
Go out get up

Wake up wake up
To take the time to cuss
Go out get up
You've seen enough enough

Do you think that you deserve it?

I am waiting here for you
Looking out across the brooke
My hands resting on my chest
But still I stare into the night

Wake up wake up
The wish you made is plucked
Go out get up
You've done enough enough
Wake up wake up
To take the time to cuss
Go out get up
You've seen enough enough

He comes running but not to help"

Do you think that's funny? I don't think it's funny.
But our backs have been broken too many times. We've seen all their tricks and we know all their lines and it's not free, but it should be.
So we risk our necks and reputations. When we hit the ground, the needle skips.
I put a file in your birthday cake because a cheap cliche and a half-hearted
Gesture is what you asked for this year. I spent a day on that damned mix tape.
I should have known that you'd have Nick Drake.
The saddest songs are the oldest news to you.

But our hearts have been broken too many times. We've seen all their tricks and we know all their lines and it's time. Oh, it's time.
So the saints are all lying on my kitchen floor, drifting in and out of consciousness and hanging on the screen door, saying, ""Life is not free, but
It will be."" And they close their eyes and smile their smiles of bloody lips and broken teeth.

Without ease and without reflection
Apples, artichokes

Asparagus, avocados

Pulled through the sand
And yet not dulled

These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on the streets, people on the streets

Watching some good friends scream, “Let me out”
Pray tomorrow, gets me high, high, high

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking
Why can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

But when you do it's of me looking for you on the ship.

The plane I am waiting on has your face printed on the wings,
When it crashes I'll eat the paint off.

I'm gonna spank your ass so hard you'll hate the wigmaster,
But I'll put two pillows on your dining room chair.
You're like a parrot,
Something that belongs to me and not to you.
Loneliness isn't being alone,
It's when someone loves you and you don't have it in you to love them back.

Look at my hair,
It's a dirty little mop crying for you to send it away.

All a guy needs is a chance to pull off my clothes and snicker,
Try harder.

If you mail me a toy I'll use it but that's the most I have to offer.
Do you want to see my panties is the last thing I'll ever say to you.
I want to finger every teenager I see is the last thing you say to me.

It whispers at first

Until mine is with yours
Then mine will burn on

My flesh sings out
It sings, ""Come put me out""

A bridge through a hoop

That you've gotta go home to be with somebody else.
Now even though I'm sick and tired of being alone,
I still gotta ask myself if what I'm doing is wrong.
And what about you, what about you,
Don't you think it's time, don't you think it's time,
You tell her the truth?

Over and over in my head.
Your a liar, a liar, a liar.

So why don't you just hush up all that noise
That's all it ever was.
How you gon try to confess
What you should have said.
Just a simple friend, I didn't
Mean to fall in love.
But I fell for that spell that you cast
And as if that wasnt enough.
Now wait a minute baby,
I gotta get this off my chest somehow.
But I'm runnin out of ways to say just what I mean,
Can you tell by the look in my face that I just wanna scream.

[Chorus:]

All the things you do in the heat of the moment
It can cost you a lifetime of happiness.
All the things you do in the heat of the moment,
In many days to come can bring you nothing but distress.
All the things you do in the heat of the moment,
You may think everythings goin right, but the very next day....
All the things you do in the heat of the moment......

He's got a different little style than other men today,
He does his thing with a swing.
And everything you see him do is in a different way,
You never ever seen before.

[Bridge (LaTocha):]
He's not your ordinary slick uptown type of brother,
Don't think twice 'cause you'll never find another.
Because the man behind the mask,
You've never ever seen him before.

[Verse Two:]
[All]
He's got the flava to do his his thang,
He's got something everybody wish they had,

And something tells me you don't wanna make him mad,
No you don't, no you don't, no you don't.

I wanna spend my whole life, my whole life with you.

[Verse One (Tiny):]
Do you remember all those precious times,
We shared back in the past.
No one knew about the things we did,
Out in the grass.
We're older now,
And we both need companionship.
So let's stop these games,
And get on with our relationship.

[Bridge:]
Ain't no second guessin' about
The way I feel when I'm with you,
It makes me feel so real.
Ain't no living without you,
'Cause you're all the man I need,
And I want you just for me.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Two (Kandi):]
Why is it when I say I love you,
You shy away from me,
When lovin's all I wanna do?
Even though we've never been,
More than just friends,
There's no reason
We should have to let our feelings end.

And whenever your ready, you can slide off my clothes.
And touch my body, anywhere,
I'm yours tonight, Make it right,
Baby just take me there.

[Chorus:]
Take your time and work me slowly (work it),
Cause I'm the kind of girl,
Who needs the kind of guy,
That can last, (work it).
Don't need a man around,
If his's throwin down too fast,
You gotta work me slowly.

[Verse Two (Kandi):]
Now change your position, and keep it right there.
Just go with my motions, rub you hands through my hair.
I hope you don't mind it, if I let out a scream,
Cause it's feeling to good to me, it's more than I dreamed.
It's more than pleasure, it's ecstasy,
Up and down, Round and round,
Baby just come with me, Take your time.

We'll do it all over again,

And yet even so, you try to play like nothing's wrong,
No you can't run away, there is no hiding place,
Cause you can't run from your heart.

Your eyes they tell me secrets that you, you can't deny.
Your eyes they show me feelings that you hold deep inside.
How do I know the secrets that you try to hide?
Cause when I look in your eyes, the truth is alive,
I knew you'd be mine.

Don't you just love the way that it feels?

But tumach shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth.
Then the steady game form very soon fell apart,
‘cause when you just doing all, the loyalty in your heart,
Slight catch a long hymn on all these niggers forgetting where they’re coming from
And they’re slowing down, wait a minute, what we’re running from?
This what we’re supposed to do, here’s where we’re supposed to be,
I hated mtv for trying to play me like a mockery.
But that don’t bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract,
Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back.
My back, backfire, assassination of my character,
Just demassing me in the America.
My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child,
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out.
Even though my father loved me, I ain’t seen him for a while.
Had to fight my baby, bitch, give me my niggaare now.
‘cause I’m running out of time and I need him to understand
The way a superior man had build a brand
Niggers talk about my taxes, had to pay, I consemn,
I’m surviving ‘cause the lines ass crooked in the hand.

Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine, I just wanted to join her.
Now I miss to join her, get to California, I got something for you to do, it was like I was annoying
Resurrected, found my purpose, I remember being dragged, being nervous when I would kick my verses.
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus,
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it.
Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn’t working,
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person.
He probably told him, and by the way did he said it on a prolijetic twisted made about him.
I see Slim and he said he didn’t recognize me,
Was it that or did he let another man to find me?
I don’t know, but now I gotta get this all behind me,
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggers blindly.

I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles,
Blood relatives I could turn to when I’m feeling trouble.
And talk about my struggles.
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone with different females.
And this is such a such, nephew, tell me, what’s up?
Ain’t even ask about your man in Cali, growing up.
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle,
Self medicated numb, but imma feel it tomorrow.
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now that pain was gone I got my second win.
Only the strong live long, you better settle in,
I’m fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win.
1983, that’s when my journey begins,
I searched every word for stritting, only find it within.

The A. K. Ricochet put blood in your cough
And you know the whole fucked up part of it all?
Take a muh'fucker's life somebody comin for yours
It's the get-back gangstas don't believe in karma
Only the strength of the dollar and the body armor
You the bitch ass nigga or a man of honor
My hands wrap around your throat like a anaconda
Then squeeze 'til your eyes pop out of your face
Then relocate to a brand new space (yo)

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Only God could save us (yeah)
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor (yeah)
Do I, come to you with blood on my hands (yeah)
Or run away from the place that I stand? Who the fuck I am, yeah!
Only God could save us
I done burned down the town and killed my neighbor
Do I, come to you for my early demise?
A minute to pray, it only take a second to die

[Xzibit]
I used to snatch people out of cars with a shotgun
Now I give cars to people who ain't got one
Still got the shotgun, whole different lifestyle
Kill you with a crowbar, wrapped in a white towel
Gotta play it smart now, the streets is watchin
The streets dictate the beats so my beats be knockin
Fuck a Strong Arm, I'll drop your coffin
Yeah yeah, muh'fucker I hear you talkin
Niggaz so often take kindness for weakness
Heat-seekin G with the elite on some cheap shit
This my square boy, you can't take me out of it
You want war nigga you better bring a lot of it
I ain't a problem with puttin my problems to rest
You so pussy, boy you need a gynocologist
The hand, the bullet, the firin pin
Please God forgive me for I have sinned, Amen

[Chorus:]

[Xzibit]
Huh, hit a nigga, kill a nigga will come back
Murder rap never attached, got too many snaps
It's more than raps, it's actual facts
Welcome back to the West, left side of your map
Been attacked from all sides, it's time for the payback
Lay back, wait for the right time to spray that
Spray that motherfucker, down to the last clip
Last clip you save for the cop on some waive shit
Blaze haze for days; shocked, stunned, amazed
Bitch best behave or take the fade
Blaze Shade-45 in the all-black Bentley
If I gotta go, y'all niggaz comin with me
Simply put, Mobb Deep said y'all were (Shook)
And when I come through, you just look
We don't change the game, we close the book
I let you go now, I know you got crack to cook, c'mon

I think of bomb shit like my brain was made outta M-80s (caviar)
I flow 16 Pablo Escobar perverse perversion' so fat my dick got a double chin
My mcin' produce more seaman then wet dreamin'
Of hostin' bet with Rachel in the Caribbean

Sendin' Jesus subpoenas

And I'm a have juice till Mark Ferman plants the bloody glove

Ras Kass:
See left coast niggas is the Craziest
I dodge shotgun pellets in the felonious Los Skandalous
Golden State
Home of dysfunctional gang truces
5. 8 quakes where glass houses pancake (westsiiiiiide)
But I be in the hood like a rebuilt engine
Fuck what I'm benchin' I weave through tracks like extensions (nigga)
I'm ridin' for chips like on time on motorcycles
And for looters to get trifle
I'm like a chink on a Slason swap meet roof with two automatic rifles
Puberty got me Vicious
And these generation X bitches is too big for they britches
15 goin' on 30
""I wanna fuck"" written all over their faces with mack compact blowin' kisses
Promoted like seven oasis gettin' niggas twisted in statutory rape cases
But I write rhymes in enough white lines askin' Melle Mel my punchlines
Hit from the baseline like six by nines
Crack addicts and Reggie Miller
That's for reala
I X more Hollywood Squares than Phillis Dilla

So on microphones I let my nuts hang like John Homes
And took so many niggas out I should change my name to Chaperone
D-Mac and Laylaw know that on mic cables
I got one thousand two hundred techniques similar to the turntable
So if it's crem de la creme since I'm smarter I oughta
Float like dead bodies in water
Manana tell your girl this here mayatti got one extra backstage pass
If she put 'em on the glass
Cause she be jockin' rappers that be seen with who's who
The single charters so she blows me for a hit like cluckheads do
No mc parallels they behind bars like Rick's jail cell
To rock well I need a beat like...
Child abuse victims (ha ha)
Everything I say turn to yay
This shit was blowin' kids away before Timothy Mcveigh

Xzibit,At The Speed Of Life,/x/xzibit/at+the+speed+of+life_20148095.html,"[Intro:]

Listen you fuckers, you screwheads
Here's a man who won't take it anymore
A man who stood up against
The skunk, the kunts, the dogs, the fill, the shit
Here is some one who stood up
Here is...

Yeah! this is it for anybody usin bodies
Presents, Xzibit movin at the speed of life
Yeah! check it

[Verse One:]

It took a long time comin but we waited
Xzibit went from underated
To now most antcipaded
Never would of thought that I would rock your set
And get love and respect without no special effects
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed
Thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed
Tryin to glority greed
Livin life at ridiculuos speed-indeed!
The main goal to achieve, is to succeed
Have it laid out for your seed
But the world gets colder every day by day
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.
Trying to find piece of mind
Is like trying to find a gold mine
It just wont happen
No time for relaxin
Real soldiers of fortune
The front line of the action
So never show a nigga what you packin'
""You know what i'm sayin'?""
It's too much weight to be juggling
Who do you picture when you think about struggling
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin

[Chorus:]

Movin...yeah!
Yes movin...
At the speed of life

[Verse Two:]

And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind
And when I die!
Niggas still recite these lines
To rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down
The underground! to upper echelon and beyond
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond
Nigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch
Mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone
It's the law of the land
A straight modern day babylon!

[Chorus:]

Movin...yeah! yeah! like this
Like this...at the speed of life
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!

[Verse Three:]

Xzibit lookin at the earth thru wide angles
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels
Where small situations turn to altercation
With a heavy ass price
'cause niggas don't fight no more!
Before hip hop was all about drama
Anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma
Just me and my bottle
We shall lead not follow
Emcees be full of shit
But they style be hollow
It seems you've bitin off more
Than you can possibly swallow
Just a day in the life of a man named X
Only blunt and latex for the oppisite sex
You see niggas comin thru to smoke and pay respect
Ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything
Whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion
But in the mean while if worse comes to worst
Bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first
Yeah! we got it locked down tight
Xzibit bring truth to the light
Shit is movin at the speed of life

[Chorus:]

Movin...
At the speed of life"
Xzibit,B**** A** N*****,/x/xzibit/b+a+n_20648238.html,"Let me explain to ya why niggers act like bitches
See coz a bitch won't what, I ain't talking about a woman,
I ain't talkin about a lady,
but you mother fuckers listen to the album like why ya always say bitch

Like there's punk ass nigger,
there's bitch ass nigger and there's men,
the ladies they the hoes,
there's women and there's bitches
Niggers act like bitch ass niggers coz they wanna jock a nigger that's got it goin' on just like a skanky bitch
A bitch ass nigger is a male hoe,

""can I get in for free""

Bitch ass nigger what you servin' in this equation
one plus one equal two that will never happen wit me and you, bitch ass nigger
Bitch ass niggers will come to your door and knock and say ""remember me?""
No nigger I don't remember you, coz when I was creating me you told me I would never be me
now that I am here your mother fuckin' bitch ass is sayin' ""can I take a free ride""

Ride wit me, lemme take you somewhere

[Xzibit]
My father was a soldier, my mother was a rider
I was born wit my fists balled up, I'ma fighter
Inspired, a real rhyme writer
Get past the past the future looks brighter
But, I wanna get it back to the way it was
Exchange blows, elbows and it was still love
A better time, better place in space
Cause nothin can erase, shame tat' like my nigga Chase
Cause Bigga B will never be replaced, right
And I'ma scream it to the whole fuckin human race
Get a bar, get a taste
Enforce the muscle to ya hustle and ya did it with grace
Cause real niggaz don't save face, they make movements
Back to the time when hip-hop was music
When N. W. A. Got booed at the Apollo
Broke ""Straight Outta Compton"" and the whole world followed
Cause right now hip-hop is hollow
With no substance, X-Man with the roughness
Cause success can suck sometime
And many of us the way we act, we even lost our minds

[Chorus:]
You can hold your breath, 'til your blue in the face
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on (now sing the song wit me)
You can speculate, on every breath I take
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on

[Xzibit]
Back to the day when +Cooley+ was +High+
Hustle big like Butch in the Y-B-I
We did it 'n died, the gang still multiplied
Sock yo windpipe, cut yo air supply
Hypnotized, not by the glitz 'n glamour
So fuck them cameras, all I need is clips and hammers
The X-Man said that the first rhyme out
Were my fans worth my time?  The first line out, so
Here we are eight years strong and still movin
Groovin with a reputation ya can't ruin
I wanna take it back how it used to be
Five thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity

[Chorus:]

[Xzibit]
Was it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame
That made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?
Played those games nigga when I was younger in life
'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife
Lose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us
Ya can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us
When times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic
Never been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard
But I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor
I never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster
I move in silence, speak with violence
Think with science, live free and walk with lions
Cats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat
It takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Pounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about
It's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth
It's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out
Don't let the things that you can't change stress you out
Cause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son
And change the world with the power of one c'mon

Somebody gotta recognize this
Throw fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist
Number one draft pick, lead the league in assists
Give a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists
You just settin yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this
Only a few slide through like the Schindler's List
Who's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse

Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?

Made a whole album, spent HALF what you spent

My niggas watch the street, be it rain, snow, or sleet
Us niggas gon eat, makin troops we creep
Losin the jeep, runnin on feet, survivin off the land money and
Gun in hand, operation quicksand
Aint tryin ta put the mark of the beast on my hand
I had to bless the head of a military man
Jumped into the back of the 4 door sedan
All up in the trunk was the hidden contraband
Fuck a middleman, my pistols aim directly from Iran
Looking from a third eye, I spot the hidden cam
I know what you look like, I know how you think
I'm the type of bitch to pop a pill up in your drink

Bitch, fuck that, you bring fat rag, here's cheese
You work your fuckin employees
You know you get all excited like that
Stack it through them hoodlum back, cuz I like it like that, bitch
I kill drama, shit get action packed
When I jump out the black stealth bomber
Cuz it's bout, you know, I want the fuckin mansion pad
To heal that bitch sittin on
So don't waste the fuckin cheese that you earn
Rotate the fuckin weed that you burn
Don't fuck with Bossy off the glam,
Rollin crack, blow blocks in half

[Tray Deee]
We rides on visitors and takes no prisoners
Handles all business and pay off the comissioner
Big time crime figure niggas gettin riches
20 inches whippin all we givin hittin switches
Twistin flippin chickens stickin victims if they slippin
Trippin, on the mission and my trigga finga itchin
Positioned at your dome, one twitch and it's on
No remorse or second thoughts once the clip and the chrome
This is the zone, weak niggas covers get blown
Stoned killers and gorillas want whatever you want
Shake spots with bank nots, keep the thang cocked
And leave motherfuckers stripped to tank tops
We the gang, it's our thang to mash and maintain
Gangbang slang came and aint gon change
All out till we fall out, fuck the world
Dogghouse style with the chucks and curls

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the X Man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some Olde English that's covered with frost
And it's like that

[ chorus ]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

{Frost}
I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like Swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the H-K with the laser
Slid the Enterpriser, rent a 99 black Blazer
I shot straight at Merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the Peppermint Casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

{Jayo Felony}
I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like Delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? That shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

Plus I got the scars to prove it
And man.. You don't understand what I understand
I'm feelin like a piece to a bigger plan
'Cause all I'm sayin is the God honest truth of it all, we fightin the wrong enemy
That's why I'm gettin invovled, it's just like the end of that movie ""Saw""
When them two chained up guys met with their demise
And the mastermind was layin there the whole time
Remember that? That's why we have to sit down
And speak about the black and the brown
Now I didn't come here to point no fingers
I know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations
Shit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations
And everybody lose.. From the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it's even the high schools
'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News
When the students squared off and one kid wouldn't choose sides
Hit with a hammer and the kid died and now it's a full blown riot
Tck, that's when the fists start flyin
These kids ain't learnin shit about math and science
Man..

I don't wanna see no more of us up under the ground

They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit.. That's why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown

Yo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day
He came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey
And he don't really fuck with nobody outside of the set
It's tatted big on his neck
Y'know? So over the years, built respect and trust
Some black and brown issues we both discussed
He said, ""Homes, it's been goin down too long
I gotta bang on them fools and it don't feel wrong""
""They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks
So word came down, we gotta handle that shit""
""Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts
Can I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin""
At first, I remind him of what vengeance do
What vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to
He wasn't tryna hear that shit
He just turned up the volume, bangin 50 Cent

I got soldiers from both sides who really don't care
Who identify themselves by the colors they wear
The homey came through to put one in the air
I can tell somethin was wrong the way he sat in his chair
He said, ""X, man I'm just gettin out
From doin eighty eight months, tryna figure things out""
He told me in the pen you get down to get done
'Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one
He showed me the scar on his gut and his neck
They got him good, said he damn near bled to death
The hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes
When he described what it feels like to almost die
All I could do was just sit back and listen
'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions
I got hit with a bottle but I'm not dead
I said, ""Think with your heart homey, not your head""
I said

Keeping bustin about, where you at? And what you owe, and what you drive?
So the day some niggaz come for you I'm really not surprised
Mr. Black Bruce Willis
Please don't kill us
I show mercy like Kevorkian
Like a scorpion

Meet me at the venue, put you on the spot to put you on the menu
Its the mc, I be the one that keeps the bitches hot
Xzibit living life, like a ball inside a? Riders slot?
Dripping everything cause you ain't even got a dime to drop
Go ahead and call the cops; you ain't did nothing
Jerry Spring you out the studio, me and Suge Knight into the parking lot
Niggaz ain't ready for all the shit I've got
Look at yourself crushing Xzibit with your tough talk
That's like Christopher Reeves doing a Crip walk

Every squeeze I let a minute

I prepare to blast hoes
Cause they say these flows is lethal
I'm peepin through my peephole
They sneekin up on me though
Rico got a pistol, nasa got a missile
Likwit got too drunk so now the party is official
I bounce until the end and still set it with bad credit
Got a wack-ass record deal but I signed before I read it
But don't regret it, everything is so pathetic
When the water's gettin deep you can drown or you can tread it
I battle with finesse, like my niggaz giving quest
In these??? We got props, we taking less
So, don't touch that stereo
Or your people will becoming to your burry, yo
The ever sorry yo can blast, I'm here to blow it through the roof
I snatch the money and the hoes and disappear like boo! *Echoes*

Yo it's the?? With Baka Boys, rings and Cali Kings

Every breath you take and every move I make
Shot heard around the world from the Golden State
I'm off the ringer with mine, your Jerry Springer with yours
Your gettin missed like a bitch and I can keep out your jaw
You hold your mop and run shop
Before I known to blow spots
Baka Boys ain't no choice so blastin on your block
I hold it down in the crowd for Cali Kings
And John P. And no P, no Sing-Sing
Laser tape, my name shall be? Regularly great?
I buy no plate, green trees roll, into lock and gate

Xzibit,Carry The Weight,/x/xzibit/carry+the+weight_20148097.html,"[Intro: Xzibit, J-Ro]

I really wish I could you know at twenty-one
YouknowhatI'msayin',he he, yo yo
(I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things
I do, youknowhatI'm sayin')
Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin'
Go ahead
Yeah! I break it down like this

[Verse One:]

You see I don't like to remenisce about the past
The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth
Each and every wrong move the police keep count
Make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out
I was at the funeral when it all began
You know the painful transition from a boy to men
I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine
Didn't understand death nearly lost my mind
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it
Age ten, new step family arrangement
At thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit
I would forever be hit with anything in reach
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach
About forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked
Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked
Physical contact was in form of a slap
At the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back
Courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate
I don't remember the date of the judical debate
But legally I was now in custody of the state

[Chorus:]

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight

[Interlude: Xzibit, (J-Ro)]

(Yeah it's fucked up though man)
(YouknowhatI'msayin')
Yo
(The fuck you doin' in jail)
Insane man, I don't know man, he he he
(Yeah wats goin' on down there, gotta get out dude)
Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man
YouknowI'msayin'
(It's popin' man)
It's cool yo fuck that
(It's popin' out here)
They can go on and on for that
(I'm tellin' you it's popin' man come home)

[Verse Two:]

And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home
But only now I was fucked up plus all alone
My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone
Turned age sixteen now on my own
Started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too
With no hesitation lock load then blast you
Without a hastle we in a town of hicks
Fuckin' all these chicks
Sellin' rock by the bricks
So we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown
At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down
Screamin' demands ""Let me see your goddamn hands (now)""
A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban
We never kept it in the house
So of course we clounded
Only found one pistol took us all down town
We be out by the end of the afternoon
Gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM!
Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife
Ty and Matt caught bodies
Now they spend there life behind bars
Catchin' scars that will not heal
Niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real

[Chorus 1 1/2]

[outro:]

Like this
Like this, like that
Yeah! gotta carry the weight
Like this euh!
Bringin live
Yeah! yeah! like this
It's Xzibit
Gotta carry the weight
Like that yo!
Like that yo!"

The official representative, lac
This is phrophecy manifested by X to the Z
Victory, strike a B-Boy stance in khaki pants
Never get along like red and black ants, advance
When your staring and this concrete that move like liquid
Like a nigga withouth legs, I ain't tryin to kick it
To much to finish, a menace, without enought time
My mind only give punchline, you probably thinkin of the wrong kind
Cause if it jokes, nigga know
The kind that drop on your eyes, your ears,  your nose, and your throat
I promote self-defense not dollars and sense
Kick it with scholars and pimps, you just the last part over the fence
Assed out in the open, while you was hopin that Xzibit was second rate
But I refuse to make; just another record in the crate
I think not, got bee-bops
I bring it to your house like pizza

""Today we are on the streets of South Central Los Angelos, a fight for
Survival""

""We have people  that are conditioned not to expect to live past age thirty.
They no longer.  Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous. ""

[Verse Two:]

Stand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean
When I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines
Hit and decapatate the bird case, featherweight
Critical thinking, while you at water that concentrate
Xzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box em in
Seal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen
Xzibit run with a regiment of veterans
I only like to come out Late Night, like Dave Letterman
Time for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick
Callin me a hater cause I don't ride dicks
Read my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips
Love the sound of clips when I know my shit
Chamber Music,  this is for the ones with stone-face
That catch you at the right time in the wrong place
We unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice
Take  away your life like three strikes

Yeah, come on, Chamber Music

[Verse Three:]

So now Xzibit got a little money, I think it's funny
How motherfuckers think I'm supposed to Cher/share like Sonny
Clarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat
You don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique
Accomplish more in one day, than you can do in a week
The X-Man, Wolverine,  one swing to make the cut clean
And the wrong things manifested in flesh
Fuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class
Catch a roadrash, all you smell is hash
Chronic mix, bumpin the Liks
And dick you like a Hebron fix
Bear-arm from here to a hundred-tweny meters
Get black-walled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald
The assassin, brother who came blastin
Take it without askin, rappers is all fashion
Xzibit keep mashing through
Got any lost words? I got two
Drive up, on you like that!

Once again Chamber Music, what what, yeah, what the deal? It's Xzibit.

Get on the ground, get on the ground!
Hands on the back of your head, Don'
Move Don't Move!
Get on the ground!

walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
to heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger
Now I'm much older, lyrically clap mc's
If you don't know by now, let me acquaint you with my steez
(C'mon) I don't get on stage and waste your time
niggaz got a lot to say but they just can't rhyme
They just babies, I snatch em out they incubators
Attach them to respirators, they breathin hard like Darth Vader
Hard as candy and suck like Now or Laters
After a while your style's tasteless and it got no flavor

[Bahamadia]
Projects my eyesights to the heavens like dead or wise sages
Release what I hold sacred through my book of rhyme pages
Scripts be ageless, like scrolls from dead sea
The cadence off and on like the motion of Tai Chi
Ba-ha-ma-D, wor-dy, to Reflect, Eternally
Science to a remedy to help and get my people free, but
little support, got my thesis on freeze
My only option's doin bootlegs for the Japanese
Get about eight G's, a heavy buzz overseas
Sacrifice a pill to mainstream and do what I believe, cause
down to the chromosomes I'm a purist to this artform
Enlighten who I touch and let the world catch on

Oppose for the nine, how no content sections of the earth
Walkin vexed, out of my sticks, laced on every verse
My cells begin to peak at least a hundred thousand hertz
Meanin my joint's prevalent in Fat Beats and Footworks
I cater to these markets first, cause they gravitate to me
And appreciate the vision of what I do musically

[Talib Kweli]
Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm!!
I walked in and they stared, see how they screwin me
Break you down, til you ain't the man you used to be
Domination of my jurisdiction, people's addiction to lies
It blurs the lines between the fact and fiction
Now we back omission, I fix your face for you, keep yappin
You start to hate the man in the mirror like Michael Jackson

[Bahamadia]
Majors they try to hold me captive but mine are figure factions
But the foundation of hip-hop hold my braincells for ransom
I chance none, fuck them spots on charts and number one
If it's meant, then I'll accept it gracious when the time comes
This grassrooted curriculum, got me sprung like twisted ankles
Experience is missable, so I approach it from all angles and
inject some substance deep inside of rap's core
Takin emceein back to where it was before

[Talib Kweli]
Call us Liberty like the Bell of Philadelphia scenery
Me and Bahama-D, style free like Mumia need to be
Seein me, feelin me, we right here on the level
Turnin hardrocks to pebbles, exposin the devil
Lyrical olympian like John Carlos winnin gold medal
Take that bass out yyour voice you talk to me in treble
I'm ""Serious"" as Steady B so you know I ain't playin
I'm stimulatin, makin crowds move like organizations in Philly
Keep it positive, my prerogative is exercise
See through the chaos with my third eye
Word I exhibit the exquitiness, since a child I was vivid
Throw your hands in the air if you with it, dig it

Justine, 19, just got clean
Fresh outta rehab with self-esteem
She ain't felt this good in a while
A new leash on life, a vibrant thang, a beautiful smile
Used to run with a circle of friends, who was skeleton thin
Sniff white lines off powerful men
But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got class
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash
She ain't from money so she startin from scratch
It's hard working for scraps
It take everything she got not to relaspe
Locked down in 9 to 5, but at the 9 to 5
She get sexually harrased and chastised
Boss is a married man, she won't touch him
Frustrated angry man, she won't fuck him
She's out of her job, at Basket Cakes
Least it came wit an 8, 2 lines to the face
God Damn!

[Chorus:]
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it
niggaz will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it!
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it, yeah

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
He was on his own, at a very young age
When he learned from the streets, made everything change
See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin
I ain't talkin paper like Jigga or Dre
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit
Now his mother work for minimum pay
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun
In the streets, jackin niggaz for fun
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him
They found out where mom stayed and went steppin
The evil that men do, but still we continue
With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar, it's so cold

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
He was 13, brought up in Baghdad
Ate with his right and made money with his left hand
Prayed to the East, 5 times daily
His mother and father just had a new born baby
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith
Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor
He heard about the buildings on 9-11
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons
Now here come the you. S., to crush Saddam
Wit 88 thousand tons of missle and bombs
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... Damn

Concentrate, move that weight
Show me how you regulate
Hold up, wait, that shit's fake

Have you on the run goin state to state
Contemplate, demonstrate
Mind over mayhem, no mistakes
Lift some weights, eat some steaks

Bust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce
Of the dust kicked up, the dirt swept under the rug
Duct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders
Cue Kaze, ready to blaze and bakin soda
First learned how to cook in a coffee pot
Made the block get hot like lava rock
Got love for the block cause I came from that
But I ain't afraid to go right back {""break 'em off somethin""}

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
It's a, suicide it's a suicide
If you ever get the heart to try fuckin with mines
No change, I'm poppin the nine, you ridin the pine {""break 'em off somethin""}
The heavy metal knock you out of your mind {""break 'em off somethin""}
Now how many really gon' ride, when the war start?
Eaten alive by these hollow-tip darts
My 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light
The house party or the neighborhood park
Mr. X marks the spot then pops the mark
Turn your whole neighborhood to a parkin lot
I paid the cost to be the boss
And will do my time standin up 'til I get an appeal
These weapons too real to conceal, so why bother
Semper fidelis, I learned from my father
I always stay faithful to myself and grow
But when I catch that ass after the show - {""break 'em off somethin""}

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
I'm slick and slippery
On a high-speed chase all the way to the victory
Y'all niggaz is stone cold mysteries
Too weak, can't stand in the ring with me
Put a pussy back in his place, straightlaced
With a Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face
I run a race with the West to my back
While you're the reason why they say niggaz in the West can't rap
Ever since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched
A avalanche in the hood on attack
Just hardcore actual facts, never wait
Just react when them killers come at you with gats
Had to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track
Hittin laps, 'bout to widen the gap yo
It ain't the long fall from the top that got 'em
It was the sharp sudden stop at the bottom, haha {""break 'em off somethin""}

We survive when you thought we was finished and done
Lookin over my cold shoulder is attila the hun

Why fight for scraps, relax and take the whole plate witcha

So we gonna move on em quickly (what)
No chance to think about coming back
Chain smoke em, turn they lungs black
See I was raised to love black, but sometimes
Black folks wanna sweat you harder than the one-time
Never participate in dumb, def and blind shit
Plus I got my little man, so daily I'm reminded
The ride only gets rougher (right)
But I'll be damned if me and my niggas suffer
Smuggle this motherucker with the raw shit, I'm blessed wit
Lookin at the world, burned for the young and the desperate
Showed heart, but got cardiac arrested
More than a nigga with an image and a press kit
The wreck hits, creates desert land, desolate
The whole intent to rock the shit, keep the herb lit

Handle your business before your business handles you
Mister X to the Z (and Defari Herut), one two

Everyday I puts in down in la, hustle in this
Assassin lyricist, serious, muscle in this
I call the bets, I know we got coordinates on more games to wreck
We blaze shows, never no Half Step
Tactics, B-Boys, no games no antics
No false images, no bullshit semantics
We planned this, for hundred of thousands
Reignin/Rainin on they brains with lyrics, from the mountains
Don't contemplate what you can't even demostrate
Defari lottery draftpick, never the second rate
Nigga who wanna hate but front like it's all great
I gots no time for these emotional niggas, I gots to motivate
Moves to make, best rhyme straight
That's for the old school, this here's our year, it's time to elevate
Handle this, don't hesitate got money to make
Push maximum levels from the Golden State

[Chorus:]

[Defari Herut]

This combination's high calibre
Hatians stay amazed and confused like this was algebra
I'm scoutin the, best land for property
Never sloppily, picture someone stoppin me
From gettin mine, line after line
And you wonder why I call these fake niggas Miller
They think they Genuine; I'm startin to shine, imported Italian
With a custom made Herut charm as my medallion

[Xzibit]

Seem like, I recite the same prayer every night
Watch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight
And fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight
Till then, lick it to the chin, let it begin
We could break bread or break skin; and watch me send it
Try not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it
And my directions, suggest for your own protection
You motherfuckers keep it movin like an intersection

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate?  I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get
For tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
Cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child
It's like..

[Eminem]
.. everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
This clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch

This ain't business, this is personal BITCH
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit

[Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
Tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
Screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
""Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans
just for tryin to stand on his porch""
And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like ""Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs?  Okay, form a straight line!""
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
And climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you..
.. it's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you"

But never take the rucked out of the rhyme
Or tribalize, look into the eyes of the emotional
Your whole style is promotional
A dead giveaway to me is just another business day

My life, a tribute to the A. K,
You wanna play
A situation only one man can walk away from
The same way he came
When I spit flame, it spits flames like your middlename

Don't want a watch
With a diamond face
I wanna watch
Through a scope
Head shot
From a mile away
Ya head pop like jfk
Like a plot by the cia
We ain't dying
From the kkk
When that ak spray
They say ""ay bay bay""
Stay tuned watch
The melee play
Get attached
To the tracks
And the facts
Through the words
I say
Gotta navigate
Out my way
I'm a roadside ied
Detonating on live tv

All eyes on me
Now put your hands
Where my eyes can see

If I die
Before I wake
I pray the Lord
My soul to take
'Cause I have faith
And I can't wait
To get
These obstacles up
Outta my face
'Cause it's my time
And it's my grind
And not even midnight
Can stop my shine
Let me confront
The ultimate sin
You're ready to die
But I'm dying to live

The hustler's theme
Caught in between greed
And the best of things
I don't even breathe
Expand my chest
Fatigued
Benjamin green leaves
In a nest of thieves
I get down on my knees
And beg God
To forgive my sins
Back at it again
Raise up like Attica did
Shift down 4th to 5th
And burn like an arsonist
Westbound down pch
Catching nothing'
But green lights
My foot never touched
The brakes

Money makes
Move in Vegas
Shake Cali

Hater
Hack ya hard drive
And erase the data

With my creator
Bust back

Return the favor

You're ready to die
But I'm dying to live

What you know
About mass appeal?
I peel out
As I clutch the wheel
Death certificate
Signed and sealed
Take a journey
Down the road to glory
Pay attention
To a soldier's story
There will be none after
There was none before me
X-Man withstand the test
A thin line
Between life and death
Sometimes it sucks
When you find success
Lost friends
Never lost respect
Coming home
Like an Iraq vet
So now the time
And the place is set
It's been a long haul
Ready to go
Circle up
C'mon start the show
So I can breath
And achieve
The impossible
I want
The bootleggers
To get it

Of Xzibit
You never seen me
Crash and burn

Who ready
For a real solution?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Sometimes I'm my own worst ENEMY
With friends like y'all, the fuck needs ENEMIES?
I beat, I stab, I kill my ENEMIES
Refuse to let you waste my ENERGY

[Xzibit]
I heard they callin me a immigrant; well this motherfuckin immigrant
Came to yo' city and started runnin shit
X is like the government, taxin that ass
Been harassed to the point that I'm ready to blast
And spend the rest of my life behind metal and glass
Never seen a nigga move so fast, cut you in half
Sick of all these threats, these bitches with no action
Hog-tie, watch you die and start laughin
And no longer will I sit back and let you disrespect the fact
That we elevated West coast rap
And bring shit back to the point ""X"" is all that they checkin for
In the clubs, the streets, the shows and the record stores
What more can you ask for, eat your heart out
Fall out with bitch niggaz constantly callin my name out
I'm really not givin a fuck, you're pressin your luck
I'm a walkin warhead ready to self-destruct, so WHAT?!

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
My name feel like a slap in the face
My name feel like a gat in yo' waist
My name is all over the place
Erasin all misconceptions
I live my whole life with aggression bitch;
And I'm not stressin
Your words ain't workin I feel so much pressure
Padlock, chain around, neck no lesser
Sick of niggaz runnin they mouth
It don't take much to get knocked out, round these parts when I start
Shit full clips get emptied, revenge WE
Move like the Secret Service, I ain't nervous
I just wanna tell the truth.. the whole truth
When I'm on the stand explainin how I had to shoot
Absolute domination, extreme mutilation
No hesitation, I'm a movin violation
So don't get hit in the street
Used to have friends and family, now I got nothin but beef
WHAT THE FUCK?!?!

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
So-and-so hate me, blah-blah gon' get me
If I gotta go, y'all niggaz comin wit me
I'ma walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Cinderblock stock, shootin straight from the shoulder
Just too much shit in the air
Burn bridges you could never repair
I slap box with a bear
I can speak from experience, you speak from ignorance
I remove you, have your whole family feelin it
Y'all hate the fact that X-Man got hustle
""Man vs Machine,"" mind vs. muscle
I drop concoctions, you leave me no options
Have your bitch screamin out, ""SOMEBODY STOP HIM!!""
No more Mr. Nice Guy, I'm a tyrant
L.A.'s finest, Open Bar behind us
Don't look hard, it ain't too hard to find us
From here to infinity, FUCK MY ENEMIES!

Rule Number One
Always be aware of your surroundings
And peep all exits
Stay and move to the next shit
Rule Number Two
Love no one that don't love you
And if the shit come down
Then you know your way around
Rule Number Three
Realize it ain't about size
Or havin' gats and guns
Because it only takes one
Handle your business
Don't let your business handle you
It's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do
What you're doin' right here, right now
Same color, same style
Tryin' to claim worldwide
And ain't traveled but one mile
In these shoes, I paid dues
With nothin' to lose
Live by the rhyme
But I'ma die by the booze
Xzibit breakin' down niggas
Who got somethin' to prove
Here we are face to face
Nigga make your move
You're in the wrong place
But at the right situation
Cause i was waitin
Hotter than Satan, never perpetratin

I treat my enemies like friends
So I can reach out and touch
Leave'em in the dust at the very end
You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin
Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins
Animosity you can reach out and touch
Heavy right handed
Teeth grind like a clutch
And plus you ain't never had this much
Too many friends too close
You might collapse from an overdose

I was raised to never follow after no man
To be my own man
So I can die by my own hand
And never knowin' what the next day can bring
So I gotta make the ends
Justify the means
Yo, I'm on the scene, here to do my own thing
Can't never spend a lifetime
Chasin' after dreams
I got the right shit
For all the wrong reasons
As long as I breathin'
Niggas change like seasons
Never trust a man
Who can't look you in your eyes
Only the strong survive
And that's word to the wise
Yo, when dead bodies get outlined in chalk
Everybody should walk
Cause real killers don't talk
I ain't really concerned
How many bridges you burned
I extinguish your flame
And take aim at your brain
Givin' ligament pain
To have you walkin' with a cane
Wantin' money and fame
You got your fuckin' self to blame
And that's West Coast rhyme
Without no gimmicks
Here come Xzibit to break it down
Like a chemic
I'm spreadin' like an epidemic
And all good things come to an end
Enemies & Friends

[Chorus]

I don't give a fuck
About the set you claim
Xzibit easily dispersed like crack cocaine
See I lent my shotgun to Kurt Cobain
And the motherfucker never brought it back
Ahh, that's wack
As a matter of fact
This one nigga tried to jack
My squad had his ass
On the run like track
Never knowin' who to trust
In this shit called rap
Here to let you know
My sound surrounds like dat
Never half step
Or play the role like DeNiro
Y'all niggas wasn't down
When we had less than zero
Fuck tryin' to be a hero
Tryin' to save some bitch
Mr. X to the Z
Never play that shit

I remember underage drinking at sixteen,
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen,
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything.

My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat,
Fuck y’all dry, saw off and done rapidly.
Partner, now let’s be honest, ain’t got no good intentions,
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position.
But I’m a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass.
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out,
Picking the shit up where I left off,
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel,
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle,
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business,
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance.
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me,
And make that money stack higher than giraffes.

I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen,
I remember underage drinking at sixteen,
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen,
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything.

I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack
So it will leave no shells at the scene where I was getting my kid back.
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up,
On hard to make the west defined a united fund.
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck,
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California
Where people fake it ‘till they make it, or take it with their hand gun,
Take your chances, swing, try to land one.
Now you’re in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness
My symphony deliver something classic.
Either you ain’t glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it,
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity,
People keep telling me I’m about to catch a felony.
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back
Gave my girl a son and my last name.

I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen,
And I remember underage drinking at sixteen,
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen,
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything.

They’re talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion,
I’m saying you can’t knock me off the square that I stand in.
Nobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed,
‘cause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything.

Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in,
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in,
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything.

Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind,
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors
You mould them and lead them, fuck the positive message.
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you’re down to the essence,
There’s no payment for passage, my immaculate presence,
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me,
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy.

I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen,
I remember underage drinking at sixteen,

Can't preserve life 'cause the best wasn't thick enough

These are a few of my favorite things!
But I ain't Mary so ain't a damn thing poppin
Only death disease and a whole lota palm trees
Not only for mics, Xzibit is a way of life
Until my death so I celebrate success
Best of the best wouldn't test these waters with a yacht
Sendin' sixteen shots across your parking lot
All up on your proximity drinking Hennessy
Holdin down ground like the Statute of Liberty

I'm only comin' through when it's time for collection
Xzibit forever nasty, spread like infection
Ain't no protection ever made by man to withstand this punishment

Keep your eyes wide cause the style gets darker

'Cause if the price ain't right then it's time to take flight
Let the piece go twice to make sure you see the light
Plus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops
And flocks of females that only think with their croth
Unlimitted smoke
The bonified cut throat Columbian neck tie
Now don't you look fly
I'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother
Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover
No matter your backround Xzibit never backs down
Be prepared for static and semi automatics in your grill

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit

Xzibit here to rock the planet 'till the fat bitch sings
The shit is closer than you think
Don't blink it might be over in a matter of seconds
I'd like to say this off the record
But it's not
So I testify to the fact
Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact
It makes it real easy to trip
Unload the whole clip on your block then split!
Aint no answers to the test you taken
Never move fakin'
Can't be shaken'
From my solid foundation like this

Want you to think ahead, not just give me head
Want you to make a household baby, not just a bed

Where you needin to be, but believe you me
Baby girl they just gon' use you up, fuck you and bruise you up
They ain't got no family values they ain't gon' choose you up

And make everybody see
In order to {fight the powers that be}

Homeboy I ain't never gon let em take me under
I maintain with a mindframe to bring the rain and the thunder
Fast 5 days straight to meditate, build hunger
And focus(focus) on the days and times(focus) that approach us

[Verse 1]
Bad seeds is planted to grow large and toke us
Whatever is left will be eaten alive by the locusts
Hear me not, believe me later
You can feel the animosity through this Irwin Vega
A full clip to make this bullshit stop
I'm in the struggle to bring the underground to the top
Head lock, Las Angeles, home of the scandalous
And beautiful bitches, smell the aroma
Nothin but doja, the Likwit soldier
Quick to fold you in half, sit back and laugh at you
Xzibit standing firm ground like a stone statue
You ever have a .45 slug blown at you?
We unstoppable, so everything is possible

[Chorus]
Xzibit maintain focus till the casket drop
That's (focus) the only to survive and stay on top
Fast 5 days straight to meditate, build hunger
And focus(focus) on the days and times that approach us

[Verse 2]
Be on the lookout
Cause this year some niggas gettin took out
Takin off of the scene
Man versus machine
I live between a rock and a hard place
About face stand straight
This is General X
Dedicated to the critics that hope and pray
That some day I'll go soft
And try to swing with a gimmick and fall off
Runnin with dogs you can't call off
Isolate to eliminate
That's the mind state
Never violate
I make your whole chest dialate
Defeat my appetite to annhilate
I carry the weight from state to state
Spread the product
Tired of friends and relatives gettin shot up
It's time for some action like Redman and B-Real
Cause I can be a dead man if I stand still
Too close for comfort, I'm under the gun
Like a felon going back
I'm ready to crack
Making niggas role the credits and fade to black
Fade to black fade to black fade to black

[Chorus]

Yeah, everyday of my life
Got clear thinking, and everything stay tight
Drop bomb shit
Only bomb shit
Here come Xzibit to break it down like this

Xzibit,Foundation,/x/xzibit/foundation_20148102.html,"[Verse 1]

When I look you in your eyes I can see my own
Straight love manifested in flesh and bone
You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit
You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget
Hit back when hit
Use force that's effective
All these bitches and women
Son, please be selective
This is California can't stick your dick in everything
We will survive necessarily by any means
Let no man ever hold you down or supress you
It's the 90's the police just arrest you,
Disrespect you on occasion take life
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us
When your neck is on the line stand ground then bust
In God we trust but just incase keep it loaded and locked
Ready to rock
Then shake the spot
The Foundation

[Verse 2]

You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers
Who forever smoke bud
So it's probably in your blood
Realize you can only run the streets so long
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong
Same shit different day
It's the same ol' song
If the time ever comes that I meet my match
Take control of my assets
Fuck startin' from scratch
Take care of your mother
Keep yourself on track
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back
Beware of the serpent
Cause there's a time in life the mothafucker will strike
And try to make you loose sight
Don't be a fake mothafucker tryin' to keep shit real
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill
Son if you ever pull heat
Then use it
If you got a chance to walk away
Then do it
Total domination takes full concentration in all situations
A solid foundation

[Verse 3]

You are the foundation
Begining of a new generation
I remember hospital hallway pacin'
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine
Only to find that yours looked like mine
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time
In this life you can't press stop
Then press rewind
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind no man
Have your own plan, expand your mind
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs
This is nothing but love
Via sattelite Muggs
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife
Be prepared for the worst
But expect the best
No matter where life takes you
Come home to the West
Survival takes more than just gats and guns
That's words to live by
From a father to a son

(See look look)
I grab the mic and start breakin down niggas
Wit out no problem
Broadcastin live from the bottom/aint no mic checkin worse/
Kick some rhymes if you got/but if it's wack
I draw back the cap for the peelin
Should of stuck to rock dealin
Cuz it's the blood stealin/super vill..
Chill.. Stayin high like the ceilin
See there aint enough room for the both of us
See it's a showdown/throw down
Your best style I'll bust
(yo)I write rhymes that make niggas throw they sets up
Couldn't hold my style if you had a pair of handcuffs
In all disrespect
I'll snatch you by your neck
And do a suplex and step
So nigga you can check my credentials
Just hard rhymes and instrumentals
Xzhibit smash you wit a dental
And a loaded pistol
No longer lookin in the window
I'll bust a field wit indo
Killin quarts of beer
Sadie's outta here...

Verse Two: mc Breeze

Like a fuze/start spreadin the news
Its 94 and Breeze is givin niggas the blues
I paid my dues/and now it's time to go on to the next mode
Make room for the kaboom/cuz I'm about to explode
And drop bombs like a B1/cops I seize none
And niggas step up/I soak emcseason
3 seconds to detinate/you betta evacuate
No time to hesitate/you fuckin featherweight
I aint the type to pic up the mic
And catch the stage fright
I'll pull a gauge if I aint paid right
To the promoters on tour
Short me a buck and a buckshot and the barrel is yours!
I'm psycho pathic like Manson
Aint wit the dancin
But still I get more Cheers than Ted Danson
More dough than Marino or roles than Pacino
You beatin me? That's only in your dreams ho
I'm not sayin I'm unbeatable/I'm sayin I'm untouchable
Livin comfortable just like a Huxtable
Plus I'm rollin wit the cross roads
Movin fast foward/while you other suckas
Stuck in a pause mode
I goes deep like a great white
But I'm a stay black
No matter how high the pay stacks
Or if my rep gets bigger
You might get take this nigga out the ghetto
But not the ghetto out this nigga.....

Verse Three: J-Ro, Tash

For the balls basketballs
Microphones gassin grass(hey)
Some of the few things J-Ro likes to pass
93 mandingo/94 I'm the pharoah
Cuz I'm b-bbad to the bone marrow
I get wild
Wit more styles than the martial arts
I need weed
I roll more grass than golf carts
April 92 you no the Ro was a looter
Now I'm writin raps on my lab-top computer
J-Ro the tittie fiend/rap dean/wearin green
Been on the scene/since the age of 13
I learned I had to earn the mic
Now's my turn
I got Furious Styles like Larry Fishburne...

Wit da bitches tunin me in
Like it's the Young and the Restless
Next up to bust my shit
From the L-I-K-S's
Yes it's the freshest
Wit lyrics rough around the edges
I'll smoke you on the mic
Like a pack of Benson Hedges
But.. Hold up wait
I'll bust rhymes that'll circulate
That'll wake yo punk ass up like mc Eiht
Cuz I be rockin rhymes
Since the roof was on fire
So point me to the bitch who's the dopest butterflyer
I'll make her break it down like she Patra when I catch ya
Broadway is on the tables
While I throw these lyrica atcha
So.... Slow down before ya fuck wit my sound
You betta do the hokey pokey
And turn ya self around..."

Stickin 'em up at point blank range
They say the more things change, they stayin the same
I can't complain
Type of shit that make you wish you was dead
Make you bite the curb, a stomp down on the back of your head
Blow it out like a afro pick
Attract bitches like flies to shit
Pop pills and ride the dick
Niggaz can't swing this quick, I'm Dark McGwire
Bangin shit over the fence with Rottweiler
Listen, niggaz do anything for a dollar, even
Killin they own, let it be known, it's like

Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own

I'm pullin pistols if you don't break bread
Mr. Wrong Side of the Bed, only get excited for head
Now print this in your industry books
If it wasn't for crooks you niggaz'd still sport the Jordache look
Hit the switch, front to back, side to side
Natural born killers never let shit slide
Never rely on the next man to swing for you
A rock and a hard place, duck between the two
And y'all bitches just somethin to do, don't get it twisted
You're easy like Sunday mornin and shopliftin
It go simple as that, I'm never givin half to a rat
I'd rather bam to your face with a bat
You get tied down to the tracks
Used to make a living cookin coke to crack, now I can't turn back
This is holocaust rap nigga, overreact
And I'ma bring to yo' chest like an asthma attack, ya heard?

Veronica, she treated my dick like a harmonica
How you think I learned how to twist it and turn
Ya back until it's broke, make you feel it in your throat
It was Pamela, Linda, Keisha, Nicole
Had me fuckin while I was drivin on cruise control
Can't wait to get it home and teach it all to you
Look I'm just tryna be the best, I'm doin it all for you
You know that thing with the peanut butter
My Brooklyn bitch said fuck untyin the ropes,
It's faster with a box cutter
I know you love the way I'm diggin you out
But always wanna fuckin aruge so let's figure this out
I'm just tryna make you happy bitch
Who's there for you anytime you get in the mood for suckin a dick
I took the time out to find out what ya like
You bust fifteen nuts, wanna get up and fight
So look

You should thank of all the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin got me fuckin you right
Never took time to see it and plus
All you thinkin 'bout is yourself, I'm thinkin for us

It was Gina, Julie, Renee, Ty and Tammy
Made me spend some extra days in Miami
Candy, Trisha, Prescilla, Melissa
Showed X to the Z it's better with three
Who could fuck your ass better than me (pssst)
I think not, hard knock the cock, welcome to my sweat shop
I pick locks made by NFL, NBA, NHL, fuck all day
You could say I didn't do this shit
Unsatisfied bitches gotta go out and chase the dick
And that's just not the thing to do
So I learn new shit from the next bitch and teach it to you
Now don't you love it how I shove it baby (hell yeah)
When we be fuckin and we thuggin baby (hell yeah)
The way I hit it when I pump it baby (hell yeah)
And don't I spit it when I bust it baby (hell yeah)

I insist that we fuckin on videotape
Just incase a bitch lose face and try and call rape
If you know somethin that might excite up our late night
Got an open invite to lay us a pipe
Make ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight
I'll go from all night 'til the sun turn bright
Two wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat
(Pussy just a piece of meat, another means to eat)
Big Tray D told me that, as a matter of fact
You only tell me that you love me when you're flat on your back
You wanna leave me now bitch, my fuckin feelings is hurt
Why am I the only one that's tryna make this work

I wanna kill you for your land, I don't mean to kill the reactor.
Linking in Japan, I am here, got the gangsta for all your chain chains.
March to the heart beat of the city, 
You only hear the drums when they audace and they see me.
You know what time it is? Flavor with a thousand checks, it's like the ice ring surrounds my neck
I never worry about the referee, the gate keepers keep him locked for me.
Push all to shallow, forever, always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z, 
Fold it all for the money, can't team, where my gangstars at?
Hit the park, build at the car scene, blowing red everywhere, look how strong we are.
So there will be no war or shots, I'm about to give my city boiling hot and make 'em pray for real.
And make 'em say my name, lit up more smoke than a power water drill
Concentration, determination, the very thin line between paradise and incarceration.

Gangsters, gangsters, 
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming.
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I... 
Gangsters, gangsters, 
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am.

They say right before you day you get the irry feeling of peace, then walk into the light.
My soul want me take it without a fight, 
She says she wanna spend the whole life, but she only got me here for one night
Said it's time, better get it in. Call your best friend, I'm a call you wonder-twins.
Stop and go like red light traffic, innovation made it another classic, we made it happen.
And big hip hop want us gut cut, niggas dare too much than offence popped up.
Another game fucked up, 'cause the lanes clocked up, but the content sucks.
I wanna fill up some big red trucks, tour then through the whole world, motherfuckers lining up.
'Cause these tickets won't move like crap, you're tying west coast around my back
And y'all niggas saying fuck it with that.

Gangsters, gangsters, 
Gangsters, stand up and rap what you're claiming.
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I... 
Gangsters, gangsters, 
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am.

Can't even rely on your own eyes, everything fake now, toast to the bad guys
That will leave a whole class swimming with the fishes, 
Part machine, part skill, part intuition.
I cooked my first album in my father's kitchen, 
He told me how to make a living, twenty grand and half a chicken
Now I'm shitting on myself and still I let him know
That if he turn me in a turn around, it kill us both.
This is a cold world, but I'm a polar bear, 
Destroy the earth like a silver flare, best beware of us.
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front.
Caught there, they try to tear me down, 
I'm on a level now, I speak like I mean it, the focus study my literature.
Clean house, taking out the trash. I'm in the fly zone, where you past, gangsa?

Use control, put a cat in whole if he's broke
And let em know, I just wanna serve my time and go

Show her a monster's ball, fuck it you tell me
Platinum, heavy 22 inch perrelli's

Haters act like under-age hoes so what's really-
Can't fuck wit y'all, paging are. Kelly (ooooohhh)
Oh, if the shoe fits buy a matching shirt
Ya nothing take ya face and attach dirt
Catch me and my niggas wit strick-9
Strictly constrict 9 triggas disfigure ya figure

Bullshit so far what this game sent
We here to burn it down open bar entertainment
Taking the work clipping the clientele on raw
Lactose intolerant  but I still sell
Game enough to mash on the coach like Sprewell
Don't salt there hoes flows ain't got that sea smell
Overstand under surveillance, Ben Savage-
Can't come to the town terrorizing we been Laden
Been beat heavyweight beefs and went passage
Back to the blockmates and it's safe to unlock cakes

Feel the adrenaline, feel the rush
The effects of the compound the ammo dump
Doc Dre don't fuck with punks
We all thump like Maximus, stop fucking with us
Take a ride inside the home of hands-on hip-hop
Speak what you believe and hope you don't get shot for it
Ghetto poets, show it if you got one
A hot one, with ass and rap like a shotgun
I can write to the sound of the sunset
Smith & Wesson, I use words as a weapon
Gun sling my dreams I rain supreme
And fiend for the next challenge, knocking you off balance
Look, I been through the worst, avoided the hearst (Survived!)
Starving to death and dying of thirst (alive!)
Here in the flesh, elope with the profoc-
The answer, the solution, the remedy, the anecdote

Ain't a damn thing promised to ya
Except livin your life, and dyin one day, I'm just bein honest to ya
It take a whole lot, just to get a little
Gettin caught up in the middle the answer to life's riddles
Never, come that easy, but it was easy
To lead me, but it wasn't easy to see me
Get up off the block to the tv
And sell a couple million cd's, best believe me
You see these callouses on my soul?
Couldn't let hate and paralysis, take control
I pick you up when you down 'til I can't no mo'
My name sting in your mouth like canker sores
Been at war my whole life, sleepless nights
Endless fights, but still can't walk to the light
Cause my work ain't finished on earth, for what it's worth
From the cradle to the hearse, God and family first, for real

[Chorus: singer]
Somewhere in the heart of man (somewhere, within, somewhere)
There comes a time when he must understand (when he must understand)
The strong withstand, the weak will fall [repeat]
Cause tomorrow may not come at all [repeat]

[Xzibit]
Life ain't long, it's more like a snapshot
You can have the top, I live for the hop
Never take a day I'm breathin on this planet for granted
Time for change, time for growth, peace understandin
See but niggaz keep forcin my hand, disturbin my plans
Bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man
It's like tryin to build a house on sand; you never get
A solid foundation, one man can change the nation
Yo I put that on all creation; Haitian, Jamaican
African, Asian, Caucausian, Indian
Whatever your persuasion, this is the message
Time is of essence especially when you're countin your blessings
Lessons learned from the deepest of pain, it's not a game
Keep my name outta your mouth and I'ma keep it the same, ya dig?
It's a shame, graduated to the rap game
Only to find out crack and rap was the same thang, damn!!

[Chorus:]

[Xzibit]
Who got skill?  Who got hustle?
Who got they family with 'em?  Who pay for they muscle?
Yo it's all gon' come out in the wash, the lost angel
With dirty wings, bullets ricochet off my halo
I lay low for no one, I love my life
Ain't afraid of no hard work and sacrifice
Was born twice through the life of my seed
Makin sure he see a side of life, I was never able to see
Hittin home like ""Ground Zero,"" move over now
Peace to the real heroes, still underground
I put it down for the homies that came that's hard in the paint
I'm livin proof it's never to late, you straight
Once in a while I go back to the main strip
And see the same niggaz still doin the same shit
And all I can do is increase the flow
Put it out, let it soak in, and hope they grow, c'mon

Got to hit some corners, I'm ridin the cane
Wanna ride out to a island, and tan your frame

Gettin' high as a kite
Proceed to rolll the light
It's real tight
In a paper philly blunts i don't need
It might fuck off the taste
Of this bomb ass weed
My nigga tango and breeze
Came thru we blaze a few
Together bored as fuck
Niggas down for whatever
Break left from the bomb
Phone call from ron hightower
Shower at his crib in a hour
All the women involved drop drawers
Don't say nothin'
Just a lota nuttin'
Fuckin' plus dick suckin'
Goddamn who was that?
Half black with the fat ass
Too much to ask if you can put them on the glass

With minimal conversation
No time wastin'
Only hard penetration
Gettin' shiners on recliners
Cummin' in your faces
Stop! get on top
I take your mind different places
Won't be satisfied till i hit every race
Color and creed in deed
All i need is weed a fly steez
Who ain't afraid to take the lead
A little dirt on your knees
Looked over saw breeze
Laid out on the couch about to let it all out

I live a luxurious life
And I'm respected in this game
Cause I do's the same

Let me spit you something for a second
Cause I see y'all ain't been peeping out my record
I see ladies, I see players, and I see haters

Chopping game, while my diamond's swinging
Banking off my gold chain

Darkness was paved

Then we've got it made

Money ain't everything dog, but I tell ya
If I didn't have it, i'd be labelled as a felon

Keep god first in my life, I know that's right

Let a homie get his sang on, instead of his bang on

Be down, but I had to make a dash

From his homies in the pen, to his balling friends

Measure your height and your weight to break your neck with your hand
Sometimes they use a shore drop or they use a crane
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain
But if the calculations ain’t correct when the rope’s set
The rope will rip the head right off the motherfucker’s neck
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows
With a vendetta beetle who wanna battle
Man you gon’ get whipped in flaw shackle to an A-frame
Beaten full force until you can’t repeat your own name
Till you smell the smell of burn and flesh
Keep you alive until you pray for death
Drawn in the corner disembowel until there’s nothing left
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death
Li chin translated this the leader in death
A rubber tie filled with gas around your arms and chest
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess
Ask the AT about the south african necklace
Go ahead and pick your poison it was coming to you
Call me the prison bull I came to fucking kill you

Have must I come through merciless
Be quick with that bullshit you heard of
Uncut mole what have we ride through
And always remember that death will come off swift wings
Anyone who run contested now know have we now picked you whatever
I came to peel

Hands behind your back shackled then I forced you to kneel
Shoot you in the back of the head send your family the bill
For what the bullets cost I’m on my China shit
Eye for an eye waterboard you like my government
Impaled and left at the front gates
Used to hear the sound of broken arms rib and leg makes
Whipping and pull apart call it the breaking wheel
By inquisition espanish mi corazon is free
No compassion don’t expect it when I fucking see you
Lethal injections is my profession loading up my neddles
My iron maiden the caucasian the asian
The information received by the ancient art of persuasion
I’m ’bout to drop like a guillotine
The cut is quick and clean I promise you won’t feel a thing
I’ll never kiss the ring

Get him on the phone, hurry up 'cause I ain't tryin to get stuck

Reminds me I gotta shake the spot
I got b****es in the hotel room ready for me to bang cop wait
Yo, who is that man?

That's when I shoulda got the heater
But I was too busy in the kitchen countin' money 
And takin' shots of Tequila
Started countin out twelve when it hit me with gallons of seman
If you was Rocksteady, you woulda came when the C-Note's rang
Before I could yell out to lock the front
N****s rushed in the front door with the gauge, ready, duck
Bad enough I'm caught up in it, jacked
I'm caught in the kitchen without the strap

Woulda killed Terminators only D between us 
Is a stove and a refrigerator
Came in and put the gauge to my chest
Took the money off the table 
And said (""Yo, where's the rest of it n****?"")
You gotta love it, came straight to the moneyman
Twenty thousand cash, neatly stacked, wrapped in rubber bands
Snatched the whole s*** and broke out
I ran to the living room and got the heat from under the couch
Smashed out to the middle of the street started blastin'
Dumpin' at the getaway car but they was mashin'
I thought I heard the homies just in time for the action
Police hit the corner with they reds and white's flashin
These n****s rolled off with at least a cool fifty
Ya, I'm in handcuffs on the ground and mad 'cause the K-9 bit me
Shipped me off downtown for the bookin'
Threw my herb sack when the cops wasn't lookin'
Fingerprints, hold the tape, hear come detectors
One at the door, another one askin' questions
Stupid s*** like  ""Who was I shootin' at?""
Was it gang related and where do they kick it at?
But I didn't say s*** I can tell from all the people involved 
It was an inside job
But I'm the wrong n**** to rob, I'll hunt you down
F*** the money, I'll take you off and accept the loss
Set bail at fifteen g's, no sweat
Got cars slippin tonight, and almost got wet

That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go
All my people fightin for they soul, you are not alone
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit
Dump like a L. A. P. D. Cop, over kill shit
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit
You know that young shit, the ""Hey nigga where you from"" shit
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand
Let's part ways and, then pray for better days
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to say

Too late to apologize kiss my ass

Got to keep your hands up homie protect yo'self
Stop fucking with the West nigga respect yo'self

I know you're fed up, feel like you can't get up
Have faith, stay strong, keep your head up
Yo, it only gets worse; we in a world
Where your status and your bank account determine your worth
There's no time to rehearse, the clock been tickin
Cause we all started dyin at birth, I speak the truth and it hurts
It felt like I was dyin of thirst
'til I was blessed with my voice, I move mountains with verse
The worst thing you ever seen in your life, ""The Passion of Christ""
Pregnant chicks buyin rock, hittin the pipe
It ain't like I ain't tried to tell ya; misery love company
Keepin the wrong company brings failure
Cause people use people like paraphenalia
With a scam, with a scheme, with a dream to sell ya

Niggaz be fake, they speak what they can't create (create)
You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame
One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff
I was only 15, tryin to pass that rock
Never got caught, just sat down, collected my thoughts
This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat
I'm just another nigga sellin some coke, y'know?
Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote
My callin for ballin wasn't pedalin dope

Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words
Your words become actions when the bullshit happens
Keep laughin, that's when the gauge start clackin
Feel the buckshots smackin have your body mismatchin
Yo, I feel the devil tryin to force my hand
Steady bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man
See I was born to be all that I can, without a Uncle named Sam
As you can see we just a part of his plan
Cause first there was a war on blacks
And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in Iraq, c'mon

Xzibit got it going on.
{Xzibit} Spittin' at 'em.  Yeah, like a automatic philly.

[Saukrates]
Yo, revolutionary, evolutionary
Bulldozer, leave y'all with troops to bury
Clean sweep if ya smell fear in these mean streets
It's instinct, life's a bitch and she's far from cheap
I got love for my dogs hustling for defeats
Put it down for this paper, increase the real
Come wit it, run wit it, fuck wit it
Big Sauk to shock your mind and your spirits
Taste these lyrics while I spit truth on tape
Whether two inch, a DAT, or D-A-T-A
I impregnate WAX, so get mine regardless
Of anybody's set, I'm starving the artist
Who's next to me? The X to Z
Together we bomb MCs with text debris
Leaving y'all hard pressed to breath

Looking for props
How you explain to nigga drinking beer to the bottom that they can't come up
Mother fucker say what?
Stack loot so much, reach out and touch you probably die from the paper cuts
I see you lazy fucks, sceming on the speed demon
Keep on dreaming, give me any type of reason
To stop your breathing, yeah it' me against the world
'Cause the eyes deceiving, anybody want to bet me

Meet a bitch who ain't hard stick like Wayne Gretzky
Look I try to live where the Lolos and the sets be
I still roll dolo, how a normal nigga test me
I let you have it in the face trying to waste me
Your homies can't face me 'cause they scared for their own safety

Feel the rush, feel the adrenaline

Yo, take that, take that, nigga stay back
With that fake rap, break that 'fore cats react
To your shallow ass shit, go practice
Saukrates never making wack shit, trust me son
If I'm eating, my dogs eating
Use experience for teaching without preaching
Each, and everyday I be thinking about my future
Preparing for the new world we ain't used to
Handle that, with supreme caution
Peep this mental distortion
Hitting you with grips of funk by the portions
Consulting with killers could lead to abortion
Face down in a closed coffin, WHAT!

You are now tuned in to the ultimate sounds.. of Dr. Dre
You know what time it is!
Xzibit steps up to the mic
Layin down the hard-core, real raw, underground
My name is KRS-One, and it's REAL!!

[Xzibit]
Well it's me, down with D-R-E
X to the Z rocks any party
Rocks the beats, and the breaks
Rocks the cocks off the whores in the place
Cause suckers shake, while I'm creatin
They get together and they start to hatin
How can we take him out one time
Cause he brought back the West with the freshest rhymes
I might go first, and he'll go second
I'll wreck 'em, deck 'em, set it, just checkin your mic
Droppin hot shit I like
So throw up your hands bitch, run your ice
Cause I'll go third, and he'll go fourth
By the fifth eat shit, you'll step off
Six is your beatdown, your title is seven
Takin out your four man crew makes eleven
By the twelveth I go for self
Rockin L.A. like no one else..
You can check any rapper from the underground scene
But few have dropped hot shit and seen green
Some have dope twelve inches, count 'em
But not many niggaz have slammin albums
X to the Z rocks consistantly
I'm ""Criminal Minded"" so don't fuck with me
Why?  Well that's my secret baby
I don't take shit, so fuck you, pay me
So you can call me, a public servant
Not a king but a teacher I believe I've earned it
So I just walk, or ride my bike
And bust on the +Up In Smoke+ stage tonight
Give me a chance and I'll rock the house
But let a motherfucker try to take me out
Cause male or female, I will strangle
If it's a label, they have to untangle
Adidas, chains, jerseys, braids
Bandanas hangin off the end of my gauge
Step right up if that's what you like
But watch your bitch, I catch hoes like a dyke
In the night at a height right for flight
Way out of sight, you bite, I recite
My chain shine bright, plus my kicks stay white
As your faggot CEO say, ""Well alright!""
.. I am your mentor
History is mine, it's time you surrender motherfuckers
And just back up quickly
Your style is sickly but you persist to get me
Or outwit me with the style that I created
Years ago when I was sellin powder to the hoes
Oh, all of a sudden you don't know
Or can't remember can't recall can't bring to mind
That rhyme that place do not chase
I run a marathon a race of rhymes in your FACE
In case you hate I won't write no tough rap
Fuck with me get your whole FAMILY kidnapped

[KRS-One]
Yo Xzibit!  Show these motherfuckers man!
I don't think they understand this shit!
Break this shit over they backs!

[Xzibit]
I don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo
I only grab a nine to bust holes in your crew
I deny your existence as artists
You puttin out a record expectin to chart but it's weak
But when you speak through the microphone
You fail to realize, nope, you're not alone on the earth
The light comes forth cause Mr. X
Intelligence, smoke and guns manifest in the flesh
I snatch the mic and get hype
Behave, before you make the news front page
Headed for the grave and the wake
So save your microscopic miniature small talk and WALK
And put a little pep in your step
X to the Z will destroy any motherfuckin rep-utation
In the nation, in creation
All you assholes in ANY occupation
Like rappers with nothin to say
I CRUSH 'EM like chronic and then smoke 'em with Dre
Cause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather
Gather together and splatter
Whatever egotistic bullshit, the game is over
When you push the record but don't push the culture

[KRS-One]
Breakin, emceein, graffiti art, deejayin, beatboxin
Yo Xzibit, keep rockin!

[Xzibit]
Just throw your hands in the sky
Still believe real niggaz never die
And if you in this life just gettin by
Somebody say, ""I'm high!""

I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

For we are the same should be laughed at
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, 'cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so christian I'm so muslim
Super size on your mom trigger get push up
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off

From decorating your face all over the building
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong

[Verse 3:]
Have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from every once came
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive

[Verse 4]
Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out
And I just sold out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we be on that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down

I'm sorry I met you

Hit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate

Traffic contraband, yeah banned through the interstate
Got a sick flow - didn't know? Let me demonstrate
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate
The left hand lands and the right hand devastates
Half part of your face replaced with a metal plate

Legends never…

[Verse:]
Ever since the day I got a room
They told me I would never make it this long
Now years after the day that I’m gone
They’ll be playing my songs and my name will live on
When everybody thought that I was insane
I stood tall after all that have came
So let the good Lord call on my name
‘Cause I done rep I’m workin the game

[Hook:]
We never die
Never die!
We just live on
Live on, live on
We never die
Never die!
We just live on

[Verse:]
Yea, I’m a cowboy steppin clear
With a pistol pointblank behind your right ear
Yea because fear is not a option
Say my name 3 times – I appear with a shotgun
Now what you motherfuckers want from me?
I’m from the gutter, I’m medicated by drug money
Take everything, there ain’t nothing else you could take from me
Never break from you niggas, swinging until my hands bloody
Time flies, dreams die, people lose faith
Tryna hide behind a lie with a straight face
Buzz kill, boots on the ground ‘cause I’m straight lace
Fuck love, never needed love in the first place

[Hook:]
Legends never… die…
Never die!
We just live on
Live on, live on
We never die
Never die!
We just live on

[Verse:]
So many doubted so little time
So many haters coming to mind
Later for waste ‘cause moments to bind
Because I would never look back and regretted this fuckin life
Around, I do it for the ones who supported the dream
And making every second of their life as a part of my team
It take the heart of a lion, the crown of a king
Bring up a throne and you keep the frame in mind but you singing my songs
Still serial kill the bullshit, spit up the thrills
And if you will, you’re not the killer, for real I be dealin
The run of the mill, with no skill, top Billy the dun
That’s why I reply

[Hook:]
Legends never… die…
Never die!
We just live on
Live on, live on
We never die
Never die!
We just live on

[Verse:]
Yea, I was born to live forever
I am legend, gather my thoughts and line em up together
Feel like bullet my own Beretta put it to my head
Better days ahead, left for dead with my daily bread
Yea, I’ll cause a slaughter in your tabernacle
I stole your castle and guillotined your queen
Los Angeles to the bite in apple
I’m playing tackle
Get it, the crush s cold like going to war with the Russians
Starving like my ribs and my stomach is touching
I’m filthy as a pig, got me streaking and fuckin
It’s just my destiny til the death of me, stand and deliver
Confessions of an unapologetic serial killer

Stormy weather rain liquid

Break necks bounce with it when I spit it
Knockin this jam is a form of calastenics
Let it knock when you mashin down the block
Rims spank with the car wash
Watch the bitches stop
An look, always stay five steps ahead
Hard at work, while you tricks lay in bed
Dead to the world but ?Hayru? he be the sun
Always burnin, 'cuz my job is never done
Run from one time I rather dump an AK

Maintain do your thang this too shall pass

Let me tell you about this bitch ass half c*** pussy ass niggers
It's never gonna pull the trigger to protect no figures
Never seen a hard time in your life beating the shit out of your kids and your wife
'Cause what you lack in a fight
That we all fight similar self aided mutilation
Never lost angel Los Angeles congratulations
From admiration to aggravation to the highest level
Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart cold and in gut metal I didn't survive at all
Praying for my downfall got the fuck from around y'all
Know when niggas bringing me down even include myself
I celebrate life for nobody else
Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health
Memento tried in stealth
'Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fail for the dollar
Now watch Xzibit rise to power
I turn these 15 minutes to hours
But still ask

[Hook:]
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I don't know, I don't know
All I know is when I grab the microphone and let me up on this stage
Grand arsony 'cause I'm still in the show
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

[Verse]
Let me tell why you these hypocrites and half wits
Caught up into politics
Worked yourself to death but uncle Sammy is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology surveillance’s a bitch
And everyone one of us some of us got no heart or no back bone
The few will see freedom while most of the masses will conform
The woman you lust for is usually not the one to stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for em attacking the land lords
Cuz the shit too high we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die may it not be in vain more
Importantly more to see keep it cracking orderly
Got my future in front of me focus is fucking phenomenal
Nobody can touch us I turn the impossible possible with it
Do me a favor man do not try to tell me shit
It's just me and my bitch

[Hook:]
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I don't know, I don't know
All I know is when I grab the microphone and let me up on this stage

[Shilo Harris]
When I was injured I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears my nose and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children
That was a lot of my motivation because I knew the way that they were looking at me
I had to get stronger I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard

[Verse]
Let me tell you about these long days of sleepless nights
Penny pension trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on into your destiny and set the stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live out loud make it no regrets
This for the set this for the ones that never waken up
Living a fantasy insanity is fake as fuck
They out of touch they out of line it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains misery eventually found the fountain of youth
It's been pissed in, shit in violated till they pollute
That's why they shoot have your ass in a box dressed in a suit
'Bout time you got in touch with your roots

[Hook:]
What's the meaning of like, what's the meaning of life
Man I don't know, I don't know
All I know is when I grab the microphone and let me up on this stage

Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya

[Shilo Harris]
The best help that you can do is help yourself
You gotta step up you gotta find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it because you know you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in the road
Yeah you're gonna be stuck in that bad place it's depressing
And holding you back
The only person that can set you free is yourself"

Where I don't think about you (yeah)
This for my mother, Rest In Peace (uh)
To you and yours (yeah) Ride with me (uh)

[Verse 1]
I know you watching me, guiding me
I know from up there it's like you watching 'Menace to Society'
Listen you was thirty-two I was only nine
But I've learned so much with so little time
Now I'm surrounded by the best of my kind
We put it all together, couldn't waist your pearls on Swine ma
You taught me better
You can't protect me or expect me to not struggle n fight
Cause see death is a part of life
What I wouldn't give for 1 more day wit you
One last embrace n face to face wit you
Explain everything that made me what I am a grown man
From the ground up with my own hands
Will I forget you? Neva
Down right angry sometimes that we ain't here together
You can feel your roots and see how strong we are
Who would've thought we could get this far, damn I miss you

[Chorus: Andre Wilson]
Even though I know it's been tough
I can't stress enough no matter what - mama I love you
You've always been there by my side
You've taught the wrong from the right - mama I love you

[Verse 2]
Yesterday was you fifty-ninth birthday
Time flew missing you in the worst way
I still feel the same pain since the first day
You left through death on God's request
I can't complain through the year's mama I've been stressed
Through them bullets and the bad times I've been blessed
For the times that I fail but I tried my best
Able to do for my loved one's, real success
Your the source of my strength I was blessed with your gifts
Your insights, your wisdom, your penmanship
Fun n games, I'm doing thangs, I know you wouldn't agree with
What I drink, what I smoke, who I be with
You made sure I got some love when there wasn't none
Opened up my heart showed the world where I'm coming from
Your little grandson is just like your little boy
Mama what you built here no man can ever destroy, your bundle of joy
I've been through so much
I lose touch and sometimes I feel that life sucks
My women try to get close I push here away
She wanna talk I just sit there with nothing to say
Feel me it's all the pain I contain on the inside
You in the right place but left me at the wrong time
Use to cook, clean, and sing me to sleep
Now I only go to bed with my heat, damn I miss you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The school of hard knocks where I learned life's lessons
With not enough answers and too many questions
When you had me you gave birth to a soldier
Now I'm much older now the world much colder
Our lives in the hands of politicians that don't care
We ponds in the game biological warfare
The family's so spread out n disconnected
Trying to hold things together put my soul on records
It's hard; you know your daughter had a baby too
A beautiful baby girl just another little piece of you
Another branch we can add to the family tree
Responsibility bringing out the man in me
You ain't a man if your not taking care of home
Raise and protect my own, until they full-grown
No matter how much these streets try to change me
I'm never 'gon forget how you raised me
I Love You, Forever.

Maybe it's time I change religions on you turning christians
To a muslin, turn a buddhist to a christian
Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it
Sipping red wine inside the pentagon
Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lee got the world watching espn
My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians
I'm a sick fucking psychotic master
The mic is my sword the booth is your casket
I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet
Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit
Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes
Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth

They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My po already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
62 minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on 20 fours pedal to the floor
100 shots of that nigga still got plenty more
Slim the mobster am I is really made uzzi

Blocked off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me

Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games,
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada, the dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo Dicaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X

[Verse 4]
Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
'Cause I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me 'cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking a lot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the american eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars, thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie

Yo - who hold guns and rock ice bigger than life;
Got bitches throwin they drawers on stage - that ain't me!
I raise kids, push whips, piss an mc
Love money like I love my moms
Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets
Wall to wall bullshit I got hardwood floors
Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine
So y'all are fuckin the same hoes who used to be mine

[Tash]
And I've been waitin three summers to rhyme longside my people
Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal
Dose of hop-hippin if you thought Catash was slippin
Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sippin
Catash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

[Xzibit]
Yo you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist - how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew
Yo get rid of the niggaz before the same thing happen to you

[Pos]
And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue
Blood leakin out, girls freakin out, motherfuckin cops tweakin out
Got you on your knees like a freak, jugglin deez nuts
Smugglin these cuts from S. C., you best be-
-lieve there's no web or leave a net
We done swallowed 40 bottles of threat, yo

Chorus: all together

What you know about my writes? (my writes)
What you know about what's weak, what's tight?
And what you know about an off night? (uhh)
What you know about niggaz frontin for the light?
And what you know about them gun fights? (gun fights)
Got a nigga duckin while them girls show fright
What you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

[Xzibit]
Yeah, yeah, look
I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor
The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol
My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fuckin shots I called
My niggaz gotta ball, never settle for less
Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts
Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll somethin
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole somethin

[Pos]
Yo these style I kick should be called?? Rap
Drawin the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet (shhhhh)
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L. A.
With connectin flights to rip it elsewhere

[J-Ro]
Drinkin up Black & Tan in the back of a van
I learned as a young man - long trip, piss in a can
Gettin a house for two grand, now you got your own land
Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan
Ro-Gram is rare earth, swingin Black Tarzan
You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand
Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand
And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

[Dove]
I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty)
Dirty like Uncle Red; aiyyo, (??) (??)
Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo
Dirt you dishin out, chef tellin it all
Face down in the dirt, doin my dirty work
Expert, tryin to regulate my network
Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it
If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it

Chorus with minor variations

[Tash]
And I've been known to get it on, past the break of the dawn
Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave ""Potholes in Yo' Lawn""
(C'mon!) You makin diss songs?  Spit that rhyme my way
I can shut y'all niggaz down like the Y-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggaz coincide
(""Right-right-right.."") The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album goin classic

[J-Ro]
This is for the dj, bring it back one time
I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme
I'm - old school like my dad is
So add this, to your collect', Plug Won - who the baddest?

[Pos]
Aiyyo we theme park status, upstage these niggaz like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blamin they legs, while I'm claimin these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

[Xzibit]
Yeah - we flat out classic, seperate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is makin sure that Hollywood burn,
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggaz
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

[J-Ro]
Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back
De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that
And what you know about us droppin ya
And leavin you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?

Xzibit,Napalm,/x/xzibit/napalm_21047793.html,"[Verse:]
Yeah, you thought that this was over
Thought you got away with murder
Watch me murder my deserters
This is congress secret service
Got your epirdermis calling
From the toxins in the water
Use the oxygen to slaughter
This is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits
Still suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch
Now it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance
Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch

[Hook:]
I'm okay now, bring the napalm
I'll fly over and blow you away
No more sunshine, no more playgrounds
I'll fly over and blow you away now
There's no glamour, no guts, no glory
When I fly over, and blow you away
Blow you away now
The fuck can you say now?
I'm loading my napalm

[Verse 2:]
The last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go
Camouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo
Hiv, Polio, positive identity
Ashes of evil because we can't believe the trinity
Homeland Security, false is superiority
Fuck your intentions and big plans for my community
I ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?
I'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I just wanted to live my life like the common man
Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends
Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right
Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights
And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all
Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn
I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Average for an arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse
The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite
All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments
The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious
This is for the populous, population genocide
Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize
Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise
When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind
But hey, hey

Yo, look at the way you reactin
I ain't on the microphone actin tough-actin like Tinactin
Madden, dreamin like baddened Aladdin
Families they get saddened, sisters no horror be cabbin stabbin
Jammin like Isley when I be
Floatin rhymes like a butterfly, stingin em like a bee
IBM's is not computers
Intelligent Black Men radio polluters and riot looters if any
Plenty of patience perseverance, persistance
And I don't need a county check for government assistance
Build the knowledge without college abolish like aparthied
Rip like a riptide, when I arrive
Million Man March, Washington D, C me when I get there
Pioneer millionair thoughts we all share

In Los Angeles, niggaz stopped tryin to make peace a long time ago
So it ain't no shock, to hear gunshots, on your block
or maybe even mine on occasion
Regardless of your town, niggaz still tore down and blast
So Xzybit ask what's worse
To getting rushed by the cops or put your piece down first, you're stuck
See either way we've been set up to fail
Throw that nigga in jail if he ain't tryin to see Yale or Harvard
or Howard, and I reguse to be a coward
Or forced to live off some five twenty-five an hour bullshit
Xzybit carry on like my brothers did
Handguns and girls hell in hands on and other shit

Chorus: repeat 2X

I don't need nobody, to give me a damn thing
Just open up the door, and I get it myself

Verse Two: Snaggle Puss

Aiyyo the cream of the land has arrived
I got with four hundred lashes and still survived
To this very day, the grafted never let up
So I got a million brothers, and we all fed up
With corruption, that's why we on this mission
To bring equality into the justice system
At any cost, I'm down for what it takes
Now cause when the rioting starts it's too late
So let em drown in my ancestor's blood sweat and tears
They fear, knowledge cause it cuts like a spear
And yeah, we comin like bats out of hell
Cause that's what it's like in the ghettoes we dwell
No laughs, you might be the next in the bloodbath
So compare what you got, to what you sposed to have
The end result is we all gettin cheated
Snaggle Puss, etched in stone, so you can read it

Chorus

Verse Three: J-Ro, Tash

To all my black folk here's some liquid lettered soap
I'm down for the upstroke, I'm tired of bein broke
I feel like I'm in the gutter, word to the mudder
Bruddah, I gotta introduce my ends to each other
The facts about black is, nobody relaxes
And those with stacks is like, fuck payin taxes
I drink the cheap wine cause I not be got'en yapes
Thunderbird and Nighttrain made from the rotten grapes
Dance boy, sing boy, run boy, rap
We'd all be rich if it was boy bust a cap
I gotta watch my back cause sometimes we do stupid shit
I can't even afford a gun to go and shoot you with
I spit on the graves of those who held my people as slaves
I catch your children slippin on the waves
I gotta stay strong, even though the stress is stickin me
I try to get a job but Mickey D ain't even pickin me

While simultaneous I'm bustin with my niggaz just for practice
Cause I see it in my sight to clock a million after taxes
And I know I'm bout to have it cause I know I deserve
Cause I could get you with the bullets but I stick you with words
That'll slit you at the seams my shit is Wilder than Jean
Tash'll eat you like a bowl of fuckin Product 19
Cause Vitamins and C give me wind to do you in
So y'all niggaz got from now until I count backwards from ten
So scram, cause before you get a chance to say (Daaam!)
I'll be on you like the neighborhood watch program
Cause I'm tryin to make the slams that'll bust your Cerwin-Vegas
Cause niggaz think life is smokin blunts and playin Sega
But not I, I make it so you can't fuck with this
Cause I want a new car, plus a pound just to twist
So get up and get out, get a pen write a verse nigga
Do what you gotta do, but yo motherfuck the first

Black man were comin' torward you
What would you be feeling?

[Scared man: ]
Just one single black man? (yeah)
I really don't fear that
You know but if it's a group I'm talking from age thirt
Even thirteen even younger than
Thirteen. Yes I will walk across the street.

Well let me ask you this...

Yo we gettiin' restless me and D. O. G. S
Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message
Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump
I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump
Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage
It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit mc
Bombin' first cause I feel it's better to give then receive
You better believe
Xzibit stays savage above the average
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage
But see all that irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate
I dance with the devil for the hell of it
Burning down your lavish lanndscape on digital tape
Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake
So make room for the legitamate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

[Hook:]

[Montageone:]
niggas we null and void I get swole like a keyloid
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure
So open up your door to me Cause if it's closed
I'm a brakin' in with some pantyhose
Over the mic
So you don't know who I sound like
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight
It's not permitted by the right
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a
Van
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate
I spit on the mic to get these mc's pussys wet
For those with plans to clone me thee original
It can't be done I'm digital (digital)

[Hook:]

[Xzibit:]
Yo who wanna come see the hard rock?
The non stop green block yo whole block recieve speed knot
You need not
Get brave my bullets never graze
They hit close to home seperating flesh from bone
So better get off on your own bitch
Rollin' chrome shit tryin't to own shit
I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer
The author of my own destiny
So I suggest you stop stressin' me
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake
So make room for the legitamate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

For baaaiiilll....

I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... Bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggaz sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. My clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggaz have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8: 30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, ""NOT GUILTY!!!""

[Chorus:]

[Xzibit]
They used to have me on that paperwork
'cause I used make my paper.. Work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with. 40 caliber glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
'Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggaz is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[Chorus:]

[The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house 'cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggaz down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast

[Verse One]

Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while
Xzibit stay versitile
With Million Dollar lifestyle
And I can feel it as a child growin' up
The niggaz that were real and the niggaz that were scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin shit
It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin with
I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof ticket
nigga you make a gang of noise and never seem like a cricket
I guess that's why we never kick it
A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin to fuck with the liquid
How many niggaz do you know like this?
Also claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch
It don't make sense
Either you're a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryin to play the part
Like dat

It's a shame
niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
extra large
It's a shame
niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame

[Verse Two]

I don't need no lights no cameras
Just action god dammit
Never no superstar
I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
A merchant from the fog with my fucked up dialogue
Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck
Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous
Big Bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, Vandelous
Yo, not to be trusted
So how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard
I'm pulling that card and sayin Gin muthafuckar
Flowin like liquid, soak it in muthafuckar
I'm breakin it down, my sounds, so crowds are like deaf
From the West
Puttin whole counties to the test
It's all in perspective
Breaker one-nine copy
This is for the niggaz gettin caught up in the Paparazzi

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three]

Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress
But I just play the back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams
For a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel
I made a cool half mil
Before I had a record deal
There for you look and stare like it's magic
Too much of anything can make you an addict
When devils be startin static, forgot the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait
Who dare to cross this path
Yo, I do ya like math
Cut with glass, make a blood bath
So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with
Smoke a lot of blunts with
I dispose of your punk shit
Keep it all in perspective
Carbon Copies gettin caught up in the Paparazzi

Once again it's the liquidation crew and I return for you

For when they come with the drama.

So I continue the saga,
Move out the path of the lava,
Move in position and conquer.
You have created a monster,
Wake up and call out the culprit.
I never weaken or soften,
Might catch me weezin' and coughin'
Because I blaze very often,
I need to knock this shit off of shit
I got problems my nigga,
And they get bigger and bigger.
You can not solve, what a thriller.
This is a pivotal moment,
This is my time of atoning,
This is my world and I own it,
So come and take if you want it,
Please God forgive me for sinnin',
Winnin', and makin' a killin',
Witness revenge of the villains.

I crash a plain in their buildin',
But now I'm married with children.
Katal and balance the millions.
I'm in another direction,

You need to hear my confession.
Forever walk with a weapon,

Make patches and master my master piece,
Niggas have the audacity,
Trynna adapt to capacities
Of your highness, your majesty.
What the fuck is you asking me?
With my accurate accuracy,
Immaculate faculties,
With a nation in back of me.
I see promising situations evolve into tragedies,
I just hustle and hustle because it comes to me naturally.
I'm a buffalo soldier clappin' you back to Jehovah,
C'mon let's take this shit over.

On your current events.
This aint no novelty spittin’ hotter than barbeque bits,

You showin' off for the cameras while I just stick to the script.
People get Hollywood quick,

Slow motion, gt rollin', your bitch she knowin'
She'll tell you we poppin' off
Ain't nothin' when X shit jumpin', to get the hoes fuckin'
They know we be poppin' off

[Xzibit]
Uh-uh, I know you gettin' high
Cause you keep on starin' and your eyes don't lie
That shit you wearin' and your friends keep darin'
There's enough to go around and they don't mind sharin'
Get between your thighs, make ya exercise
You ain't gotta waste no time with no 'fuck me' eyes
I'm like all day long up in ya
Take a break, make a drink, roll the 'wood, let the games continue
Uh, (you make me so hot) - you better than the rest of them bitches
I'll bang your back out in every position
I never listen to the shit niggaz say
How you're easy to spread, like to pop pills and fuck all day
But baby that's alright with me
If you thinkin' long-term, bitch that's what it ain't gon' be
So just shake what your mamma gave ya
And I'ma give you what your dad gave your mom to make ya

[Chorus:]
In the club drinkin' with all my homies
And ain't no worries tonight 'cause we poppin' off
Don't bite me, but if you wanna fight me
It ain't hard to find me, just know I'll be poppin' off
Slow motion, gt rollin', your bitch she knowin'
She'll tell you we poppin' off
Ain't nothin' when X shit jumpin', to get the hoes fuckin'
They know we be poppin' off

[Dj Quik]
Now riddle me this...
Whenever I hit her hard in the middle she piss
Do I take that as normal and watch her play with her tits?
I'm confused, I feel so used - and I got the dick
Now what am I doin' here?
She tell me she wants to keep the condom as a souvenir
And that's kinda weird to me
I guess this ol' fuck session ain't what it appear to be
Because the concierge has just brought the bill to me
I go 200 miles per hour on a street bike
And 9-0 beats per minute on a sweet mic
Whenever I get with bitches I lose a little somethin'
Sperm by the zones, we keep it hot and goin'
Xzibit we got it flowin', don't even approach us, you only get roaches
How you gon' smoke with us nigga when you can't even focus
Cause we don't break bread with bitches, we take head from bitches
Cause niggaz be gettin' dead from bitches for bein'

[Chorus:]
In the club drinkin' with all my homies
And ain't no worries tonight 'cause we poppin' off
Don't bite me, but if you wanna fight me
It ain't hard to find me, just know I'll be poppin' off
Slow motion, gt rollin', your bitch she knowin'
She'll tell you we poppin' off
Ain't nothin' when X shit jumpin', to get the hoes fuckin'

Last of the honcho and Flint type niggaz
Big Tweet, Big Pete, pimp type figgas

Demandin' all bitches stay silent - fuck snitchin'
I'm the violent - pilot for your child hall riot
Where niggaz pull swords like pirates
Hoes get i-rit, I mean irate
Tee-la let a bitch eat, put some dick on her plate
You better get yo' ass some muscle and go hustle
Get up on the grind, stop fuckin' with mine
For the umpteenth time, I'm a baller by nature
Schooled by the best, fuck a hater
Never lay low, let 'em know, out of mind, out of sight
But for damn sure you'll catch me with the homies tonight
We just -

In the club drinkin' with all my homies
And ain't no worries tonight 'cause we poppin' off

Now let me introduce whose first
The nigga that's been down
With the set since birth
Whatever it was worth
I checked in on the norm
Since a juvenile callin'
Shots in the dorm
Moms said you better get right
Or shake the spot
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone
Like pop
Stashin' the rocks by the gats
With the Gs
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!
I don't fight the feelin'
Gotta hustle with a passion
Comin' cross state to put you down
With some action
In actuallity I keeps it  real in the streets
Remininsin' younger days
Over gangsa ass beats
And I,
Hit the weed
Til myeye balls bleed
While my life is corrupted
By lust and greed
Serve you anything from cocaine
Up to speed
I came with the drank
So here's five on the weed

[Xzibit:]
See kids don't belong
Up in grown folks buisness
The Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness
Sickness bear witness
Like tequlla without a chaser
It burns going down
Niggas guarenteed to drown
Legendary sound
From the west coast underground
The mighty King Tee
And Mr. X to the Z, see
Never underestimate the power
Of the X man
Dismantle your plans
Or just catch you with a back hand
Xzbit bring it to you live
With the know how
Cool in a gang
And ain't about to change
My lifestyle
Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle
But Xzibit unravel
Have smoke will travel
I bust Teflon rhymes
Into the crowd, bitch
You anin't Steve Rif
So stop trying to get Loud
You need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision
Xzibit still winnin'
Unanimous decisions

[King Tee:]
It's going down
Once again everybody lay down
Run your money and the jewels
To the front without a sound
The infamous supreme King Tee
Glad to meet ya
Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain
Through ya speaka and hey
I walk around the hood lookin' looped
Strapped like a mothafuckin'
Desert strom troop
Niggas be like ""King Tila
How you get that Benz? ""
By sending birds to Oklahoma City
To my friends
I slang my gangsta funk
Through the night
Sometimes I fight
Like I'm the ghost of Eric Wright
Compton is where I dwell
It's like hell
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers
In a spell
And all my homies live lives
Like crooks
Rich and infamous
Hoes wanna look but get shook
Cause we don't trust you hoes
You'll have a nigga fucked up
With a bullet through his clothes
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live

Ladies and gentlemen
Undivided attention
Xzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson
It's the...
Most dangerous things next to grizzles
Unsolved mysteries
Xzibit hit you penetentary style
Quick sharp and straight to the neck
I'm heavy on your chest
I'm all up in your life
Like stress
The coast that resides to your left
Whre niggas perpitrate
And catch a fate worse than death
And like Cyanide I'm hard to detect
Got more desighns and stragiht lines
Than an architect

She act like she ain't gon' survive the night

Without my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast
I see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash
Walk around naked witcha beautiful ass
Who the fuck taught ya how to move that fast?

It took time to perfect the stroke, by any note
Maybe we really don't need to drink and smoke
And just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin'

I'm up all night but I never complain

I don't, waste no time with pickup lines
I just look in her eyes and read the signs
A lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm
'Cause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city

Just look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair
She get off too quick, when I pull on her hair
I'm the only nigga that can take you there
I ain't the only one fuckin' and I don't care!

She come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin
And then that's when the party begins
And I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks

She don't gotta cheat 'cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin' a fuck, we fuck all night

Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind
Get in line, bitches stay on the grind, 'cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs

Ain't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty
Ass in the air like a pass to Grassi
It's a thin line between hoes and women
And close my dick with a hat and change the linen

At a night club, talkin' bout you don't go out
And you tryin' to got to school to make a certain amount
But the last part, I just couldn't figure it out
I guess it's real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth
Lightweight, like confetti
Steadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready
To deal with the legendary
Soopafly, X-Z, and Bullet Loco
Shot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po

Round and round we go, it don't stop
Till we all get dough, come on, make it hot

Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!

Terrorizin' my hoes, make they high-heels fall off
You got me close to fucked up, if you think I'm goin' soft on ya
I'm hard on my hoes that's how it goes
Bitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four
My name, you bounced, so you might as well break bread
And only Du Lo niggas know, whats the head
My name is Billy Loco and this is my opinion
I'm coming from SD, and Du Lo is my religion

All I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!
In Jamaica, at the Half Moon Villa
With a killa and a cocaine dealer, layin' low from the law
See it all comes down to who's quick to draw first
Pay attention, prevention, ridin' off in a hearse
Mister X to the you know me
Thousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free
The dysfunctional member of the Alkoholik family tree
Frequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee
Hennessey on the rocks, with Pina Coloda
At the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna
For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees
After that we kickin' back and burn up some trees
Mad shout, 'cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin'

I love my fucking rob, and I don't want to stop
Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a cop
You know protect and serve, a couple traffic stops
I make a bust, and take something out the top
A thin blue line, we run these streets
You bang on them, but never bang on me
I cell search, stepping on pillows and sheets
I'm the police, treat a nigga just like fresh meat
I got a short wick, on some New York shit
Take you to the precinct and fuck you with a broomstick
I patrol your hood, put you on my hood
Leave you in the wrong hood, got it understood
Pc 647b, that's a prostitute, plus she kind of cute
She don't want to jail, well bitch I'll tell you what
Get on your muthafuckin' knees, suck my partner up

I'm the police, I'm the police
I'm the police, I'm the police

You know a couple of muthafuckas was giving us grief
Pulled a couple strings, dodge the media beef
Ever since them niggaz in black said ""Fuck the police""
I been grinding on the back of my teeth, loading my piece
Waiting for some, get back like it or not
We investigated the shots, that killed Biggie and Pac
Ever wonder why nobody ever figured it out
Cause we the ones that got to figure it out
I shout freeze at the top of my lungs
I'm the cream of the crop
You don't stop you get popped by my warning shots
And if you try to come back, with a civil suit
I sit back and watch my system take a shit on you

Order in the court, Order in the court
That muthafucka shot me, case dismissed
Ha Ha Ha Ha, police
I'm the police

You see this fuckin' badge, you see these fuckin' lights
I'm in your neighborhood rolling on you every night
You faggots run and duck, look at you scared as fuck
You see me coming in your mirror niggaz straighten up
Turn that hat around, I'm here to take you down
Hey partner look at these weapons and this coke I found
I'm going to let it slide, show you who you can trust
And if you want to keep selling, nigga you sell for us
Make you a 1030, I'll get you hands dirty
Murder for hire, professional liar
I plan to make police chief and then retire
I remember when you set your own hood on fire
I reinforce the freeways, to bring the tanks
So the next time y'all trip, fuck bloods and crips
Cause we the biggest gang in L. A.

He didn't get a second chance to see the glock pointed at his hood
Makin' his way through the rain he's caught in the game
He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain
Nothin's changed in a city flask
Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats, forever
Until the job is done and no one's left
My man Jeff told me with his very last breath
To watch moms
But they got her with the car bomb
Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm
niggas play for keeps like casino
Baby's has got fathers just got back from doin' Chino
With nothin' to lose loose screws in the attic
The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic
And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible
Death resume 20 kill in incredible time
No guilt and shame
On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin' didn't know he was blind
So I find
Mankind is a serious threat
To another others kind when there's something to get
In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got
Nobody saw shit cause it's not
Cool to brake the rule of the code of the streets
niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets
And it's deep how blood drys as a mother crys
Open eyes gettin' landed on by flys

fuck playin' with toys our fun was on the block
Watchin' all the cats negotate the neighborhood stock
My job was to come runnin' whenever cops was comin'
My older brother I figure was the ring leader
Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters
All black and nickel plated (c'mon)
Soon became fasinated bitches cars and kicks
And look at how fast they made it
My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content
With G. I. Joe and Tonka trucks
But I want butts, livin' first class delux
15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks
My older brother was touched
It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane
Crack house for my birthday
The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police
In a rage he lived but he payed the price
Caught with keys 25 to life
Takin' in by the crew time to standed on my own two (c'mon nigga)
But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood
I really can't remember my body doin' good
For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em
Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a
Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast
Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release

Put the toys down excited about the first round

One more day and I'm a free man walkin
Leavin from behind these gates, I paid my debt to the state
And ever since they took the weights
Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin
Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend
Remember like it's yesterday, eight-teen and?
I can't remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them
Goin for a ride that I cannot stop
Set up shop in Cochran, connect the dots
And for those that don't know, that's the Pen-East to Fresno
Northeast to Baskersfield, fuck ""Let's Make a Deal""
Livin around niggaz who kill, right along with the niggaz who will
At the drop of a hat, sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that
Niggaz givin up the manhood they can't get back
It's a sick university, murder the cirriculum
Concrete campuses, I miss Los Angeles
More than that I'm missin my kids
Missin my turf, missin my bitch, what could be worse?
Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit)
Some nigga picked up, wanted to break her neck
When kites slide up under your door, you slide them back
Cause when you pick em up and read em that's where you're at
And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back
Level four right away, gettin hit the same day
Playin the price for the games you play
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened
Tacs gettin taced up, plottin and talkin
Sellin everything from weed to blow
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know
Niggaz holdin weight, essays got the power
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours
Top Ramen and Tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks, get too weak
And then physically and mentally cannot compete
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin
Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz that's freshed out
But some of these niggaz on swipe
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again
On all times take the long walk to the front gate
Dress out expandin shit, today my release date

Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker

I'm busy baby you fuckin with it
Is it your place or mind
Don't wanna waste your time
And you can get it how you want it it'll blow ya mind
Its over time
Takin pride in the bump and grind
A hit from behind to leave you with a broken spine
This what it's all about
You better stall me out
Its just the game of the name you bitches callin out

[Chorus:]

Pop it, drink it
Float it, sink it
Plan to stop me then you better rethink it
Drive it, use it
Pimp it, abuse it
Shit motherfuckers do to hip-hop music
I live it, I die it
I'm laughin, I'm cryin
Pop two of these bitch, lets start flying
I hear it, I taste it
I touched it, I faced it
Breakin down the bullshit back to the basics
I had to kick in the door
That's how I had to get it
I shitted with lyrics
And getting better for fuckin credit
Gettin gangsta with it
The best that ever did it
Hit it and quit it my nigga
You shouldn't babysit it
We need more emcees and less wannabes
Three hundred and sixty degrees of reality
That's what it's all about
Kill em and haul em out
Now feel the aim of the name you haters callin out

Playin stopped playin long time ago with childish toys
It's only men in here; deuce deuce inch Pirelli
And Goodyear niggaz, sip malt liquor beer
They gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks
Shot the lights out at the championship
Big chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's
Full of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed
Rap niggaz, we different individuals
Elevate the level of the music and the visuals
It's do or die, I need a +Priest+, call +Superfly+
Whatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I
I'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight
Five hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit
Everyday, every night's a saloon
Crime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes

[Chorus: Goldie Loc]
Love when when you're out there on the ave
When you're down 24/7, niggaz don't know the half
My Romeo's step down on the pedal
My back keeps on scrapin the metal
I be coastin and be coastin, hittin three wheel motion
With my rimz and tirez

[Xzibit]
I ain't never seen Kevlar flesh (hell naw)
Y'all bitch niggaz is flirtin and fuckin with death
I was taught to stick with the right and work with the left
Never love nothin, never turn snitch and confess
Got catch me in the heat of the act, and run the risk
Of catchin three to the back, and try walkin with that (yeah!)
I ain't goin to the pen for shit, except to snatch up
My loved ones to get loose and hop the fence
It ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue
Mad dog to niggaz that walk up your boulevard (yeah!)
But one day, you gon' feel it (what?)
I'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it
A hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire
The live wire, leak a nigga like a vampire
My empire roll rimz and tirez
Either get with us, forget us and get behind us, muh'fuckers

[Chorus:]

[Interlude]
Ride along, with my rimz and tirez
Side along

[Kokane]
Mr. Recycler (what?) I'm lookin for a sixty-two Chevy
And she kinda bad, threw him six and I was read'
(Whatchu want me to do?)  To get spic and span
Man I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good lookin)
He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)
And I change colors when the sun hit me
Fix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools trippin
(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dippin?
(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slippin (why?)
For me it was an easy task
I kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash
Fool (peep game) I was born to lowride on rimz and tirez, yeah

I binge on the finer things you cringe in defeat
Escalation, elevation to another plateau
Sometimes it take a few steps back to mentally grow
Here we go, what you know, campaign in motion
Straight West coast and West worldwide rollin
Got that Aston Martin dv9 equipped with a stash box
In case I ever find myself alone in a tight spot
Strip down my frame, repave my lane
Insane with my ink pen, Citizen Kane
Don't complain when the chamber slide back and bang
Make it taste like shit when you sayin my name
It's the Golden State heavyweight, holdin the belt
Cause I'm a one man army I don't need no help
This is a - pistol, I use to protect myself
Careful these hammerhead hollow points is bad for your health

Another night in L. A., the homies all valet
We got it lookin the dub show in front of the place
Strong Arm + 75, we so deep we arrive
And then we swarm like you fucked with the hive
Gotta look a nigga right in the eyes, to tell the truth and the lies
Even the strong find it hard to survive
Another day another dollar we can walk on water
Better, drop your tone, you ain't nobody's father
Hotter than about a buck shot your carne asada
X burn down the town like a path of lava
Pathological drama so we got it inside
Is it the wine or the women it's so hard to decide
Look alive it's crackin; this is organized street hustlin
With corporate backin promotin interstate traffic (traffic)
Classic, smash out right
Cause live from Los Angeles it's Saturday Night

Cause I, can get yo' ass on the floor
Cause this, is this the funk that you want?
The hand, it comes way up in the air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't caaaaaaaaare

Stop, shake that junk in your trunk
See you, can move this groovyville shit
The shake that makes the whollllle club flip

You ain't a soldier like me you a fuckin disgrace
X move like a shark in the water, I'm dodgin death and disorder

I was sent here to strangle and slaughter in no particular order
Your big mouth might endanger your daughter
Another day another digit I'ma speak it and live it
Better get yourself a gun 'fore you fuck with Xzibit
Pockets shorter than a midget, you can fuckin forget it
X green light the target and easily hit it
Grab the zone and split it so we smokin them woods
Steady givin niggaz the business and keepin it hood
Firearms we packin, this is military mindstate
That's ready for action we mercenaries and assassins (blastin)
Clashin, smash out right

Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own da shit
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick
So who am I? I reply with my government, exchange the numbers
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman
I got 20/20 cord vision, seein' you comin'
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife
But you persist, tryin' ta strengthen our relationship
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace
You ain't the one for me!

[Chorus:]

You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat
I'm feelin stuck, had to hustle up
The A-T-F, hit the house, had me shackled up
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out
You never let a brother down, when you stressin out
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man
I understand that you love me and you want the best
But if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest
I rock a vest, baby!

[Chorus:]
Cause I, run these streets for my struggle
Cause I, carry heat for my troubles
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?
Cause I, want family so I'm buildin
Cause I, want you just for my children
Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want, is that what you need?

And all this time it was you
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin you through
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I must do
I used to think I was the man, wasn't havin a clue
I wasn't lookin for no love, but I found it in you
It's so true, behind every great man is a women
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come runnin
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down
You always given me another reason, I can smile
Cause you beleived in me, when there was nothin there to see
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree
Ugh, nothin can stop us now, ? Verawane? Gown
Watchin your father, walk his little lady down the isle
Cause you the one for me!

[Chorus:]
Cause she, was put here to complete me
Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need
Cause she, won't let go, she won't leave me
Cause she, won't leave, what she don't need me
Cause she, got what I want, got what I want, got what I need

Feels so good
Like this, yeah, feel so good
Hey ya live, bring it

See I been waiting all my whole life
For something like this
Who woulda thought the end of all time
Would start wit a kiss
I'm not the type to show emotion
At the drop of a dime
But at the bottom of the line
The decision is mine

To approach and get close
Takin' a chance in a way
But Xzibit give a damn what the next man say
Because you only die once
I'm tryin' to live to the limits
And it just now hit me that
I wanna take you wit me

For the long haul, I'll be there
Whenever you call
And get together, we stand
And everything goes according to plan
We'll be tight from tonight
'Till the daylight
If lovin' you is wrong
Then I don't wanna be right
So good

Never have I been so mystified
By anyone's love before (hey, yeah)
I feel so natural
I keep coming back for more
And each time we touch you open up a new door

Baby, you're such a midnight tease
It's gonna take everything to keep you from me (hey, yeah)
And the joy that your lovin' brings
Can separate the mountains from the sea

1 - I don't wanna be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so wrong
I don't want to go on

2 - I don't wanna be wrong
But it feels right
It feels good
So good, so good, so good

Spent so many nights believing I was wrong
For you being in my life
I can't ignore it when
Some say that it ain't right (It ain't right)
But I decided you're the best thing that happened
In my life

I haven't had everything (oh no)
But you come close to everything that love means (hey yeah)
In heaven's eyes love is embraced between you and I
Now that we have each other
I don't have to dream

I don't wanna be wrong
But it feels right
If loving you is so strong
It can't be wrong

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
I walk the earth like Kane from Kung Fu
To kick it wit you
And all your people like to criticize
The things that we do
But I don't sweat it, what we got baby
Is good like credit
And be careful what you wish for
You just might get it, forget it

I'm not about to let this good thing go
I try to keep it on the low
Put on a show like a Giggalo, so
It's dedicated to the one that I got
And other folks that start the talking
Would be walkin' the spot

But they don't understand we in a place
They can't even see
Besides, I'm not livin' for them
I'm livin' for me
And it don't take no brain surgeon wit a master's degree
To try to figure out
What real love is really about

Just let me live to the fullest
And keep my name at your mouth
And I won't bring you no drama
Without no reasonable doubt
So therefore, I'm not the one to try to knock like wood
You be my baby forever
Because it feels so good

Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin {*King T starts speakin, indecipherable*}

[King T]
I'm comin ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twistin wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*Boom*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold seperate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown done run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L. A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L. A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
C*** me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggaz jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your turkish chain, C. K. B. K.
Blued up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggaz get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, ak's and 9's
One-time's, sunshines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian thai, drive-by, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called what-The-Dif'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor
Better than yours, drivin away gettin head from a whore
It's Avirex-to-the-Z
Fuckin with me might get you banned from tv,
Cassette and cd it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin, burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let em come in blaow he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggaz, who by fifths by the fo'
And bruise by the case
Slap you in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Something more, something more than fairytales
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I designed an oasis, wide open spaces
Butt naked bitches having sexual relations
Major operation, let me take conversations
Sensitive intel, pay attention to detail
Yeah, design the flat, not your vital signs
Ac, dc, alkaline, whichever type of battery you got in your back
Gon' be removed when the clips get slapped
You and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back

All of these dwarf stars, they fizz a lot fast week
Burn like the sun and you suck like a black hole
Suck in my style and get over my flagpole
These colors don't run, we attract to
Drama like madness, you wanna get your head flew
Incredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme
I'm not the average, no in fact I'm
Super rap killer, extremely great spitter
Make a dope, hit a door, solve the queen's riddler
Sinister, ill enough to bang with the sickest
So get up and get down with the sickness
This is something more than just songs
I wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with
Better lines than them, to crush their dreams
And attempts at my sport when I do this thing

The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

What you know about death, money and sacrifice?
What you know about people scheming to take your life?
I'm tryna tell you, what know about these Cali G's?
That mister penitentiary invested movement on a bigger better day
What you know about the harder man?
We paint the art of war to decorate the promised land
You understand, it's in my nature not to walk away
Cause I'm a beast, my beats'll open up your chest and face
Call the police, it's not the same and I don't give a fuck
I speak the truth and now my catalogues are living trust
Now give it up and get it, take it at gun point
We cut-throat niggas in what point
You gonna realize we came for

Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not

Let one nigga talk, everybody gettin caught, for sure,

Xzibit,Spread It Out,/x/xzibit/spread+it+out_21046447.html,"I’m heavy hearted, heavy headed, misunderstand it,
Try the permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon.
I’m addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood,
Drink a gallon of heaty, throw it up with the hood.
Imma rhyme for my people, give my people a voice,
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice.
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage,
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out.
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron
The iron mob, try better bombs, I’m better alone.
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones,
Smoke to the sack of gold, nigger on a grind,
Put my motherfucker records on,
So they can relate to the hate and the pain,
To the struggle and strain,
Never take it in vain, bring the one and the same.
Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain.
So now

Let’s spread it out, nigger,
Yeah, yeah,
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out,
It go oooo, oooo,
(and you can’t get none, you don’t want none, you can’t get none,
Spread the fuck out, gets these hot ones)

I try not to get involved with the nonsense
I’m from the time where you couldn’t pause comments,
Couldn’t hide behind a computer, catch a fatal get shot by a shooter,
A barracuda for Buddha.
I maneuver to the manure, ignore the allure, the illusion,
My bad, sorry for all the confusion.
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done,
The saga continue, bring it back on the one.
I’m coming back with a gun, ‘cause I saw that I know
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go.
Never taking a smoke, in my profession you need aggression,
A weapon, you can brand the shit to your own discretion.
And I hear, just a sandwich, nigger, what’s your preference?
I chose bad and now I’m headed in a right direction.
They’re sick of the decisions, now my family is good,
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be.

Let’s spread it out, nigger,
Yeah, yeah,
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out,
It go oooo, oooo,
(and you can’t get none, you don’t want none, you can’t get none,
Spread the fuck out, gets these hot ones)

This go for all my people, people who see we’re equal,
I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil.
We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion,
People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere.
Enough with all this swagger, party’s a baggy bagger.
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what’s heading at.
Money’s so fucking tight, the root to all them fights
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night.
But she know that you go off with that stripping hoe,
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain,
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere.
Pussy nigger, you lame, get on top of your game,
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain.
Children retain, remember living upon the pain,
That’s when they curse your name, they will see you do the same.
Yeah, so spread it out, nigger.

Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out,
It go oooo, oooo,

I put my city on my back, now,
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided to the struggle, we fall.
Got my city on a map, now,
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all,
You gotta stand tall.

To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates,
Burn the back wood, burn it back to your fingertips.
Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment
You couldn’t have told me none of this back in ’96.
The ability to crawl upon the bottom, this bitch,
This is our time I’m spending mine up in this bitch.
I still remember the very moment I was enlisted
I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business.
And when there’s blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters
They wanna debate on television about the victim.
Right or wrong, Treyfa was my little man,
I would take a chainsaw for my man.

I put my city on my back, now,
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided to the struggle, we fall.
Got my city on a map, now,
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all,
You gotta stand tall.

For all the moments I wasted on making others happy
Attack me, I’m bulletproof, tag me, I’ve seen the virus through.
I never lied to you, still rolling with golden views,
Spend every word and I mean it, mean it and I really buy to you.
‘cause I regret being held in a jail cell,
I’m handcuffed, superheroes lend me cocktails.
I never feel, don’t try to patronize me,
I learn, I’m painfully aware of everything in my surroundings.
I am shaved, fully shining, never touched the silver lightning,
The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds.
I hear my city calling, here come the jogging, now are twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot.

I put my city on my back, now,
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided to the struggle, we fall.
Got my city on a map, now,
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all,
You gotta stand tall.

So, figure in the action,
How do you think I made it out that corner apartment?
Turn my corner to my market, and now I tag it the same,
Niggers, I told, don’t let that dumb shit.
‘cause when the gun clicking, that bullet lady can’t get her life back,
Karma is a bitch and believe me, she’ll get it right back.
They say that success is the best revenge, but who really wins if we don’t got really in
If I had it all, then I probably wouldn’t pray the same
And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain
My name good in every corner in my city,
You don’t believe me, then come fuck with me.

I put my city on my back, now,
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided to the struggle, we fall.
Got my city on a map, now,
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all,

I play chess not checkers but this is not a game
And this is not a song, and this is not a verse

Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse
That wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade

To let you know that I appreciate you by my side

We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the wooorrrlld famous Wake Up Show

[Rza]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, mc's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercin holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through yo' box
Walk wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up! (Tech is on)

[Tech N9ne]
When I Woke Up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin lookin around your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leavin mc's litless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher? Potna, you can't *fuck* wit the snyper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yellin ""Tech N9NE's vild!""

[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch! (bitch!)""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin verticle
Nose-first wit the top off landin up-side down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin from high noon till the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Korloff was
When I cut ya neck, leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked, why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show wit Sway, Tech and dj Revolution

*Dj Revolution scratches*

[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
Dj Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the head decay
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit blood redecorate
Until the head of jake investigate

[Jayo Felony]
What, Sway can give it to but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

[Chino xl]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul/file, for sexual harrassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg, your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin, wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring krs in

[Krs-One]
De de de da de de de da di day hey! Krs-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As I'll as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway and a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!!!
Ha ha ha, fresh for 1999 you suckas!!!"

Yeah.. welcome.. yeah.. huh.. there's plenty of room for everybody man..
Yeah.. bangin.. come on.. yeah.. look..

[Xzibit]
Huh, Stay in my lane like a hustla
Never hate a motherfucker,tolerate a motherfucker
To a certain extent
When it's on, it's over
Don't get no chance to get popping
Forgotten about you before your body cold in a coffin
Just another failed attempt, you fall through the cracks
Sure as God made man, the first man was Black
The Black man made pyramids and gangsta rap
That's all I know, cuz poppa didn't raise no rats
Face the facts not the fiction
I Build my empire from a pocket full of stones
And a fifth of ambition
Niggas wanna ball but they never wanna listen
So instead of coming up, they just, come up missin
My mission is to hit with precision, shake whole continents
Crush niggas' confidence, expose my dominance
Without no conflict, you'll never have progress
I'm sending this one out to all the neighborhoods and projects, I'm a

[Chorus - A.H. singing (Xzibit)]
One shot gambler (Yeah) Two shot gambler (Come on)
Three-time felon with that itch for dough
These madd street (Whuttup) Got me puffin on dro'
I'm guilty (What) Tryna make a living (Work it)
Thirty-eight albums and still no dollars (Come on)
And you wanna know why I hit the block for mo'? (Yeah)
These madd street (Uh) Got me puffin on dro' (Uh)
I'm guilty ..  For tryna make a living

[Xzibit]
Bitch I ain't tryna holler at you (nah)
I'm just wanna drink, smoke, fuck and toss a couple dollars at you
I'm fightin dirty, I'll take thirty of you motherfuckers
I'm throwing cheapshots, low-blows and suckerpunches
I'm not for the games, I'm not in the mood
Not to be confused with dudes that fumble and lose
Xzibit move when I hear oppurtunity knockin
But I'ma shoot straight through the door if you comin with problems
It's too crowded at the bottom, too lonely at the top
Ain't no inbetween, trust me, like it or not
We gon' be here forever like cops and roaches
Do not approach us, ferocious, we pop them toasters, nigga

[Interlude - A.H. (X)]
I'ma have to hit the block, then around to my hoes
I got a haze, two trays, and a change of clothes, cuz
Pimpin' ain't easy y'all,it's too sleazy
Too greasy, and I can't take it easy!

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Everytime I try to get out
I get dragged right the fuck back in, it's like I'm never gon' win
Nigga got the whole world on his back
Overeact, matter fact we act like when animals attack
I know, pussy sells faster than crack, ambassador rap
Twist back your salary cap, who fuckin with that?
Welcome to the X games, enjoy my pain
Inhale my smoke, it's hard not to cough or choke
Motorola nigga up the old fashion way
This ain't rap, this is shit that I was born to say
Though lately I been having dillemas, with insignificant niggas
And half-ass rappers that think they can get it
We the Golden State, we keep the whole thing bouncing
Y'all move units, we move mountains
Y'all rap for bullshit, tryna be on T.V.
We seen you, now we don't like Chandra Levy, I'ma

And a big chest got me feelin' like a brand new man
Roll some doe and nigga gimme somethin' to smoke
Say she didn't love the status, she just love the stroke
Restless, beat the pussy 'til she fallin' asleep
Athletes trippin' off a couple a thousand a week
Just to do the same thang

She was in my car givin' me brain

Ya know i can kinda dig that
Because the game don't wait on anybody
Ya know, i need a fix (game don't wait)

[nate dogg]
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
I got no time for no damn lunch break
I got to go out and buy some brand new clothes
And change my socks 'fore they reveal my toes
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
The hookers flock because the dick is straight
Let me teach you what i already know
The shit don't stop, so it's time i go (game don't wait)

Youngsta never bite the hand thats feeds you
Proceed to give back to your folks and loccs that need you
We do, we always keep it on the true

It's true, that the dirt i did as a kid got me _caught up_
But i was brought up with the m-o if a d-o
So for your info, nigga
I been doin' this before i hit the radizzo
Snoop d-eezy is off the heezey

Xzibit,The Music Of Business,/x/xzibit/the+music+of+business_20148173.html,"(Xzibit): Yea.  That's what I'm talking about
(Ras K.): Yea
(Xzibit): The homie John John up in this motherfucker
(Ras K.): Yea
(Xzibit): Mr. X to the Z with a public service announcement
For all you faggot ass rappers
(Ras K.): What's that?
(Xzibit): They think just because a nigga's rapping
With a label behind him, it's all great
(Ras K.): Yep
(Xzibit): It's modern day pimps and hoes going on

Ask epmd, rap is still out of control
Cause hip-hop plus glocks = Scott La Rock, Tupac and Biggie Smalls
I figure y'all niggaz brawl for lack of protocol
Now I'm gonna take matters into my own hands,  like masturbation
Another 39 suicidal rap is at heavens gate waiting to battle with Satan
Rassassination: taking heads like decapitation (ching!)
Trapped in infatuation (really)?  Back up off me
Kiss my ass.  Then wake up n' smell the coffee
See, when you're broke and unknown, your baby's mama clown you
Your family down's you.  Don't want your own kid around you
You ain't shit.  Don't do shit
Ain't gone never be shit.  So it's quits
Two video's later, she's on your dick (Bitch)
When your albums selling, she ""Don't Worry, Be Happy.""
Bragging to her friends: ""That's just my babies daddy!""
And sadly, niggaz start acting like they shit don't stink
But wait: you getting cut like the wedding cake
The music business is straight Mafioso:
Jewish, Italiano, and Black
My bmi/Ascap platinum placque rap track
Bootleg my shit to japan.  At Swap Meets, sell my same shit back
Long sharks break legs.  We break beats state to state
And record deals?  That shit belong with a fucked up interest rate

(Chorus 2x):
(Parish Smith sample): Music Please, music please
(Color Me Bad Sample): ""Why you treat me so bad?""
(Parish Smith sample): Music please.. Music please
(Other sample): ""I don't know why baby!""
(Xzibit): Just handle your business

[Verse 2:]
It's sort of like the label is the devil:
R&B, Pop, Gospel to Heavy Metal
They make doe pimping the ghet-to
Label mates: different rats in the same rat race
The production company is the nigga that you learn to hate
Management is your crimy.  Your lawyer is your liar
And when your famous but po', you set your accountants office on fire
It's like this: they loan you $1
For you just to break even, they stack $10
When you finally make one dollar, your profit is Andrew Jack-son ($20)
You skinny.  They got plenty.  The Benjamins?  Before you see any
They getting G's: big cheese.
No Vaseline fucking dope M. C. 's, ""so freeze""
Call the police chief?  It takes a thief
Here's everything you need to know about the record industry,
Like a chief.
'Cause labels is doing $300, 000 deals;
Blowing coke smoke up my ass, but we both know crack kills.
Not very many, rappers ever see a penny
But double platinum is two million units.  Cd's cost $20.
(Too true)  So here's a clue
Somebody just make $40, 000, 000 and it sho' wasn't you

(Chorus 2x):
(Parish Smith sample): Music Please, music please
(Color Me Bad Sample): ""Why you treat me so bad?""
(Parish Smith sample): Music please.. Music please.
(Other sample): ""I don't know why baby!""
(Xzibit): Just handle your business.

Want to know the relationship between hip-hop and drugs?
'Cause professional athletes, black actors, rappers, and thugs
All sleep in the same bed together
Rich black niggaz only kick it with other black people with cheddar
Same lifestyle: legal or illegal
It be us, swinging a three fuck getting skeed up with peanuts
Which leads up to this: a high turnover ration
Groupies turn tricks and be quick to give fellatio.
Mc's get the pussy and fame.
Brothers essex floss with a corporate card
And charge it to the rappers name
But the label owners make all the real money
Just ask David Geffrey, Barry Gordy, Russel, or Puffy (ching, ching!)
Business?  You don't get what you deserve.  You negotiate
And everything is renegotiable based on the sales you generate
But hip-hop fans don't buy albums, and, then again, tend to player hate
The rapper that went Pop.  But before this, I never knew
Skills don't pay the mother fucking bills.  Money do
Is you stupid?  How nice I represent don't pay rent
The R&B ho who jock Theo on the radio buy your cd doe.
Rap magazines be screaming they keep it real
But keep it fake on the cover
Pulling tennis shoe and clothing advertisements.  No wonder
Like Common ""I Used to Love H.E.R.""
Now I just fuck H. E. Are. With two rubbers

(Chorus: repeats until end):
(Parish Smith sample): Music Please, music please
(Color Me Bad Sample): ""Why you treat me so bad?""
(Parish Smith sample): Music please.. Music please
(Other sample): ""I don't know why baby!""

No amount of fame gon' change this gangsta spit
Quick to roll out the backwood (yeah) smoke out your buildin

I'm the hardest cold-hearted artist, the coast is clear
Dubai, Australia to Africa, this is the year!
Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo' system
I be swimmin through these women, man, fuck 'em and flip 'em
I know you hopin I would fall to the side, or go to Way Side
It ain't a motherfucker alive to come and take mine (no!)
Don't procrastinate, don't waste time
Never faced time, Houdini with crime, traffic over state lines

All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave
It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious
Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of
An Egyptian
We rips then
Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'
Cause no light shine through a flow like mine
Casual might ignite the mic for pastime
With one style older than the sundial
My elaborate connection of words is fun how
I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy
Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a J
My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs
For the wack it gets foul
Got a Full Metal Jacket off rhymes to press
To manifest under pressure

And associate my good times wit Hennesy straight

We makin history, get your cameras and roll the tape
Document the moves y'all niggas refuse to make

We automatically swing hard and aim for the throat, mothafuckers

Of course, the work horse, the main source
Either come in quietly or be taken by force
40 Dayz & 40 Nightz brought the Thunder & Lightning
Let's both burn sudden and have a Clash of the Titans

Chorus 4x"
Xzibit,U Know,/x/xzibit/u+know_20148140.html,"[Xzibit]
Most niggaz get it confused right?  Huh
They think it's all chronic and palm trees out this muh'fucka
Bitches and bikinis, listen, huh

Some niggaz is better left alone
I place you underneath the very ground you walkin on
And ain't no children in this motherfucker, drop your tone
Ain't got no business even FUCKIN with no microphones
So yo it's me against the world, and ain't got shit to lose
My heavy artillery built to make the masses move
I carry tools that'll pick you up and out your shoes
Xzibit bringin new meanin to alcohol abuse
I wanna fall up in the spot where all the bitches at
Holdin somethin heavy to help you straighten out your back
A couple of drinks and I bend you over the kitchen sink
So what you think I owe you somethin bitch for fuckin me?
(BITCH) Get a grip, misery love company, check it
Xzibit show you the difference between real life and makin a record
Makin the moves and connections that you never expected
What good is money and the fame if you never respected?
Check it out

[Chorus]
You know, who's runnin these fuckin streets
(You get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
Don't be actin like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin with X
You know, we roll so fuckin deep
(Yeah round after round in the middle of the street niggaz)
Cause you're actin like your shit don't stink

[Xzibit]
Yo, I ain't afraid of them fuckin invisible gats
You always bringin out in your raps
My shit'll quickly make you fold and collapse
My goal to strictly takin over the map, by any means
Hustle and make more tracks than a her-on fiend
Keep my enemies on a first name basis
And hate them niggaz like a skinhead racist
Chuck Taylors and fat laces
Stompin hoes through y'all turf
I hurt worse than actual childbirth
A chick can suck my dick til the big squirt (AH-AHH!)
The song work, so ain't no playin wit us
Findin out where you rest your head and I'm sprayin it up
The remains that's left behind can probably fit in a cup
You pressin your luck, you makin yourselves easy to touch
I'm from the home of the hit 'em up, only two ways
You droppin some shells or you get 'em up, back in the days
There was a time there was this woman that I want to keep up
But nowadays when I see you I'm just tryin to fuck
So check it out

[Chorus]
You know, who's runnin these fuckin streets
(The king of these West coast gangsta beats, niggaz)
Always droppin off nothin but straight heat
So stay the fuck out of the way
You know, we roll so fuckin deep
(Round after round in the middle of the street niggaz)
Cause you're actin like your shit don't stink
Y'all ain't fuckin with Dre

[Dr. Dre]
Thangs just ain't the same since he came out
Two thousand and one, came blew the game out
I heard you was hot {*huff*} blew your flame out
And got the nerve to believe you hold the same clout?
I thought I told you, keep my name out of your fuckin mouth
(But Dr. Dre!) See that's exactly what I'm talkin bout
That shit right there, that's all day long
Just don't stop, I gots to be alone at the top
Forever ready loaded and locked, with niggaz that'll circle yo' block
And let 'em pop til some bodies get dropped
It's Doc Holiday in the flesh
(Still) hold it down, represent, resurrect the West
(Still) holdin ground, touchin down, with my nigga X
(Still) send a couple through yo' chest if you disrespect
Dr. Dre comin back (shit) I never left
The number one ranked highest paid celebrity guest
That's eight digits, motherfuckers

[Chorus]
You know, who's runnin these fuckin streets
(You get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
Don't be actin like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin with X

Round up in regal, your rathets mad cause they giving us action

The farm once you came here when it was my turn
Everyone up in here spazzy, loud and hippy
Perking hella pissy, everybody tipsy, feeling heck trippy
My wrist real brisky, icey, bitch main niggas don't like me
Cause they wife on me to pipe shit
But only since 1990
Body, booming, I'll be, tycooning
Me and a few of my goonsing
Alcohol consuming
Wanna raise in the grip, well fin to sneak upon you
Try to hit you for a hit
Better pack an extra clip, cause niggas ain't playing

All in, like rallying, I should... Pimp styling
All I hear is money calling

While we vacating the destination for motivation, hey
Separate hunneds from fifties, fold it up, bring it all with me
Call it an audible hit me, I'm open, never forget me
Down shift, punching, approaching the hunned and sixty
I'm crawling like... Bouncing up round the city
Pity you feeling shitty, it's 25 to life for this pushing this spiker
Get anybody hit by a sniper
Live the rest of your life in a diaper
Chill the fuck out, or you can walk, keep walking
Or niggas will carry you out
This is the end of the drought
Homies is bouncing around me, too many zeros to count
I let these women surround me, jump out they clothes to come out
But then they never can found me, holding the holy amounts
Already showed you to rock,

I move bricks of yae, I freeze it with ice
I keep my business separate from my personal life
Me and my niggas hustle enough, move enough weight
To buy real estate, vehicles, paper weights, straight
Little niggas try to calculate the money I make
I ain't having it, I keep the gauge cocked in the kitchen cabinet
Grabbing it for any altercation
Catch a permanent vacation fucking with the son of satan
And I ain't waiting for the one time to catch me
Arrest me, arraign me, humiliate then stress me
I'm at the crib trying to chill with my little kid
Had everything in controlled or at least I thought I did
Telephone rang, when I answered then they hung up
Three niggas kicked the front door with they guns up,
Cover my son up, and let the lead off
Get the pump to pumping, Xzibit took them niggas heads off (BITCH!)

Living the gangsta's life (living the gangsta life)
We living gangsta like (living the gangsta liiiiiife)

I wake up five in the morning, smoke a sac to the head
Sneak out the back, grab a strap, and dock and dogging the feds
Slanging hanging on the corner regulating the hood
Banging and robbing transporting the goods (nigga)
Popping and bugging up on the cell in my pocket
Grab my strap and cock it and see my homie hopping the fo's
Watch the young ho's jocking that gangsta life
Niggas is heated down to dump on site
Nah, I just swerve the boulavard and maintain the status of a G
'cause ain't nothing but the hog in me
Niggas around my way don't get along with me (why?)
Because they jelous that I'm clocking more than thirty G's
Nigga, cocaine and weed was a main factor in my life, I'm coming up
I'm running on anybody who post and ran up
Everybody in my family path was jail
Heaven and hell, that's where my homies 'ill dwell
STRAIGHT GANGSTA!

What would you do if you could
Get with my crew, baby
What would you do if you could down with the dog pound

No snitching allowed, spitting no names
I'm Gâ?¦and You ain'tâ?¦
I canâ?¦.and you can'tâ?¦
Ever since you dropped names, your out of sight
Snitching on your homeboys, that ain't right
I always grew up since eighteen and up
With something to throw up, what hood we threw up? (Dogg Pound Gangstas)
Blast backs at times we got bust at
Turn around, bust back then scat
Moving on up to the top of the map
'cause gangstas 'ill be here 'till the curl come back
This is our world, land of the gangsta macks
Controlled by the blue and red rags
Out here we ain't into ice
Just banging, dice, and the gangsta life

Uh-huh, hah.. I'ma sit back
Tell you niggaz what I been lookin at, huh

Y'all niggaz is killin me
You got Bloods and Crips in New York City, is anybody feelin me?
I ain't concerned with who gon' shoot who
I'm only concerned with music, and who break through
Fuck you, for thinkin platinum is the ultimate goal
These faggot niggaz gettin they money, but losin they soul
I don't wanna hear shit from you niggaz with no background
No backbones, you get no chance to back down
Deal how we deal witcha, peons, no chips
Changin whips out so they can look richer
I see the big picture, startin in the kitchen
With bricks and Pyrex pots, the widescreen edition
Listen, I seen niggaz hit with so much time loc
They have to die and come back three times to see them white folks
Take notes, cause you will be tested
Vested up, drunk as fuck, large caliber weapons
I feel you.. Rap niggaz, fuckin it up
Monkey-mouthed muh'fuckers, spoilin the cut
For real niggaz in the street, really hustlin weight
See they networks and blueprints on hip-hop tapes
Johnny Law catchin on, soakin up the game
How you think they find the stash spots and follow the slang? Stupid
Grown men playin cops and robbers
Death for dollars, I'm too laid back to holla

We back at square one, ridin, with nuttin to ride fo'

Save mine up, cause nothin ever last forever
Never nothin out of my reach, we blast whoever
I can split a muh'fuck*are from his ass to his last thought
Shit talk, then stomp through the asphault
It's yo' fault we tow-truck for your outline
In due time, you'll find, the world is mine
So I listen to the rhetorhic, jealousy and the ignorance
Can't stop me nigga, my mind too militant
God blessed me with a chin
And a heavy right-left combination that'll cave your face in
So don't make me hurt you, patience is virtue
They only got a few of us let, huh

Now it's two-thousand-and-two; where kids do
Whatever the fuck they wanna do, huh, sad but true
Wanna take another life like it's the thing to do

I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power and the eath was lighted with his glory
And he cried mightily with the strong voice saying ""Babylon the great has
Fallen,
It's fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every fowl spirit and a cage of very unclean and hateful men""

What you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for kick downs, get my own shit, blowe
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple my existance is to ripple through time
Only concern is what is mine, divine, never monkey shine
Walkin' down the very thin line, holdin' wait, runnin' crazy in the streets,
Yeah
Plus the company I keep work in overtime
While you oversleep don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around on the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said to can't have your take, you need a tune (fuck you)

This ain't no luck of the draw, I'm supposed to do it

And stay swingin' for the fifths like it's no tomorrow
Make a nigga trade hard like I'm custom model
Each one, teach one, we gonna lead, so follow
Niggaz soft like avocado, trying to hold bravado
My tips be hollow, some real hard shit to swallow
It's the S. A. S express don't get caught on the tracks

Fuck punk motherfuckers that pray for my death

For my foes, bullet hoes through ya clothes and that fake Chinchilla
For all my niggaz in the hustle, celebrate ya life
Fucking Bush administration tryin' to take your life
X man exchange the data, hate the hater
Hit the earth so hard leaving cracks and craters
Niggaz wanna spend money on hats and gaters
Hoes in Vegas they gotta have chrome and dames
But don't wanna do a third of the work
I built an empire from dirt
I put you in a world of hurt... Fucker!!!

[Chorus:]
You can read me in the magazines
Or watch me on the tv screen
If you ever tryin' to take for me
That's gon' be the last day you breath
Nobody here rides for free
You fuckin' with a real O. G
I stick 'n move like a young Ali
You can't hit what you can't see...(me, me)"
Xzibit,What's The Difference,/x/xzibit/whats+the+difference_20148178.html,"[kurupt] What's the difference between me and you? (repeat 2X)

[Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

Chorus: kurupt (repeat 2X)

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin

[Xzibit]
Yo I stay wit it
While you try to perpetrate, play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
(Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

Chorus

[Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up!
Stop the beat A minute!! I got somethin to say
Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
(The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit

[Dre] Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
[Em] I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
[Dre] Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

[Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin of havin them thoughts thought up!
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

See me on the street I won't speak
Cause I'm all that - and what crews despise
To the 600 backboard on 2-K-5

Just deliver the powers(?), steady knockin off bitches
Blunts and Hennessey bottles - straight ahead, full throttle
Never follow nobody cause I'm a leader myself
Never workin for no cracker like a Keebler Elf
I did it for delf, niggaz wanna look for the best
Pull out your you. S. Map and look to the West

Won't stop us from seein your black ass and makin it ours
Tinted our cars, platinum bars, weed delivery run

Known for the flow when downsizin a four-oh
And hittin suv's hooked up, by 3-1-0
And I can't stands no man
Smack dab in the middle of me and my plan?
I blast with either hand
Why don't you try Cortizone ten I heard it helps
When your neck wrist and ankles, is covered with wealth
But I couldn't tell you how to treat that hole in your chest
Shoulda wore a vest, now you just a motherfuckin mess
I used to have A. 22, my khaki's I was saggin em
Now I'm sportin Polo, and A. 44 Mag-a-num
Shameless plug - Likwit Crew, dj Pooh
Make you booboo in your Fubu, runnin right through you

While you watchin in black and white
With foil on the rabbit ears

So if you owe Catash some dough, you best go rob a Denny's
I don't care where it's from, I'll count ten G's in pennies
Cause I'm shifty when it comes to puttin food on my plate
Rap it ain't my only lick, but I push it like weight
+Cash+, multi-mill', fuck chasin a deal
I'm by the freeay with a sign that say ""Will kill for scrill""
Dollar bills is who I chase in this rap race of drama
If she owe Catash some dough, I might kidnap yo' momma
+Cash+, peep how far I came along
I charge twelve G's a verse, so that's 36 a song
Niggaz got it all wrong, y'all got this ballin distorted
If you gotta ask the price that means you couldn't afford it
+Cash+, fuck the acre, we want the paper
Tash just bought a skyscraper in Jamaica
Fuck y'all little fakers tryin to ball with Big Tash

Poisonous poet, I Master ""p"" like uhhhhhhh!!!

Herb you just and ingrown hair in the world of tweezers
We can dance before I crack mc's like Gator in jungle fever
Got them speakin in number like Soundscan
Severed the ears off your soundman, black Israelite
Like four-hundred and forty-four thousand
Niggas talk like dog, we'll walk like cat
I'm Ozzy Osbourne bitin the head off of rats
When they started bustin, fuck the Russian
We playin West Indian Roulette, ? Some of mine? Blind get wet

Give birth to earth to planet, we harder than granite
And concrete, man made could never compete, complete down to the core
Weighing in tons, hotter than lava, God, Javi, Jahovah, Allah heavenly Father
Nuns to bank robbers, wealth beyond the dollar
Here to school the scholar, make new born babies
No live for no bitch or lady, they try to play me
We flowin like the Mississsippi to the River Euphrates
One-hundred and eighty times two, one complete rotation
Fit any situation for a small donation, live on location
Third planet from the sun
Travel 24 hours you spend a lifetime to run
Witness the slave shot he bolted to a gat and a gun
>From Hitler, Musolini, to Attila the Hun
Imagine existence wit no fear, tears never she'd here
One day for me could last a thousand years
The first element baby, one two....

It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bounce it
Come on

The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behind the mic like Walker Kronkike
Y'all keep the spotlight
I'm keeping my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe
And call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit
That you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon shoot who? (Who?)
Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut now we break through in the rut
Hennesy and Orange Juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range
Going up and down my dick like the stock exchange

(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground

Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next X wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefa, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Ravel your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin
Rockin' chains, stadium, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop tops sittin' on twenties
Using rappers like crash test dummies
Stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight
When you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

What an event?
We hardcore 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel?
No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck
Demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
It be like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stagger tracks, strangle the beat
Restless no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Bejamin Greet
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chair
(Not these niggas again)
Come back, bounce in the spot and slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle

Everybody, here was born to hustle
It's a very thin line between the boss and the muscle
We foot soldiers
Face first in the trenches
Only time I'm on my back is fucking these
Hoes and weight bitches
Hell's kitchen, raw kitchen
Never crying and bitching and settling
For less
Metal in your chest, take a final breath
Revolutionary
It's X-man the mercenary
Carry A. 44 desert eagle
Feeding my people even if it aint legal
Low-ride in the regal or the cadillac
Money stack probably give yo ass a

Purchased your last cd I want my money

You see the battle Ima see you in the

Survival of the first to draw the heaters
And the cannons
I'm guaranteed to be the last man standing

I hear it all the time
Livin life for the day
Easier to burn than papier-mache

Graduate to radioplay
I still ain't satisfied
Bout to blast off worldwide
Get in line check the politics
Ever wonder why only certain
Motherfuckers get rich
Ain't this a bitch
Barely can eat, barely can pee
I dedicate my life to the street
It's not for you if your stomach is weak
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets
That's the only time I really find peace
Having violent stand-offs with the police
North Hollywood beef
Grinding my teeth
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief
New breed I'm the bad seed
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes
Bleed
Dedicated to the niggas that despise us
So ain't nobody s'posed to be here
Besides us
Catch a flatline

[Verse One: Brother J]

African.
Very African. Come and step in brothers temple see what's happenin
From the bass low, coming down from below, Tell me what a sissy know.
Funkin lesson is a new flow
Stalking walking in my big black boots.
Living off the earth eating herbs and fruits.
The children await me by the mountain in the river.
And gather round the fire for the scroll that I deliver
Coming immaculate from the sand the the sky.
And devils taking pleasure want to measure how high.
Your body reveals you. Your mind can't catch it.
The nation of a God goes far beyond brackets.
Come into my oven devils come and you burn.
I can always catch a fire when my strenth is Black word
Yer pissin me off because you swear yer higher level.
Back to your cave. Get yourself together
Silly and Magilla. Chocolate and vanilla.
How could polar Bears swing on vines of the gorillas. Please
Yer just floating cause there's something amiss.
I'm up in the clouds. You're down in abyss
Your freakin while your teachin and your speaking rap rhymes.
It's halfway to the sun. That's the mortals last time.

[Chorus:]

[Verse Two: Brother J]

[How deep?]
Deep. Deeper than atlantis
Deeper than the seafloor traveled by the mantis.
You copycats will never know.
For you the funk will never flow... And that's another blow.

Make your move beef appretice, I never step.
I'm a tribal move your master hasn't figured yet.
Run your weapons through my swords and shield
What's the higher level if your shit ain't real
My mystic magic, What cha gonna do.
Think befor youe step upon the rebel silly mortal you
You try to come but your mind won't catch, it's like cookies in the oven
If you want to burn a batch you just burn.

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: Brother J]

Like this like that like that like this
How sharp is a word. How firm is a fist.
Originals come from the sand and the sword in the concrete,
Fighting wars in the street.
The day of outrage history another page.
You lack the word of this, but now there is a brother J
We're the warriors, of the masses.
All the benelovent, punks playin asses.
You damn sissies always flunt for the glory.
Sissy bomb is coming, but that's another story.
So many people forgot where they came.
Disrespect religion, but their living is lame,
Black watch how you living? (zoom)
Flow in the nile (zoom)
Then record the seconds, The time of a sundial.
What we see for the Gods to be
What it was, what it is and again shall be.
What's my mindstate if my state ain't Black,
But Moses, Malcolm and Huey your back.
Go from [?] go from verb to verb,
Sit back and take heed, brother
You must learn!
Swimming in the books, but the books ain't hittin.
The scales of a Blackman.
Ways of the livin."

There's no beginning and there is no end

[Brother J:]
Once again, the illogical one
Bring your mind state to dark side of the sun
Music for creators to give no slacks
So I stepped from the board to keep my eyes on black
Now my religion is reality come take a drink from the great verb stick
Coming with authority grouping the majority this is not your gimmick or
Your fraudulent trick
Now I see children of originals doomed to lose
Teachers and preachers remain confused
Talking about humans in true black ways
Talking revolution and you're out to entertain
Ignorance, I grab you by your crackhead neck
Take you back to Egypt where you'll learn respect
And on one knee and through one way
You'll follow out the path of the new sun way
Let it click, here comes the royal of authority
Grooving up the masters of majority
People have a problem with my step
But you see I'm an example of the X
I travel with my bag with my books and fruits
Rose up the? Frowl? Not jeans and boots
Tip from the sundial time for the drum
Dum-diddy-dum funk coat has begun to the scales

Above all of [? ] I rise like the sun
Like the moon above day palms
Where there is light I enter absolute
Where there is dark there is none of me

I am sworn to life, I am bound to death
I take my oath under the sword

[Tom Tom Club:]
There's no beginning and there is no end

[Brother J:]
Scale of [? ] speak ballads
I never I'll, I never will, I won't have it
You see queens are of men and real men don't play
It's like moon for the night time and sun for day
I am an African, I don't wear Greek
Must of we be reminded of the legendary thief
Who tried to make peace in comparison to Egypt
But they got gypped cause their minds not equipped
I see a cave boy and they try to play black
Give a +Gasface+ and you're bound to get slapped
And don't play stupid I'm a pyramid stalker
Witness my soul on the bas-? Road
Chilling with the pharaohs and my ages has been
Doing this forever and you asked since when
Time is but a word and of little concern
And not another second will we red burn
To walk one way and to walk one path
Ways of the scale of the aftermath

There's no beginning and there is no end

Welcome to my science now seems you're always with it
Brother J, funk me, I come again, I stick it
Some say it's too deep and some say strong
Some say the truth hurts and I say wrong
Awaken Osiris, it's time for war
Mount your chariot, I can't take no more
Life or death, it doesn't matter I come again
There's no beginning and there is no end
Popped the stage, turn the page
Coming of Isis, Queen Mother Rage
Witness the s** Overseer the X
Verbalizer funk and listen give a taste, what's next
Show and improve, what's the true move
You come inside and present the strong groove

Blood to the concrete, tears to soil
And here's another word to make the other man foil
War, raised on your planet to a caveboy oppressor
Great one sends the aggressors
Thought we weren't comin but it seems you made an error
Wrench in the mill work, systematic terror has arrived
Cornered by the order
Checkmate sucker, not a move, game's over!
Clocks bending backwards, many cannot get with me
A logical man, I'm the epitome
My black folks travel hard with claws of steel
Hearts kneel to the raw that speaks the deal
Vanglorious, voice of the many
Voice of the many of the man wanna get me
It's not safari, so don't make a move
Protection is the reason it's a different groove
Sun up to sun down yo check the time
Mystic magic is more than a rhyme
I bring a little taste of the unearthed bass
Problem with the truth? Then bring it to my face
I'm outraged as I write the page
A sun forged sword mince a wimp twelve gauge
Any day my son, I don't like guns
I don't like roses that I step on for fun
In the first place, 3rd Bass? I'm at home
Waitin for the pitch so I can chrome your dome
A Brother grand slam cuts a vine like butter
Pick up my monkey and back to the mother
On to the road to pimp the unpimpable
The untouchable, doin the impossible
Kill the world of the age it flees

At the road, witness me
Before the coming of the Sun;
Peeking at you from the Eastern side of Plutonia
Dressed in armor of Order, to meet destiny with a strong Black grip
Ten hun-zu, see you in from the Zero, take 'em to the three
Stand firm at the five; here's a star and a shield to support you
At the nine!

It's like A - D - A - M
Prepare your mind, run tell your children
Fire, air, water, let the Earth make flesh
Now see from the Father, how funky can you get?
Now my activity is cosmi-tivity
Immortal is my soul, my God, my reality
I'm not measured by tradition, or any type of 'ligion, huh
Not even cosmic dimensions and such
But many fools, they try to post a duel
Try to post a front but they know it ain't cool, yeah
Boy, my mind goes back to things, just like the cosmic battle
When sword was my rattle
Shield was my bib, and sarcophagi my crib
Not measured by my words, but the deeds that I did for God
Illogical god, I was created and formed
Verbal shogun, yes, the cosmic storm
Who? Scrolls to lyrics to bust
I roll 'em up with the papyrus, funk sealed, in God we trust
I laid it down from circumference to dry space
And now I'm back again, quite lyrical, to kick my bass
Energized by another plane
By logical fanatics, when trying to examine my brain
They can't beat me, so they try to eat me!
They can't keep me, so they try to freak me
Positive sin, again and again, degrees in a spin
Verbs all your silly mortal g-g-grin
Make you feel you could drown in some godly waters
Take control of your body like the farmer's daughter
And as you beg for control, what's the reason? What's the reason?
Yo, I am son of the Chaos so my brothers call me Cosmic
Teh-hun-zu for tribal, Brother J when trying to rock it
Six-foot black boot god in the suit of the warrior
So now I'm taller 'n 'ya,check'n me out
A - D - A - M
Prepare your mind, run, tell your children
Fire, air, water, let the Earth make flesh
Now see from the Father, now how funky can you
Get get get get get down, the rhythm must come to such
When it's time to bust, and all the mortals lay crushed...
Dark sun will get darker
'Cause I existed in the valley of the Father
I got whooped by my mate
'Cause the fruit had a taste
Of the curse that served as a marker
Now here we go, to deal, with all the little ""-isms""
To define me in simple ""-ologies,"" Hell no!
On with the flow, here we go, sickamo'
Let us slip on back into the Blackwards row
Niggas didn't catch it anyway
They pat me on the back, talkin' 'bout ""Yeah, J""
Well yeah, right
East I flow, East I go
Cover both your eyes, and what do you know?
What do you see? How does it be?
Is it circumference, or what's up, G?
It's like that on the break, with a verbal milkshake
And a godly vainglorious break

You shall be moved, logical one!
After a clear pouncing with energy from the Sun
At my beckoning - you and your landmark built
Without the Zero pride
Shall crumble, stumble my way to might

I once walked the Heavens with Gabriel
Walked through the desert with Israel
Traveled onto Mecca with Ishmael
I'm crucified, resurrected - now ask how I feel
A - D that I AM, that I AM
From Father flesh to Father Solomon
From the pinky to the thumb 'pon my hand
Bring a other Caddy and a tribal j-j-j-jam
But yet I'm judged, leather prophet and all that
Still a pimp, with a crown and a Yankee hat
And yet they ask me, ""Brother, what's the time?""
It's a African drum with some space-age rhymes, man
Yo not at all, I say it's sexual, infectual, delectable
I'm not a masturbating intellectual
And couldn't read it from a book because that bores you all
So come to Umoja, Kujichagulia
Ujima, Ujamaa, and purpose stands for ""Nia""
Kuumba, Imani, daughter named [?]Simani[?]
Came to the planet, Father [?]Afer[?] left his body

Yes! I'm that kind of nigga
The one you fear, be scared you can't figger
The one that has the finger on the trigger, boom!
In the cut of zoom
In the darkness, the halo, the moon!
Stepping ta' ya' real soon
Ah! Check the blackness!
Me before those enter the lightness!
Masturbating!
Masquerading!
And you call your self righteous?
Follow me!
A peripheral, missionary, and ark commit-ness
Having intercourse with the nation of darkness!
Books with worms!
Jherri suited with last names like perms!
Niggas, get your hands of your cracks, come to terms with yourself
If you don't get any bigger
Pink Caddy driving, black boot stomping
Yes! I'm that kind of nigga
Brother J, whatcha' say?
Brother J, Brother J, whatcha' say?
Brother J, whatcha' say? Brother J, whatcha' say?

[Brother J]
Yeah!
I'm just a pro-Black nigga, and I'm doing this
And yet you watch me, clock me, to see if I continue this
In the ways of the Caddy I survive like a pimp
No jherri curls, waves, perms, or crimps
The ever-nappy crew setting the mood
I raise my fuel for my firm attitude
Walking through the streets with my war cry spear
Certain folks know it means doom when they hear
My firm, black boots with no spurs attached
Now let me take a second, cause I might detach
My black boots if you confuse
I lose my peoples in the words you choose
For writer was wrong, or, man, what you think?
Accept my Black, so how the hell you diss Pink?
And yet you wanna' be down, clown
So many wanna' be down, with the illogical ark
Steppin' through your cave-boy crew
Your nest of war, with your bald hair-do!
Media weapons!
News at 11!
Paper at 6 or systematic tricks
And that's why I do what I do
Say how I feel so you get it on the real
True, true, any rapper will subdue
Try to test some buddy business
And submit my whole crew
The front page, says outrage
There's no gauge, cause it's time for the mac!
Tune in your radio, video, stereo and all that
To the vibes of the pro-Black
It's like that as I wind up my wrist
Check out the smack of the scientific fist
But on a level to the East I go
Cause with Freedom or Death, there's no choice, you know?
Still on the topic of the P-are-O
When I pass my verbs, stick to brother P-X-O

[Professor X]
Over and under as I progress to this
Got no time to be hanging out with humanists
Raise a flag, fly the, tag the hand, clutch the fist
Serve we nationally comes the diss
Humanity keep it with us we break edicts
Milwaukee, the brutality, how can you dismiss?
So, off to the road we go you know
Follow the pro-nigga flow
Off to the road you know we go
Follow the pro-nigga flow
For you and yours, legislation
Past-purpose agitation
By way of the old??? Emancipation
Zoom, zoom, zoom revelation
Cometh pro-Black dedication
The solution: revolution
Evolution
The conclusion: the trigger!
Please, a let me take a swigger
And if you don't get any bigger
Yes, I'm that kind of nigga!

To the East, my brother, to the East!

[Brother J]
Yeah!
Revolution, evolution, the solution
No amendments, and burn the Constitution
You take the authors, a bunch of old wig-ers
Who ratified extinction of the poor, Black niggas
Know why? Cause I'm that nigga that they can't stand
That teach an African how to say, ""Black man!""
And I'm that nigga they can plainly see
With the nationalist colors of the red, black, green
Yeah! I'm the one who cut Tarzan's vine
Ran his ass out the jungle with his homeboy swine
One of those brothers that they just can't find
That makes 'em shake and make 'em shiver when it comes nighttime
Yeah! A boom-bap with a pro-Black slap
The old systematic dues
All Irish do Japs. Yeah!
You hear me? Boy, you'd better make way!
Enough action and totally nothing to say
And here's a message to the Rainbow crew
And their fearless leader, Captain Human:
Revolution is not humanism!
Individualism and not separatism!
Hey! Point blank, living-ism is a tank
Cause there's just some things that I never forget:
I remember green suits on a Black mayor;
I remember nine-millimeter child slayers;
I remember all the times that you called me an animal
But in Milwaukee there's a cannibal
Check it! Some of the things that you just don't figure
Cause it gets a lot Blacker and a whole lot bigger
No matter, nightstick or bring your big trigger
Our nation is protected by some pro-Black niggas!

[Professor X]
Making note of some minors. I'm not talking baseball, cause if I was
Brother J, we'd be playing professional. There nine innings to a

Perceptive
Courageous
Outspoken)

[ verse 1: Brother J ]
One man is not a nation, Brother builds a Clan
Certer than the circle creates the better man
The colors, the brothers, the key, the motherland
This causes to assemble this blackman
Red, Black and Green are the colors of the flag on the rise
Cause a nation should be guised
Another flowing, as I comfort sons and daughters
Knowledge leads the way, so I flow like Nile's waters
African-American rebel of authority
Majority, while I'm so-called minority
Sometimes they ask me, ""Why are you the rebel?
Is that the way you choose, attain the bass and treble? ""
Yup - ""Brother, don't get deep,"" that's what they tellin me
Just like a sell-out, while society
Gets stronger and stronger, my race gets weaker and weaker
Maybe I can make a difference through a mic and a speaker
So my lyrics flow different than a hip-hop be bop
Mic controller who turns out to be the flop
My wisdom God-given, excercised 'pon a rhythm
Power postive and strictly Bible, that's how I'm livin
Fortress we establish high, so none attack it
Back to the ways of our mathmatic blackness
They can't solve it, it's somethin they can't catch
Took respect off our lives, so now I'm snatchin it back
Power flows in the nation, there is life in the key
Let us all bind together in the Red, the Black, the Green

[ verse 2: Brother J ]
One vanglorious way, through the heart, unified
And that should be the guide
For the younger nation, so they can build the tribes
After and beyond keep the colors alive
A message through lyrics and beats composed
Bring composure outstanding direct to those
Who understand what was taken, xeroxed and stripped naked
Today's pig shall be tomorrow's bacon
Education brings false words, what do they teach?
Everything that I learned I had to self-reach
What do you know of a race that's dyin hourly?
The smartest men in the world, they in a bowery
Or either trapped or brain-washed on a come-up
Kicked to the butt, wake up, are you some kind of nut?
Are you blind, can't you see what's never seen?
We need some unity within the colors of the (Red, Black and Green)

[ verse 3: Brother J ]
Garvey-like brotherhood flows with the vibe
And with the key, the flag is kept alive
The sense of power, native to a different land
Originality, fact that I understand
A black fist, black power and a black man
X Clan take a stand with the other hand
Usin this as a gimmick, yo man, I'll catch you
Fetch you, kick my foot and then direct you
In the right path, succotash
Don't ask me 'bout the aftermath
You do what? Don't make me laugh
Dummy, I am protected by forces beyond you
Think before you step before the rebel, silly mortal, you
Wearin Mother's tags, and you don't know what they mean
All you are concerned with is greedy man's green
Sportin your medaillons, cause they matchin with your outfit
Your posse's wearin it, man, that's so illegit
Without definition you represent the fraudulent
Blessed with blackness, but now you're just doggin it
Tooth for tooth, and a man for man
Ignorance take a pause and we'll all understand
Independence is one thing when unity is stronger
No one to realize the pressure last longer
I'm just one man who fears for the worst
Cause if we don't take a stand someone will step first
And then...

Could never hang with the words, that ever caused the clamor
I'm singin ""Raise the Flag"" cause I hate the Spangled Banner
Because you can't get with me, you label me enemy
Your comments on the mortal side are labelled as blasphemy
More than I am, puts the taste in the dam
Puts the X in the Clan that puts the brother on land
It's like that y'all, ya don't stop
Because the sight of the Watch is sure to shock
From the beginning
From the beginning is it winning, is it ever?
Unearthly, resistance, forever
You think your thief based system is clever?
It's a simplistic, endeavor
I checkmate, terminate, never late, contemplate
Mindstate is never fake, hesitate you lose
No shoes ever do I kick around in boots
I simply drop the science that just speaks about the [?]
In our nature's, flavor, lacking from the coon
Now our dream for the younger, when will the rover take reign?
Is it a joke or something you can't cope with
Devils keep avoiding, people keep on hopin

Day two-dark-zero-zero and it circles degree
Brother one makes up a system bring oppressors to knees
I speak a language universal, check on how I use it
Dwellers of this planet, labelled it as music
I come and I go from where the land where the milk flows
Earthbound to mortals what they lack the Brother will know
I'm buildin temples made of many dimensions
Illogic and cosmic, are not an extension
Now many many gather and they say, ""Bro J;
Tell me the direction of the crossroad way""
Up on the down stroke, valley in the middle
On through the thorns as if you could ever figure
Nothin is balance unless balance is irregular
Misplaced, heed chaos to bass
Some talk to doo-doo, and miss the voodoo
I'm like the guru, your baby's doin judo
Why don't you just sit, and contemplate on this
This is much more than your white boy diss
Or your fat gold chain, the wash on your brain
The fleas in your system, what then remains
But a science that's deeper than deep, nine the odd
Harder than hard so now the journey to Gods begins
From the blood to the greenest of earth
Elemental is my nature and the strength in my verse
And zeroes who remain in two truth is key
To release us from the shackles Armageddeon will be
It's like that y'all, ya don't stop
Ah Sugar Shaft in the house ya don't stop
Ah Brother J funkin lesson ya don't stop
Ah Paradise architect ya don't stop

Blackwatch for the justice you don't quit..

Ahhhhhh... Listen
With a diamond in the back, a sunroof top
A ride called pinkie, and a black boot to the pedal
Pushin us to the full nine

Now mortals aware, now prepare for illogical son
My Verbs of Power are the spiritual spank
My deep, deep Blackness, your mind gets dank
Revelation to Genesis, something you cannot dismiss
Keys to Crossroad, come to abyss!
And find a verb-stick swingin' while I'm livin', giving the rhythm
Heed the word, and the bass-drop given!
A funk down, super sound, lyrical, visual
Illogical wisdom, forever continual
You're living simplistically, yet speak of reality
Your science, elementary - Dare speak? You can't get with me
Look at the wax, it's hieroglyphic, it's actual fact
I'm not reading and striving to wanna be Black
Here's the move 'cause I see none
I never boast, I never brag, I get the job done
I'm not the [? Buckley?] political, nor am I the physical
The rhythmical spiritual, the mystical magical
Movement is circle, never 90 degrees of a square
I'm the gorilla - robotics will run in a scare
Just to find that the zero's the ground
Come into my temple, have a seat at the round, feel the power

Professor Overseer, I've got pimp in my crown
It was the pimp that drove the mountainous elephant
It was ignorance that made this irrelevant
I'm not the pasta boy, I'm the African, call me by name
I'm the original, I taught you to set up this game
You silly mortal, keep on playing the Trump
I think they're gonna have to get me,
From stompin' and kickin' your rump
Once again, now it comes in the trend
I said ""Free South Africa!"" - you went to Berlin
Now there's the problem, I stand firm, beating my chest
You think a silly polar bear could ever put this to rest?
And yet they still will apologize, while I will epitomize
Embrace my children, show them Creator's eyes
Onto the path of the mystical teaching the math
No more to suffer - it's time for the wrath
Feel the power

On to the throne, the throne I come forth
Weapon of our rule, the verbs of great Thoth
Look at the sundial, look at the child of man
Where's the faith in the Spirit, the master plan?
Opportunity - the spoils of religion of God-man
Hero to rescue the drum jam
Fire, water, air and earth, I am the fool
Teaching power that I never could learn in school
I am the teacher from the far and beyond
Turn an apple to a lotus, turn a rib to a wand
To compare me or dare me is foolish, it's more than a job
No entertainment - illogical odd god
Has come - straight from Amon-Tet with the herb dish
Come with the Verb Stick, the bag of the new tricks

That's the power"

Will give more reason to impeach a president
And all the puppets in the other square lay
Supporting three Ks and Amerikkka can wait

Cause apples pie's toxic, it slurs my words
And how could I reach a Black nation?
The vibration, sensations, like that!
Is that a combat? And either pimp slap?
There's other missionaries who would have me off track
But heed is a lead is a positive sin
And you can't you can't stop me, so let's stop your grin

As we begin with the warrior's flex

Try to play my mind, try to play me humdrum

More and more and more, and this loud cry, Free?
Siggy-siggy glance and the
Now my attitude is worse than an ak
Clip never stopping when it's time to kick or spray!
I jiggy-jiggy-jiggy-judge a brother won't budge
Now kick it to the middle, cause that's how you get 'em
Now, God, now what's a brother do?
I try to keep my patience, but now I'm out the truth
One-Zero, now I crew shoed
Bad attitude cause I have enough food
Next days, they try to condemn me
But, yo, I'd just be me as it remains it will be
Friggy way these verbs stick the whole nine
Part of the thighs of the cosmic child
Got your clean cut American
Strictly African, my look is terrorism
What's the seravist, don't call me Communist!
I'm just a bro'!
Not New Jack or Joe
And Freedom or Death, this means I'm going for broke
It means my life is my death
My attitude should reflect
I met a dude, the cosmic god
All father respect

Value in your system rejects to feeling outrage? Take a sip. Ah! Feel
The surge. The red! The black! The green! Through your veins to your

Back from the peak of Heaven, the depths of Hell
If you feel voodoo, and here's my spell
To teach my people, and, Yes, rock well
And very, very black
I hear some niggas talking 'bout they'll paint the White House black
I'd blow the sucker up and pressure on the attack
And Frontline, you'll find, the government swine
Find themselves caught up in a bind

A vibe in a vigour
A pro-Black nigga, Black nigga, Black nigga!

Or down with Swiss Miss or anyone from the abyss?
We're down to the core
I can't take it no more!
With no legend or
Almost prove law
With no funny moves for the earthly residents

The flick of my cigarette and your Mother's on her knees

On her knees
Turning tricks for me
Giving up the honey
Bringing me the money

Your cheap momma and her monkey and the kindness of my heart
Is all that keeps your family together in this white trash trailer park
Your wacked out momma she's a junkie, she's gotta have her stash
So she walks the street, sells her soul and brings me back the cash

She's so cheap
She'll always need me
You know I own you
We own the streets

Until the last chapter's mastered

The proof you pretended to carry to the end
Barely alive, but nowhere near dead

More than a misfit's pistol grip click

Overstands warfare, caught in the crosshair
The moment when focus becomes more
Than what's noticed by the starving locusts

The burning of the pride, turning of the tide
Searching through the fight
Snuck in with the shadow that broke the castle
Escaped the cell, let hell out of the capsule

I am the hunted that stalks my aggressor
I am neurosis, I am the measurements used
When it's time to choose which tools are proper
For the opportunity to break it loose

When it breaks, it'll all come together now

Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board with this blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest is the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
The elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
Its going down
Stalence emulation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
Its going down to sub-terrestrial high

Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

Eight blocks from flushin metal where my family settle

Used to link up with Nas, from Corntop Choice, for female persuasion
Bustin off in the park, that was in the dark

There's a hero,
If you look inside your heart,
You don't have to be afraid of what you are.

There's an answer,
If you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know will melt away.

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can survive.
So when you feel that hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.

It's a long road,
When you face the world alone,
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold,

You can find love,
When you search within yourself,
And the emptiness you felt will disappear.

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can survive.
So when you feel that hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.

Ooh
Lord knows,
Dreams are hard to follow,
You don't let anyone take them away,
Hold on,
There will be tomorrow,
In time you'll find the way.

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can survive.
So when you feel that hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.
That a hero lies in you.
Ooh
That a hero lies in you."

Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to say
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away

Out of my mind
Tell me where I'm what's going on, oh please

Is this the wall of my heart

For long time I've been searching for my way

I carry on, carry on...

To this so stood world

Don't wanna be down

Everynight hurt is so deep in my heart

It's so painful, stop it!
Is there someone to help me
Please get me out of here
Oh! Get me out!

Get it settled once and for all
Dead or alive, can't live in the past
Only one way to live

If I could only turn my back
Let me do screaming high
Squeeze the throes of death for me

Fall on me as if it grow in my brain

Disclose the feeling inside of me

Why do you live alone
If you are sad
I'll make you leave this life
Are you white, blue or bloody red
All I can see is drowning in cold grey sand

The winds of time
You knock me to the ground
I'm dying of thirst
I wanna run away
I don't know how to set me free to live
My mind cries out feeling pain

I've been roaming to find myself
How long have I been feeling endless hurt
Falling down, rain flows into my heart
In the pain I'm waiting for you
Can't go back
No place to go back to
Life is lost, Flowers fall
If it's all dreams
Now wake me up
If it's all real
Just kill me

I'm making the wall inside my heart
I don't wanna let my emotions get out
It scares me to look at the world
Don't want to find myself lost in your eyes
I tried to drown my past in grey
I never wanna feel more pain
Ran away from you without saying any words
What I don't wanna lose is love

Through my eyes
Time goes by like tears
My emotion's losing the color of life
Kill my heart
Release all my pain
I'm shouting out loud
Insanity takes hold over me

Turning away from the wall
Nothing I can see
The scream deep inside
Reflecting another person in my heart
He calls me from within
""All existence you see before you
Must be wiped out:
Dream, Reality, Memories,
And Yourself""

I begin to lose control of myself
My lust is so blind, destroys my mind
Nobody can stop my turning to madness
No matter how you try to hold me in your heart
Why do you wanna raise these walls
I don't know the meaning of hatred
My brain gets blown away hearing words of lies
I only want to hold your love

Stab the dolls filled with hate
Wash yourself with their blood
Drive into the raging current of time
Swing your murderous weapon into the belly
""the earth""
Shout and start creating confusion
Shed your blood for pleasure
And what? For love?
What am I supposed to do?

I believe in the madness called ""Now""
Past and future prison my heart
Time is blind
But I wanna trace my love
On the wall of time, over pain in my heart
Art of life
Insane blade stabbing dreams
Try to break all truth now
But I can't heal this broken heart in pain
Cannot start to live, Cannot end my life
Keep on crying

Close my eyes
Time breathes I can hear
All love and sadness
Melt in my heart

Dry my tears
Wipe my bloody face
I wanna feel me living my life
Outside my walls

You can't draw a picture of yesterday, so
You're painting your heart with your blood
You can't say ""No""
Only turning the wheel of time
With a rope around your neck
You build a wall of morality and take a breath
From between the bricks
You make up imaginary enemies and are chased by them
You're trying to commit suicide
You're satisfied with your prologue
Now you're painting your first chapter black
You are putting the scraps of life together
And trying to make an asylum for yourself
You're hitting a bell at the edge of the stage
And
You are trying to kill me

I believe in the madness called ""Now""
Time goes flowing, breaking my heart
Wanna live
Can't let my heart kill myself
Still I haven't found what I'm looking for
Art of life
I try to stop myself
But my heart goes to destroy the truth
Tell me why
I want the meaning of my life
Do I try to live, Do I try to love
In my dream

I'm breaking the wall inside my heart
I just wanna let my emotions get out
Nobody can stop
I'm running to freedom
No matter how you try to hold me in your world
Like a doll carried by the flow of time
I sacrificed the present moment for the future
I was in chains of memory half-blinded
Losing my heart, walking in the sea of dreams

Close my eyes
Rose breathes I can hear
All love and sadness melt in my heart
Dry my tears
Wipe my bloody face
I wanna feel me living my life
Outside my mind

Dreams can make me mad
I can't leave my dream
I can't stop myself
Don't know what I am
What lies are truth?
What truths are lies?

I believe in the madness called ""Now""
Time goes flowing, breaking my heart
Wanna live
Can't let my heart kill myself
Still I haven't found what I'm looking for
Art of life
I try to stop myself
But my heart goes to destroy the truth
Tell me why
I want the meaning of my life
Do I try to live? Do I try to love?

To disappear, throw away love's gleaming replica.

I'll be sailing down and I will know
I know I can clear clouds away
Oh Is it a crime to love

Swing the heartache
Feel it inside out
When the wind cries
I'll say goodbye
Tried to learn Tried to find
To reach out for eternity
Where's the answer
Is this forever

If my love is blind
Crucify my love
If it sets me free
Never know Never trust
""That love should see a color""
Crucify my love
If it should be the way"

No matter how many tears I she'd
I probably won't be able to forget about you
Just tell me my life
Make a faded and sleeping rose
Beautifully bloom in your heart

When you live your life honestly
Then the night reflected in your eyes, certainly leaves behind only shining dreams
Forgetting the loneliness that greets the morning
I held my red wrists and cried
Let the night end

Shaking, with the door of my memories closed
Cutoff memories accumulate in my blue lips
Oh-Rusty Nail

No matter how many tears I she'd
I probably won't be able to forget about you
Just tell me my life
No matter how far I try to walk
I won't be able to see tomorrow through my tears

Pain adorns my heart... And even now
I won't be able to forget about you"

I know I cannot get enough of you
Come into my life again
I wanna see you, love you, feel you
When were getting old the time goes by
It aint to late before we die
We gonna leave the bad times
And we gonna leave everything behind again
You know, you re always on my mind
We gonna leave everything behind
(Chorus 1x)
You came like a thief at night
You broke the door and took me right
Now I pack my bangs and go
To hunt you, somewhere else, I know
We gonna leave the bad times and
We gonna leave everything behind again
You know, you re always on my mind
We gonna leave everything behind
Come into my life
Come into my life
(Chorus 1x)
Come into my life
Come into my life
Come into my life"

that I've met you at a show
you were the clown
I was the fool

Right now it's vice versa

youve always been
the fool for me

Do we feel the same way
or do want to play the game of love

You took me to a bar
to tell me who you are
you never know
what you want

And you want me for good

I don't care if you love me
Cause I don't love you anymore

I know it can't be good for me

The love left at the break of dawn
While you were sleeping, sleeping on
I wrote a letter on the floor
Cause I don't love you anymore

I don't care if you love me

To kill anyone

Then imma bring it back to a haywire day prior to when people did it wack.
Better bet on that. Yeah you can trust me I'm just psycho.
I go michael, I'm so gyro. When I rap it's a wrap because even I know that.
It's probable that's it's impossible I'm not unstoppable.
Cause I'm passing all my obstacles on the globe.
Can't decide if I'll keep the beat alive,
Kill it with the pans in the kitchen, or stab(Bed) it with a knife.
Either's aight.
So if you view me as a humble dude then trouble's brewed and I'll make a
Subtle move that'll puzzle fools. I'm coming through to out-hustle you.
Lyrically crossing up you young bloods, hip hop's version of Uncle Drew.
Quick syllables, erratical is how imma go. Panic or you'll have it when I'm
On a roll.
Intangible, infallible. I'm an animal. Manic and I'm automatic in a flow.
Better be hoping you're gonna get a miracle. But it's unlikely now.
I'm the one you clowns used to clown. How ya like me now?
And the question isn't a rhetoric. But answer wrong and I'm gonna be
Leaving your face so fu[n]ked up they'll have to make a new emoji for it.
So forfeit.
Or I'll be jarren (jarrin') you till you look just like a swizzzle stick,
Spinning till you quit. Come to think of it. My saliva did it all: it's
Competed in monday night wwe and that is why I spit it raw. I'm nasty like
Holy smokes, leaving people in awe. You're nasty like ew that's gross.
Leaving me just like awe... Look at that wittle cutie patootie, a rappin
Newbie with his groupies attached, who be the doody and crap. And he be
Soothing me fast, grooving me smoothly. His track's really moving me to a
New bat, making me smack myself 'till I'm blue and a black. Then I'll be
Doing that to all the artists who claim that they are the hardest 'cause
They had a bowl of rocky road. While I'm so hard that I once drove down a
Rocky road eating a rocky road with Dwayne Johnson and Sylvester Stallone.
I'm leaving people in a fear when I'm here cause addicted to a style
Different than an average kid's. This toilet paper represents your whole
Career so I half-ripped it.
Then, I went to put it to a use and wiped my ass with it."

Cause when I was a kid I was deviated, head butted the norm and affiliated

Domination
For the day they would praise such a craze in amazement
Instead they began to stare so I escalated to an elevated place called my

Never gonna figure what happens in my mind, Imma do it even when I get on

Kill it every single time I rhyme cause that’s (what I do)
Thrilin' ‘em with rhythm so divine cause that’s (what I do)
Mention lyrics so ridiculous cause that’s (what I do)
Always spittin' so meticulous (doom-pa-dee-do)
Got a factory that’s filled with bars cause that’s (what I do)
Shot for the sky but now I’m on Mars cause that’s (what I do)
Rappin' as if I was from afar cause that’s (what I do)
Actin' so bizarre

(Verse 1)
Aw shit
Hittin' em with the raw shit
They gonna think that I lost it
When I’m puttin' the beat in a coffin
Messed up when you messin' with the best stuff
Rest up cause everything gonna get tough
Guess what? All imma do is get buck
Cause you suck, I’m wondering who is next up
I’m a line leader and a mind reader and a rhyme eater, you a caboose
Because I’m cleaner and I rhyme neater, you define weaker, better cut lose
I took a big look a bit at these cookie cutter schnooks and shook a bit
I don’t like the look of it

Oompa Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da
If you're not greedy, you will go far
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa doom-pa-dee-do

Go berserk and wack up on the track cause that’s (what I do)
Merk ‘em turn to Taz and then I spaz cause that’s (what I do)
Smirk and get 'em nervous then just snap cause that’s (what I do)
Make ‘em gasp when they feel my wrath
Gobs of stoppers that I throttle at cause that’s (what I do)
Pop their noggins off with bottle caps cause that’s (what I do)
Bop ‘em till they drop with wonka bags cause that’s (what I do)
Got ‘em all to ask

(Verse 2)
I chisel the beat
There ain’t no similar me
The hate they threw’s why I Gru into a Despicable Me
And attack anybody makin' me back track
That’s that, hittin' em with a whack and I get em a bit of a sma-ack
And I gra-ab 'em then I’m rippin ‘em in half as I la-augh
I’m glad to be back, but where am I actually at?
All this calamity is maki’n me wonder where reality’s at
I guess I took a hit then everything slowed down as if I was like Brook a bit

X-Phaze,Pretend,/x/x+phaze/pretend_21060413.html,"(Intro)
I'm slowly pacing down the street with my face down
I'm feeling like I fell face down
Better late than never, but it's already too late now
The race is over so there's nothing to erase now
And even though I keep my pace now
I feel like I'm being chased down
To a different place now
And there's now escape now
Don't know if I am awake now
Or spaced out
But I know I will never get faked out

(Chorus)
Imma get my grind up
Imma get it
I done made my mind up
Let this shit begin
If you with me now
Be down to the end
Homie ain't nothin' changed
I'm going for the win
Cause this ain't just pretend (x4)

(Verse 2)
Man, I be dedicated
And I be underrated
While these overrated rappers are gonna be over exaggerating
About a zany payment that they think will make 'em famous
But nah, what makes you make it is effort and concentration
That's why I give it my all no matter what the circumstance is
Or the challenge that I'm handed even when I'm reprimanded
I can't be distracted cause I'll end up stranded which would be tragic
Single handed, I'm commanding my passage to living lavish
I'm eyeing to ascend
I'm trying to contend
And I'm dying for the win
So if you ain't with me now when I've got struggles and pain
Then don't expect to be in attendance when imma make it to fame
You better remember the name, Phaze

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Exaggerators, duplicators, imitators and traitors and all the
Haters get the best of me
Fakers get the rest of me
Foes turn into friends and friends just end up being enemies
That's why their entity will never be
Inside my memory
So the make believe cannot mess with me
This aint pretend this is reality
There ain't no run throughs or take twos so the fake fools won't last a
Beat
So you can have it all or have a seat
You can face your biggest fears or you can face defeat
See, life is what you make of it
You ache a bit
You take a sip
You aim to hit then miss and wanna quit
But it's too late for it
I favor greatness
Everything is at stake to make it
So I must take the facts and face 'em and forget the fakeness

(Chorus)

(Outro)
Focus now or get spaced out
Be strong or you'll break down
Be real or get faked out
Cause this ain't just pretend"

Blowing across the yard it's crisp and it's cool

And stubbornly I remain under a tree
The wind gusts up stronger from time to time
We're supposed to grow cold as the day wears on
I'm'a looking for the future, today, today, today, today

And at the same time I am dreading the outcome of our actions
Fall makes me feel a little sad sometimes
Whip out the sweater and the second layer and it's time for a change
And surely it's the way,
Oh boy, oh shit!

He seemed unconcerned with my purity of expression
And I can see his point, which is all well and good

Sometimes I'm not sure if I can see my...

You do just fine and you won't next time
If you want it [Repeat x4]

Back to the weather, I must admit it looked pretty nice
Why are my legs shaking
Why are there still mosquitoes
Shouldn't they be in bed and dead by now
