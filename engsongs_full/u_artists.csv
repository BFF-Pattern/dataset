UK's National Anthem,God Save The Queen,/u/uks+national+anthem/god+save+the+queen_20983467.html,"God save our gracious Queen
Long live our noble Queen
God save the Queen
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen

O Lord our God arise
Scatter her enemies
And make them fall
Confound their politics
Frustrate their knavish tricks
On Thee our hopes we fix
God save us all

Thy choicest gifts in store
On her be pleased to pour
Long may she reign
May she defend our laws
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice
God save the Queen

Not in this land alone
But be God's mercies known
From shore to shore
Lord make the nations see
That men should brothers be
And form one family
The wide world over

From every latent foe
From the assassins blow
God save the Queen
O'er her thine arm extend
For Britain's sake defend
Our mother, prince, and friend
God save the Queen

Lord grant that Marshal Wade
May by thy mighty aid
Victory bring
May he sedition hush
And like a torrent rush
Rebellious Scots to crush
God save the King"
U2,11 O'clock Tick Tock,/u/u2/11+oclock+tick+tock_20141536.html,"It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
And the boys and girls collide
To The music in my ear

Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home

A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong

Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home

Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

La lah la lah... La lah la lah... La lah lah...

Sad song, sad song

Call out your name
Call out in shame
Call out your name
Call out
You better call out
Call, call, call out"
U2,40,/u/u2/40_20141614.html,"I waited patiently for the Lord

Out of the miry clay

I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song

How long to sing this song
How long to sing this song
How long... How long... How long...
How long... To sing this song

He set my feet upon a rock
And made my footsteps firm
Many will see
Many will see and fear

I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song

How long to sing this song
How long to sing this song
How long... How long... How long...
How long... To sing this song"

Don't go

I believe you set me free
I believe you can loose this chains
I believe you can dance with me
Dance with me

Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!

I believe in the third world war
I believe in the atomic bomb
I believe in the powers that be
But they won't overpower me

And, and you can go there too
And, and you can go go go go

Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!

And we don't have the time
And everything goes 'round and 'round
And we don't have the time
To watch the world go tumbling down

Go! Go!

I believe in the bells of Christ's Church
Ringing for this land
I believe in the cells of Mount Joy
Doesn't understand

And, and you can go there too
And, and you can go go go go

I believe in the walls of Jericho (And you...)
I believe they're coming down (Can go there too)
I belive in this city's children  (And you...)
I believe the trumpet's sound (can go go go go)

And you can go there too
And you can go go go go...

I believe in what I'm doing
What am I doing here..."

Look from the outside
To the world I left behind

I'm dreaming
You're awake
If I were sleeping
What's at stake
A day without me

Whatever the feelings
I keep feeling
What are the feelings
You left behind

Today's a day without me

I started a landslide in my ego
Look from the outside
To the world I left behind

In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes, and then let go
To the world I left behind
Shed a tear, and then let go..."

On you
So small
Down there
From here
So high

We fly
Twilight breaks through
A different kind of blue
More lights
Blue signs
All gold

Down there
Tonight
With twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue
Twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue"
U2,A Man And A Woman,/u/u2/a+man+and+a+woman_10160907.html,"Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
Take the heat from the sun
Little sister
I know that everything is not ok
But you're like honey on my tongue

True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
No I could never take a chance
'Cause I could never understand
The mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

And you're the one, there's no-one else
You make me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mine...

Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God

The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants... The soul waits...

No I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

For love and faith and s** and fear.
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

How can I hurt when I'm holding you?"
U2,A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel,/u/u2/a+room+at+the+heartbreak+hotel_20141556.html,"From where I stand
I can see thrugh you
From where you're sitting, pretty one
I know it got to you

I see the stars in your eyes
You want the truth, but you need the lies
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino
You give your life for rock n' roll
Uh huh

Stand, we're on a landslide of love
You got everything you want
But what you need you give away

For primitive love
And a ride on the mistery train
A primitive love
A room at the Heart...
The Heartbreak Hotel
A room at the Heartbreak
Heartbreak Hotel
A room at the Heartbreak
Heartbreak Hotel

You say it's love, it's not the money
You let them suck your life out like honey
Turning tricks, you're on the street
Selling your kisses so bittersweet

[Gospel voices]

A primitive love
A and a ride on the mistery train
A primitive love
A room at the Heart
The Heartbreak Hotel

A room at the Heartbreak, the Heartbreak,
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel

U2,A Sort Of Homecoming,/u/u2/a+sort+of+homecoming_20141625.html,"And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Light in the distance

And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire, time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape

Oh, oh, oh...
On borderland we run...

I'll be there
I'll be there...
Tonight
A high road
A high road out from here

The city walls are all pulled down
The dust, a smoke screen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance

And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill
As the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of it's own

Oh, oh, oh... On borderland we run...
And still we run
We run and don't look back
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
Tonight

I'll be there tonight... I believe
I'll be there... Somehow
I'll be there... Tonight
Tonight

The wind will crack in winter time
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words, just a scream...

Tonight we'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again
Tonight

And your heart beats so slow
Through the rain and fallen snow
Across the fields of mourning
Light's in the distance

Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
For tonight, at last
I am coming home
I am coming home"
U2,Acrobat,/u/u2/acrobat_20141384.html,"Don't believe what you hear
Don't believe what you see
If you just close your eyes
You can feel the enemy
When I first met you girl
You had fire in your soul
What happened your face
Of melting in snow
Now it looks like this

And you can swallow
Or you can spit
You can throw it up
Or choke on it
And you can dream
So dream out loud
You know that your time is coming 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down

No, nothing makes sense
Nothing seems to fit
I know you'd hit out
If you only knew who to hit
And I'd join the movement
If there was one I could believe in
Yeah I'd break bread and wine
If there was a church I could receive in
'cause I need it now

To take a cup
To fill it up
To drink it slow
I can't let you go
I must be an acrobat
To talk like this
And act like that
And you can dream
So dream out loud
And don't let the bastards grind you down

Oh, it hurts baby
(What are we going to do now it's all been said)
(No new ideas in the house and every book has been read)

And I must be an acrobat
To talk like this
And act like that
And you can dream
So dream out loud
And you can find
Your own way out
You can build
And I can will
And you can call
I can't wait until
You can stash
And you can seize
In dreams begin
Responsibilities
And I can love
And I can love
And I know that the tide is turning 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down"

U2,All Along The Watchtower,/u/u2/all+along+the+watchtower_20141483.html,"There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them know along the line
What any of this is worth

No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who think that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And that is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
Because the hour is getting late

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While horsemen came and went
Barefoot servants too

All I got is a red guitar
Three chords
And the truth

All I got is a red guitar
The rest is up to you

There's no reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are some among us here
Say that life is just a joke
You and I, we've been through that
And that is not our fate (at least today)
So let us not talk falsely now
Because the hour is getting late
Late..."
U2,All Because Of You,/u/u2/all+because+of+you_10160906.html,"I was born a child of grace
Nothing else about the place
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face
And it left me no illusion

I saw you in the curve of the moon
In the shadow cast across my room
You heard me in my tune
When I just heard confusion

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am... I am

I like the sound of my own voice
I didn't give anyone else a choice
An intellectual tortoise
Racing with your bullet train

Some people get squashed crossing the tracks
Some people got high rises on their backs
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks
You can make me perfect again

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am... I am

I'm alive
I'm being born
I just arrived, I'm at the door
Of the place I started out from
And I want back inside

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am"

You say you want your story to remain untold

But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
A treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me eyes in a world of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold

Tonight this city belongs to me
Angel

So long...angel of Harlem

Birdland on fifty-three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles says she's got to be an angel

Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies

So long...angel of Harlem
Angel of Harlem

She says it's heart...heart and soul...
Yeah yeah...(yeah)

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting
Blinded you lost your way
Through the side streets and the alleyway
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight
An angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah yeah...angel of Harlem

Angel...angel of Harlem...

Waving a white flag
Baby got a white flag flying for you baby
Got a white flag, a white flag

Sent us home

With a black and blue
Working at the station
Where he can't break through

Was working on the coin
On the union stand
With a digital aid
And a union band

Saw a moving statue
Saw the bullet train
And a sheltered city
Where clowns scream

Our move ruined it
Saw the money god
Brothers say by a ring
Others sat by the brim

And now the eye of the needle is a heart denied

The search through shit for melody
A single scrap of dignity
In the junkyard of humanity
On the burning rubble and the sulphur sky
We look for clues yeah, you and I
Although the screams and the sirens wail
Is up for sale
The subway screech soars down the drain
The thunder when there is no rain

So why would I invite a complete stranger into my home
Would you?
These days are better than that

Every day I die again, and again I'm reborn

To walk out into the street
With arms out

Will not be drowned out

Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone

See the rain through a gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children

Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap
Spent the night trying to make a deadline
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline

I have your face here in an old Polaroid
Tidying the children's clothes and toys
You're smiling back at me, I took the photo from the fridge
Can't remember what then we did

I haven't been with a woman, it feels like for years
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose
The scent of it lingers and then it just goes

Return the call to home

The worst of us are a long drawn out confession
The best of us are geniuses of compression
You say you're not going to leave the truth alone
I'm here 'cos I don't want to go home

Child drinking dirty water from the river bank
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank
I'm waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon

Return the call to home

Now I've got a head like a lit cigarette
Unholy clouds reflecting in a minaret
You're so high above me, higher than everyone
Where are you in the Cedars of Lebanon?

Choose your enemies carefully 'cos they will define you
Make them interesting 'cos in some ways they will mind you
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends
Gonna last with you longer than your friend"

And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship, once it's won
It's won... It's one

Northside just across the river to the southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on cedarwood road, on cedarwood road

[Verse 2:]
Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
'cause it's never dead it's still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
I'm still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can't see
You can... You can

[Hook:]
Northside just across the river to the southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on cedarwood road, on cedarwood road

[Verse 3:]
If the door is open it isn't theft
You can't return to where you've never left
Blossoms falling from a tree they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place that we can call our home

Is a heart that is open"

Take these boots they're going nowhere
You know these boots they don't want to stray
You got my head filled with songs
You got my shoelaces undone
Take my shirt go on take it off me
You can tear it up
If you can tie me down

Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?

Take the colours of my imagination
Take the scent hanging in the air
Take this tangle of a conversation
And turn it into your own prayer
With my fingers as you want them
With my nails under your hide
With my teeth at your back and my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies.

Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?
And it looks like the sun but it feels like the rain

Love's a bully pushing and shoving
In the belly of a woman
Heavy rhythm taking over
To stick together
A man and a woman
Stick together
Man and woman
Stick together....

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

And it looks like the sun
But it feels like the rain
And there's heat in the sun to see us through the rain"

Goodbye and it's emotional goodnight

Are you still holding on
I'm not coming down

She takes the blame
She covers the shame
Removes the stain
It could be her name

Grace
It's a name for a girl
It's also a thought that
Changed the world

And when she walks on the street
You can hear the strings
Grace finds goodness
In everything

Grace
She's got the walk
Not on a wrapper on chalk
She's got the time to talk

She travels outside
Of karma, karma
She travels outside
Of karma

When she goes to work
You can hear the strings
Grace finds beauty
In everything

Grace
She carries a world on her hips
No champagne flute for her lips
No twirls or skips
Between her fingertips

She carries a pearl
In perfect condition
What once was hers
What once was friction
What left a mark
No longer stains

Because grace makes beauty
Out of ugly things

Grace finds beauty
In everything

Grace finds goodness
In everything"

That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you
It goes like this, the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
Though I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter what you heard
The holy or the broken, Hallelujah

Hallelujah...

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's no complaint you hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah

It's the stuff it's the stuff of country songs

I sure could use them here right now
Well if god will send his angels
Where do we go..."

Yeah, I'm feeling seasick again
The world could just dissolve into a glass of water
I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to
Do you really want me to be blue as you
It's her daylight that gets me through
We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The moon was naked and cold
I was like a two year old, just wanted more
If you wear that velvet dress (If you wear that velvet dress)
If you wear that velvet dress (If you wear that velvet dress)
Tonight the moon's drawn it's curtains
It's a private show
No one else gonna know I'm wanting

It's all feel-good
Sure it's ok
'Cause I'm always with you

Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear but nothing at all like the moon, it's ok
The struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
I got my own hands to pray
If you wear that velvet dress (If you wear that velvet dress)
If you wear that velvet dress (If you wear that velvet dress)
Tonight the moon is a mirror ball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls

If you wear that velvet dress"

To see me through
A warning sign

First the thunder Satisfied
Then the storm If the past it will not lie
Torn asunder The future, you and I
In the storm Get blown away

In a lifetime
In a lifetime

And as the rain it falls Begin again
Heavy in my heart As the storm breaks through
Believe the light in you So the light shines in you
Faded and worn Without color
Torn asunder in the storm Torn asunder in the storm

Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it disappears

First the thunder Selfish storm
Then the storm Hold on the inside
Torn asunder One life
In the storm In the storm

I'll be home, love

When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no end
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there

In a little while
I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running
To Sunday on my knees

That girl, that girl
She's mine
And I've known her since

Since she was a little girl
With Spanish eyes
Oh, when I saw her
In a pram they pushed her by

My, how you've grown
Well it's been
It's been a little while

Slow down my bleeding heart
A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocketship into the skies
He lives on star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail
The scatter of light

Turn it on
Turn it on
You turn me on

Slow down my bleeding heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my bleeding heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love"

Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls to me

Sleep comes like a drug
In God's Country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses
In God's Country

Set me alight
We'll punch a hole right through the night
Everyday the dreamers die
See what's on the other side

She is liberty
And she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold

Sleep comes like a drug
In God's Country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses
In God's Country

She stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love"

You didn't belong

To see the sun shining
On someone else's day

In the name of a father
And his wife the spirit
You said you did not
They said you did it

In the name of justice
In the name of fun
In the name of the father
In the name of the son

Call to me
No one is listening
I'm waiting to hear from you love

Stay with me

But there's peace in the sound
Of the white and the black
Spilling over

The light that strikes the tallest trees
Will light a way for I

The thinner the skin

Who's to know when the time has come around
Don't want to see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye

It's somewhere I can taste the salty sea
There's a kite blowing out of control on the breeze
I wonder what's gonna happen to you
You wonder what has happened to me

I'm a man
I'm not a child
A man who sees
The shadow behind your eyes

Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to say what it is will break you

The last of the rocks stars
When hip-hop drove the big cars
In the time when new media
Was the big idea
What was the big idea"

And we love to fly a flag
But I won't...let others live in hell
As we divide against each other
And we fight amongst ourselves
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song
Let the bells ring out
Let the bells ring out
Is there nothing left
Is there, is there nothing
Is there nothing left
Is honesty what you want

A generation without name, ripped and torn
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Nothing at all
And if you can't help yourself
Well take a look around you
When others need your time
You say it's time to go...it's your time
Angry words won't stop the fight
Two wrongs won't make it right
A new heart is what I need
Oh God, make it bleed

On the road to my regret
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me
They ask me to reveal
The very thoughts they would conceal

Makes a shadow of you and I
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea

In the palace of my shame
Said, love rescue me

In the cold mirror of a glass
I see my reflection pass
See the dark shades of what I used to be
See the purple of her eyes
The scarlet of my lies
Love rescue me

Yea, though I walk
In the valley of shadow
Yea, I will fear no evil
I have cursed thy rod and staff
They no longer comfort me

Climb up the mountains, said love
I said love, oh my love
On the hill of the son
I'm on the eve of a storm
And my word you must believe in
Oh, I said love, rescue me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...

Yeah I'm here without a name
In the palace of my shame
I said love rescue me

I've conquered my past
The future is here at last
I stand at the entrance
To a new world I can see
The ruins to the right of me
Will soon have lost sight of me

I want a close up of that face
Here comes the car chase

I bought two new suits, Miami

Two souls too smart to be in the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day

We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
But if love believes in me
Oh, believe in me

At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back
To my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released form control

I was punching in the numbers at the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down 'til the pain would stop

More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got

We're one
But we're not the same
Will we
Hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law

You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should

One life
With each other
Sisters
Brothers

One life
But we're not the same
We get to
Carry each other
Carry each other

One... Life

One"

One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing

I'm on an island at a busy intersection
I can't go forward, I can't turn back
Can't see the future
It's getting away from me
I just watch the tail lights glowing

One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
Knowing, knowing

I'm hanging out to dry
With my old clothes
Finger still red with the prick of an old rose
Well the heart that hurts
Is a heart that beats
Can you hear the drummer slowing?

As the day begs the night for mercy love
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows
Only scars carved into stone
On the face of earth
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes

You run like river, on like a sea
You run like a river runs to the sea

And in the world a heart of darkness
A fire zone
Where poets speak their heart
Then bleed for it
Jara sang, his song a weapon
In the hands of love
You know his blood still cries
From the ground

It runs like a river runs to the sea
It runs like a river to the sea

I don't believe in painted roses
Or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
I'll see you again
When the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red
Over One Tree Hill

We run like a river
Run to the sea
We run like a river to the sea
And when it's raining
Raining hard
That's when the rain will
Break my heart

Raining... Raining in the heart
Raining in your heart
Raining... Raining to your heart
Raining, raining... Raining
Raining to your heart
Raining... Raining in your heart
Raining in your heart..

If we can't feel ordinary love
And we can't reach any higher,
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Birds fly high in the summer sky and rest on the breeze.
The same wind will take care of you and I.
We'll build our house in the trees.

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years I would believe that the would couldn't wash it away

'Cause

I was so sad (so sad)
It was so bad

I had the opinion it was out of control

Go to the school and girls
They make children
Not like this one

I was of a feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control

I was of a feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control

I fought fate
There's blood on the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood

One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late

Who bring me down to roof, remind me whatўs in coming
And who comes first?  Who comes first?

Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day

I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun,
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

Again and again
That there's gonna be

Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies

They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you

And it's already gone too far
You said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt

Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth

Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth

No who's or why's
No one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth

She never got to say goodbye
To see the color in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth

They're reading names out
Over the radio
All the folks the rest of us
Won't get to know

Sean and Julia
Gareth, Anne, and Breeda
Their lives are bigger than
Any big idea

Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth

To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth

Jesus in the song you wrote
The words are sticking in my throat
Peace on Earth

Hear it every Christmas time
But hope and history won't rhyme
So what's it worth

This peace on Earth

Peace on Earth

You had to win, you couldn't just pass
The smartest ass at the top of the class
Your flying colours, your family tree
And all your lessons in history
Please, please, please, get up off your knees
Please, please, please, please

So you never knew how low you'd stoop to make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground until they made you crawl
So you never knew that the heaven you keep, you stole
Your catholic blues, your convent shoes
Your stick-on tattoos, now they're making the news
Your holy war, your northern star
Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car
Please, please, please, get up off your knees
Please, please, please, leave me out of this mess
So love is hard and love is tough
But love is not what you're thinking of

September, streets capsizing
Spilling over, down the drain
Shards of glass, splinters like rain
But you could only feel your own pain
October, talk getting nowhere
November, December
Remember, we're just starting again
Please, please, please get up off your knees
Please, please, please, please
So love is big, it's bigger than us
But love is not what you're thinking of
It's what lovers deal, it's what lovers steal
You know I found it hard to receive
'Cause you, my love, I could never believe"

In the night of love
Words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cut
Like a switchblade to my heart
Words tearing me apart

She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run, she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
Then I just melt away
She's a mystery girl

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

Haunted by her side
It's a darkness in her eyes
That so enslaves me
And if my love is blind
Then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me

Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell
Am I left to burn
And burn eternally
She's a mystery to me

She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl

She's... A mystery girl
Mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's... A mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl
She's a mystery girl"
U2,Silver And Gold,/u/u2/silver+gold_20141513.html,"In the shit house a shotgun
Praying hands hold me down
Only the hunter was hunted
In this tin can town
Tin can town

No stars in the black night
Looks like the sky fell down
No sun in the daylight
Looks like it's chained to the ground
Chained to the ground
The warden said
The exit is sold
If you want a way out
Silver and gold

Broken back to the ceiling
Broken nose to the floor
I scream at the silence, it's crawling
It crawls under the door
There's a rope around my neck
And there's a trigger in your gun
Jesus say something
I am someone, I am someone
I am someone

Captain and kings
In the ships hold
They came to collect
Silver and gold
Silver and gold

Seen the coming and going
Seen them captains and the kings
See them navy blue uniforms
See them bright and shiny things
Bright shiny things

The temperature is rising
The fever white hot
Mister, I ain't got nothing
But it's more than you got

Chains no longer bind me
Not the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners
Inside the free
Set them free
Set them free

A prize fighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts
Silver and gold
Silver and gold"

Read about the politician's lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why don't you
You dress in the colours of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else's suicide
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

Dreams, 
It's a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there's no daylight, there's no healing

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

Hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else's pain

You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take flight
Like St Francis covered in light
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight"

She does it slow... Dancing
All night long

Scarlet eyes and a see-through heart
She saw me coming right from the start
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just a' beggin' her, beggin' her please

Take me slow dancing
Slow dancing
She took me slow... Dancing
All night long

And I don't know a man
Search for himself in his lover's eyes
No I don't know why a man
Sees the truth but needs the lies

My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience, I don't want it back
It just gets in the way

If you wanna go slow dancing
Slow dancing
She took me slow... Dancing
All night long

Slow... Dancing
Slow... Dancing

I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted

They pass right through you like a ghost
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
Baby, you're nowhere

You're so cruel

Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie

Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug

Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
Oh...love...sweetheart...
You're so cruel

She wears my love like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing
Her movements something else
Oh love...like a screaming flower
Love...dying every hour...love

You don't know if it's fear or desire
Danger the drug that takes you higher
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire

Her heart is racing, you can't keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust
We are trampled underfoot

Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
Oh...love...sweetheart...

And what you got is not enough

Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy
Your skin is white but you think you're a brother

Some sunny days you wish it was raining
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in

Taking you to another place

Some days are honest, some days are not
Some days you're thankful for what you've got
Some days you wake up in the army
And some days it's the enemy

Lookin' for Jesus and His mother

Listen to the call of the rescue team
We have no water, light or bread

Don't try too hard to think... Don't think at all

I'm not the only one starin' at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb I'm staring at the sun
Not the only one who's happy to go blind

There's an insect in your ear if you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you want to see what the scratching brings
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach...
Will we ever live in peace?
Cause those that can't do often have to
Those that can't do often have to... Preach

To the ones staring at the sun...
Afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb... Staring at the sun
I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind

Intransigence is all around... Military is still in town
Armour plated suits and ties... Daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle God is good but will he listen
I'm nearly great
But there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free
Though you never really belonged to me

And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

To claim the victory Jesus won

Is it only me who sees
There’s something wrong there

I can see you
You need to see me

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way

I saw you on the stairs
You didn’t notice I was there
That’s 'cause you were talking at me and Not to me

You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you your liberty

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
It’s the little things that tease and betray
As the hunted I become the prey
It’s the little things
The little things that give you away

Sometimes I can't believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I can’t get back inside

Sometimes the air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all of my innocence has died

Sometimes I wake at four in the morning
When all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any song will reappear

Sometimes the end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes when the painted glass shatters
And you’re the only thing that matters
But I can’t see you through the tears
Sometimes the end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes"

Got up one morning, went out to plow,
  Tee roo, tee roo, went out to plow,
With sixteen oxens and a darned old cow,
  Tee roo, tee roo, and a darned old cow.

Up stepped the old devil sayin', ""How do you do?
There's one in your family that I must have.""

""Oh, please don't take my oldest son,
There's work on the place that's got to be done.""

""It's all I want's that wife of yours."" (2x)

""Well, you can have her with all of my heart,
And promise me you'll never depart.""

He picked her up upon his back,
He looked like an eagle skeered off of the rack.

He carried her on about half of the road,
He says, '""Old woman, you're a devil of a load.""

He carried her forty long miles or more
He carried her on to the old devil's door,

There stood a little devil with a ball and a chain,
And up with her foot and she kicked out his brains.

Nine little devils went climbing the wall,
Saying, ""Take her back, daddy, she'll murder us all.""

Got up the next morning, peeped through the crack,
I spied the old devil come wagging her back.

And now you know what a woman can do,
She can whup out the devil and her husband too.

Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower & you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely & the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky & the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the

""The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry"" is one of numerous tales of
The Silkies, or seafolk, known to the inhabitants of the Orkney
Islands and the Hebrides.  These enchanted creatures dwell in the
Depth of the sea, occasionally doffing their seal skins to pass
On land as mortal men.  Legend has it that they then accept human
Partners, and some families on the islands actually trace their
Ancestry to such marriages.  In more complete versions of the
Ballad, the Silkie's forecast of the death of himself and his son
Eventually come to pass.  The tune is by Dr. James Waters of
Columbia University.  From ""British Ballads and Folk Songs from
The Joan Baez Songbook. ""

In simmer, when the hay was mawn
And corn wav'd green in ilka field,
While claver blooms white o'er the ley
And roses blaw in ilka bield
Blythe Bessie in the milking shiel
Says;-'I'll be wed, come o't what will!'
Out spake a dame in wrinkled eild
'O guid advisement comes nae ill.

'lt's ye hae wooers monie ane,
And lassie, ye're but young, ye ken!
Then wait a wee, and cannie wale
A routhie butt, a routhie ben.
There's Johnie o the Buskie-Glen,
Fu is his barn, fu is his byre.
Tak this frae me, my bonie hen:
It's plenty beets the luver's fire!
For Johnie o the Buskie-Glen
I dinna care a single flie:
He lo'es sae weel his craps and kye,
He has nae love to spare for me.
But blythe's the blink o Robie's e'e,
And weel I wat he lo'es me dear:
Ae blink o him I wad na gie
For Buskie-Glen and a'his gear.

O thoughtless lassie, life's a faught!
The canniest gate, the strife is sair.
But ay fu-han't is fechin best
A hungry care an unco care
But some will spend and some will spare
An wilfu folk maun hae their will
Syne as ye brew, ny maiden fair,

'O, gear will buy me rigs o land,
And gear will buy me sheep and kye!
gut the tender heart o leesome loove
The gowd and siller canna buy!

Light is the burden luve lays on;
Content and loove brings peace and joy:
What mair hae Queens upon a throne?

From your house to mine is no more than a step
Now that we are alone give me a hug

An arrow in the air cupid launched
And as it went playing, I was the wounded one

Unknown,Clementine,/u/unknown/clementine_20169288.html,"Clementine

In a cavern, in a canyon,
Excavating for a mine,
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter Clementine.

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
Thou art lost and gone forever,
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.

Light she was and like a fairy,
And her shoes were number nine,
Herring boxes without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Chorus

Drove she ducklings to the water
Every morning just at nine,
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine.

Chorus

Ruby lips above the water,
Blowing bubbles soft and fine,
But alas, I was no swimmer,
So I lost my Clementine.

Chorus
Then the miner, forty-niner
Soon began to peak and pine,
Thought he oughter jine he daughter,
Now he's with his Clementine.

Chorus

In my dreams she still doth haunt me,
Robed in garments soaked in brine;
Though in life I used to hug her,
Now she's dead, I draw the line.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A remarkable ballad developed in San Francisco toward the end of
The nineteeth century.  It became a favorite college song during
The Reconstruction period.

Additional verses (Boy Scouts and others)Rg

In a churchyard, 'neath a gravestone
Where the myrtle doth entwine.
There are posies, and some roses
Fertilized by Clementine.

How I missed her, how I missed her
How I missed my Clementine!
Till I kissed her little sister
And forgot my Clementine.

All you Boy Scouts, take fair warning
From this dreadful tale of mine.
Artificial respiration
Would have saved my Clementine.

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day  and night.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star whereever it went.

This star drew nigh to the northwest;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.

Then they did know assuredly
Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Death took the husband of a neighbor of mine,
On a highway, with a drunk at the wheel.
She told me ""Keep your clean hand off the laundry he left,
And don't tell me you know how I feel. ""
She had a tape that he had sent her from a Holiday Inn,
And she never played it much in the day,
But when I heard him say he loved her through the window at night,
I just stayed the hell away.

[Chorus:]
There's a hole in the middle of the prettiest life,
So the lawyers and prophets say.
Not your father nor your mother,
Nor your lover's gonna ever make it go away.
And there's too much darkeness in an endless night
To be afraid of the way we feel:
Let's be kind to each other,
Not forever, but for real.

My father never put his parachute on,
In the pacific back in World War ii.
He said he'd rather go down in familiar flames
Than get lost in that endless blue.
And some of that blue got into my eyes,
And we never stopped fighting that war,
Until I first understood about endlessness,
And I loved him like never before.

(to chorus)

It's just lucky that my daughter got her mother's nose,
And just a little of her father's eyes,
And we've got just enough love that when the longing takes me,
Well, it takes me by surprise.
And I remember that longing from my highway days,
Though I never could give it a name.
It's lucky I discovered in the nick of time
That the women and the child aren't to blame

(second chorus)
For the hole in the middle of a pretty good life,
I only face it 'cause it's here to stay.
Not my father nor my mother, nor my daughter, nor my lover,
Nor the highway made it go away.
And there's too much darkness in an endless night
To be ashamed of the way I feel:
I'll be kind to my loved ones, not forever, but for real.

(final chorus)
Some say that God is a lover,
Some say it's an endless void.
Some say both, and some say She's angry,
And some say He's just annoyed.
But if God felt a hammer in the palm of His hand,
Then God knows the way we feel.

Or they'll all get eaten up by the snails.

     CHORUS

You'll take my advice, gentle Annie,
And you'd better watch your chappie goin' away
With his packbag flung over his shoulder,
And he stole some knives and forks the other day.

     CHORUS

The bullocks they are yoked, gentle Annie,
For you know with you I can no longer stay.
So I'll bid you adieu, gentle Annie,
Till we meet you on another threshing day.

     CHORUS

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The original song, ""Gentle Annie,"" seems to have been written by
Stephen Foster in 1856.  Like many good songs, it found it way to
Australia, where it took on local references and, perhaps, a more
ambiguously sensual flavor.  This version appeared in print in
Vol. I, no.e, (1964) of Australian Tradition, and was recorded by
Martyn Wyndham-Road. Thence via Joe Hickerson to Ed Trickett to
me.

Recorded on Side 2 Band 4 of ""Turning Toward the Morning""

Good King Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen.
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel.

Hither page and stand by me if thou knowst it telling
Yonder peasant, who is he, where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes' fountain.

Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pinelogs hither
Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither
Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament, and the bitter weather.

Sire the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart I know now how, I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps my good page, tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed
Therefore Christian men be sure, wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing.

I shall have an old age, full of rum and riot.

I shall be an old man, ribald coarse and bloody.

I have never slit throats, even when I yearned to.
Never sang dirty songs that my fancy turned to.

   To cast me off discourteously.
   For  I  have  loved  you well and  long,
   Delighting in your company.

   Greensleeves was all my joy
   Greensleeves was my delight,
   Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
   And who but my lady greensleeves.

   Your vows you've broken, like my heart,
   Oh, why did you so enrapture me?

   But my heart remains in captivity.

   I have been ready at your hand,
   To grant whatever you would crave,
   I have both wagered life and land,
   Your love and good-will for to have.

   If you intend thus to disdain,
   It does the more enrapture me,
   And even so, I still remain
   A lover in captivity.

   My men were clothed all in green,
   And they did ever wait on thee;
   All this was gallant to be seen,
   And yet thou wouldst not love me.

   Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
   but still thou hadst it readily.
   Thy music still to play and sing;
   And yet thou wouldst not love me.

   Well, I will pray to God on high,
   that thou my constancy mayst see,
   And that yet once before I die,
   Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

   Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,
   To God I pray to prosper thee,
   For I am still thy lover true,
   Come once again and love me.

+1985 Mark Cohen

The sky's clouding over, there's a breeze off the mountain
A chill in the air and the sound of the rain
It washes the trees and it fills the gray river
But it won't clean these hands and it can't heal the pain
I'm nobody special, I'm somebody's neighbor
Had a job in a store and I made decent pay
My wife and I lived in a two-room apartment
We'd a nine-month-old daughter and one on the way

It was Saturday night, I'd been working till seven
And then I'd gone out with the boys for a drink
Got home after nine, I was tired and hungry
And a little bit drunk, and in no mood to think
My wife was asleep and the baby was crying
Dirty dishes and diapers were piled around
She woke up and saw me, said, ""Please feed the baby,
I'm tired and sick, and I need to lie down. ""

I guess it was building a long time inside me
It must have been smoldering over the years
The dishes, the crying, the tiny apartment
Something let go, and my eyes blurred with tears
It seemed like her crying would go on forever
Louder and louder it pounded my brain
My thoughts were a fog of frustration and anger
I had to do something to stop all the pain

They say they don't know if she'll ever be walking
They say that my wife and new baby are well
They tell me I'll be here a little while longer
But there's one thing that nobody ever can tell
What makes a man raise his hand to a baby?
How can he strike his own daughter or son?
I wake every day to a nightmare of sorrow
And I wish that these hands could undo what they've done

And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.

O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.

Ev'rywhere you go; 
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again 
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Toys in ev'ry store, 
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
On your own front door. 

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots 
Is the wish of Barney and Ben; 
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk 
Is the hope of Janice and Jen; 
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Ev'rywhere you go; 
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, 
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; 
Soon the bells will start, 
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing 
Right within your heart"

To swell the glorious chorus of ""the Quakers be damned.""

(John Pierpont, 1859)

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Cho: Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.
Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
Two-forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead.

There were three jovial fellows
Came over the hill together.
Came over the hill together
To make up a jovial crew.

And they ordered their pints of beer
And bottles of sherry
To help them over the hills so merry,

When Jones's Ale was new, me boys,
When Jones's Ale was new.
And the first of them was a tinker,
And he wasn't no small ale drinker.
He was a jolly beer drinker
Among this jovial crew.
And he called for a pint of the very best ale
To drink a whole gallon he never would fail.
To drink a whole gallon he never would fail,

When Jones' Ale was new, me boys

And they ordered their pints of beer

When the landlord's daughter, she came in,
And we kissed those rosy cheeks again.
We all sat down and then we'd sing.
When Jones's ale was new, me boys,
When Jones's ale was new.

And the next to come in was a soldier
With his flintlock upon his shoulder,
For none could be more bolder,
And his long broadsword he drew.
He swore every man should spend a pound,
And they should treat all hands around.
Then he jolly well drank their healths all 'round
And the next to come in was a dyer
Who sat himself down by the fire,
'Cause that was his desire
To make up a jovial crew.
And the landlady told him straight to his face
The chimney corner was his own place,
And there he could sit and dye his own face,

And the next to come in was a mason.
His hammer needed refacin'.
His hammer needed refacin'
To make up a jovial crew.
So he threw his old hammer against the wall,
And he hoped that the church and the chapel would fall,
For that'd make work for masons all
And the last to come in was a hatter,
And there was no man ever fatter.
No man could ever be fatter

Written by Rouget de Lisle, a young officer in the French army
Stationed in Strasbourg in 1792.  It was played at a patriotic
Banquet at Marseilles, and printed copies were given to the
Revolutionary forces then marching on Paris.  They entered Paris
Singing this song, and to it they marched to the Tuileries on
August 10th.  Ironically, Rouget de Lisle was himself a royalist
And refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new
Constitution.  He was imprisoned and barely escaped the
Guillotine.

Smut, give me smut and nothing but, a dirty novel I can't shut
If it's uncut, and unsub-tle
I've never quibbled, if it was ribald,
I have devoured where others merely nibbled,

And as the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my Aunt Hortense,
To be smut it must be ut-terly without redeeming social importance.

All books can be indecent books, though recent books are bolder,
For filth, I'm glad to say, is in the mind of the beholder.

I thrill to any book like Fanny Hill, and I suppose I always will
If it is swill, and really fil-thy.
Who needs a hobby, like tennis, or philately? I've got a hobby-
Re-reading Lady Chatterly. But now they're trying to take
It all away from us unless we take a stand and hand in hand we fight
For freedom of the press, in other words smut (I love it!)
Ah, the adventures of a slut. Oh, I'm a market they can't glut
I don't know what compares with smut. Hip hip hooray let's hear it
For the Supreme Court. Don't let them take it away.

My name is Macnamara,
I'm the leader of a band,
And though we're small in number,
We're the best in all the land.
Of course l'm the conductor
And l've often had to play
With all the fine musicians
That you read about today.

Chorus:
The drums they bang, the cymbals clang,
The horns they blaze away,
Macarthy puffs the ould bassoon,
Doyle (And I) the pipes does play.
Hennessey tuteily tootles the flute,
The music is something grand,
And a credit to ould Ireland's boys
Is Macnamara's Band.

Whenever an election's on
We play on either side,
And the way we play the fine ould airs
Fills every heart with pride.
If dear Tom Moore was living now
He'd make them understand
That none can do him justice
Like ould Macnamara's Band.

Chorus.

We play for fairs or weddings
And for every County Ball,
And at any great man's funeral
We play ""The Dead March in Saul.""
When General Grant to Ireland came
He shook me by the hand,
And said he never heard the like
Of ould Macnamara's Band.

Chorus.

Just now we are practicing
For a very grand affair,
It's an annual celebration,
All the gentry will be there.
The girls and boys will all turn out
With flags and colours grand,
And in front of the procession
Will be Macnamara's Band.

We'll rally once again,

And frequently she turned it loose
Upon the bank to play,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.
The sojers eyed it from the shore
In a kleptomaniac way,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.

Cho:

""What makes the men love mutton so?""
The colonel he did cry,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.
'Cause mutton makes the whiskers grow, ""
The sojers did reply,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.

Our pickets saw it too,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.
And speedily it simmered down
Into a mutton stew,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.

And Mary never more did see
Her darling little lamb,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.
For the boys in blue they chawed it up,
And didn't give a damn,
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom.

Unknown,O Canada,/u/unknown/o+canada_20172265.html,"Canada-I-O

Come all ye jolly lumbermen, and listen to my song
But do not get discouraged, the length it is not long;
Concerning of some lumbermen, who did agree to go
To spend one pleasant winter up in Canada-I-O.

It happened late one season in the fall of fifty-three
A preacher of the gospel one morning came to me;
Says he, ""My jolly fellow, how would you like to go
To spend one pleasant winter up in Canada-I-O?""

To him I quickly made reply, and unto him did say,
""In going out to Canada depends upon the pay.
If you will pay good wages, my passage to and fro,
I think I'll go along with you to Canada-I-O.""

""Yes, we will pay good wages, and will pay your wages out,
Provided you sign papers that you will stay the route;
But if you do get homesick and swear that home you'll go
We never can your passage pay from Canada-I-O.""

""And if you get dissatisfied and do not wish to stay,
We do not wish to bind you, no, not one single day,
You just refund the money we had to pay, you know,
Then you can leave that bonny place called Canada-I-O.

It was by his gift of flattery he enlisted quite a train,
Some twenty-five or thirty, both well and able men;
We had a pleasant journey o'er the road we had to go,
Till we landed at Three Rivers, up in Canada-I-O.

But there our joys were ended, and our sorrows did begin,
Fields, Phillips and Norcross they then came marching in.
They sent us all directions, some where I do not know,
Among those jabbering Frenchmen up in Canada-I-O.

After we had suffered there some eight or ten long weeks,
We arrived at headquarters, up among the lakes;
We thought we'd find a paradise, at least they told us so,
God grant there may be no worse hell than Canada-I-O.

To describe what we have suffered is past the art of man;
But to give a fair description I will do the best I can:
Our food the dogs would snarl at, our beds were on the snow,]
We suffered worse than murderers up in Canada-I-O.

Our hearts were made of iron and our souls were cased with steel,
The hardships of that winter could never make us yield;
Fields, Phillips and Norcross they found their match, I know
Among the boys that went from Maine to Canada-I-O.

But now our lumbering is over and we are returning home,
To greet our wives and sweethearts and never more to roam;
To greet our friends and neighbors; we'll tell them not to go
To that forsaken G---- D--- place called Canada-I-O.

Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land

In all our trials born to be our friend.

Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,

But do you recall 
The most famous reindeer of all? 

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 
Had a very shiny nose, 
And if you ever saw it, 
You could even say it glows. 
All of the other reindeer 
Used to laugh and call him names; 
They never let poor Rudolph 
Join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, 
Santa came to say&#58; 
Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? 
Then how the reindeer loved him 
As they shouted out with glee, 
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, 
You'll go down in history"

I guess they figured he knew best,
So they built a town around him
And they called it Mobile,
(Where's that?) Alabama.

They took a swampland, heavy with stream,
They added people with a dream,
And that dream became a heaven
By the name of Mobile.

Pretty soon the town had grown
'Til they had a slide trombone,
And a man who played piano,
And a swallow who sang soprano.

No use your wondrin' where you should go.
It's on the Gulf of Mexico
Where the southern belles are ringin'
And the climate's ideal,
It's a honeysuckle heaven
By the name of Mobile.   Yaahhhhhh!

They've been friends long enough to say hello with a smile
Though it feels like coming home is still weeks away
Me and this country band have come here to play

Play a sweet one for the encore and let's soften the pace
Pass my hat to the crowd while you tune up your bass
Slow the tempo down, Charlie, I'll take the mike from the stand
We'll save the best for the last, to send 'em home hand in hand

I'm sorry to hear Fred left us last year
It's so good to see your face, your smile is so clear
I remember how he'd waltz you across the ballroom
Would you dance with an old friend in the light of this moon?

At the new faces mixed with those mellowed with age
Oh, for thirty-odd years I've rolled over this land

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
  Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
  For once she was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt...
Without any seam or fine needlework..

Tell her to wash it in yonder dry well
Where water ne'er sprung nor drop of rain fell

Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn
Which never bore blossom since Adam was born

Now he has asked me questions three
I hope he will answer as many for me

Oh, will you find me an acre of land
Between the sea foam and the sea sand

Oh, will you plow it with a lamb's horn
And sow it all over with one peppercorn

Oh, will you reap it with a sickle of leather
And tie it all up with a peacock's feather

And when you have done and finished your work
Come to me for your cambric shirt

I stepped on board a vision and I followed with the wind
And I shortly came to anchor at the cross of Spancil Hill

When lreland's sons and daughters in crowds assembled there
The young and the old, the brave and the bold their journey to fulfill
There were jovial conversations at the fair of Spancil Hill

I went to see my neighbors to hear what they might say
The old ones were all dead and gone and the young one's turning grey
I met with the tailor Quigley, he's a bould as ever still
Sure he used to make my britches when I lived in Spancil Hill

I paid a flying visit to my first and only love

She threw her arms around me saying ""Johnny I love you still

Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen,

G                        D        G

To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,

No maid I've seen like the brown colleen

That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped I shook my head
And I gazed with a feeling quare,
And I said, says I, to a passer-by,
""Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?""
Oh, he smiled at me, and with pride says he,
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown,
She's young Rosie Mccann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the Star of the County Down. ""

I've travelled a bit, but never was hit
Since my roving career began;
But fair and square I surrendered there
To the charms of young Rose Mccann.
I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet
Did I meet with in shawl or gown,
But in she went and I asked no rent
From the Star of the County Down.

At the crossroads fair I'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
And I'll try sheep's eyes, and deludhering lies
On the heart of the nut-brown Rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Though with rust my plow turns brown,
Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the Star of the County Down.

Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
As it fitfully blows half conceals, half discloses?

Our national anthem was written by Frances Scott Key during the
attack of the British on Fort Mchenry, September 13, 1814.  Key
had gone out from Baltimore to the British fleet to obtain the
release of a friend, held prisoner.  Her arrived on the eve of
the bombardment of the city by the British, and was detained on
his own vessel lest the plans of the attack be disclosed.  All
day an night he watched the battle anxiously from the deck.  When
morning dawned and showed the Stars and Stripes still floating
over the fort, he was deeply moved and quickly wrote the words of
the poem.  They were later set to the tune of an old English
drinking song, ""Anacreon in Heaven,"" a song widely sung in this
country at that time.

He invited him to dine with him the very next day,
He invited him his wife and children all to bring,
And in token of favor he gave him a ring,

And dress'd up all his children in the finest of their cloaths
Then the poor man and his wife and his seven children small
They all went to dine at this nobleman's hall, '

And then after dinner he soon did let him know,
What into this poor man's hands he had then to bestow;
'Twas forty or fifty good acres of his land,
He gave him in writing and sign'd his own hand,

Saying on this you may live happy all your life,
Therefore I do entreat you to be kind to your wife;
Be kind unto your wife and children all around,

There's a little ranch house in the vale,
Pretty little ranch house up for sale;
All the shutters drawn,
Tenants all gone
And thereby hangs a long, unhappy tale.

'Cause he caught her in the kitchen playing Westport,
A game indigenous to suburban life,
Where you take a wife of whom you're not the husband,
While someone else's husband takes your wife.
Some people may claim that the name of the game is Scarsdale,
Or Beverly Hills, or even Shaker Heights,
But commuters from Manhattan call it Westport.
And it's the game that some of our local leading lights
Play
To while away those cold Connecticut nights.

Now in that little ranch house used to dwell
An advertising feller and his Nell.
Two kids and a pup,
Living it up,
And everything was sounder than a bell ---

'Til he caught her in the kitchen playing Westport
Between the washing machine and thermostat.
The husband thought it really was an outrage.
Said he, ""You might at least remove your hat!""
Well, they may play it that way in Great Neck,
While in Levittown they'd never think it odd.
But there is not an architect in Westport
Who'll ever forgive the cad that said, ""My God!
Sir.
I must have got the wrong cape cod! ""

Since they are no longer groom and bride,
Quoting from the Sunday classified:
""Are there any takers
For three lovely acres
Of peaceful old New England countryside? ""

'Cause he caught her in the kitchen playing Westport
Which would ordinarily be a cause for gloom;
But though the sanctity of wedlock's on the downgrade,
Currently housing is enjoying quite a boom!
And while they defame the name of the game in Boston,
Where naturally they think it's a dirty shame,
In the green and fertile pastures of suburbia
The local dealers in real estate acclaim
It
The best thing since the fha, hey,
Westport is a grand old...
'Midst pleasures and palaces...
Westport is a grand old game.

Called to see if she'd like to go
To see a show, but Miss Kate said ""No

If they don't win it's a shame;
For it's one, two, three strikes you're out
At the old ball game.

Katie Casey saw all the games,
Knew the players by their first names;
Told the umpire he was wrong
All along, good and strong.
When the score was just two to two
Katie Casey knew what to do,
Just to cheer up the boys she knew

and some like a girl who is slender in the waist

And I scarcely can believe your false deluding tongue
Yet I see it in your eyes and it fills me with surprise
That your inclination lies in me cuckoo's nest

Then think of it as fondness and do not be surprised
For I live you me dear and I'll marry you I swear
If you'll let me clap my hand on your cuckoo's nest

Me darling, says she, I can do no such thing
For me mother often told me it was committing sin
Me maidenhead to lose and me sex to be abused
So have no more to do with me cuckoo's nest

Me darling, says me, it's not committing sin
But common sense should tell you it is a pleasing thing
For you were brought into this world to increase and do your best
And to help a man to heaven in your cuckoo's nest

Me darling, says she, I cannot you deny
For you've surely won my heart by the rolling of your eye
Yet I see it in your eyes that your courage is surprised
So gently lift your hand into me cuckoo's nest

And now this pretty fair maid has lost her maidenhead
In a small country cottage they increase and do their best

We set sail from the fair cove of Cork.
We were bound far away with a cargo of bricks
For the fine city hall of New York.

In a very fine craft, she was rigged fore-and-aft
And oh, how the wild winds drove her.
She had twenty-three masts and withstood several blasts
And we called her the Irish Rover.

There was Barney Mcgee from the banks of the Lee,
There was Hogan from County Tyrone.
And a chap called Mcgurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from West Meade called Mellone.

There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Casey from Dover.
There was Dooley from Claire who was strong as a bear
And was skipper of the Irish Rover.

We had one million bales of old billy goats' tails,
We had two million buckets of stones.
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides,
We had four million packets of bones.

We had five million hogs, we had six million dogs,
And seven million barrels of porter.
We had eight million bags of the best Sligo rags
In the hold of the Irish Rover.

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost her way in a fog.
And the whole of the crew was reduced unto two,
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog.

Then the ship struck a rock with a terrible shock
And then she heeled right over,
Turned nine times around, and the poor dog was drowned--
I'm the last of the Irish Rover.

You took her on the hillside and there you hid her clothes

You took her by the roadside where you begged to be excused
You took her by the roadside where there you hid her shoes

You took her on the hillside to make her your wife
You took her on the hillside where there you took her life

Take down my old violin and play it as you please
At this time tomorrow, it'll be no use to me

I dug a grave four foot long, I dug it three feet deep
And throwed the cold clay o'er her and tramped it with my feet

This world and one more then where do you reckon I'd be
If it hadn't been for Grayson, I'd a-been in Tennessee

Unknown,Turkey In The Straw,/u/unknown/turkey+in+the+straw_20325731.html,"Turkey in the Straw

As I was a-gwine down the road,
Tired team and a heavy load,
Crack my whip and the leader sprung,
l seys day-day to the wagon tongue.

Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Went out to milk, and I didn't know how,
I milked the goat instead of the cow.
A monkey sittin' on a pile of straw,
A-winkin' at his mother-in-law.

Met Mr. Catfish comin' down stream.
Says Mr. Catfish, ""What does you mean?""
Caught Mr. Catfish by the snout,
And turned Mr. Catfish wrong side out.

Came to a river and I couldn't get across,
Paid five dollars for a blind old hoss;
Wouldn't go ahead, nor he wouldn't stand still,
So he went up and down like an old saw mill.

As I came down the new cut road,
Met Mr. Bullfrog, met Miss Toad
And every time Miss Toad would sing,
Old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing.

Oh I jumped in the seat and I gave a little yell
The horses ran away, broke the wagon all to hell
Sugar in the gourd and honey in the horn
I never been so happy since the day I was born.

What a privilege to carry,
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Oh, what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer!

Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful?
Who will all our sorrows share?

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?

Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Along with Captain Gooding;

Mind the musie and the step,
And with the girls be handy.

There was Captain Washington
Upon a slapping stallion,
A-giving orders to his men,
I guess there was a million.

And then the feathers on his hat,
They looked so' tarnal fin-a,
I wanted pockily to get
To give to my Jemima.

And then we saw a swamping gun,
Large as a log of maple;
Upon a deuced little cart,
A load for father's cattle.

And every time they shoot it off,
It takes a horn of powder;
It makes a noise like father's gun,
Only a nation louder.

I went as nigh to one myself,
As' Siah's underpinning;
And father went as nigh agin,
I thought the deuce was in him.

We saw a little barrel, too,
The heads were made of leather;
They knocked upon it with little clubs,
And called the folks together.

And there they'd fife away like fun,
And play on cornstalk fiddles,
And some had ribbons red as blood,
All bound around their middles.

The troopers, too, would gallop up
And fire right in our faces;
It scared me almost to death
To see them run such races.

Uncle Sam came there to change
Some pancakes and some onions,
For' lasses cake to carry home
To give his wife and young ones.
But I can't tell half I see
They kept up such a smother;
So I took my hat off, made a bow,
And scampered home to mother.

Cousin Simon grew so bold,
I thought he would have cocked it;
It scared me so I streaked it off,
And hung by father's pocket.

And there I saw a pumpkin shell,
As big as mother's basin;
And every time they touched it off,
They scampered like the nation.

Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy.

Ultra Bra,Yöllä,/u/ultra+bra/yll_20352599.html,"Taivaalla kuu tuskin hengissään
Keskellä hauraiden pilvien virtaa.
Juro vartiomies palatsin luona
Katsoo vihoissaan tornikelloon.

Uskoton vaimo on menossa kotiin,
Hänen kasvonsa kovat, sulkeutuneet,
Ja uskollista polttaa kaipuu,
Jota unen tiukka syleily ei saamuta.

Ja mitä heistä? Viikko sitten huokasin,
Heitin maailmalle hyvästit. Mutta huoneessa
Ilma on tunkkainen ja lähdin puistoon
Katsomaan tähtiä, koskettamaan lyyraa."

Koska siitä saa auki kaksi ikkunaa

Puolen litran pulloista

Neljä kolme seitsemän yksi
Olet sietämätön tyyppi
Ja mielipiteesi ovat vääriä
Älä soita tänne enää koskaan

Itketään erkkerissä harmittaa
Koska sinä olet vailla järjen hiventä
Juodaan kahvia paksupohjaisista
Viiden markan kupeista

Kuka ketäkin petti
Silloin haluaa kävellä rantaan

Huojuvat nosturit

Guess the price was the fall if I get up

Real G's wit me on this one, yah, yah, yah yah,

Wifey home, wedding band I'm a lucky man,
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully yes I am,
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep,
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets,
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites,
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, jus telling myself a lie,
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life,
Man I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

[Chorus:]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess,
Better give my girl my vest cuz my??? Under arrest,
Cuz I love my lady,
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for the ladies,
Coulda picked up the phone, could of ended up doing wrong,
Man I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home, cuz I love my lady,
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for the ladies,

I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates,
With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed,
No rooms left in the Mender Inn, I gotta figure out a play,
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way,
We started talking business, she handed me a card,
We exchanged information, I rented me a car,
While I'm driving she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts,
Fine as hell but I don't wanna break my baby's heart, no nonooo.

[Chorus:]

They call me you. S. H. E. Are are. A. Y. M. O. N. D,
And I just wanna do right by my lady,
But lately I been slippin up, fanasty bout dimes on the side,
Dark tint on my ride, I gotta 10 in ride, I can hide,
I can't lie lie, but ever since I put that band on my hand,
More and more chicks trying to get at me,
Then I don't know what to do,
Just trying to handle my grown man B. I,
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose,
Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool,
Make that move,
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the rules

She got the door locked, and the lock don't fit, your key,
Yah you punching up her numbers in the adt,
You'll be wondering how the hell this happen to me,
Better not feed feed feed that appetite,
Now your baby's gone, you putting out????
And some other brother, been tossing up your????
Get caught slippin you gone wish you would of listen to meeee,

And I love you life girl I love you for life

There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times I hated myself for
The way I went about it the ups and the downs one foot in while the other foots out
Loving on you loving on another and I ain't no different from any other brothers
What I did to you right here right now in this here place
In this here space as my heart pour out as I state my place as I break it down

Never gon let you go,

Your Michael Jackson,
I'm Michael Jackson,
We all Michael Jackson,
I guess what I'm asking is everybody bow their head for a legend don't breathe for a second,
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,
So you can hear my message, my confession,
Someone tell Usher, I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him, like he touched me, like he touched you,
So carry on his legacy, something I must do, so I trust you lighting candles, concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room,
First thing I did when I heard was call puff,
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,
Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge.

As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,
When list my air ones, mj was my nier.
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,
And since I'm a hollywood star I'm gonna tell you my story,
Never had a family that close, never see Barry Gordy walking through interscope,
Just like me they always had Mike in a scope,
No matter what you say,
I'm gonna love him and he's still dope,
Let me take you back to 85 when I was in a zone, dancing for my momma thriller jacket with all the zippers on,
Now I'm doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,
Listening to Outcast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson
Anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta you,
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to let us through.

All these stops signs I be have ignored
I can almost taste her, wish I could erase her
Fence after fence, wall after wall
I huff and I puff, hopin that she falls
It's either give her something or give nothing at all
I really wanna quit but her girl is the shit

See it' s burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this, is coming to an end
And it's better for me to, let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse:]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time comin
But we done been fell apart
I really wanna work this out
But I don't think it's gonna change-e
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin' baby, I ain't happy baby
'Cause there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus:]
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta Let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same
Find myself
Callin'her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
And all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I knew I made a mistake
Now it's too late
Now she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now now

To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh

Without my boo-ooh
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty eleven days, umpteen hours
I'm'a be burnin' till you return

Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it's through

Hey!
My name is Usher,
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house,
And if you really wanna know what my name is
Just Call Me A Mack
Word,
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby,
Cause I ain't confused
Usher singing
I maybe got some,
But I got a
Whole lot on manly in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't complain (Huh, ha!)
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib
And chill,
But just be sure
That you call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)
Learned how to play a player
And do you know why,
Because the mack
Hook
Just Call Me A Mack
Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well known fact
That I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Just Call Me A Mack
Now, baby I ain't dumb
And all those silly
Games that you play
I see right through
So let me kick it to yah (To yah!)
I don't have a lot of girls,
But I gotta know
I'll get the respect that I give
That's just the way I live
Because the last girl
I had was moving
Things too fast (Slow down)
She tried to pull a fooler
And do you know
What had happened
Hook (twice)
Usher's Rap
The mack is right here
And yes I care as much
Just giving a little love
It's spreading everywhere
You see it's
Here
Here
And here
Catch a feeling
I'm having a little trouble
I know my girl will always
Hit it
Pit it
Like an orange
Cause it looks
Like numbness
My lovin' and
Hugin'
And bitterness
My peeps keep
Pumpin'
Humpin'
On stage
I'm engaged
And yes
The truth is it
You see an
Ugly woman
You better change

I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin'
I just can't let you go
I never ever want to hurt you
I just wanna to love ya
I just wanna to sex ya up

Want to give you everything you need
Things you want, just lay down
Let me love ya all night long
I don't wanna to leave ya, I just wanna to keep ya

When they saw me, they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl
That's how I felt, every time I thought it was right
It went left

We used to love and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself I don't want you no more

And hate, people screaming it won't work

But I can't let you go

You ain't even got to wait till in the mornin' man
You can get out of here at night man
Ah-yo clear, go rap, go shit, get out of here )

Baby you not gonna like me
But you not gonna fight me
You can walk away and say
I never gave you everything you want, thing you need

All we ever do is argue all night long
I don't want to leave you, see you
With another brother lovin ya sayin'
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl

Got me walkin' around lookin for somebody to slap
Got me goin', goin', with no pause (?)
Got me up in Cartier every day just cause
Got me arguin' about little stuff

She don't call lil' stuff
When it get a little rough,
We me kiss and make up
She want to say what she want to, I don't play that
She want to constantly bring up shit from way back

Got me thinkin' about her while I'm watchin' a flick
Got me dippin through traffic tryin' to get home quick
Got me talkin' to myself ""I'm hatin' this""
Got me wantin' to wild out like I'm Jadakiss
Got me in a place I never thought I would see
Got me not wantin' to stay, and not wantin' to leave
Got me happy
Got me confused
Got me wishin' I could get it how I used to

For any reason, just to bother me
Just for your quota, so it's rest in peace to Sean Bell
Sleep in peace Eric Garner (Sandra)
Every street, every corner
Conspiracy, new world order
I spoke to Tamir Rice mom and she told me ""be strong""
It won't be long 'til it's justice
They won't have votes but refuse the discussion
On how certain cops stay shoot us for nothing
Revolution is coming

You act like the change

Tryna throw me in chains

Don't act like you saving us

Man don't act like I made it up
You blaming us

We still in chains
We still in chains
You see these chains?
We still in chains
I can't see
We still in chains
The difference from how we used to be
We still in chains
We still in chains
You put the shame on us

[Post-Hook: Usher & Bibi Bourelly]
Now, now, now shame on us

De la duda y la traición
Veo una vida hecha pedazos
Y ahí es donde nace un campeón

Face to face but worlds apart

De amarguras y esperanzas
De las penas y el dolor
De una fé que todo alcanza
De allí es como nace un campeón

Usher,Chivalry,/u/usher/chivalry_20831854.html,"Ladies, we gon’ try something different this time
I ain’t sayin’ you wrong for doin’ it how you do it, fellas
But it’s something different
(When put a lil’ extra in it man I’m tellin’ you, you get a lil’ more power)
Sing it ladies, listen

I see you standin’ here lookin’ real nice
I bet I know what’s going through your mind
You probably thinkin’ that every man in here
Is lookin’ for somebody for one night

Your friends drug you out ‘cause you ain’t wanna come
That’s why you’re standin’ there actin’ stuck up
Holdin’ up the wall, you got a misconception of men
Thinkin’ we’re all the same, full of games
All because you ended up with the wrong one

I bet you think that chivalry is gone
’Cause you ain’t seen nothing like it in so long
It’s when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when it’s cold outside

A man ain’t a man until he’s man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, I’ma change your mind

Your probably like, why did I pick you
Well, I’m over there, you L double okay at me like, ooh
And I was wonderin’ what’s your N A M E
How you gon’ A C T when I C O M E over and ask you what it do?

And her reply was S O double R Y
Thanks for the compliment
But I gotta let you know I’m probably not your type
You got a misconception of me, listen and I’ll make you see
Don’t let one B A D a double P L E spoil it for the bunch

I bet you think that chivalry is gone
’Cause you ain’t seen nothing like it in so long
It’s when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when it’s cold outside

A man ain’t a man until he’s man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, I’ma change your mind

Now this ain’t for everybody man
So don’t get twisted on what I’m sayin’
If you wit somebody right now
But you feel that they playin’
Then I know that you understand

How it feel when you talk for hours
Show up at the door wit some flowers
When you put a lil’ extra in it
Man it give you just a lil’ more power

Most of us go the extra mile
To get what even though it ain’t our style
The stuff I’m talkin’ most ain’t seen
Or heard since they was just a lil' child

I’m tryna show you how to really get her on
I’m tryna show you how to really get her home
I’m tryna show you how to have shorty mind
All messed up in the zone, just tell her I

I bet you think that chivalry is gone
’Cause you ain’t seen nothing like it in so long
It’s when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when it’s cold outside

Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

[Breakdown]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Chorus:]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions"

Turn the lights on

These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trecking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby going deeper ain't gon kill me
And I know they are shagging for me
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my ways
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Love makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby
You'll be my place tonight, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew I, don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar

Let no obstacle before you slow your speed
For you possess a will to win that burns intensely
And win you will yes this will be your creed

To push yourself much harder than you have done before

'Cause no one else can live your dream but you

And in the end with no regret
And in the end with no regret
You're given your all and nothin' less
You're given your all and nothin 'less
You know you've been the best that you can be
You know you've been the best that you can be
No one can say you didn't try
No one can say you didn't try
Go on and wave your banner high
Go on and wave your banner high
And savor that sweet taste of victory
And savor that sweet taste of victory

Dreamin' keep on dreamin'

Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
Just go ahead and live the dream

Anything in life can happen
If you give your best in all you do
If you give your best in all you do
Ain't no limit for those who want it
Ain't no limit for those who want it
Take a chance and let it all come true
Take a chance and let it all come true
Shake your fears and hold your head high
Shake your fears and hold your head high
You can make it if you really try
You can make it if you really try
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you

Dreamin' keep on dreamin'
And if you really believe in time
You will make your dreams come true
You will make your dreams come true
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'

She said you'd never feel like this with another girl.
Her eyes lift as the sun rays fell over her face, 
I was amazed.
Then I realized that I was in this enchanted place, 
All I could say is baby keep on giving me more.

She makes me feel like I'm breathless (off with my feet, I'm floating)
I only hope I can take it(no gravity can hold it)

It's like the stars and planets are all aligned, 
And for the first time in a while I feel alive babe.
I loose myself inside your love it's hard to escape, 
Ooh I can't break these chains and I don't want to baby.
I'm [?] on the clouds whenever I see your face, 
And all I can say is baby keep on giving me more sugar.

She makes me feel like I'm weightless (off with my feet, I'm floating)
I only hope I can take it (no gravity can hold it)
She makes me feel like I'm wasted"

Eh yo why am I gonna sit here and let ya'll bug me
Cause I got a dime and a girl who love me
And when we alone she ain't all luvy duvy
Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga fuck me
And uh I don't do nothing for my babygirl to not trust me
I don't do nothing for her to bust me
I would love her if her rings were rusty
Feet were crusty
And arms were musty
Cause ain't nobody gettin that--just me
And ain't nobody hittin that--just me
If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me
Cause she know how many girls lust me
Back in the day they wouldn't even touch me
Now they say they don't want nobody but me
To tell the truth
Them girls just disgust me
Cause I already found the one that love me
Chorus
[Usher]
It's all good
Lovin somebody
As long as somebody loves you back
2x's
[Cam'ron]
Mess with her?
I ain't have to
But player I was glad to
Brownskin dove
But her love won't pass you
Promised her a ring
Along with a shine
Never stressin my rhyme
All she wanted is time
Where you find her at
Cause you a grimy cat
Puffin dime sacks to see where my mind be at
And I told my other niggas that
I told her yo
I don't always have to hit the twat
Just to get you hot
You don't believe me
Then pick a spot
But remember, I lick alot
Ayyo she likes to trick alot
Just to get a bigger knot
Loves to see her nigga hot
Worries if I'm jigged or not
And her stuff--hot and divine
And the things she coppes--top of the line
Baby is hot and divine
Always poppin some wine
And then she told me
Cam, I got a rock on my mind
Chorus-2x's
[Cam'ron]
It feels good when you love em'
And they lovin you back
Go tit for tat
Never scratch your back
Matter of fact she touches and grabs
Not to lust you bad
Just to get you mad
When we alone she screams and moans
She don't front on me
Cause she don't want to be alone
Come on
Everybody needs somebody
Spanish girls screamin out
Ay Papi!
Take her out
Uh-huh no doubt
Then we lace her out
Uh-huh no doubt
Then we ski her out

Ski her out

Then we eat her out

Where your tan at?

Wit her legs cocked
And she beggin me to stop it.

It's time to say goodbye
Is there a reason why our love could not last
I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty Lady
I thought we had a master planbut it takes a stronger man to walk away
Than to watch our love fade away
I often wonder how and why I did not cheat I did not lie
I hope you know how hard I tried
But it's over for now
It's time to say goodbye
Chorus: I can't believe how suddenly things change
Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were Heartaches And pain
Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out
But in my heart I knew I still had my doubts
I thought we made a symphony
It's over now no more harmony
I prayed so hard for love to fly

Ooh bye bye bye bye bye

Got something that you need to kno
Be the relist shit I never wrote
Can't hold it gotta let it go
Though that I mean every note
Yea yea
Listen babe

Let me start by saying that
The way I feel for you is never once changed
And the games I've played, mistakes I made
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got problem baby I can't lie
Cuz lately I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that we were wrong but we (let it build)
And I know you never knew when you say I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

And it's killin me girl that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby said it's killin me girl
Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do
I know it's hard for you
Hard for you to live with this

Trade memories for moments
Trade love to be lonely
Guess it's just the man in me
Blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And then spotlight feel like the bright light
But it's really just my fears
And it still don't dry your tears
When I, say she aint you
When I, really love you more
When you, say if it's true
Why'd you do it for?
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break you heart, make you cry
I just wanna say goodbye

It's killin me girl that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do
I know it's hard for you
Hard for you to live with this

What a feel I don't even got it right
It's like poisons in my body & there's no way yo deny
That my heart is a time bomb
With seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you kno before it blows
Still it aint on you
It's my fault
All the gossip n talkin behind your back when you walkin
But in time you will konw
Before long u'll see that you deserve more
You deserve more
You deserve so much more
Then what imma be

And it's killin me girl that you have to live with these
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby said it's killin me girl
Said I just don't understand

Why would you love a fool with all the things I do

I spent a couple thousand on her ass shots
She got all colors in the G socks
That's a Rolex not a G-Shock (G-Shock)
I'm diggin' in her while she got her legs locked (Got her legs locked)
We fuckin' in the penthouse at the tip top (Oh)
Make her cum again, spend a hundred bands, new Mercedes-Benz
Gucci store again, had to let us, private when we land
I gave her a chance, gave her the advance, diamond on her hands
VVS' dance, Off-White on the Vans, Tesla for a van
I'm rubbin' on her skin, she gon' let me in, we ain't gon' pretend
I'm her latest friend, she don't chase her Hen' and ain't scared to sin
I'ma give her a lend, purse that cost a ten, help her on the rent
We just wanna win, just don't care to spend, Gucci store again

Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)
Treat the Gucci store like a gift shop (Gift shop)

Good ol... Heh

I told my man I'm having a barbecue
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through
He brought this shorty that I used to know
It brought me back to when I was in school
She said Usher where have you been?
We used to kick it every now and then
Remember when I used to call your phone
Tell you come on cause my mother's gone
How about them times I had to throw
A rock at your window
To let you know to come downstairs
And open the door
And after that baby it was on fa'sure
Honey got my head spinnin' around for real
Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this, huh
But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to reminisce, cause

Now she's asking me to take her
On a tour of my house so we can catch up
For all the time lost since I blew up
And became the man that drops his pants
And every girl around the world is dying to love
Break the beat down
Let me tell you what I'm talking about
If you're not carefull it'll turn you out
It's that way she used to go
When you want it nice and slow
Even though you can't The memory will make you want some mo'
She used to understand me
Touch me, hold me, taught me how to be a man
She used to kiss me all them things she used to show me
Damn I wish that I could do it again
Honey got my head spinnin' around for real
Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel
But I got a girl now and yo she's right upstairs

Never had somebody that's as bad
Somebody with a whole lot of body
That'll choose, make you wanna leave the one you with
Cause you know how good it is
Not a prissy, lil' missy baby, talk that slang
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thang
She was a friend of the famhot without the glam, not
When I be trippin'
She didn't really give a damn, stop
It's what I need to do
Cause I know what's this is leading toif I keep on thinkin' bout that back

Can’t say I ain’t try
But I guess my love wasn’t good enough

I guess I’m guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I’m guilty cause girls always want to show me love
I guess I’m guilty for leaving and having a little fun
Girl I’m guilty for that girl Im guilty
Don’t take me to jail

I did nothing to her, gave everything to her
For that,
Don’t take me to jail
Ohhh,
Don’t take me to jail

So what the hell am I gon do
Turn my life around, it aint going down
She know bout the life I live why she crying now
This sh-t is so silly to me but I plead that

Lets go
Right hand to the sky
Strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case well what am I
If I hurt her I aint try to, in the club I may decide to ride through
She got proof well I got alibi’s too
Couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
7 carrot solitaire, Caribbean water blue
Range Rover Porsche powder mirror in the Bentley coupe
All the sh-t I did for her and this who you gon listen to
Her life I submit to you is evidence
I never been on bullsh-t she aint caught me on no tiger Woods sh-t
Knew what I expected when she met me
Should have let me be
I’m balling against the law shorty go on arrest me then

If you gon treat me like a crook putting money on my books

Do everything I can to survive

When she smiled at me
She took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful
When I can't take my eyes off you
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I want just the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?

How do I say?
The room was filled with a sweet arom
When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so united
In the language that I will never forget

I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd cause she found me
And when she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that i want her, I want her
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
In my life, I've never felt like this
I've never had a lost for words
One kiss from her has got me feenin'

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful
When I can't take my eyes off you

Usher,Hush,/u/usher/hush_20770024.html,"[Verse:]
Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think it's genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
He does shit to make it better
And I'm thinking of you

[Chorus:]
Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don't want to sacrifice
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

[Verse 2:]
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know
That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the tv - the story repeats
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Think it's a waste of time to vote
She says the one that has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I'm thinking who

Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho)
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants heaven (Heaven)

But it ain't getting better
'Cause you can't be blind with eyes wide open

I see only the mess we made
I see things that I can't change

Hold deep inside

All my niggas take a walk with me
You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be

And how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga
I get money I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit I hit dimes, what I need with a nine

Before y'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware we here
What's my name, got chicks twisted like
What's my game?

Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don't harass it
Ma' I'm a baller I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy

If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through, come on

It's right around eleven o'clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot

Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook, y'all doin' it heavy
She's telling you she might change
But you tell her not to

She know that she looks stunning
It'll be fine
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got'chu

You're smoking

As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?

I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

And when we get home we’ll have us our own private party in here

I love you anyway
You can twerk it while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you do, do it

I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a s***
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late, we can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place, blow her own gas, no role’

You were incredible, took my breath away
I remember first time your eyes met mine
I saw a lot of me in you
That day I vowed to do my best
To try and teach you right when you're wrong
But you gotta live out your lessons
Time makes it all right
Watch you grow, you think you know
But I know better cos I been there, seen that, did it
How you think you got it

My gift for life is seeing the smile on your face
That's when all of my troubles melt away
Holding you in my arms makes the world feel like a better place
You say I love you, well I say that I love you too
I love you, I love you, you too I do

My second time around
Man this is crazy incredible
To feel something like this again is so remarkable
Big bright eyes, little lips, with daddy's attitude
So I know the biggest job ahead of me
Is doing my best
To try and teach you right when you're wrong
But you gotta live out your lessons
Time makes it all right
Watch you grow, you think you know
I know better cos I been there, seen that, did it
How you think you got it

My gift for life is seeing the smile on your face
That's when all of my troubles melt away
Holding you in my arms makes the world feel like a better place
You say I love you, well I say that I love you too

Life ain't a perfect story write it while you live it
[?] know that joy's gonna kill it
And no matter what you're still together
Ha listen you're gonna fight but work it out

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks that romance me don't tickle my fancy
Bonin Tiffany, Nancy; that's not where my plans be
Need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to Delancey to trips to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin me
Here's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world girl, it's you and me

And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
Cuz now I'm gettin money and the game gettin deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
Wintertime and its full lit, snow white
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been lookin for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
It's cuz of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl...

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didnt 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style; this shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way that I used to kiss the pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

Change can be beautiful
Something is just still the same you know

If this were our last night
Here on this planet
How would you feel
What would you say
Pretend that you never
Ever will see me
After tonight, after today
And I tell me you rather fight
And hold the grudge against me
Instead of makin love tonight
Ooh is that what you sayin baby

I never be flawless
Never be perfect
No matter how bad you want me to be
I'll be your hero
As soon as you let go
And stop having me in your fantasy
Lets just live life
Lets just have fun
Maybe inside we can be as one
But if we never do then that's okay
All that I'm trying to say is

I aint gonna change (oh no)

All that I ask is, just be you

Now what if tomorrow came and I change
And you started doing things that you claim
Would be better, what if I did whatever
To push the ease that we'd always be together
Would that make you satisfied
To have me home every night
No way that I really missed the lights
Could you live with yourself
If that'd happen babe

Tell me where is the girl
The one who used to standin
As the light in my world
Where is she at
Cause I want her back
Can we go back
Cause who I'm looking at
Forgot how to love
I want the one that gave me love
The one that I could go to
Who used to trip on all the little things

Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off but you still persist to front on me

Why do we play this game of chase
When you know we both feel the same way
And why do you put me through all these changes
When you know you're just a freak like me (you're just like me)

It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster
Voice yo' opinion, Queen B made a million
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it

When yo' head be in between it, if I had a penis
I'd be heartless for real though, niggaz start shit
I'd just flash out my dildo, ya'll move too quick
Thought I'd be mesmorized by ya cocaine bricks

And ya smoke gray six, nigga I thought you was a groupie
Obsessed fan with my picture in ya hooptie-doo
Heard my record now ya know I'm freaky
So ya wanna wreck it and ya wanna see me

How your dreams be, you want me sexual
In a gun fight, two on three
I'm next to pull, and I love life
Something you never could imagine, then you woke the fuck up
It's just rappin' (ahhh)

Working intermissions, switching positions
We so expensive oh!

You can say it all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

[Rick ross - rap verse]

You can say it all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game mate, come on
Holler 'bout what you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see"
Usher,Lessons For The Lover,/u/usher/lessons+for+the+lover_21018513.html,"Turn the light on! 
How could someone hurt you
But still make you feel so good?
How the screaming... 
You stand there and let them good
Just cause he gives you pain, 
That don't mean he ain't the one! 
Fuck you at your brain, you'll be smiling when he's done

Pre-chorus:
So my advice would be
No, don't leave, don't go so easy! 
Let the argue... turn you on! 
It's worthy! 

Chorus:
And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
Lesson for the lover, for lover! 
Lesson for the love, oh lover! 

So hard to imagine living life without them there
Cause now you're so cut out in the passion
But this shit is beyond compare, yeah! 
Cause... make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drug
You fought hard, but think about how hard you come

Pre-chorus:
So my advice would be
No, don't leave, don't go so easy! 
Let the argue... turn you on! 
It's worthy! 

Chorus:
And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
Lesson for the lover, for lover! 
(Turn the lights on! )
Lesson for the love, oh lover! 

No one wants to be fighting all day, love, all night, love
So we just scream to wish... making up
Yeah, and as time goes on we're feeling ok, babe, alright, love
And we'll forget about it in the morning, oh, oh! 

Chorus:
And these are the lessons learned by love
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
Lesson for the lover, for lover!

Lesson for the love, oh lover!"
Usher,Let It Burn,/u/usher/let+it+burn_20542152.html,"I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn)
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

Of a little love
It's okay for me
To open up
But I just
Can't give me
Heart to anyone

Cause
Some only call it
A life for a season
And stay a while
To give you a reason
To put
In your every thing
And to think
That it's forever

I used to think
That it was hopeless
And that I should
Just give it up
Give it up
But I couldn't stop
Until I found myself
A good girl

Every state

You'd be willing
To give them
A lifetime

Gonna love you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock

And I know just when to start
And I'll be lovin your reaction
Every time I hit that spot

Bottom soft like leather
Gently
But the top is hard
Gently
Whisper your pleasures
Gently
Then I'll do my job
Invigorating, intense
Girl let me do what I do
I don't know what's echoing louder
The music or you

Right after the storm

You say, you say, do you say it girl
Make it
Gonna push it to the limit

See second place or win the race
I'm gonna be your number one
Til the sun shines
Here comes the sun
Forever more
Let's try and taste the moon again forever more

Let me touch you gently

Ripping shades off the wall
Light as feather but hard as a rock
This might not be in the bedroom but I'm gonna love you girl gently
Light as a feather but hard as a rock

Let me touch you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently
Light as a feather but hard as a rock

Be a good girl, now, turn around
And get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back

Here's a pillow, bite that
And I'll be settin' separate plays
So on all these separate days
Your legs can go the separate ways

Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found

And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold

And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us

And the sky turns grey, and the water from the rain washes progress away

Just leave me, just leave me, be
Why you just leave me, just leave me, Be

But, the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss, that I missed, girl you know I'm trying

I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
Cause we will never be the same ooh

This must be a slow death,
That I'm travelin' on.
It feels so wrong, I'm
Barely holdin' on
See, no matter what it takes
I've gotta get it together.

And these hills that I'm travelin' up
She ain't showin' me love
I'm down on my love

I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying travel through
But it's like moving mountains...
It's like moving mountains... Hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns grey, and the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains...
It's like moving mountains...
Well baby why you just leave me,
Just leave me, be
Just leave me, just leave me, be
Why you just leave me, just leave me, be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be ooh"

Caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one
Oh-but what's bad is I know you got a man

And he'll never understand

Something inside of me

If you can think it you can have it
That's why I believe

One day you'll be mine[mine]

No whisperin' when he's around
One day you'll be mine

Now eveytime I see you baby
It's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missin' at home baby
So much love to share

It's something in the air
Tellin' me I should never leave you alone
But even though
I know you gotta man

He'll never understand

You say you don't when I know that you want it

Don't come up in here lyin'

That stack of chips in Vegas
That college dorm in Georgia
That'll forever remain nameless

And knowin' I deserve it makes it worst
Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand
Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand
I know I told one too many lies
Never thought it'd turn around on me
Let's call it even and I won't up and leave

How many days, how many ways did he hit that
Did he make my queen his hoe?
She said ""What's done is done""
[Couldn't think of nothing bad enough to call her?]
Guess I had it coming

Oh, it was that room in Cancun
That stack of chips in Vegas
That college dorm in Georgia
That will forever remain nameless
I know I got no right to judge you but it really hurts
And knowin' I deserve it makes it worst
Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand
Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand
I know I told one too many lies
Never thought it'd turn around on me
Let's call it even and I won't up and leave
I can count the times you did me wrong on one hand
I can count the times you made me cry on one hand
Every man you ever gave your love on one hand
Oh no, on one hand (On one hand)

Don't know what to do
Try to forgive and forget
But if I do, I know I look like a fool
I did my dirt, and I made you hurt
How the hell you turn it around and switch on me
(Switch it on me)
Go with the first in mind, and kick it
I can't guarantee it won't happen again
I can't let it go, but if I do
For this day forward, we gotta promise to keep it on
No, baby
Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand
Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand
I know I told one too many lies
Never thought it'd turn around on me
Let's call it even and I won't up and leave
I can count the times you did me wrong on one hand
I can count the times you made me cry on one hand
Every man you ever gave your love on one hand
Oh no, on one hand (On one hand)"

Driving round looking out for her

Now its raining
And I'm looking over at the passenger side
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off
She was stopping and dropping me
Switching from fast to slow
But that ain't have nothing on how you got
When I got you home

When you left (oh)

The way you touched yourself had me up the wall
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I'm searching for you cause I can't seem to let you go

Just like a revolver, babe
Just like a revolver
(It goes around)
Just like a revolver, babe
But we gotta resolve it babe

Piercing
Piercing with my actions
Spitefully ignore you
I don't even care
Just how much you take
Biten and it's potent
You hate it and I know it
Pandora's box is open

(Repeat 2nd verse)

These walls get high baby (3x)
It won't ever come down
These walls get high baby (3x)
It wont ever come down

Round and round
Like the game roulette
Step on up kid
And place your bet
Round and round
Is the route we choose
Play that game, man
We all gonna lose

She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

[Verse 1: Usher + Future]
So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven
[Hook: Usher + Future]
Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals
(You gotta give me that)
I put that on the Bible
(You gotta give me that girl)
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feelin'

I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though
I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling startin' to get too familiar

To find a girl like you... We would meet at the park at school
And talk till the day was through
... Take a pair of tones... And I would comb your hair
And you would dream of all the cities
And places we could go

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh... Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart out close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns in night.

I can still remember dreams as a little boy
Now I'm man, and still can't...
Hey, hey, hey
Real love it will never come, if you in it now
But I had to learn that lesson down in the...
... Spend the night in the town just to have a little fun
In my mind I'm wishing she's the one
(i said to myself)... Is this to close to reality
For you to be that girl from that fantasy

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh... Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart out close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns to night.

She stole my head and let's go play the dream again
Uh, uh, to find a girl like you
(only you and me around!)... I look into your eyes
I'm not seeing... I look into your eyes
I'm not seeing... Love is pure!

Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart out close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns in night.

You can't deny it - oooh but you're lying

How come you're so wrapped up in that anger, let me get you out
You say that nothing can help your situation that I could do, you doubt
How can you be so quick to judge what you can't even see? I mean really
I'm not just something you have from your past, don't blame it all on me
Tell me, let me get ready for the letdown, but I'm not giving up now

Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it – girl, but you're lying

What's the problem, something's got you bent out of shape
Cuz I can see that you're hurting, it's written all over your face
I told you my only objective is to make you smile (ah baby)
But you keep saying I'm interrupting, in the meantime give it a little bit of loving
I'm going to get to the bottom of it

Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it - oooh but you're lying

I know you told me that you had enough
And the pain will go away if you feel enough
The only way to make it through another day
Is to keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting
And when you feel like giving up
And you'll keep searching 'til you find (out) just what to do
You have a right to open up
Baby, there's no way to hide it
Eventually the truth will come out of you

Cuz the secrets that you're keeping
I know your weakness
You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that
You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head?
You can't deny it – girl, but you're lying

Either way I lose

Work my way to the front

You and I could never sing
Cause love isn't for me and you

If love was an Oscar
You and I could never win
Cause we can never act out our parts
If love is the Bible
Then we are lost in sin
Because it's not in our hearts

So why don't you go your way
And I'll go mine
Live your life, and I'll live mine

Cause we're better off, separated

If love was a fire
Then we have lost the spark
Love never felt so cold
If love was a light
Then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold

If love was a sport
We're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean
Then we are just a stream
Cause love isn't for me and you

So why don't you go your way
And I'll go mine
Live your life, and I'll live mine
Baby you'll do well, and I'll be fine
Cause we're better off, separated

It's sad but now we gotta say goodbye
Girl you know I love you, I can't deny
I can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I
I know it hurts so much but it's best for us
Somewhere along this windy road we lost the trust
So I'll walk away so you don't have to see me cry
It's killing me so, why don't you go

Oh now, I wouldn't fall for something like this usually
No, no, no tell me how could I ever prepare

Don’t wanna miss one of your blessings now
Talking about how good you should be.
I’m sitting right in front of you, 
Don’t be shy, girl, I won’t bite you now.

Talking about you work on the weekends now
Let me work you out on a week day
I ain’t talking about a relationship
Talking about a love in a hallway
I’ll show you what you’re supposed to do
Don’t be shy, girl, what you’re waiting on?

I present to you my perfect situation
Ain’t no need anticipating on
Take that, take that, 
Take that, take that.

Listen, let’s take a shortcut to my hotel now, 
If you’re ready, we can meet in the ballet.
You gotta follow all my directions now, 
Don’t wanna mess around and be lonely.
Won’t be the one to push em out
Girl, you need to push this love up in your life.

It gets hot in the parking lot, 
You wanna have to open the windows
Hop in the back seat till I hit that spot, 
Got your legs around my neck in a chokehold.
Show you what you’re supposed to do, 
Don’t be shy, girl, what you’re waiting on?

I present to you my perfect situation
Ain’t no need anticipating on
Take that, take that, 
Take that, take that.

Take that, take that, 
Take that, take that.

Patience is a virtue, 
Why can’t we just skip to it?
I ain’t gonna rush you, babe, 
Totally lost with you, girl, enough is enough.
They say good things come to those who go hard and take ‘em
But no really I ain’t faced, I am here to play no game

I need to know what you’re waiting on

Ain’t no need anticipating on

So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love

You see I've waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man

To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes, made me realize
That everything I feel, has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

I'm trying to find someone who
I can give my good lovin' to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah

I prayed to heaven, and then I found you

Tell me you ain't been lying
'Cause I don't condone it ('Cause I don't condone)
You got a rock, started to keep your ass at home (Keep your ass at home)

Tell you been driving me crazy, tell you been driving me crazy
Who you been texting daily, who you been texting daily
You know I don't do fugazi, you know I don't do fugazi
(Neck, wrist, finger, you know I don't do fugazi)
Hope you ain't lettin' him hit it, hope you ain't lettin' him hit it
I hope you staying ambtious, I hope you being committed
Perpetrating them feelings, but that ain't the way you get it

I never should have gotten in the mix
You never understand till you go through it
All the rights things you say

Wrong things to do

You should be lookin' for a TTP

I used to be young and dumb
And always wanted to run in the streets
'Cause I thought that was where it was at
But it wasn't all it did was leave a brother in the cold

With nowhere to go
I caught myself slippin'
Thinkin' I was the lick, I was trippin'
Tried to jump dip to dip

I thought it was a way to be happy
Until somebody took time to tell me

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

It's taking over
My mind and

Over your touch)

The way you move it
The way I touch you

How good I'll fuck you
Off the Richter
Off the meter

Know you feel that
Where my hands at
Makes me not care
Where your mans at
I have not fear
Girl, I'm past that
I just want you
Asking me
'Where ya' pants at?
In the morning
After an evening
Lots of moaning
Heavy breathing
Body's socking
Showers steaming
Got you open
Loud and screaming
Call it passion
Call it lust
Call it classic
Call it a must
Lay it down deep girl
All in your guts
Feel the rush
That starts
With a touch

Now when I met you
Knew I shouldn't
Get attached
But after one touch
It had me coming back
Sweat running down
The side of your hip
I'm tongue
Kissing all of your lips
I mean all four
You on all fours
Four Season hotel
I'm on tour
Just reason
To see you some more
Even gave you
The keys to my door
I don't usually
Get chicks used to me
That's just prove to be
Too much drama
But girl

Everyday this week
How about I fix you
A little something to eat
And just chill
We got a while
Right now just chill
Parle lil' momma, right here
Sippin' on Chardonnay
Slip on that
Victoria Secret lingerie
'Cause I ain't gonna
Throw my money away
If I can see you talk it
Out for me

[Chorus:]
(Talk'n it out)
Layin' in the cut
Kissing and rubbin
Makin' sweet lovin'
Damn the club tonight
Girl let's work it out
(It'll be)
Just me on you
(All night)
From eleven till
Six in the morning
I know you like when
I do you like that
Just work it out

Now that I got you
All soaking wet
I bet you know
What's coming next
(You)
Gonna twerk it out
Ah baby
Let me tell you how
What do you think about me
Twerkin' it from your
Front to your back
And kickback
Relax come sit
Here on my lap, shorty
Tonight I'm takin' you
All the way
Won't stop until you
Scream my name

[Repeat chorus twice]

Morning is coming and
I don't want to let you go
Let's just lay her in this
Bed of red rose pedals
I know that we spent
But one kiss
Could make this start
All over again
If you want it baby
Come with me

It's way to trill the way
You making it feel
The way you twerkin' is
Oh so s***
Oh baby, you sure
Love the part
It's way to trill the way
You making it feel
The way you twerkin is
Oh so s***
Oh baby you sure
Love the part

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try,
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

Thought that she was the one for me,
Til I found out she was on her dream,
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me.
This is why we could never be.

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

I know it's so unfair to you,
But I'd be lingering the rest to you,
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...

You remind of a girl, that I once knew.
See her face whenever I, I look at you.
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through.
This is why I just can't get with you.

2000 it's us
Yo, it's time to u-turn
Ya heard me?
You're either with us, or against us, yo

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball
Remember, the snake
And how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
We're bringing it all back
This is how we do it, just

[Chorus: x 2]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Oh come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the u-turn

In the 80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the 90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown
The dance was the running man
Now everybody want to push Bentley's
The year is two, everybody do the u-turn

[Chorus: x 2]

All you need to do is let go
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor, whoa

What happened to you yeah
From the beginning to where I was getting
But I was with it, and I'll admit that
She was clear it was a kinda thing
It woulnd't be easy for me to let it go
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time
I got a head someone got left behind
The world is yours, your sign is that aligned
And in no time, I had, money clothes fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fading cause I miss you
Can we go back
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
Cause I miss you, can we go back
What happened to you
What happened to you

Did what I wanted, freaked out the honies
I stayed on ther mind, mind was on the money
Had whatever, whenever heart throb forever
Black young and clever

When you give it up, you get it on
Love would be the only reason to look back
And when you turn it on, you can't turn it on
But picture me complaining the notice
Money clothes fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've fading cause I miss you
Can we go back
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah, turn back
Cause I miss you, give me your bag
What happened to you
What happened to you

What sense does it make to have everything and nothing
At the same time...
Where are you
I need you, were are you yeah
I'm looking for you, girl, come and share all these

Money clothes fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven grammys
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard
Private jets to france, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I'm fading cause I miss you
Can we go back

Saath mare aur sathattar ghyal
Blame doon Rab ko kyun aisa banaya

Tera jis se pad gaya paala
Acche ko ghalat kar daala

Tu cheez badi hai mast
Tu cheez badi hai mast mast

Madhosh hai tu har waqt waqt

Tu cheez badi hai mast mast
Tu cheez badi hai mast

Cheez badi..

Ho ankhiyan farebi, shaitani hain
Ishq mein tere marjani hai
Kitna koi khud ko bachaaye
Aag dilon mein lag jaani hai

Jaadu aisa kar daala
Na hosh kisi ne sambhala

Deewana Main Chala

Sharmayegi Ghabrayegi
Phir Vo Mere Paas Aayegi
Usay Na Jaane Doonga
Haye Sharmayegi Ghabrayegi
Phir Vo Mere Paas Aayegi
Usay Na Jaane Doonga
Gesuoon Ke Tale
Hum Milenge Gale

And the clashing of cymbals.
I need some running frantic notes,
Some lines of panic and desperation.
Cause your infatuation demands satisfaction.
I'm trying my best. I won't quit.
I'm trying not to disappoint.
Again and again.
Here we go just to balance you out.
I'm on fire, and this is about
How our song came on and we sang along.
So sing along.
The pictures are all falling down.
The ground started shaking without you around.

And you cleared out all the poison"

You said ""Hello, do you have the time?""

It's not mine for me to keep
You smiled and you said ""Let me buy you a drink""

Well, I just can't trust a girl that does the buying
I just can't trust a girl that does the buying

You gave up smoking a few months back
Well I quit last December, and I never looked back
Let's go somewhere fresh where I can see your face
You keep touching my arm, we're gonna crash at this place
I'm hooked on something you just said
You looked so lonely, or maybe it's just me
So the medicine went down smoothly
You went through my records
And you picked the one that I would have picked
Your eyes shined up as you sat on the floor
You tipped a glass and said ""Come join me""

You're always up or down
But you're never around.

I think I'm better off without.
Everyone is talking,
But they all sound the same.
All these singers singing
They play the same games.
You're as crooked as the California coast line.
So I'm sending you a tornado to get back east.

I could drive us all around

The insects they nibble away at our skin
As our bodies touch and twist
Your pressed collar and pencil thin lips
Your smile is strained and you're waiting
For a kiss that just won't come
Now we're back at your place
We rely on stale dialogue
I ruined what could have been long ago
What I need tonight doesn't matter now
So I watch you collapse and fold yourself into the bed

Adopted her posture and jaw line
Made them your own

Here we go again
You're transparent
No proper introduction just a sly smile

You're such a sloppy drunk
There goes another one on my shirt
You said you have my words written on your

And not the righteous

So have you been to a place like this?
To see your breath as it paints against the sky
The fever is near
I wish you were here

I'm thinking ambitious
I've got this feeling things will be alright
So go break a leg night
Been given the green light
So go entertain them
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for you

So have you been to a place like this?
To see your breath as it paints against the sky
Feeling so right and things will run
The fever is near
I wish you were here"

I'll laugh my eyes out, I'll feel the rhythm
I'll pretend you're the reason
To make anything and everything that is scented blossom
I'll run my fingers through your hair until your eyes blink out

All night long I layed in the grass
And listened with headphones to the saddest songs
It was a spiral of a night
You were spread out across the sky
The way you skinned your knees chasing cars
They're taking you away

I'll laugh my eyes out, I'll feel the rhythm
I'll pretend you're the reason

I've been conditioned to sell myself.
Well, that's not what this is about.
So I've got one hand on my neck
To keep all the vampires out.
I'm gonna finish this stiff drink and I'll be on my way.

No, this isn't me. No, this isn't you.

But I just took one bite and that's all it took.
Now write me down in your book, in your book.

I say ""goodnight."" I put the keys in the ignition.
I think the entire existence is asleep it's so quiet.
My headlights dance pictures on the treeline.
The song floats out the window into the fog-filled night.
I'm home now. It feels different.
I undress in the dark and find my way to the sheets.
My head is light from what you said. You were dead right.

Now they're back at my throat and they're thirsty.
I haven't proved anything until I've proved them right.
This apple in my hand, I just took one bite.
I just took one bite.

No, this isn't me. No, this isn't you.

All these circles and you're hanging them on the wall
Don't get so worked up
I'm still up here smiling
I had that dream again
Where you were flying high like a butterfly
I wanted to catch you to satisfy my hunger for hunting something down
Well I'm hunting you down

Stay awhile so we can play

Lost in a dream
That's becaming a nightmare

Its my love and my life
And somewhere between them
There's a road
And it's a far, a far better way

Out of nowhere came this vision
Of you and me together
Looking for a better way
Then from nowhere
You came running
Look out, world
There's something coming
I've suddenly found
A lot of things to say

Now well sing our tune together
This way it's a whole lot better
Were out to prove
There is a place for love

In a year or a day
When the devil is put to the test ...

The day of creation
Was our finest hour
It's something we ought to defend
But it's been so abused
Since the first day of light
That no glory can come in the end

Young man cried the old man
There is victory in staying alive
And if you care so little
For the world we're in
Why and what do you
Want to survive

Can't we try
To let the past go by
With it's lessons firmly
Settled in our minds
To our children one by one
And before the darkness comes
Let us leave a world full of light
Of a different kind

In truth they should meet
And with love
Their hearts should beat
And with patience
Solve the problems of our time
It wouldn't be so hard to do
It's only up to me and you
Let us not bequeath
A life that is a crime

On its way to reality

Strange how it pulls me through

Through the wires tonight
Just close your eyes and hold on tight
And here I am concentrating girl
With all my might
Now the sound of your laughter
Trails off through the midnight sky

As the miles go by cities come and go
When you close your eyes
And listen to the radio
Girl can you hear my song
The signal is clear and strong
Across the miles tonight

I load the gun, you shoot me down
I'm on the edge about to fall
Destructive power will make you
Lose your mind, use your mind
Trapped inside my nightmare

A reputation of
The highest resistance
A mean runner bringing order

Don't believe in feelings

Just a new beginning

I'll survive just fine
Free to take my time

Ridin' the moon in the midnight sky
I can see through
The man who lies with eyes
And the real thing that's wrong is
He has no song to lean on
So I'll take my time
Just to give you my rhyme
To try to be sure and open the door
'Cause there's much more to life
Than a day and a night to dream on

Now I ain't confessin'
To same kind of blessin'
I'm trying to say
Why I'm happy today
I'm not preachin', teachin',
Makin' some speech in dedication
'Cause it's no good me sayin'
Where the blame should be layin'

It comes out the same
With an ear to the ground
Each day I found inspiration"

A better way
I just can't go on living for today

I thought I heard a voice
Out on the wind
And I'm sure I heard it say
I'd find a friend
And it said I'd find
The answers in the end
All I gotta do is carry on

Carry on, carry on, the time is flyin'
You need another love
Maybe another town
Carry on, carry on
Don't wait until your hope is gone
When your last chance
Comes round

I'm gonna keep on looking
I won't quit
Aggravation
It ain't gonna hurt a bit
And I believe that
I have seen the last of it
There's nothing left to do
But carry on"

Found a love he never knew
Now he teaches children what is true

What made him choose to turn away
What makes us change our mind

There is no rhyme or reason

Running around in your confusion
From the cradle to the grave
Aint got time to see the world go by
Where are you going
Always moving round in circles
Talking words that never end
Standing in the grip of madness
Why oh why
What are you saying

How can we choose to run away
How do we change our mind
See the perception turn around
There is no explanation why
There is no rhyme or reason
Just feel the love and you're alive

Realise this understanding
Move before it gets too late
Take this chance
Or life will pass you by
This is the only way
We must pull ourselves together
There's so much we must explain
Got to teach the children what is true
There is no other way

Why did we choose to turn away
Why did we change our mind
The will to see turns you around

Now I don't mind
All this running around
Seems I've been doing it
Most of my life
My musics been kind
But some days I find
It brings me two kinds of trouble
And three kinds of strife

So don't try to compare it
Cause I just want to
Share it with some people
I like to call friends
There aint nothing bad and
No need to feel sad
And there's certainly no need
To make amends

It wont do you no harm and
There's no cause for alarm
I wont be praying for
Help from above
If the only thing
Wrong with rock and roll
Is that I keep on falling in love

If the only thing
Wrong with rock and roll
Is that I keep on falling
Keep on falling
Keep on falling in love"

I remember those magic nights
Those nights when it
All seemed right
But I knew that by mornin'
You'd be gone
And though you tell me
That it's not for long
It ain't easy here holdin' on
You gotta tell me where I stand

'cause either you don't give a damn
Or you don't even care to pretend
Or you won't spare a thought
Though you know
It must come to an end

You'd better know that
I've made up my mind
I gotta high of a different kind
And it's gonna take me
Where I wanna be
Sure i'll miss ya but I gotta choose
You can't believe that
I came here to lose
And you ain't a winner
That's easy to see

So i'll see you around or i'll write
And i'll send you some love

I'm at the point
It makes me feel like
I'm at the point of no return - feels like
I'm at the point

I was drifting through the days
With nowhere else to turn
I finally discovered
How much I have to learn
I shouldn't be afraid
For you to bring my love
Taking me somewhere
Deeper than deep in my soul

This time my heart will lead the way
To win the game you'got to play

You love me like a lover
I see it in your face

No need to run the race

Telling me something
Over and over again"

Someday, somehow
I know I'm gonna get there

All my daydreams
Seem so much nearer now
And I beg you hear my song

Firefly
On your glowing wings I'll ride
Till I sit beside
This dream of mine
Firefly, high on a risin' tide
Only wanna touch
The things I've seen

Steppin' lightly from star to star
Cross a wilderness of blue
Wonderin' how much
In love with me you are
'Cause I'm so much in love with you

Firefly, can you take me
I ain't had no lovin' lately
Firefly bring me love

To my new horizon
The one that I've still
Got my eyes on, my my firefly
Firefly, firefly, firefly

In my dreams you come to me
The answer to my prayer
As I begin to feel
You warm my heart
I awake and you're not there

Now and then I see your eye
As the stars begin to shine
No rain to cool my passion
No! Not now!
No, now you're mine!"

Is it I'm intoxicating

He took me to a little shack
And put a whip across my back

Came back with her on my mind

Johnny's got spare change
In his pocket
A ring and a watch
To hock for a sweet ride
A one way ticket
Hidden in his shoe
These last few hours
He says he'll spend with you
He's leavin' home without a trace
No forwarding address
He'll never have to face another

In a cold town
Got yourself a hot night
In a cold town

Well, the losers and the groovers
And the corner boys
Are hangin' around
Runnin' in and out of doorways
Up and down the stairways
Stray dogs headed for the pound

Im alive, Im alive and Im me

There's been so much
Bad time wasted
Just look and you'll see
Weve got so much going for us
Its not just a dream
Lets look and well find the answers
To questions Ive made
Well reach out for new beginnings
Let love show the way

Lets leave our past behind
The love can make us blind
But now we know
That were alive"

Walking with the sun shining down on my face
Seeing all the pieces just fall into place

Why fate takes a hand
Well I know, that I'm ready

Running through the howling wind, 
Moving through the stinging rain
If you don't take what is given, 
You only have yourself to blame.

I can dream and laugh and sing

I can have my fun,
With the silver stars
I can watch the sun,
Fall in the sea
And if it rains,
I will smile just the same
For the rain will make the flowers sing

I know how it is to feel sad
I know how it is when things go bad
But I'm sure that I have found the way

Keeps avoiding you

You begin to wonder if it's real
You are reaching sleep's oasis
You begin to wonder how you feel

I'm not afraid to live with mystery

Everywhere if you really dare

Lead on, speed on, I'll follow

Even for me

Shining there for me
I am the mountain high, I am the sea

It'll all disappear and there's the lesson
And the minute you think it's over
Say the word and your dream
Is coming back

All the way
I followed the road that was real to me
And suddenly
You take it for granted
And things don't turn out
Like you planned
When you think you've found
What is good and true
Through the open door
It can really turn on you

So here we are
We look for the light in so many eyes
And in our life
When hope starts to fade
There's a strength that
We give to each other
Walking in the sky over everyone
Head above the coulds
As we're touching the sun"

I gotta find a place,
A place to hide

There I was on a July morning looking for love.
With the strength of a new day dawning and the beautiful sun.
At the sound of the first bird singing I was leaving for home.
With the storm and the night behind me and a road of my own.
With the day
Came the resolution
I'll be looking for you.

I was looking for love in the strangest places.
There wasn't a stone that I left unturned.
I must have tried more than a thousand faces,
But not one was aware of the fire that burned
In my heart,
In my mind,
In my soul.
In my heart,
In my mind,
In my soul.

There I was on a July morning - I was looking for love.
With the strength of a new day dawning and the beautiful sun.
At the sound of the first bird singing I was leaving for home.
With the storm and the night behind me and a road of my own.

I'll be looking for you."

The singer needs a song

Ill be back before too long
I gotta do what I gotta do
And you know how
My heart loves to run, I gotta ride

Keep on ridin
Keep on ridin now

There's a city waiting
And a railroad station
Where my face is known
And an old hotel
That I know so well
Its a little bit like home
Its a situation
Not of my own choosing
And though a gamblin man
Would say that I was losing
I started out to win
And I'll do it again
Im never givin in
Cause if it comes down
To my heart, or to my pride
Im gonna ride

Keep on ridin, keep on ridin
Keep on ridin, yeah
Keep on ridin, keep on ridin

And I know you say
Im driftin, driftin on a dream
Youd better watch your step boy
It may not be what it seems

This heart of mine
Keeps tellin me to ride, ride, ride"

Uriah Heep,Lady In Black,/u/uriah+heep/lady+in+black_20142439.html,"She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win

She asked me name my foes then. I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or god
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life

But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she the mother of all men had counselled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay

""Oh lady lend your hand,"" I cried, ""Oh let me rest here at your side.""
""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life
""There is no strength in numbers. Have no such misconception
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away""

Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear
My labour is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone
I'll find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me"

But there's something
Going on inside
Could be friendly, could be vicious
And there isn't any place to hide

Its my imagination
A blessing or a curse
No, I can't ignore it
For better or for worse
It wakes me when Im sleeping
A thief that takes my breath away

And I find myself
Reaching for a lifeline
Throw me a lifeline and
Bring me back in time
I need a lifeline, throw me a lifeline
Im going down for the last time

Sometimes I can't control it
Sometimes it isn't there at all
Sometimes I try to roll it
And wind up staring at the wall

My imagination
I love the games it plays
I get in so deep that I get lost
For days and days
It sometimes leaves me shakin
Standin in the dark alone"

Take a trip around the world
View the magic lantern
There's a thousand
Mysteries unfurled
And I know one of them

I remember your face
Can't remember the place
Here on our own
Living alone

You can dream that
You're a man of power
Ready to be happy with your gold
Without love your mind is going sour
Money's no good when you're old

View the magic lantern
You can have the sky above
Yeah, the magic lantern
You'll buy everything but love
Everything but love"

Believin' we could make a little love
And I let you have my heart
I was as certain as the stars above

Looked here and there
Every everywhere
I even searched beyond the dawn
But you were nowhere to be found
And I was going round and round
Lost like I'd never been born

Time after time
I've lost my love for a rhyme
A reason seemed good enough
You always put me down
While you made me run around
I can't take anymore of that stuff

Through my mystic window

I saw presented
Became a vision that
I saw resented
I stood and watched
Its image changing
The unseen hand was rearranging
And all the time I wondered
How did it wind
Slowly, surely it unfolded
Its simple lines just as
A pole wind told it
A temporary revolution
My problems rose and fell
With a lapse of illusion
My mind was telling me, don't fight it
It's just a hazard in the night
Don't do those
Who've lost their way

What it was worth

Miles and miles of smiles
Getting me nowhere
Opportunities I just can see
Can't lead me to the slaughter
'Cause I'll already be there
I've been up that street
And I know what's waiting for me
Just waiting

Midnight, moonlight
Day into day
No escape I must stay
Midnight, show me the way
Show me the way
Give me something to play
Something to play
To help me make the new day

Take me out of the darkness
Into the light
I've no friends to stand by me
Here in the night
It's an affair of
A sad and weary heart
Take me out of the darkness
Back to the start

The answer was in the question
She asked me if I wanted to stay

All of my friends said it couldn't last
Id be another there in her past
But I disagree cause
I can't say say no, no, no, no

Save me, she's so hungry
Make a man do anything
I know, she gets hungry
Gets away like an innocent child
Save me, she's so hungry
Has the appetite to everything
I know, she's just hungry
Shes got the mind of a miracle child

And when I changed the seasons
And water to wine
I took all the wordly problems
And got the peace in our time
And after I built the temple
She wanted so bad
I took her to altar on sunday
To look at everything that we had

I could say no, but I always do
Someone outside
Would be comin through
And I can't stop her
I can't say no, no, no, no

To chase away the sorrows
Her clothes are like a million stars
Made of tears and rainbows
And all the while
Her senses smile into my life

To a mission bell

Of her image on the water
And precious stones upon the shore
From every distant corner
Like diamonds in the light
They shine beyond the stars

I was just driftin
As a wind blown wave
Like a stricken ship
I thought I'd never be saved
So far below me
There seemed so much more
Yet a man has to know
What he's looking for

Something unknown
Kept my life turning around
But I couldn't get near to
Putting my feet on the ground
With all that I had
Any man would be glad
But my everything was nothing
So what made me sad

That heavy load
No more blues about paying dues

All the seeds I sowed"

The night that we left home
And the words of warning
Ringing in my ears

New job, new friends and a family
In a house on the sunny side
We played on the wheel of fortune
But it was me that took the ride
It didn't work between us
I had to give it all away
And in the end I knew it had to be

Just before I go
Since he was the offender
I want her to know

With a power so obscene
Then your hollow heart it was torn apart
You were thrown a learning curve
If you turn your back on good advice you get what you deserve

We hit the nail right on the head,
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again

Here's another guy he just want us to try
His best to make things good
He's an honest man with a helping hand
From a run down neighbourhood
Then you hear the thud, you see the blood
His good work come undone
Step aside for the one who said
Only the good die young

I hope you don't misunderstand me now
Cause I don't want to get you down
Just looking out at all the things I see
And they keep coming round and round

We hit the nail right on the head,
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again
We hit the nail right on the head,
We hit the nail right on the head
Over and over again

Now we have to go down a lover's road
On a path that ain't so smooth
Many ups and downs many tears and frowns
As the sweethearts look for truth
All the lies between what she believers
Gonna have to take the fall
No fear that she will ever look back
As true love conquers all.

I hope you don't misunderstand me now
Cause I don't want to get you down
Just looking out at all the things I see
And they keep coming round and round

We hit the nail right on the head,
We hit the nail right on the head

Pushing everything and everyone
To one side
But when all grows old
Chills still cold
When I sing with my sweet guitar
When I sing with my sweet
My sweet guitar

Don't waste your tears on me
Go cry in the river
What you need I aint
About to deliver
I'm my own man and
That's how I'm gonna stay
Cause music is
The name of the game

As she walks towards the light

Its the night of the wolf

Streets paved with gold
Night gives out a warning
There's thunder in her heart
And mother wolf is calling

Searchin in the shadows
For the one she must save
She cries out a prayer
Like a song from beyond the grave

The bells will toll
No one will sleep tonight
While she alone will
Walk the streets tonight

Sun begins to rise
All the streets washed with rain
Still hear her cries
Eyes burnt with pain

Returning to the twilight
Betrayed by the night
Screaming for her young one
As she walks towards the light"

Now that we've grown apart
It seems so very sad
Why did it turn so bad and I remember
You said that all good things
Must surely end
Never mind all the hearts
That lie broken

I know I'll never make
The same mistake again
I doesn' matter what you say

Now I think about it
We all need a little time
'Cause if we ain't got love
We ain't got nothing
The doors are opened wide
On my one and only life
Gonna ride down the road
And let my soul run free

I know I'll never make
The same mistake again
But I will always be your friend

Now that we've grown apart
It seems so very sad
Why did it turn so bad and I remember
And I remember

Let my soul run free
Let my soul run free
Did I break your perfect little heart"

Aaah aaah aaah aaah

A pilgrim at the grey of dawn
Leaving in the mist of morning
On his journey of goodness
Heaven sent, God blessed

Pilgrim laughing at the world
Spreading joy at the touch of his hand
Wiping out all the misery
Making love and history

Those of us who don't know war
We shouldn't try to make it
'Cause so many did and even more died
Do you think you could take it

'Cause Love lies waiting at our back door
Such a beautiful matter of fact
Life's like an apple with love as the core
And I'll tell you 'bout that

Just a man in my prime
Love was there but I had no time
I was cheered and adored
And I thought fame was all the world
Battles won and victory cheers
Were the sounds I'd heard for years
But the woman I really loved
Was losing me to all this blood I only knew I had to win
And build a world where I was king
But leaders come and leaders go
And that's the truth I came to know
Love or war I could not choose
And so both I had to lose"

Take your time with
What you're doin'
And you'll see the skies appear

Can't you see the time will tell us
How it's gonna always be
You can wrap me
Around your finger
And I ain't no mystery

That's all I can do
I'm playing for time
Before I fall in love with you

You can push me every which way
Hey I got no place to fall
Guess you're gonna rue your bullshit
When your back's against the wall
Louder now that's what the games go ?
And I bought the devil now ?
You can get to dream about it
I won't need one anyhow

Turned to sweetness in her eyes

Came to life to my surprise

Rain came and took her away
Just when I thought she was here to stay
Sun gone I was left high and dry
Love came by and touched me
And kissed me so long

Shine hard October moon
Eagle take me to her soon
Run swiftly silver stream
Find my love or let me dream

Now half of me is all of her
I'd be much happier if I were whole
All my words and wisdom fall
The poet's justice leads me to my goal
Leads me to my goal

All over the world

If we try to find some
Deep communication
Bring an end to war
And start a new creation
From the truth inside
Its waiting, it's waiting

Suddenly then
The clearest voice will call
Feeling the air
You have no choice at all

Can I ask the question to you
Do you know who you are
Do you know what were doing here
Try to see the way from within
Cause it isn't outside
Let your honesty see it clear

Why does anger fit our hearts
With missconception
Turn us inside out in every direction
From the truth inside
That's waiting, it's waiting

Follow the voice
That lives inside your heart
Never the choice
That tears your world apart

Take a walk and be
A wave upon the ocean
Touch the sky and
Feel our spirit in motion
This is the love inside that's waiting
Just waiting

Suddenly everything is there to see
You can be everything you want to be

Are you ready to go my love
Are you ready to be my love
Are you ready to die for love"

And it's getting to me, a happy man

Waste all my time

Measuring carefully my years

They will see us ride
But if they cared to look
Then they would see
It's our return to fantasy

Can you understand
That in every man
There's a need to unwind
That's never been defined
Somewhere deep within
There's another being
You are somehow abusing
By the person you're using

After moonlight night
Side by side
They will see us ride
But if they cared to look
Then they would see
It's just our return to fantasy

Travelling faster than lightening
Closer than ever before
We can go on for you
And take you nearer to
The legend of mystery
From the beginning of time
Dreaming... Time... Dreaming
We can return to
The land of the good and the kind
Time... Dreaming... Time... Dreaming
Why don't you come to our party
And open your minds

In another place
There's a newer face
Like an unfinished painting
Your creator is waiting

What it is inside
That will set your mind thinking
While the others are sinking"

I was all on my own
She poured a beer
And said when I'm finished here
Hang around 'cause
I'm taking you home

Don't worry
I'll treat you all right

I was until I got inside

Give me your money
And don't start any foolin' around
I said what, I said what
Don't you think you're
Turning me upside down

She said, I don't care
I've been everywhere
And I've not been looking for you
But I'll take you in
And give you a spin
You'll know some tricks
By the time we get through

Shady lady
You want it all your own way
Shady lady
You won't let go of your prey

Eat me up and spit me out
But let's get started now
I know what you're talking about

Now in the morning
As the day was dawning
Shady asked me if
I'd stay there awhile
I said stay, baby no way
But I couldn't keep myself
From a smile

I said now no bye-bye's
Go in and dry your eyes
That ain't fittin'
For a lady like you
Why not be smart
And give your life another start
But take care now
Whatever you do

I'm on my way

We'll meet again one day
And don't worry 'cause when we do
I'm gonna make sure
That there ain't
Very much left of you"

Lost in emotion she cries
To the wind and the rain
In silence she feels the breeze
No mercy tonight
The passion and promise has made
Life broken inside

She stills calls his name
She can't get home
She stills calls his name
Broken hearted

Another town rolls by
As a distant rose
And wonderin what she will find
When she gets home
You, there's a part in flame
But a careless heart
Dreams are an open game
Will tear you apart

She stills calls his name
Shes out of control
She stills calls his name

One love comes of the rest
A bed of roses was a bed of nails
Don't take the blame forever
Just give it time"

Free our souls in endless love

Our hopes and dreams

Our world would surely die

To the warmer winds and balmy skies

And my love ever meet
Sweet sweet freedom
Sweet sweet sweet

What I'm really tryin to say
Is that I will be around
Should you find that after all
You can't get by
With what you found

Oh, it wasn't just my heart you took
And gently tossed into the sea
Though it's hard to find
The words I need -
I guess it was me

Will the line between all this
And my love ever gonna meet
Sweet sweet freedom
Sweet sweet sweet

Oh sweet, oh sweet sweet freedom
So sweet, so sweet"

You took me by surprise
In your long silk dress
And those deep brown eyes
I was captured by your smile
But when fate put out its hand
You're walking to your love
How was I to resist
The passion and the kiss
We raised the future alone

She stole my body and soul
With a heart next to mine
I didn't wanna face the day
But I have no choice when we kiss

She said
Goodnight my sweet pretender
Tonight we live forever
One heart, one soul
On the edge of the world
Goodnight my sweet pretender
Feels like we died together
In each others arms
On the edge of the world

When she touched me so warm
And so was her body
A kiss she gave to me
The name she said to pain and pleasure
Time my soul rescue me
But I know I'd be here on my own
As soon as the sun would rise
I didn't wanna face the day
But I have no choice when we kiss

I've dreamed of a place I know
With the shadows of my past
Still remain
You're buried in the midst of time
For always you'll be the sun that shines
Shines on me

Goodnight, goodnight
My sweet pretender ..."

You and I are
Masters of our destiny
We look for consolation all the time
Until we find out things are not
What they were meant to be, oh no
And if it doesn't suit our mood
We'll call it crime

Dedication's not an obligation
Or a figment of
Someone's imagination
It's the only way they say
To live from day to day
To make each passing way
A small sensation

Dreams are the possession of
The simple man
Reality the fantasy of youth
But living is a problem that
Is common to us all
With love the only
Common road to truth"

Morning's sleepy sky
With all the colours of the sunrise
Shining in our eyes.

One, then another, with a story of yesterday's lives
Or of a lover who had gone in a
Moment of strife.

No thought of sleep ever dwells upon
The wise man's mind
Some task or audience stealing every
Moment of his time.

Thus we have learned to live
While mortal men stand waiting to die.
How can we do what must be done in
Just one short life.

And if you ask, then you must know.
If you still doubt, you should be told.
It was not we that made it so.
It was by those who went before.

And there you sit, tomorrow's child
So full of love, so full of life
But you must rise to meet the day
Lest you become another tale

And there you sit, tomorrow's child
So full of love, so full of life

Thousands fill the gallery
They pay their price to see a dream
They can make believe for free
Two hours' worth of fantasy
Maybe they pretend

Or maybe they just love
To sit and blend

Colours unleash and float away
To each and everyone of you
Tonight the spirit brings the news

When will the crimes of
Inhumanity be known
I am only one voice

Everything will surely disappear

The snow has gone at last
I'm out of the shadows and into the sun
And then I see you smile

As he rides from day to night

Hes a bad man, so they say
Living for his love and living free
Riding swift and secretly
So hell miss the hanging tree
Wounded spirit on the wind
Riding to his dream and destiny

Hes laughing at the wanted posters
Calling for his friends to see
Laughing aloud as he rides away
Kicking up the dust with speed
Time hands him down a pathway
And freedom is a horse he rides
Glory is a dream he's after
And fortune is his hearts delight

So hell miss the hanging tree
Wounded spirit on the wind
Riding to his dream and destiny"

While the midnight moon shone brightly overhead.

To the magician tell of lives that he has led.

Let the bells of freedom ring.
Songs of love to Friday's king.

Let's all go to the magician's birthday.
It's in the forest but not so far away.
Much to do and so much to say,
While we listen to the oaken orchestra play.

Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.
(Happy birthday - you magician, happy birthday to you.)

(Repeat)

And at the dead of midnight, as we watched the dancing firelight,
The air grew cold and seemed to dour the flame.
The fire died, the music faded, filled with fear of death we waited,
For now we knew some evil was to blame.

I challenge you, I challenge you all
For all you own and all you know
And by all the powers of darkness
I will steal what is mine.
Surrender now or face my spite.
I catch you: It may be Friday night,
But did you know this day also number thirteen.

First I give you fire...
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream.
Yes! Now I give you nightmares.
From your horror I'll create a dream.
You cannot fight me, for I have the sword of Hades.
But one thing you can't see,
My answer is simply
An impenatrable fortress of love.

The fear went as quickly as it came.
The air was clear, the fire burned again.
The flames leapt beyond the glade,
The swan sang to greet the day.
And then we knew that
Love will fly"

Its iron strength to take the strain
Children rock it to and fro
And gaily trim its coloured brow

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Above the sky devoid of cloud
Think not to cast a thunder shroud
Upon this place so full of joy
A field of gold of love's employ

Until he died at the hand of needless war

To free the world of it's fear and pain,
And help the people to feel free again.

Why don't we listen to the voices in our heart
Cause then I know we'd find we're not so far apart
Everybody's got to be happy, everyone should sing
For we know the joy of life, the peace that love can bring.

Utada Hikaru,About Me,/u/utada+hikaru/about+me_10162372.html,"My baby, there's something you should know
About me, before you propose
Although we have known each other for quite a while

Whenever you need me
I'm gonna try to make it through to you
But I'm not always ready to
When you are not watching
I prepare myself for you
But I worry that I might have been misunderstood

I gotta tell you, I wanna tell you
I can be lazy but I'll try not to
Maybe I'm not a very honest person
Right now you're sure that you love me
But are you really sure that you know all about me
Up and down and down down down down we go

My baby, a lot could happen before tomorrow
Think about the pain before you take another dose
Who knows if it could be good for you after all

Whatever you give me
I'm gonna try to give you something new
Not something you've already chewed
When you are not watching
I prepare myself for you
Because this could be good
What's buggin' you

I gotta tell you, I wanna tell you
I can be crazy when I don't want to
Maybe I'm not a very honest person
What if I don't want a baby yet
Is it okay if I'm not cute and naive
Up and down and down down down down we go

This could be good
So I gotta tell you, I wanna tell you
You can be shady... Whatcha goin' through?
Maybe you're not a very honest person
You say you're sure that you love me
How could that be when you keep so much for me
Turn the tables 'round, 'Round and 'round we go

Right now you're sure that you love me
But are you really ready to know more about me
Up and down and down, 'round and 'round and 'round
Where do we go"
Utada Hikaru,Addicted To You,/u/utada+hikaru/addicted+to+you_10162352.html,"There is no need to meet you everyday
I've got so many things to do
There is no need to talk with you everyday
I am annoyed with so many phone bills

No love lasts forever
Worrying about our relationship deepens my love
I never talk about our love to anyone
Because I am not a child

This road won't last forever
When it ends we should go our own separate ways

It is a funny story
Even though I'm hurt, I'm back for more
I am addicted to you
Just because I can't meet you
Doesn't mean I will die
I understand our circumstances

* Even so, I am still dying to meet you
I want to meet you everyday
I don't know what to do with this feeling
I want to be mature enough to deal with my own feelings
But it takes time for that to happen
Oh baby (Oh baby)
I am addicted to you

There is no reason to restrict each other
We do not need to pretend that we are mature
At night, he doesn't answer his phone,
Instead his answering machine does
I want to call him to hear his message anyway

I'm in love with you
I know you want me too
I don't say ""I love you"" not because I cannot say it

It's a sad story
Whenever you doubt my love, I love you more
I may be addicted to you
Everyone's excuse for not saying ""I love you"" is the same
Everyone thinks that they need reasons

Even so, I am still dying to meet you
I want to meet you everyday
Can I tell you this feeling?
Hold me rather than kiss me
Don't stop without telling me
Oh baby (Oh baby)
I may be addicted to you

I feel sad when I can't meet you
I feel good when I am with you
These feelings are addictive
Hold me rather than kiss me
Don't stop without telling me
Oh baby (oh baby)

Hold me rather than kiss me
Don't stop without telling me
Oh baby (oh baby)
I think I am addicted to you"
Utada Hikaru,Amai Wana / Paint It Black,/u/utada+hikaru/amai+wana+paint+it+black_10162377.html,"Everytime we meet in the street by chance
My doubts deepened
That strange guy who appears everywhere I go
Because I'm always doing something dangerous
So no matter what I do, he worries me
Love trap

Being loved and confused
To the point where I couldn't move
Carried along by something that seemed to guard my steps
I was caught

I was caught in a sweet trap
And my situation has become serious
A sweet trap, I'm not just calm
I can't be called ""shallow,"" or ""young""

Everytime you lose your temper to me
It draws us closer together
Don't make such a suddenly serious face
I was confused by that clever trap of yours
It's a futile resistance
Love trap

Did I underestimate that young smile?
You aimed for the chink in my armor
Because of it's twinkling, your eye
Pushed me into it's depths

Your chains have become comfortable
I'm embraced by both your hands
I want to shine like a firefly

I was caught in a sweet trap
And my situation has become serious
I've only beome the prisoner of a sweet trap
Sweet, faint, that gentle light

I was caught in a sweet trap
And my situation has become serious
A sweet trap, you won't say it seriously
Let's confess the whole truth to each other"

How about some speakers to amplify me
How about a rhyme to fortify me

Simplifying things for everybody

I need someone who's true
Someone who does the laundry too
So what you gonna do
Please don't forget to follow-through
I take my diamond shoes
Someone who tries to be on time
Do what you said you'll do
I hope you like to follow-through

All that I need's a bit o' practice
My mind is set on bigger business
This is not a time for reminiscing
This is something new and interesting
Why are you trying to classify it
This is music for all humanity from me

Dreaming of hip hop tunes
They say you've got the proper tools
So what you gonna do
Keep doing things the way you do
I take my diamond shoes
Someone who tries to be on time
Do what you came to do
I came to see you follow-through

The melody you hummed
Because you couldn't whistle

The motion of your tears
Passes through the air
At the moment you lightly touched my arm

The sun is bright
And I turned my eyes away from your signal
Because I've been alone
The stars are too wide
Give me another chance

When our hearts overlap, it will rise
Like a color pattern
With a feeling this natural
There's no way it can be mistaken
When I look at it from the gap in my memories, it vanishes
That pattern
No matter how far we're seperated
There's no reason for you to give up

No matter how much you push me away
I can't hide it
Now, throwing away my pride
I'll beg of you

When I awake from dreaming
If you're there for me
Oh, I need nothing more

Even the weakness hidden by the sun
Which I understand for the first time
If we can be together
I'll become strong
Give me another chance

I'm searching for you, my dear
In the circle shaped pattern
Inside the endless maze
I want to come a little closer to you
In this daily battle
I can't convey it
No matter how tightly you hold me
I have no way to reach you

When our hearts overlap, it will rise
Like a color pattern
With a feeling this natural
There's no way it can be mistaken
When I look at it from the gap in my memories, it vanishes

No matter how far we're seperated
There's no reason for you to give up"

Yeah...

You pick up the phone on the seventh ring
Even if I don't say my name
You know who it is by my voice

The melody that falls naturally from my lips
But I was most happy when I lost my words
Even on days when I have problems

When I see you, they all fly away
On my rainy days, when I can't see you
Just by hearing your voice, automatically the sun will shine

It's automatic, just by being by your side
Just by you looking at me with those eyes
The excitement won't stop
I can't say no
I just can't help it

It's automatic, when I'm held by you
It seems like we're in paradise
Shining brightly
I close my eyes and soon I feel so good
It's automatic

Your ambiguous attitude still makes me uneasy
So being this infatuated with you
Is still necessary for a while

Even on the days when your kindness was hard to bear
You always told the truth
On rainy days whe I can't cry alone
If I touch my ring, look, the sun will shine

It's automatic, just by being by your side
My whole body gets warm
I can't hide my excitement
I can't even take a breath
I just can't help it

It's automatic
When I access it
I try to touch the glittering words
Inside the computer screen and I feel so warm

It's automatic, just by being by your side
I don't think you're beloved, just necessary
It's not because I'm sad
I just need you

It's automatic, when I'm held by you
It seems like we're in paradise
Shining brightly
I feel so good
It's automatic...

I just want you here with me
Tell me why

Why is it that I sing? (Who knows)
I don't want to love anymore
Why am I growing distant? (darling darling ah)

I can't hear anything
The desert dawn is cast on my eyelids
My tears don't spill at all
I just tried turning blue

I was born of a woman, but
I go best with this color

I can't feel anything anymore! It's that age, isn't it
The sadness of the clown The spinning lights

Even on nights this clod
Who is the one singing? (Who?)
Five or six sheets of manuscript paper
The tune of blue ink

I want to believe one more time, we will be even
Sooner or later the light will reach you!

No matter how painful the time
Why do I live? (Who knows)
I don't want glory at all
Normality is the best

Darling, Darling, ah... Questions make me blue
Darling, Darling, ah... Tell me something good

Let me feel it one more time, with a heart from performance

No matter how long the night
Day should break, right? (Who knows)
This story is from how many years back?
You're still caught up in it, huh (Darling darling, ah)

I can't hear anything
A ship floats in amber waves
I don't embrace fantasies
It's fogged up and I can't see

What can you understand?
Why do I care? (Who knows)

You still can't read the signals I've been sending from here.
Come on.
I'll get it across, I'll stop, just hide it away
Until I can't runaway anymore.
I'll believe, that's no good, cause I still don't wanna believe it.
I want to be closer to your ideal
I can't be a good girl Can you keep a secret?
I'm not sad when you're here.
Can you keep a secret? Can you keep a secret?
I can't be closer to your ideal.
I can't change that quickly, Can you keep a secret
Cause I'll call to you when I'm sad
Can you keep a secret? Or do I have to keep it secret?

Hit it off like this
Hit it off like this, oh baby
Even when you're by my side,
I'm looking for a round about way to express it.
If you don't want this puzzle to go unsolved.
Won't you come on
A faint sound
The moving shadow giving chase
A shadow that won't leave us alone.
You'll need to be a bit adventurous and have the courage to hurt.
I want to be closer to your ideal
I can't be a good girl Can you keep a secret?
I'm not sad when you're here.
Can you keep a secret? Can you keep a secret?
I can't be closer to your ideal.
After this there's no going back, Can you keep a secret?
Show me, that you're not going to go and blab it to everyone.
Can you keep a secret?
Or do I have to keep it secret?

I've kept it quiet all this time,
Don't tell anybody, Can you keep a secret?
I'm not sad, cause you're here.
Can you keep a secret? Can you keep a secret?
Even if I promise not to hurt you,
Who knows really? Can you keep a secret?
I'm not sad, cause you're here.
Can you keep a secret?

Don't disappear into the background beginning to stir
With commotion just yet, I can't hear anything anymore.
But I can feel you breathe
A little unlike myself I'm expecting something
From a surprisingly coincidental development.

I wanna be here eternally
I want to gaze at you just like this
I can feel you close to me
I can't be by your side forever
Only this moment will last forever.

I want to be with you on my break before I go to war.
We'll leave the promise until next we meet.
Can you hear me breathe?
Everyone has times when they are moved by not so surprising
Developments.
I wanna be here eternally

In a place no one will find us
I can see you're all I need
I don't need help getting to tomorrow
Even this moment is surely just a fantasy
I can feel you close to me
Even if we can't go back to that place,
At least this feeling will last forever

I wanna be here eternally
I can see you are all I need
Only this moment will last forever."

Now home feels so foreign
They told me I was mistaken; infatuated
And I was afraid to trust my hunches
Now I am ready

Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving
Please let me worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
This is my story

Through mountains high and valleys low
The ocean through the desert snow
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know
This is our exodus '04

Through traffic jams in Tokyo
New music on the radio
We'll say goodbye to the world we know
This is our exodus '04

Landscapes keep changing
History teaches something
I know I could be mistaken but my heart has spoken
I cannot redirect my feelings
The waves have parted

Daddy don't be mad that I'm leaving
Please let me worry about me
Mama don't you worry about me
This is my story

Through mountains high and valleys low
The ocean through the desert snow
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know
This is our exodus '04

Through traffic jams in Tokyo
New music on the radio
We'll say goodbye to the world we know
This is our exodus '04

I'm listening to a music never-ending
My baby don't you know I'll never let you down
You've opened me to so many different endings
But baby I know that you'll always be around

Through mountains high and valleys low
The ocean through the desert snow
We'll say goodbye to the friends we know
This is our exodus '04

Through traffic jams in Tokyo
New music on the radio
We'll say goodbye to the world we know
This is our exodus '04

Soon have nothing to

For some reason it hurts,
Like a magic spell
That doesn't get undone even after the good bye.
A hint of bitterness.
The flavor of life

Stuck in the midpoint between friends and lovers,
Like an un-riped fruit dreaming about the day of harvest
Because of being unable to move one more step forward
What's causing this frustration baby?

When you say thank you to me,
For some reason it hurts,
Like a magic spell
That doesn't get undone even after the good bye.
A hint of bitterness
The flavor of life

Sweet talk and tasteless conversations.
It sparks no interest in me
Even when things do not go the way you want
It doesn't mean you've thrown your life away

When asked 'What's wrong? '
I answer 'It's nothing'
The smile then disappears after goodbye
It's unlike me

The more I wish to believe in you,
For some reason it hurts even more
'i like you a lot' instead of 'i love you' sounds more like you
The flavor of life

The moment when you suddenly remember the scent of someone you had almost forgotten
I want to be able to openly and honestly cherish the white purity of the falling snow more

A future tender and warmer than a diamond
I want to grasp it, in this limited time we have, I want to spend it with you

When you say thank you to me,
For some reason it hurts,
Like a magic spell
That doesn't get undone even after the good bye.
A hint of bitterness
The flavor of life"

To say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme
To make a poem singing

With music and words I've been flying
For you I have written a song
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along

Fly me to the moon,
And let me play among the stars
Won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words: Hold my hand!
In other words: Darling, kiss me!

Fill my heart with song,
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for all I worship and adore
In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you!

In other words: Please be true!

Utada Hikaru,For You,/u/utada+hikaru/for+you_10162353.html,"When I put my headphones on and hide amongst the crowds
I feel like I must've just disappeared.

That music that makes even the sound of my own footsteps fade away.
Until I forget you and our fighting I want to dance.

When I come back to a messy room,
I can see my own loneliness through your existence.

Though it would be better to become kinder for my sake and not someone else's,
I can't feel lonely all by myself, that's why
For you I want to give you the same loneliness so that you can become strong
So that someday it can reach you, that's why
I sing this song for you.

Even on mornings when I don't want to get up,
I get up to see your face.
On sleepless nights,
I sing to myself the song you gave me.

Don't get me wrong,
I don't intend to ever rely on you for anything at all.

If there's a song I can sing for only me and not anyone else,
I don't wanna remember that kind of song.
That's why for you if you misunderstand me, I feel this heartbreak
Eventhough I should be used to it, eventhough I should be milder.
That's why I sing this song for you

I want to make you cry
Let me hurt you, and let me heal you
When I want to fly you always give me a brighter sky.

You want to make me cry
You taught me joy by sorrow
When I want to shine you always give me a darker sky."

English translation:

No matter what the time
I'm just alone
Destiny forgotten,
Even though I kept going.
Inside of the sudden light I awaken
In the middle of the night

Quietly,
Stand in the exit way,
And, in the pitch-black, take the light
And about the recent promises,
Is it just that I'm so anxious?
A wish that's wanting to be said, but shall be repressed
I'll introduce my family,
You'll surely get along well

No matter what the time
We'll always be together
No matter what the time
Because you're by my side
The light known as ""you"" finds me,
In the middle of the night

Enter a noisy street
And put on the mask of destiny.
Thinking too much about the future.
Stopping things that have no meaning.
Today I'll eat delicious things.
The future is always before us,
Even I don't know it.
It's not necessary to go right to the end,
Just keep going.

It's okay if the scenes
Go on one by one.
The light known as ""you""
Reflects my scenario

Let's talk more,
And about the tomorrow that's before your very eyes.
Turn off the television,
And look only at me.
No matter how well we're doing,
I don't believe in us completely.
But at those sort of times,
Because you're by my side,
The light known as ""you"" finds me,
In the middle of the night.

Let's talk more,
And about the tomorrow that's before your very eyes.
Turn off the television,
And look only at me.

Let's talk more,
And about the tomorrow that's before your very eyes.
Turn off the television,
And look only at me."

She doesn't listen to her best friend
It's only for the money, for the money

She doesn't want to be respected
Reality's her best friend
She need's the extra money, extra money

In the city, the town, and the household
So many things go unreported
So many things her eyes have seen, eyes have seen, eyes have seen

Chorus
Meet me in the hotel lobby
Everybody's looking lonely
Watch me as I walk in slowly
When your eyes meet mine
It's in the mirrors of the hotel lobby

This is not what she expected
Her hopes, they stretch and they bend
Whinkle like paper money, paper money

In the city, the town, and the household
So many things can be distorted
So if you want a true life story, bring money, bring money

Meet me in the hotel lobby

Watch me as I walk in slowly
When your eyes meet mine

Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care, you're always there

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be without a friendly face
A lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Troubles seem to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give

But you don't notice
I'm sure you don't even know my name
But I don't care about that

With fake nails, color contacts
Extensions decorating my hair and wearing fake fur
Why am I looking for true love?
Fighting is okay, but I'm tired of that

If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same
That's why I'm dreaming of you
In my room, I escape into a dream
If I close my mouth, lies and truth are the same

It's a line that moves my soul, but I can't hear anything
From far away someone is calling me
But I don't yet want to return
The noise of the city is comfortable

Cold, kind, I'm enfolded in my own private zone
Why am I always searching for a place to be?
I laugh, I cry, I don't mind if I hurt people
If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same

That's why I'm always with you
In my room, I escape into a dream
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same
There are days when I want to run away
And forget everything

If I close my eyes, dreams and reality are the same
That's why I'm dreaming of you
In my room, I escape into a dream
If you're with me, lies and truth are the same"

And give you all the love you need.
When the nights get longer.
I wanna get with you
Adn only you.
You oughtta know by now.
What you do to me.
I'm touchin' you so sweet
Really puts me in the mood.

Then you'll feel my hearbeat inside.
You just need to give me all

瞼閉じても戻れない
さっきまで鮮明だった世界 もう幻

汗ばんだ私をそっと抱き寄せて
たくさんの初めてを深く刻んだ

揺れる 若葉に手を伸ばし
あなたに思い馳せる時
いつになったら悲しくなくなる
教えてほしい

今日私は一人じゃないし
それなりに幸せで
これでいいんだと言い聞かせてるけど

勝てぬ戦に息切らし
あなたに身を焦がした日々
忘れちゃったら私じゃなくなる
教えて 正しいサヨナラの仕方を

誰かに手を伸ばし
あなたに思い馳せる時
今あなたに聞きたいことがいっぱい
溢れて 溢れて

木々が芽吹く 月日巡る
変わらない気持ちを伝えたい
自由になる自由がある
立ち尽くす 見送りびとの影

思い出たちがふいに私を
乱暴に掴んで離さない
愛してます 尚も深く
降り止まぬ 真夏の通り雨

夢の途中で目を覚まし
瞼閉じても戻れない
さっきまであなたがいた未来
たずねて 明日へ

ずっと止まない止まない雨に
ずっと癒えない癒えない渇き"

Happiness inside a bottle

Light as a feather
I lie in my bed and flip through tv channels
Eating Godiva
I'm smoking my days away reading old emails
In my old pajamas
What a day, me muero, muero, muero

Loneliness makes its arrival
Depression starts to settle in
I try to go Winona Ryder
And do some crazy thing

Now and then I'm suicidal
Flirting with a new temptation
Overdose overreaction

Light as a feather
I lie in my bed and flip through tv channels

But I still can't get through, it's 4 am
When the night's too quiet, my thoughts get restless
I understand, but I still can't get enough sleep
I've forgotten that promise
I'll give you back your ring, so give me back my heart
I have to go on without you

It's hard, so I'll be the one to break up

いつの日かまた会えたとしたら
最後と言わずにキスをして
もし夢の中でしか会えないなら
朝まで私を抱きしめて

涙で目が覚めた月曜日の朝
急いで支度をした

僕はまだあの頃のまま
青空で待ち惚け
夏の花が散る頃には
笑顔で僕を迎えに来て

純なあなたが誤解するから
おしゃべりな私を黙らせて
傷ついたのはお互い様だから
四の五の言わずに抱き寄せて

いつの日かまた会えたとしたら
もう一度私を困らせて
もし夢の中でしか会えないなら

The tv looks at me with it's blue eyes
No matter how often I change the channel
I can't escape that gaze

No matter how many times I look in the fridge
It's the same answer, an answer I'm used to hearing
The timelimit is about up
I need more time, let me be

Oh no, this is a parody
But to me, it's my life story
Without waiting for me, the clock
Pretends not to know anything
I know, it's a common story
But to me, it's my life story
Not being some copy of someone else
I'll write the rest of it from now

Facing the same way with everyone else
It's the freeway
It's just a coincidence
When the road split, it was sudden

Hurry me to the seventh floor, please
The elevator is unusually small
But no one else is here, so I feel safe
Set me free from ""thoughtfulness""

Oh no, everything's a parody
But to everyone, it's a true story
Without putting any strength into it
You pretend that you don't need anything
I know a couple that looks just like us
But they do nothing but argue
Without putting much priority on it
I'll read the rest of it from now

Oh no, this is probably a parody
I'm sure for someone, it's a fake story
I can't wear any shoes but my own
That's alright, since I can walk like that
I know, it's a common story
But to me, it's a real story
Without waiting for the rest of it
I'll go to see you from now"

When you walk away
You don't hear me say
Please, oh baby don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

[Verse:]

You're giving me
Too many things, lately
You're all I need
You smiled at me, and said

Don't get me wrong I love you
But does that mean I have to meet your father?
When we are older you'll understand what I meant when I said no
I don't think life is quite that simple

[Chorus:]

When you walk away
You don't hear me say
Please, oh baby don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

(So simple and clean)

[Verse 2:]

The daily things (like this and that and what is what)
That keep us all busy
Are confusing me
That's when you came to me and said

Wish I could prove I love you
But does that mean I have to walk on water?
When we are older you'll understand it's enough when I say so,
And maybe some things are that simple

[Chorus:]

When you walk away
You don't hear me say
Please, oh baby don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

Hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning
Is a little later on
Regardless of warnings
The future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before

You went away
Now my life is just a rainy day

How much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories
Seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true
That once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
I wish that you were here with me

Soaked with love all my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone I don't know what to do

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine
Once again you'll be mine all mine
But in reality
You and I will never be
Cuz you took your love away from me

I had believed that I could become stronger, little by little
Then I realized that there was something wrong with that

I used to always do nothing more than act strong
Though I acted stubborn and laughed
The truth is
I'm just a crybaby and a cowardly pretender

If I'm just hiding, makeup and fashion are hopeless
A true self that noone tries to show
I too had participated in such a game, oh no

Even today, a blue sky rises
Though I think cynically about it, and look away
The truth is
I'm just a pretender who doesn't pride my worrying

Somewhere
There are people
Plotting together
While that hand
Stretching out
Is empty
I'm sure I'll find something

Forgiving each other
In private
We should have exchanged
A promise
Even I have need
Of somebody
Today, I'll meet him

I used to always do nothing more than act strong
Though I acted stubborn and laughed
The truth is
You're the cowardly pretender

Today will be the day the rain stops
Though I don't want to expect it
The truth is
I'm just a pretender who doesn't pride my worrying

We gotta be
In the same situation
Otherwise I can't
Understand you
God
Are alone?
That's why you can save us

With just shadows
Covering each other's
Hearts
We can touch each other
Even I have need
Of somebody
Today, I'll meet him"

I will love you for a thousand years
Yours truly

I ain't gonna play it cool
Let me tell you I've tried that already
Everyday and every night
Your words ring through me
Who am I trying to fool
Honey I've been living on my own like Freddie
But I'm still a woman
Baby tell me how

How could I ever love another
How could you say you don't remember
God knows I'd give anything
For just one more night together
Today I miss you more than ever
How could you say you don't remember

I'll be wishing you forever

It's just another friday night
For you and your accessory (lights)
And there you are before my eyes
Two hours and for fifteen minutes
You are here
I don't wanna scream
Lest I should tear
But whisper in the darkness disappear
Sincerely

We should get back on the road
Like Simon and Garfunkel
Let's get married
You are all the shelter that
I need above me
Who am I trying to fool
Honey I got your ringtone on my
Blackberry
And I won't give a damn
If only I knew how

Ain't no need for me to lie

Filling up my hard drive

You got me crying like a child
And the crowd is going wild
This one This is the one
Come on and give it up

How could I ever love another
How could you say you don't remember
God knows I'd give anything

If you make me feel rushed, It's set.
C'mon the story is beginning.

If there are words that can only be said now,
Then the voice I'm making you listen to must be mine.

Since we who love new things are easy to get sick of,
These feelings must be eaten quickly or they'll get cold.

If you want to know what love tastes like after it's passed the expiration date
Order with someone else because I'm not paying.

Come on time, don't get lost,
If you don't call before the next train comes...

If everything brings about the end, still more I feel like I can love ""in the present""

Since we who love new things are easy to get sick of,
If we don't start to see the fruits of our love soon, it's time to call it quits.

Is the taste of dreams that have passed the expiration date bitter?
You shouldn't throw them away before they get that way,
That's not what I'm saying.

There's no tenacity which holds up without a time limit."

From this long runway!

Time will tell
When time passes we'll understand
Cry, it's ok if you don't try so hard
When time passes we'll understand
Cry, there's no hard road to tomorrow
Surely, surely, surely

Even if there's rain, if we fly above the clouds
Always blue sky
Even the sun seems so close
Like you could grab it with your hand

Don't get depressed alone
We just can't control the time
Take off into the blue sky
From this long runway!

Time will tell
When time passes we'll understand
Cry, now I can't even fool myself with these excuses
Time will tell
When time passes we'll understand
Cry, so now it's ok to cry if I feel like it
Surely, surely, surely

Time will tell
When time passes we'll understand
Cry, it's ok if you don't try so hard
When time passes we'll understand
Cry, there's no hard road to tomorrow

Problems kept inside, look neat and organized
What you need in life is some wonder

Worry infiltrates my head till I kill it
I fill it instead with improper visions of you

Stay very close to the floor
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
Careful when you close the door
Nobody has to know (Synchronize it)
When we tippy toe, tippy toe

What you hiding on your phone?
No, I don’t trust your honesty
Love is cursed by monogamy
Don’t keep swiping right
You might see something you won’t wanna see
It’s okay to say that you needed your own space
If I give you that green light
There’s no excuses for breaks
But wait, one thing I gotta say
I’m so done by the games
See you changed, I can see it in your face
You’re so set up in your ways
See, it’s strange
How I gotta take the blame
When I’m the one that’s in the rain
Yo, all these tears keep falling on me
No more late night calling on me, no
I hope you see how hard it is without me
Coz we gon have to learn to set new boundaries
I fell into your tears and let it drown me
Coz I’m too proud to be too proud
I say it proudly

I'm a workaholic even on
Friday afternoons
Snatchin' up a taxi is easy, (and I jump right in)...
I've got my eye on you

The taxi driver looks to me and says ""Where to?""
Oh, just kinda over there
""The bad economy's a problem (closing)
Please watch out for the door""

Riding on the wind, Climbing up to the moon
My place is here... right next to you
The problem is it's hard to go home
Admist the dreamy spring night

Traveling, with you
Traveling, onward
Lighting up the asphalt (""In the asphalt, blazing up a trail"")
Traveling, where
Traveling, are you going?
To anywhere far

Traveling, beyond
Traveling, get down (""shake it"")
Let the light shine away all your troubles
Traveling, let's fly now
Traveling, speed up
Even though we're not in a hurry

There's a song and I want to sing it
Over and over again
So I can spur my feelings on until they won't stop
That's the plan

Partying with the waves, Thanking the clouds
I finally met you
Because we're young
Nothing more than dust blowing in the wind

Traveling, our hearts
Traveling, press closer
Now and forever let's abandon the usual
Traveling, this place is
Traveling, shabby
Our destination is not here.

Traveling, Your window
Traveling, open it
There's nothing to fear
Traveling, here
Traveling, all is well
Everything we've got is in our hearts

This is the time to dance and have fun
Don't hold it back tonight
The hidden wishes in your heart are gonna hurt you
Put up your hands and have some fun!
And why does
Some wariness remain

Traveling, with you
Traveling, still
In the asphalt, blazing a trail
Traveling, where
Traveling, are you?
The good times are about to begin

Traveling, let's fly now
Traveling, shake it
Let the light shine away all your troubles
Traveling, let's fly now
Traveling, speed up
I don't want to stop

Can you take me up?
You look quite good.
Can you keep it up?
I would like to.
Can you take me up?
You look quite good.
Can you keep it up?

Don't believe until you see all there is to see

English translation:
But it shouldn't be as easy as saying
""Even though I slipped up...""
Hold on, I'm sure if you just understood me a bit more
A better rain would fall

""Selfish."" That's what I was called
It's alright to feel lonely sometimes
Riding in the solution we put out together
We'll pass by all the cloudy skies

Though the tires that won't spin line up before our eyes
I wonder who's hypocrite who won't step on the accelerator

Oh baby wait and see
Sometimes, even pain is good
It's because there's risk
That faith has meaning
It's impossible not to get lost

Oh baby wait and see
Even though waiting isn't my specialty
It's too soon to start your scolding
Don't believe in things like fortune-telling

Turning to love, there's a shortage on the left side
That's why I need you
Do you intend to protect
Yourself with your cold attitude?

Give me the power to endure what I cannot change
And also to change what I cannot endure

Oh baby wait and see
Even though it's no fun to hurt
It's because there's risk
That we become strong enough to fight
It's impossible not to be afraid

Oh baby can't you see
Even though waiting isn't my specialty
It's too soon to start your scolding
Don't believe in things like fortune-telling

So baby wait and see
There's no wound that can't be soothed
I wonder if it's because there's risk
That we hurt the more we love
There's nothing wrong with that

I wonder if it will be easier
If I were to run somewhere far away
There's no way it should be
Because no matter where I am, I'm still me

If the key is too high, you can drop it
Because the song has strength that won't change
There's only one point where suffering can pass through
Like a bracelet that's too big, it slips right away

Don't believe until you see all there is to see"
Utada Hikaru,Wait & See (risk),/u/utada+hikaru/wait+see+risk_20931064.html,"That you say ""Sorry for stumbling""
When you say it, it can't be song, can it
Wait a little longer, surely you'll get it
Because a nicer rain is falling
Like that you called for me
Sometimes even though I feel pain, it's okay
Embarking on the reply we made
Because the cloudy skies will soon be gone

But tires that won't go 'round line up before my eyes
I wonder who's stepping on the accelerator
It's a contradiction

Oh baby wait and see sometimes pain is also okay
Because there's a risk, what you believe in has a meaning
It's impossible not to get lost

Oh baby can't you see waiting isn't easy, but
Deciding is too fast
Don't believe in something like fortune-telling

Facing our love, on the left there is a shortage
That's why you are necessary
Do you act cold to protect yourself?

The power to accept unchanging things
Then give me the power to change
Things that can't be accepted

Oh baby wait and see Pain isn't wanted, but
Because there's a risk, I'll become strong by fighting
Fear is impossible

Oh baby can't you see waiting isn't easy, but
Deciding is too fast
Don't believe in something like fortune-telling

So baby wait and see there's no such thing as an unhealable wound,
Because there's a risk maybe love is so painful
That's not all that bad

If I run far away will it become a song
It won't, will it
Because wherever I am, I am myself

If the key is too high it's okay to take it down
The song has the strength not to change
Worry is just one thing to get by
Slip it off like a too-large bracelet
Don't believe until you see all there is to see."

Wonder why I wonder if you're alright
Thinking of the love we made
Ran around, out of town, now you're back again
Confusing true love and pain
Threw it down, now I'm back on my feet again

Are you asleep
Or are you still afraid of the dark
Hugs and kisses, pictures and romances
Things that I wish I could do without

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Then again I wonder 'bout
But I don't give a damn about you

Take a bite; the pleasure is all mine
Keep in mind I'll think about you sometimes
I'm alright; I'll thing about you and I'll...
Turn this plight into a singer's delight
Living in a house of pain
Ran away, and I'm glad that I ran away
Rather be out in the rain
Now I understand why my mother ran away

No use asking
When did I start acting like such a jerk (you to)
Washing dishes, birthday wishes, watching baseball matches
The other future that I wonder 'bout
So many things I wish I didn't wonder 'bout

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Now and then I wonder but I betcha
I betcha don't give a damn about

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout

My watch must have stopped I guess
Dinner is cold and the kids are asleep

Always late (always late)
Yes, it's always the same
Procrastination is my middle name
But the rest of the world is ahead of the game
And that's why I'm always late.

Won't somebody give me a ride
I've been out of gas for hours
My mother-in-law's flying in from the coast
She's probably in an ambulance by now.

Willie, it's time to get up
Willie, you get out of that bed,
You'll be late for work again

I had a vision in the middle of a daydream
In a place I'd never been before
I couldn't tell if I was still awake or sleeping

I saw so many things I barely recognized
I thought that I was lost but then I saw you

I could be wrong, but I swear
That I knew you in another life
And I could be dreaming, but I swear
That I knew you in another life

Certain things affect me certain ways
And this isn't just the first time
That it's crossed my mind

And you begin to recognize all of the little signs
I wish that I could place every little gesture
But it really doesn't matter 'cause we'll never know"

Where do I go? What am I supposed to live on?
What happens when the twenty-five dollars is gone?
That leaves me lots of time to wonder why I was born

Everybody's dancing
The music sounds entrancing
But you can't find the beat
It's the ticking of a thousand human time bombs
Who are back on the street

Oh the names have been changed
But the story's the same
History will repeat
Add it all up and then divide it by zero
'cause you're back on the street

I can't stand the strain of this job no more
I must have forgot what I took it on for
I make lots of money, yet still I want more
And my head is blazing
I think that I'll check out the shops downtown
Sometimes it helps to buy things when I feel brought down
At this hour I might dodge those hippie low-life's around
But the countdown is on

Once you had to stand out
Looking for a handout
Free love and body heat
And that money's just a crumpled green ball in your pocket
When you're back on the street

Back on the street again
Said you're back on the street again
The countdown is on
And nobody knows when

Spreading like a cancer
Looking for the answer
In everyone you meet
And each in his way has a hustle to play
When he's back on the street"

Her performance was outrageous
Put me through some changes

She's a bad little actress

And the show was panned

Caravan life is a mirage,
Only a mirage dancing on the desert sand

How I recall all the mountains
How I remember the farm
Oh how I miss the big city
With a pretty girl on my arm
Sell my best friend for some water
Cut off my leg for some shade
Sunburn these thoughts from my memory
If I live I will be remade

The sand is like a razor
Slashing at my face
Everyone's in panic but you can't see any place
It's a sand storm, taken by surprise
Hide beneath your wrappings and cover up your eyes

Well I lost my kit and camel
Maybe I will die
Feel so lost and helpless and I think I'm gonna cry
It's a sand storm, nothing you can do
No one knows if it will last
No one knows if you will make it through

Where is that bloody oasis
Must be around here somewhere

Time for the ultimate change

But I know it all by heart, chapter and verse
I'll quote you any part, every word
But it's so deep inside it can't be heard

And I've been working on the weekly cryptogram
I know there's a message in between the lines
That's the same way I am
I got the crossword puzzle half complete
But now I need another word four letters long
It's just like the way I want a perfect fit
I can settle for less but all of them are wrong

Somebody buys it
We can't be satisfied

Gangrene, that's all the vampires leave behind

Fifty million kids with nothing better to do
Than sit around like a zombie and stare at the tube
They'll sap your strength and suck your soul and
Feed you their trash
'til your mind is left blank
And your dreams have been smashed"

And it just won't go away
It sends a message out
What's it gonna be today?
It wakes me up at dawn
And as the day goes on
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on

It never lets me rest
I can't get a minute's peace

I try to turn it off but the beat goes on"

Said I'm trying to forget
And it ain't happened yet

I musta woke up this morning with a bug up my ass
I think I'll just haul off and belt the next jerk that I pass
My old man says I'm just a stoned little punk
But he keeps himself a pistol and he's always drunk

I know
Something's gonna give
Pretty soon
I know it
Something's gonna give
I wanna live
I wanna mess thing whole world around
Go on and poison all the water, use up all the air
Blow your stupid heads off, see if I could care
Put me down but don't blame me for what you did
'cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid

I was a sweet little kid once
Now I'm a full grown crank
And when I die I'll probably come back as a sherman tank
I know that I could make this world so peaceful and calm
If I could only get my hands on a hydrogen bomb"

Meet me outside the curiosity shop
No need to bring money
Life can be so funny
When you're hangin' around with the hoi polloi

The countess wipes her nose upon her sleeve
Doesn't think that we can see
The duke of astinbury has to leave
He's afraid to dance with me
Look what happens when you've got it made

Her fifteen year old daughter
Drives the patriarchal letch insane

We'll be hangin' around with the hoi polloi"

That between adam and eve
There was nothing to hide
Were it not for eve's primal haste
Or a leaf strategically placed
Who knows what she'd decide
Eve and some guy named clyde

Life is just a pose in a rag

Life is a drag

The argument can be rendered
All bodies are forcibly gendered
By how they are wrapped
And though popular opinion holds this
Makes us civilized
So much deference is attended
By what's in one's lap

History proves that
Who wears the pants is as much a mere circumstance
As a matter of time
Ultimately, why should we care
Where one buys one's lace underwear
If one is so inclined
Show me yours, I'll show mine

That's why life is a drag
Fashion is a long running gag
We can deck you out in sequins or spandex
A mohawk or shag

It's a drag

You can be a stag in a bag
They won't know until you're stiff
On a slab and they look at the tag
What you see is what you get

Let's just say
We hereby conspire
That a change of attire
Is all part of the plan

Something that was so long suppressed
Starts to show when you wear a dress
And if clothes make the man
They can unmake the man

That's why life is a drag
Life is just a pose in a rag
You can play the part of
Pusher or pastor
Of harlot or hag
Life is just a dressing game
Life is a drag
It's a drag
What a drag

Fashion is a long running gag

When your butt starts to sag

You got a message from the weather man
You're looking for a thumb when there's a hole to fill
Who bites the bullet?
Man of action will
Call me. Have gun. Will travel.

Think about it, ponder on that
If you can't make that move, man of action will
Think about it, ponder on this
With a fist or a kiss
I'll put your dreams in action

Pressure's building up and down the line
You see the difference in the smallest thing
Put a new tape in your message machine
Hit the shelters 'til you see what change will bring
Sometimes justice seems a fragile thing
You paralyze it with a lack of will
Trade in your karma
Man of action will
Call the avenging angel

Think about it, ponder on this
If you can't make that move, man of action will
Think about it, ponder on that
Time to cut through the fat
I am your first reaction

Someone's got to push it on
Someone's got to shake it on
Someone's got to take it on
Man of action will"

There are times I miss distinctions over wrong and right
But I'm gonna get an answer when I get there tonight
On the road to armageddon

It's the wrong world
I must be on the wrong planet
I been checkin' it out
And I know what it's all about

Mr. and mrs. universe
In their cabin in the sky
She's a little bit of heaven
He's one hell of a guy
And like all suburban couples they may have a spat
But that is that
It's back to normal
And it's your night to feed the cat

With the holy ghost
And the good and the wicked
The strong and frail

For as long as this life lasts
We are mated

And you know we'll still be here tomorrow

Nobody else understands what I'm doing
Nobody else makes me act in this way
And because they can't comprehend
What we mean to each other
They won't leave you alone

Maybe it's more than I can take
'cause it seems like the world's against me now
And I need someone to show me how
But I still can't admit you were right, you were right
And I was wrong

Maybe I could change
Maybe I could change the world
Maybe I could change myself
Maybe I could change the world
Maybe I could have your love
I've been holding my hopes so high
But can't you help me now, my arms are so tired

And maybe they made the world that way
Maybe it's just a waste of time
Just like me, they turn the other way
And just like me, can't bring themselves to say
Now I know the mistakes that I have made

Then I can maybe admit you were right,
You were right, and I was wrong"

Can't say that about nobody else

Someone should tell her honestly
She is a fool to count on me
I swore there would be no delay
I should have been here yesterday

So I sneak in the door and there she is again
She could squeeze off a shot just as soon as look at me
She don't say a word and every word is true
And if that's the best that I can do then

Mimi gets mad every time I'm wrong
Mimi gets mad when I sleep too long
But then mimi gets glad when I do my share
See no smile but I know it's there

To think about how life's so queer
And listen to the little choir
The sermon I don't care to hear

Don't fight it
Who can say that it's not the end
Don't fight it

I know somewhere a monument
Stands in the name of our love

I will find my way back to the fire

Heat is not enough
More light
Love is strong enough
More light
Faith is not enough
More light

I think that we don't need another great communicator
And there's a million extended mixers we are ready to retire

Someone to depend upon

When I grow weak from the pace
I can feel the breath of gentle wings on my face

And when the world closes in around me
Then my angel
Will come and roll away the stone
Like a hand reaching down from the heavens

And when the darkness falls all around me
Then my angel
Will come and draw aside the veil
I am safe in the arms of my angel

Anywhere
Anytime
In my mind I know
That a pair of sweet eyes is watching me
Wherever I go

Is it real?
Am I dreaming?

I thought that heaven began
From the waist on down

That I could use my head

From the waist on down

Maybe I haven't noticed getting older

Trapped in a dream
Something has to change in this endless stream
Of ships that pass in the night
Is this what I want out of life?
I want to know what this game is about
I want someone to try and figure me out

I can't determine why

Your modus operandi
Turned me inside out

About your fine hardware

Micky and margaret make the clothes that we wear

There's no escape, tell me why do they try so hard?

And I pretend that I'm invincible, that I can go it all alone
But I'm only human, trying to get by
And praying to heaven I might find out why am I human
Mere flesh and blood
Afraid to go on without someone to hold me up

It's just a human thing to fear the unknown
But isn't it a tragic thing to live and die alone
Oh lord look at the world,
Have you ever seen so much misery?
Like a ghost ship of fools, lost and floating out to sea

Yet they struggle on the same fault

And though I lie, I had nothing to hide
You're the one who's pretending

Things that never occurred
Turned my back to the loving ones
On the strength of your word

Glass bricks and a ten foot wall
You really don't care at all

And when I came to relieve all the pain
You were somewhere pretending

That you're only pretending

I believe in believing
And I hope that there's still hope for me

And you're free to be free as you please
But I'm not the kind
Who can live with life
And I never could
'cause I'm just no good at pretending

What's the truth after all this time
Is it your perception or is it mine
Sometimes you're better off alone
You can't get blood from a stone

And while you cry, I'll be laughing inside
'cause I know you're pretending
Look me straight in the eye
When I tell you good bye
'cause I won't be pretending
You could beg me and fall down on your knees

Don't you make a sound

Utopia,Singring & The Glass Guitar,/u/utopia/singring+the+glass+guitar_20142685.html,"(an electrified fairy tale)

This is an electrified fairy tale. If you've never heard of an electrified
Fairy tale, just picture little fairies with wee tiny electric guitars.

Once upon a time [not long ago] in a land not far from here, there was a place
Called harmony. Everyone in harmony was happy and this ""joie devivre"" was
Guarded by their invisible patron, the muse singring. But jealous forces, and
There are always jealous forces in such tales, have conspired to capture the
Spirit, imprisoning it in [an instrument of glass, locking it in] a chest with
Four keys, and casting the keys to the four corners of the earth so that only
Four particularly brave and talented individuals might retrieve them. It is
Here that our story begins.
There's a rumor I heard that's going 'round town
Someone's captured singring, singring
Come hear the news, come hurry on down
Down to the old town square
The announcer wipes at his eyes, he's trying to hide
See it in his face, tell by his expression
The secret knowledge that claws to escape as he cried
Day of infamy, someone's captured singring
Day of tragedy, someone's captured singring
Now what shall we do, what shall we do now?
And if you take a look around, harmony is dying
Someone trapped the spirit in a glass guitar
And if you listen with your heart, you can hear it crying
Free me from my crystal prison in this glass guitar

There's a rumor I heard that's going around
Someone's saving singring, singring
Come hear the summons, hurry on down
Down to the village green
And the spokesman speaks for us all, together we call
Brave adventurers, warriors, and free men
Conquer self and so in the end save us all
Conquer earth and wind, conquer fire and water
Brave adventurers, come and save us all
And if you fail to win the keys, harmony is dying
Trapped away forever in a glass guitar
And if you listen with your heart, you can hear it crying
Free me from my crystal prison in this glass guitar
Having gathered on the green, the brave adventurers of the land march off in
Search of the keys. Their quest leads them first to the river's edge.
Lead me to the water
Pass me my flagon of wine
I said show me to the water
Quick before I change my mind
I go down to the river and bravely the rapids I row
Over the falls to the bottomless pool
And it's down to the bottom I go

Only one has the courage to dive into the river and brave the bottomless pool
In search of the first key.

Let the four winds blow icy breath before me
Storms will never keep me from the glass guitar
Hurricanes may scream, I will never feel it
'til I find the key that leads me to the glass guitar

Only one has the courage to wander the desert [alone] and brave the eternal
Winds in search of the second key

Fire can never burn me
Flames can not catch me - faster am I
Blazes never faze me
Barefoot I walk hot coals for a mile
My sword is tempered, my loins are girded in steel
Make my way to the heart of the forest of flames
And if I do my best and don't stop to rest
I may pass the test and capture the key that opens the chest

Only one has the courage to make his way into the forest of flames and brave
The fire-breathing dragon in search of the third key.

I will climb the face of the highest mountain
Whilst singring calls crying from the glass guitar
Though the earth may shake let the planet tremble
Steady will I struggle onward to the glass guitar

Only one has the courage to climb to the top of the highest mountain in search
Of the fourth key.

Having scaled the mountain and finding no key, the climber begins chopping
Madly at the ground with his pickax, causing the mountain to split in two,
Revealing the last key.

Now in possession of all four keys, the brave adventurers march triumphantly
Into the valley of silence to open the chest, smash the glass guitar, and free
The spirit of harmony."

Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Under a tree.
I got a feeling there's a miracle due,
Gonna come true,
Coming to me!

Could it be? yes it could.
Something's coming, something good,
If I can wait!
Something's coming, I don't know what it is
But it is
Gonna be great!

Phone'll jingle, door'll knock,
Open the latch!
Something's coming, don't know when, but it's soon -
Catch the moon,
One-handed catch!

Around the corner,
Or whistling down the river,
Come on - deliver
To me!

Will it be? yes it will.
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there!
Come on something, come on in, don't be shy,
Meet a guy,
Pull up a chair!

The air is humming,
And something great is coming!
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach,
Down the block, on a beach,
Maybe tonight..."

Ancient logic, never ending mystery

In the technicolor sky
Exploding mandala of light
Disappearing into darkness
A stunning sunburst finish
Shatters the horizon

Wonder of wisdom
Far beyond this mortal comedy

Wind of the desert blowing strong
Mist of the ocean kissed by the sun
Tropical splendor
Paradise is calling you away

Wake up to find your garden is green
Please take your seat onboard

Echoing across the canyon
Hear the song of the gypsy caravan
Magical voices in flight

And watch the shadows slowly filling the valleys below.

And constantly caress the edges of my shadowy interior...

In a manner of model effeciencies. And my previous profession
Always at least offered that. Fully vasectomies in clean and
Well-lit places. A sterile feel, seals from infecti[b,

The legions of the lonely

See how they hang on
Each one in a world of his own design

Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.

And the music plays forever
And it captures every ear
And the sound of barriers crashing down
Is the sweet harmony you hear.

Still, be still
To strong, so be still
Much too long, come down
Be still, look around
Listen here, be still
Hear the sound, be still.

Still we are here
We are still
Will we sing sweet
Sing we will
Still we are here
We are still
Nil is a fear all is nil
Still we are here we are still
Spill it let go let it spill.

The question comes to mind
About what should be done
And how much of the old will die
That the new may be begun
But you don't have to be afraid
Of being alone with nowhere to run.

You don't have to be afraid
To look yourself in the eye
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.

Someone knows who you are
Someone watches over you
Someone knows how you feel
And someone feels the same.

So you don't have to be afraid
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind

For those who still recoil
For those who fear the pain
Of peering o'er the edge of
A new and different plane.

You don't have to be afraid
Whenever you go you come back again
So you don't have to be afraid
We live and we die
You don't have to be afraid to know why.

Heavy changes
I can't say I'm hip to where you're coming from
I can't say I hip to where you're going

Well I see something's growing in the back of your mind
I give you the willies
You don't like my kind
But I can sing like a jingle
Sting as bad as any

Hey, that you? is that still you?
You're looking mighty new wave
I hardly recognize you with that shish kabob through your face
But that's all right, yeah, that's all right
I guess you're trying to make a statement
You been out on the street
Looking for somebody to carve on
Well you can ramble,
Just don't go carving on me

'cause I don't mind the fashion
I've lived with your mind
I dig on the passions
The rest is just crap
I can sing like a jingle
And sting as bad as any

Hey, don't I know you?
Ain't I seen you before?
Yeah, you're the one doing a pyramid party
Down in marina del ray
With their spoon and friends
Still going through them changes

And your nose in the air

Utopia,Welcome To My Revolution,/u/utopia/welcome+to+my+revolution_20142655.html,"There's too much music, too much light
These endless broadcasts into the night
Petty seizures of money and drugs
By some official or unauthorized thugs
Now it's gone, the whole world's gone
There's the army at the front door, guerrillas in back

Why do I always have to take up sides
I had no plans to be conscripted today
I am no use to them anyway
So what the hell's going on
When they took my bed for the good of the state
I had to rest my head and took to levitation
Welcome to my revolution

Every morning they confer with the press
Just to point a few fingers
Fix the blame for this mess
The spokesmen waffle and the jerk-offs complain
In a stream of rhetoric
Piss themselves down the drain
Then it's time to go home
Time to go home
What will they say when it's gone
The whole world's gone
So they call a cease fire to bury the dead
And just delay it for an hour or so
Loose talk of cowards and leaders that lied
What does it matter once we're vaporized
Say what the hell's going on
Then it got so bad I couldn't breathe the air
So I became my own church and begged for sanctuary
Welcome to my revolution

This is the dream that I have every night
I wake up screaming to the left and the right
Is this my vision of the end of the world
The faces looked smoldered, the edges are curled
Tell me what is the reason we can't look at ourselves
And realize everybody creates his own hell
And if we put it together to make them all real
And then forget how to think, forget how to feel
Until it's gone, the whole world's gone
Are we damned if we do and damned if we don't
Could we be suckered into thinking that
Or get too greedy, afraid of the loss
And wind up fighting for a worthless cause
What if we died and had to come back
How may times would we have to go 'round
What if tomorrow was the end of the line
Don't want to feel like I wasted my time
So what the hell's going on
When the noise gets so dense
You can't hear yourself think
We got the spirit world on a telephone link
So welcome to my revolution"

Showing your friends you can
Party all night
But tinsel town at the crack of dawn
Leaves you cold and wondering
Where you could belong

Now you're standing
At the fork in the road
All alone
And wondering which way to go
Any minute something's going to explode

Break out you western girls
One day soon you're going to
Change the world
Break out you western girls
Hold your head up high

Though you think
That life will pass you by
You are fine thing, never say die
Get your face out of that magazine
It won't keep you warm,
Another paper dream
Another evening in a cafe' for two
Another memory to haunt you
Soon he's going to want to take you home
Darlin' are you better off alone

The clock is ticking
But you still can't decide
To turn around or go along for the ride
Make up your mind because there is
Nowhere to hide

There's changes

They destroy and they poison

So where does the world go to hide?

Nobody cares what will happen to me
And nobody cares if I cry
There must be a reason to carry on

And what you don't know hurts you so
It can only be that way
Feel yourself becoming someone else
We may yet see that light at the end of the tunnel
If we can find a way to keep things under control
The web of life connects each of us to the other
So it's no use pretending that you alone run the show
Just like a moth too close to the fire explodes
Though the myth is exposed
You're still looking for windows in the sky
Supernatural paradise is the place you are looking for
All you need is a miracle divine
All that's left is you alone
Loneliness is all you own
Feel yourself becoming someone else"

We might pass in the hall as we're going to work

I have found us a place where there's no telescreen
And there's no hidden mikes and it's not too unclean
While the high remain high
And the middle change places
The low don't want to know they tell all with their faces
She might sit afront of me for the two minutes hate
I might see her again if it's not already too late
So they will take the book away from me
So let them catch me talking in my sleep
I guess I never really understood the law
So winston smith takes it on the jaw

So let's do what we want, it makes no difference now
When the thought police find us, we're dead anyhow
Kick us out of the party and bust us to parole
Then they'll stuff us both into a memory hole
So let them haul me off to 101

Of everything I heard and everything I saw

Why don't you come and put me away

It was a long night
I could barely keep my head
I heard a knock on the door
It was only harry jones

I used to wonder
What it is that makes me feel like I can't be free
'cause you don't give me nothing
You never give me nothing
But you don't know what's going on inside me

Y'know you make me crazy
I'm in misery
Are you interested enough to see what's left of me

I'm only thoughts of heaven trapped in flesh and skin
And from the world of men
I try to tighten up the code again

And the code is a play
A play is a song
A song is a film
A film is a dance

Boot me up on the Zen Machine
Log me onto the Zen Machine
Load me down
Everybody get ready
Hook me into the Zen Machine
Sharing time on the Zen Machine
Load me up
Everybody get ready

Sometimes it's clear to me
Then for a moment I'm in timeless ecstasy
There are no reasons why
And everyone's a passer-by
But when they've gone to bed
A fire's burning on the screen and in my head
And on a windy day
You can smell it from a mile away

And the smell is a note
A note is a taste
A taste is a hue
A hue is a touch"

Sekunder kvar

S jvla underbar
Ja, det r Jante-lag och skt dej sjlv
Och skit i andra r du snll
Och inga stjrnor mer p himlen

Mste hitta nya kuster

Som en stjärna på himlen, som en flicka mitt I natten på krogen
Som äppelträdgårdarna I maj runt Kivik
Som vinden, som regnet, som själva livet

Däare du blir en docka som lever I en härva av yta och dumhet

Som en salva över såren som herden saknar fåren saknar jag dej

Som viskar I mitt öra att jag varken kan eller vill

Just one night there

Lookin' at the distance
Between you and my heart
I never knew I'd fall

How it feels is nothing new
We're only going through the motions
Me and you
I'll go back home again
There's nothing left but empty rooms
We're passing through and
It can't end for us too soon

(1) Any day, any day
I've got to get up and go
I wanna tear all this down
Breakaway, breakaway
Everyday seems so damn slow
I don't wanna be around

Now my baby sits and stares
The clock spins the hours away
And there's nothing left
For you or I to say
Should be out having fun
How, come we don't anymore
But we been through this
Too many times before
Here comes my coat now
Put it on my head
Before I get to city prone
I ain't no judge
I ain't no diplomat
I don't need no crystal ball

Caught you with your pants down, fingers in the till
Caught you stealing something, my last thrill

At war with the world as this life unfurls
Ooh, better get ready
At war with the world, as this life unfurls
Better get ready

Living like a hound dog who's not fed
Life's one big bed baby
From the trash right on the street and anyone you meet
Trying to make the first glance and I doubt you will last
Caught you with your pants down fingers in the till
I guess I've swallowed life's hardest pill

Sometimes it makes me so blue
Let me take you down to Mexico
Cos I'm still in love with you

Everytime I get to thinking, thinking of you
Under a sweet corrella, does it burn you too
And if sometimes I wonder when,
When sleep don't come at night

Beggars and blues was all they got

Cold on a silver spoon

Baby's wishing on a wishing well
She's moving up and ringing her bell
Can't fly to heaven on a Persian rug
So put some coins in the old sailor mug

From the coast
East of Aldgate
Silently like ghosts
They had a scam, they had a scheme
For drunks and bums counting beans

And I wave old glory

I don't need to know

Longer nights freeze me it seems colder
Darker days they will take me under now
So help me please

Take me to the river, cleanse me with water
Because the good Lord has baptized me
I can't live like you good people
I'll bare my soul for the world to see

I don't care what it's all about
I don't need to know

Darker days surround me now I'm older
Longer nights freeze me it seems colder
Darker days they will take me under now

I don't think so
I don't know so
I keep falling down like little drops of rain
I don't know you
Tell me what's true
What is real, and what it is you call insane

Take me to the highway
Take me to heaven
I can feel Jesus, right in my bones
Looking for a high class up-market doorway
With no connections, no telephones

And I don't care what it's all about
I don't need to know

Oh yeah
Gotta help me please"

Smells of drinking Bombay gin.

Before his time is gone.

My Irish mother crazy.

When grown men
Cry like babies.

No sun up on the sky

If there's a job I will apply
The dhs says it's now or never
This is a case of do or die

I've got to struggle through it

Come closer
Tell me heroes don't fade away, they're forever
Just a little bit of something
Just a little bit of real
Tell me heroes don't fade away, become a memory
So come on darling now
I still need to know
Are we gonna fade away or stay forever

Took a walk down to Soho
I've got T. V. On my mind
It says these days you have it easy
Oh Lord, I must be blind
When it comes right down to it
I can see right on through it

Much more grief she can't take
Wish I could take her somewhere fancy
I still need that lucky break

There's really nothing in it

Of just me and you now

But a love with no money
How long will it ring true

One big city smells like another
I get lost in this maze
When I get home should I lie
The bottle's gone I'm in a daze

Sometimes I wanna run away

It merges into another day

After so long felt I was damned then I reached some gates and held a hand
But came to the point of sing and say, laughing people led me in to stay

In a place that's strange to me, the earth is black and there's not a tree
Well its so dark there's not a sound just the feeling of wanting to be found
I must make haste to be gone, in this place I do not belong
I thought I tried to move a foot, I just remained where I stood,
And in the distance I heard aloud the shrill of blank deathly sound
I tried, I tried, I tried to run, but every move I was where I begun,
It's too late, shadows over me blind my eyes I cannot see
All my strength all my love, someone help me please above,
Death will surely take me down, I'll be doomed to live beneath the ground

As some fool caught the bouquet the bride threw in the air

Kids clothe armour hands like battle dress
Got his act down, some kind of feeling
And tonight they're gonna make the run

From the back roads through the alleys it screams
You gotta get a feeling mean, mean, mean
And I love the way they make their move

It stops in a minute,
It's right down in it
Hey, we're really back on a roll

I don't know why, I don't know why
Feel so good I could die, I could die
Great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth, on a wish and a prayer
With a head full of hammers, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna rise again

Dream time (Lavinia??),
Even though the odds are stacked, she's coming back
(moon monkeys barking?) In a bitter chocolate glow,
There she goes, feel like letting go...

Hey, Mr. Cool jazz nights, let the fever go,
It stops in a minute, I'm down in it
Hey, play it long and slow
I don't know why, I don't know why,

From the high plains
To the border
All across the land
From the flying of the flag
To lovers kissing hands

Put nickles on my eyes
There be no tomorrows,
No more goodbyes

Little diamonds
How you shine and glow
Looking at the future I don't know
I am just here to watch the river flow

A street full of whispers,
Rings like a chinese gong
A room full of would be's
Whose lives have gone wrong

The blues don't exist now
Just to cleanse your soul
They were made to wake you up
Not to dig a hole

Wired to self destruct

And delight in your living hell

So you've seen the sunrise on the Nile
Solved the mystery of the Mona Lisa's smile
You proclaim your innocence
What you're saying
Makes no sense to me at all

So you help the needy and the sick
Heard confessions from a lunatic
My eyes are growing dim
Ghost shadows closing in
Around me now

And there ain't no sympathy at all
Just a sea of angry faces
Staring at me
There ain't no sympathy at all
I gotta find someone
To make me happy

So you've scattered roses at Versailles
Wiped a teardrop from an old man's eye
Seeing you in such distress
I'm afraid I must confess
That boys don't cry

And there ain't no sympathy at all
Just a sea of angry faces
Staring at me
There ain't no sympathy at all
I gotta find someone
To make me happy

Two clean shirts
I'm out on bail
As the barroom baits
They start to wail

?? Domes shimmer and glow
Golden citadels
While the autumn wind billows and flows

Move really nice to that money sound

And it's falling on my ears
I can hear the trumpets playing
Running down the years
Don't ask me how the world looks
How it looks tonight
I'm gonna be leaving babe
Outta here and outta sight

Coming off the rails

I am the one in ten 
A number on a list 
I am the one in ten 
Even though I don't exist 
Nobody Knows me 
But I'm always there 
A statistical reminder 
Of a world that doesn't care 

My arms enfold the dole queue 
Malnutrition dulls my hair 
My eyes are black and lifeless 
With an underprivileged stare 
I'm the beggar on the corner 
Will no-one spare a dime? 
I'm the child that never learns to read 
'Cause no-one spared the time

I'm the murderer and the victim 
The license with the gun 
I'm a sad and bruised old lady 
In an ally in a slum 
I'm a middle aged businessman 
With chronic heart disease 
I'm another teenaged suicide 
In a street that has no trees

I'm a starving third world mother 
A refugee without a home 
I'm a house wife hooked on Valium 
I'm a Pensioner alone 
I'm a cancer ridden specter 
Discovering the earth 
I'm another hungry baby 
I'm an accident of birth.

Deprive them of their basic rights

All over by sunday, consigned to the past
The cleanup starts Monday despite the bomb blast
A brand new beginning the die has been cast

Five megatons of oblivion
Sent with love from the Pentagon
On a laser guided Neutron Bomb

They can't find the body: it's causing a stink
The guy in the Oval is back on the drink
And Uncle Sam's poodle's in need of a shrink

It's been a full year, the families can cheer
Their sons and their brothers are now in the clear
The war is all over but it would appear
That those left behind are all living in fear

How many innocent die every day
Loot shoot gunfire salute
Innocent die from the games that you play

Deceit and deception there's always some deception
Like the unjust executions dat they forget to mention
You stop, stare and wonder but a you mek di blunder
Your enemies draw near wid di sound like rolling thunder

Torture and detention there's always some detention
For the fall guy, the patsy, the one dem never mention

On this madness end this confusion

And the promised land we want is still out of reach

I once knew a man who wore self-righteousness
Like a medal on his inflated chest
He hated all people for breaking his rules
Looked down with distaste on the cowards and fools

He lived like a king in his castle of stone
And sneered at the man who worked hard for his home
He knew all the right words and who to defend
And would be with conviction the working mans friend

But contaminated minds are blind to truth
Contaminated minds speak with loudest voice

Rock in a de dance, me seh fe give dub a chance,
Rock in de blues, you know you jus' can't lose.
A dub me a defend, on dub i can depend
Check out dis yah music and run tell yo' friend.
We don't want rock 'n' roll and we got enough soul,
We don't want rock 'n' roll and we got enough soul.
Bass is beutiful if it's clean,
But dis yah dub music, man it well mean.
No bother follow friend and ignore dub again.
It's simple, but effective, can't you see?
A lot of people catch on in 'eighty-three.
Now is 'eighty-four and you must know the score,
Anything me chat, you know the people bawl 'more.'
Me jump 'pon de graphics, don't get vex'
All me have a total concept to make you feel Irie.
To make you feel Irie."

I've heard about you niggers and the trouble you create""
I said ""I'm coming from a party and me going home straight
Me just stop a de shop to buy some cigarette an chocolate""
When me explain de situation him stop interrogate
Turn around jump in a I'm panda car an say ""See you mate!""

And if she sit down pon you you will suffocate

You talk to me of sunshine

Just because you can't see it

Just because it can't touch you
Doesn't mean you shouldn't care

A thought is spared for those who missed
The handouts when it came to wealth
To education and good health

The time has come now all can see
As seeing this is killing me
our future victim to command
Together we can lend a hand

So don't blame me for wanting more
The facts are too hard too ignore
I'm scared to death of poverty
I only want whats best for me

But even so I'm holding on
I think the world can live as one
If only credence took the lead
The world would see a world to feed

An endless sea of blood that's spilt
Enough to sail an ark of guilt
And when we lend our helping hand
We'll have our green and pleasant land"

So you take what they give
You've no money to live
And your family don't understand.
After all these years
They will end up in tears
With a mountain of bills in their hands.

Now your lesson is learned
There's nowhere to turn
And it's no use pleading for help.
When you're left on the heap
There is nothing to keep you
From going and helping yourself

The dilemma you've found
Is you're morally bound

So what do you care
You know life isn't fair
And for years they've been stealing from you."

Searching tropical flowers
A pick and chooser

Come sit down, make your self comfortable
Tell me somthing, how long have we known each other?
About ten months huh?
Say what's that on your finger? An engagement ring?
So you and john are getting engaged huh?
You know he's a mighty lucky guy
Should be proud to have a woman like you
Listen, i've got something to tell you
Don't think i'm getting fresh or anything like that
But this things been bugging me for a long time you know
And it's getting heavier each and every day
And i've just gotta get it off my chest
See i've never seen anyone like you
I've never known anyone like you
Let me take me back to my childhood a while
See we had a medium size family you know we were'nt rich
But my mother tried to bring us us the best she could
Did'nt commit no crime nor nothing
But I had to reach man hood to commit this crime
According to the code of love, if there is such a code
See love is a thing well, you know?
It's a bit like quicksand
The more you wriggle the deeper you sink
And when it hit's you you've just got to fall
That's why I do believe that I am guilty
Guilty of loving you"

Put another penny in the corporation hat
There's computer consolation now
For every boy and girl
Coz the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rules the world

Sony in the nursery, no need to turn the page
The cartoon generation are soon to come of age
Virtual relationships untouched by human hands
Laying their foundation in the ever shifting sand

If politics is just for fools, equality a dream
Then you'd better wear protection so you never hear them scream

Animated babysitters always there to play
Will keep the undesirables a million miles away
Everything is changing but the song remains the same
Asylum has been locked away, the seekers has been framed"

Digging deep for clues on higher ground...

Thru fields to feast my eyes upon
Intoxicated drinking from
The loving cup of burning sun
In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace
Another time another place

Screws keep you under, wanna see you blunder
When they say sit just take a seat

Sometimes inmates would even call me a growler
Me a growler, i'm no growler

Where's all the power now they've pulled the plug

We need a little love ain't life tough enough
There's no coming back your ticket's one way

Cards on the table enough is enough

Pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away.

Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing

When I'm drowning in tears

We're shown no respect
But that can't break our pride,
When our backs to the wall
We won't run and we won't hide
It's time to stand, face the oncoming crowd

Drought and famine in TV land
Read the sunday papers credit card ina your hand
Sing your song of freedom just to ease your troubled mind
And save your guilty pennies for the ones you leave behind

The burden that you carry from the cradle to the grave
Is like a badge of honour that you wear upon your sleeve
You make your contribution and you shed a little tear
And stage your celebration just to show how much you care

You obscure your stolen power with hypocrisy and lies
Your talk of understanding is a wafer thin disguise
You glorify my image but deny me flesh and blood
You radiate with goodness when you here me beg for food

Those rivers of blood will flow again
Someone changed the lyrics but the song remains the same
You can build a wall of protocol to keep the wolves at bay
But history dictates that someone has to pay

And the music so loud that to shout above it, you'd be left voiceless

The music so right
We could have danced all night
The feeling so nice
Operator play it twice

They have the reggae and soul and the ital vital dub plate riddims
They have revival 45, calypso, soca, and all kinda riddim

You see the busy barman in the dance, he's used to dealing under nuff pressure

For the bus that never came
Not to be the one to blame
For anybody else's misery

Now and then
I contemplate a different way around this day
With nothing more than simple words, so I can say
I'm quite content and happy being me

Walking tall with peace of mind
To leave no childhood dreams behind
Arriving home to always find
Things just as I know they ought to be

Now And Then

To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance
How perfect every single day would be

No rainbow with a pot of gold
No cloak to shield me from the cold
No pill to stop me growing old

My arms enfold the dole queue

With an underprivileged stare
I'm the beggar on the corner
Will no-one spare a dime?
I'm the child that never learns to read
'Cause no-one spared the time

The licence with the gun
I'm a sad and bruised old lady
In an ally in a slum
I'm a middle aged businessman
With chronic heart disease
I'm another teenaged suicide
In a street that has no trees

I'm a starving third world mother
A refugee without a home

Made the morning cooler, left a rainbow in the sand
Sweet Hibiscus lingers in my own backyard
With a million different colours of a Hummingbird

The Firefly's romance ignites the evening shade
Makes the twilight dance a moonlight serenade
The smoke sends out a signal above the golden sea
Another day in Ladda Bay is waiting there for me

And they own you till you die

The tired and homeless roam the streets
The walls shout loud with angry words
The people air their views
The poor can scream but no-one hears
The concrete jungle sings the blues"

UB40,Sins Of The Fathers,/u/ub40/sins+of+the+fathers_20719422.html,"Once upon a time, not so long ago
When things were much much simple,
And time would travel slow.
There came a righteous stranger,
With a bible in his hand.
To educate the sinners
And liberate the land.

[Chorus:]
Sins of the fathers
Today from old
In a never ending circle
Of people bought and sold
So the wretched of the earth
Would huddle from the cold
As a ship of fools go sailing
On an ocean black as gold

So come and sit beside me
And let my tale unfold
In a land on milk and honey
Where the truth must not be told
As men of right and reason
Let the devil take their soul
For greed and fame and fortune
And a river black as gold

[Chorus]

And all the non believers
Where hiding from the light
As a thousand burning crosses
Were scattered in the night.
The theives and the vagabonds
Were sinking in the sand
As a righteous lord and master
Stretches out a helping hand.

[Chorus]

And those who had to suffer
The sick the young the old
Where sacrifice to fortune
And left out in the cold
So with this new arrangement
The leaders sold their souls
For bangles, beads and baubles
And a river black as gold

[Chorus 2x]"

Look like tactics for delaying
While we're on our knees and praying
Making and breaking
Sitting and debating
The art of speculating
Then accumulating

I'm not buying what you're selling
All your shouting and a yelling
And the lies that you are telling
Don't strike me as compelling
Picking and choosing
Winning and losing
Cutting and bruising
Using and abusing

The elections you are rigging
From your penthouse living
The deals that you are fixing
Creeping and crawling
Running and falling
Stopping and stalling
Crying and bawling"

Wishing I was somewhere else

Wishing I could please myself.

Ten hours a day I'm grafting
Under the bosses eye,
Earn just enough to keep going,
Making cars I'll never buy.

Wondering where my life has gone.

The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth

For the rain to wither, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop."

Quick the door's about to shut
Too late we're full just hang around

Is an honest day's pay for an honest day's graft
5th floor you may make a little more money
Now it's apparent downstairs ain't so funny
6th floor a mortgage, a collar and tie
2 weeks vacation in june or july

Pushing a pen you're not turning the tools

Recouping the redies before it's too late
11th floor the penthouse the final cut

Some bawl ""Forward"", some bawl ""Rewind"" and some shout out ""eject""

Even when satan captured me and bring me close to death
You offered me the truth and right and I had to accept
But now me find you Jah me na go keep it secret
That's why the conscious lyrics are my favourite subject
Me chat dem in the blues party, pub, club and discotheque
Me chat dem in the bookie shop while man a put on bet
And also in the gambling house when man ready fe set
And even to bad man who a walk wid dem ratchet

Left right its time to walk in the light of Jah not darkness
Left right who Jab bless no man curse, who Jah curse no man bless
Left right eternal life for the man that tries his very best
Left right do bad and you'll go down in the pit that's bottomless

THE KING STEP THE KING STEP THE KING STEP

Step 1, we all should know that there's one god and only one
Step 2, Is give him praises for this whole creation
Step 3, Is love your brother man cause you and him is one
Step 4, Is not to make the same mistake as Soloman
Step 5, Is to repent and beg forgiveness for your wrongs
Cause the wrath of Jah is clear to see in Revelation
So make up mind if you want to go to Heaven or Hell
Step 6, Oh yes there's more the King Step carries on
It carries on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Step 6, is once you know the truth to pass the message on
And do the King Step daily as you trod upon Jah land
So when the right time comes for Babylon's destruction
You'll be among the few to march towards mount Zion

She finds now joy amid the sleaze
It's hard when you've been paid to please
So she turns her thoughts to the pillow

[Chorus:]
Daylight comes she rests her head
The beauty of an empty bed
She dreams of happy days instead
Of brooding on tomorrow

She swapped her dreams of shining knights
For pushers, bars and money fights
For nameless faces in red light
So she turns her head to the pillow
Those black eyes don't hurt any more
She's heard the jokes and jibes before
She's felt the long arm of the law
So she turns her head to the pillow

[Chorus:]

Taking drugs was not for fun
It made her feel like going on
But now she hurts when its all gone
And she turns her head to the pillow
She take a blade and breaks her skin
Sweet life force flows from within
The white clouds in her head grow dim
And she turns her head to the pillow

Sunlight creeps across her head
Pale beauty in a crimson bed
No dreams of happy days ahead
She'll have no more tomorrows"

Where rainbows end there's a pot of gold...

Talk to the moon
Stop when I hear somebody playing our tune
Any excuse
And you'll see me
Drifting back home to the place I should be...

Listen to me
Mostly I find that I disagree
They tell me to change
Set myself free

Maybe I'll go
Maybe I'll stick around I don't know

Sleep awaiting coded warnings
From the top the barking orders
Light the sky on these dark mornings

Reaching out for what it's worth
Shelter from the raging anger
Raining down on bitter earth

Sympathy for all who's hurting
Getting lost between the lines

Laughing loud in victor's lies
Up above on wind's declaring
Soon the cold will whistle through
Push aside the warm sierras
Fill the sails that carry you

Where did I go wrong to make it like this
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now, hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl, you'll be gone for good

I thought you had saved me, the love that you gave me
The sweetest loving in all of the land
But youve taken my heart, and youve torn it apart
And it's crumbled to dust in the palm of your hand

Where did I go wrong.......(etc)

Might as well face it, it's out of my hand

When you're floating on a cloud
But you know that lonely feeling
When nothing's going right
'Cause it's only the beginning
Of a cold and sleepless night

You could meet somebody, you never know
From brief encounters habits grow
Into giant oaks that hide the sun
Your only chance is to turn and run

It's harder getting up there
And it's painful coming down
And now you can't see clearly
Beneath the thunder cloud
And the loneliness gets longer

And things ain't getting any better

You're always pulling me down
You make me lower my expectations
You're always pulling me down
Why do you complicate situations
You're always pulling me down

I don't know what else to do
I'm still in love with you

Youre checking in with me

On the tour, on the road
Never stop for rest

Whos the fuckin best
Now I've got to move
And I've got to move on
Now I got to laugh
While I'm singing this song
I hand you love
Its no surprise
Don't step to me
Its a lie
Alive in me for all to see
I am the man
Slowly walking down
You know I'm falling into place
And I'm screaming at the heavens
While I'm looking at her face
But I've gotta move fast
And I've gotta keep my back
Like the vision that she wasn't
Like the girl who never danced
Took my love, she took my heart
She took me to the level
Took my love, took my heart
She took me to the devil
Now I've got to move
And I've got to move on
Just like I said
You try to bring me down
You try, you try, to make me one of you

My superstars were laced up tight
And all the sinners were gathered in white
The pearly gates were opened up wide
And the lord must have seen me with his big red eyes
So I stepped out to the clouds
The holy father was getting down
And as I ordered a round of drinks
He said I got a little story tell me what you think
Moses used to sniff the lines
Noah used to rock the boat sometimes
Mary used to get undone
Jesus rode a harley davidson
All the angels were gathered around
Leather boots and lace night gowns
And one started to kiss my feet
She said the lord got a red light on at every street
My superstars were laced up tight
And all the sinners were gathered in white
The pearly gates were opened up wide
And the lord must have seen me with his big red eyes"

In control like the girl janet

Eyes demand give me some,
I crawl too for a fat cheque 'n income,
Disbelief hissin', now think that I'm dizzin'
Innercity, urban zombie, won't you please listen?

Whack black on black crime,
Destroyin' the black mind,
Human beings never seeing,
The toll 'n deadly sign
A lotta love in chest - but I walk battledressed
Like pharcyde let it pass,
Bullshit 'n all the stress,
Composure's best form, when world's predatory
When shit gets down I got some troops ready for me
All this is insanity, too close to reality
Roll like ced-g, flex a spaceship mentality

Claimed to be top, sick of hard labour

Understand with one glance

Not far from a dream

I must say I'm touched
When you dilyy-dally 'round the methadon bus
The soul with the same hole as their pockets
Here's the supply guy, don't need no ducats
And off to the famous spot
Be a leech for the twat ownes a lot
Had a blast - that can no longer last
Build up fast in the moments of rash
Had a bash for the cash 'n purse that you snatched
Take cardboard tatch, build a home to rest

Uds take both to reach the souls
Narrowmind clydes, still holding a pose
What we pour 'n flow when we come close
To the contrary, they pinch their earlobes
They call it rogue-rock, but it's a deeper shade of soul
We blend everything, with the color of skin
Under the skin, we're in like flynn

To innovate the frame of thought they're in

Crack egos like the cracks in liberty bell from philly

Rockets from houston, like olajuwon took apart robinson

Urban Dance Squad,No Kid,/u/urban+dance+squad/no+kid_20276652.html,"This is all about music how to use it, they call it songs
If a rapper doesn't sing, well they call it wrong
While remington raps on, coming on strong
Critics let their face grow long
Face my music for once - I doubt if you can
You've been brainwashed too much as a public man
This is no kid
T. V. 's your pet - your radioset, I scan
Popular music gives crapjams
You've been blinded, narrowminded
You know rap is big with the crowds - nothing's behind it
They just dance if they like it, so they clock it
Don't be misled by my size when I rock it
This is no kid
Mr. Top-50 biznizman talking so slick
Don't like our kinda music so he gives us the pip
Why a lie - rappers only flip their lip
Both sides of the globe call this music hip
Still knocking on doors of pop - to make discs
While big men fake it with crapoid artists
Discotheques' answer ain't raps - they ask for
A quick jam, pay wannabees, a few plaster
Just think you're a master with your ghettoblaster
Pipedreams about gold, but big men go faster
But you've hyped the type of music that holds you in a grip
When you pay this critics give it a miss
Dissin' the circuit - you say 'why, what this is! '
Cause you rock like a kid
I gotta do it right
This is no kid
Absorbing the words, it's absurd
People go with the crowd like a herd
The bits, the music, the whole words
Copy the style without own effort
If they are the herd, then I must be the herdman
Inventing fresh jams - firsthand
You said it was nothing, not worth a damn
Too hard, too noisy, my show a five or ten
But the mediamen clap their hands
Now you wonder, guess how we did the good hook
It's the guitar, dj, bass, the drummer's foot
Crumb up y'all, you never get these roots
This is no kid"
Urban Dance Squad,Pass The Baton Right,/u/urban+dance+squad/pass+the+baton+right_20289553.html,"Put sandbags and barricades
Just to protect all
I'm known to be the chunky lyrical shrapnell
Ricochet, - what he say?, get slain, won't say
It another day
Metaphore impact, chests cave in, big way
Like 'death becomes him or her'
Big hole unfold, unwise to wish the absurd
Rappers can't take lyrical obstacles
Estafette, you can bet my timing is phenomenal
Steeple-chase with the bass, tempo, ain't a turtle
He trips over pebbles, I take rhymes
With the hurdles
The title for grabs
Cause of my time lapse
Pioneers hear the cheers
Of the bloodsuckin' peers
Got to reach the peak supercrafty like cavalier
He's fronting for conquistador but he's the devil here
Made a perfect start and pass it to an allie
See him on the tracks
'For the finish doin' shuteye

Pass the baton right

' One two three four five senses working overtime '
How to freak the wild funk, line by line
Heavy technique, make 'em catch for breath
Rapstrangle from every angle, what's left
Seen weasels fakin' 'cockdieselness' - whacker
Take positions on squares like checkers, I'm the wrecker
You must be down with jimi fakin' castles in the sand
Tidal wave, sneak-a-peek on these whack bands
The funny game's to catch that moneytrain
Wesley plus woody, but you're not that goodie
Go against the grain
I'm a 'trekkie' doin' work like kirk fullthrottle
Got the bends, bust some sense in heads with a bottle!
Cycle running in a threadmill, think that's classy?
Pick up your face from the gravel, so bloody and messy

Pass the baton right"

Get more response,
Relate more in a zoo
Pulsatin' veins, migraine

More ways to reach, without nothing to say
No need for the shanhara suit
This x-o manowar ain't on the rescue

Planet ultra

One junkie said to the other junkiehead
"" Did you get what I told you to get ? ""
Showed the emergency-stash, and got upset
Just to see

Sip another sip of cheap beaujolais
Fungus with the faeces

Wanna go out with a bang

Through the mirror
You’re not nearer
Than myself

I must confess
Tears just wetsplashed
On the shelf

I tried to drink liquid from a cup
Eat cereal lump by lump
A full-grown baby that sobs
For his care got stopped

[Chorus]
Routine, routine, routine, routine
Feelin’ I mean like takin’ a bath with my toaster
Takin’ a break for a swim, yeah
What’s the use of even
Routine, routine, routine, routine
Feelin’ I mean like takin’ a bath with my toaster
Takin’ a break for a swim, yeah
What’s the use of even
Breathin’ now you’re leavin’

I tries to join the ratrace
And the worldpace
Stand the grey lane
On the bus

Well, I tried to find my way back to the mall
At K-Mart, I just fell apart
And hey, what’s in a brands’ name
For it all tastes the same

I may be the world's biggest scam

It's just the way you look

Man I am takin' some props
Before the world's gonna give 'm little rhyme
Little bit egocentric livin'
Ain't gonna, wanna take what is his/hers
I take my life like a drape
Gonna wear it like a t-shirt first nothing served
Given, when it comes to play roles
My fifteen minutes o' fame,
Oops, sorry andy warhol ain't gonna quail at weight
Of my ego scale
To a point take it as a joint
Let's inhale

Suppose you just can't see
Inside the man, the hero in me
So maybe it's just the way you look

I got the people buggin' like a housewife's a nagger
Mick jagger givin' lip 'n walk with a dagger
You wanna lowrate me to a paperhanger
No chance, hang on to my ego
Hold on like I was cliffhanger
With the grandeur factor
Force with cause flavor plus the charisma
I kick like horse
Hypo/ripe so I flip scripts never negative
Flow funky shit, like my name was laxative

And you people want me to stick to the ground
That's far too down to earth now"

Look at their hands as they seek for donation
European to asian, mixed with caucasian
Negroes with egos ain't takin' humiliation
I got a fistful, wish I had this till the end of the world
Knocks on doors, collect big bills
Know that the road is steep, no way you gonna sleep
Creepin' 'n crawlin', fallin' on the big antheap
I pay the taxman, make life more complex man
Go suffice some needs
Where it bleeds it lacks man
Some human interest I guess,
Where's that manifest that the profit,
The unfit, but the lie never rest
Servants plus clergymen, politician,
Businessman gonna make money honey
With oxygen in spray cans
I stand in open field, words will never shield
The feel that some big men get it all 'n never yield up
And they never yield up

Eyes from right to left, watch out for backstab,
These souls have roles to blind you from all facts
You wanna sidestep, bypass
Or neglect authority is the one with big gut in big chest
See how they start to grin 'n laughter becomes a sin,
Big men so little but that's how they always win
Attack will be just a pinch, use that common sense
Block a machine, use elements within to bend
Let me all put this straight, I'm here to infiltrate
Play like furniture, I wait
Blendin' with all the others, where talk turns to fodder
Clockin' for those, the ones who hold the rudder
But life's a mistress, never know what lasts
Sour grapes are sweet, when it's easy to let them pass
Lickin' some heels above,
No matter how hard tough
Let the man gloat pride you swallow up
Pride you swallow up"

Shit worn out like a pair of hippiesandals
Stuff got really trippy on me
I blew the picture huge
Like a skippy, and see
It's all out-o'-proportions
Their notion, presumption
The speculation - causin' irritation like guitar distortion
Yep, pencils get pushed, poison flows out
Printing on paper, paper on the doormat
Watch brothers scream out
How to live with a big knife, avoid the daylight
Hawk with bloodred eyes
Through the night ?

Finally the truth shone through
It's all hell when the smell's on you
Got to live a life through, hectic like a zoo
Got to go for what you know, what would you do ?
Avoid the paperstand and
Cast glances elsewhere and
On your feet when the heat is on withstand
Be a man
The titan with the item, hard to beat and fight 'em
Some come to throw the odds against
And simply duck-'n-slide them
Got the thing right, professionalism opposite
Heard the cynicism, watch how it get dropped kid !
Wreck with the data
Flow like a feather
Get yourself in check, expect heavy weather
So finally the truth shone through
Take the papers when I got to do
A heavy poo-poo
Ask myself what's new, ask myself what's new
And flush the toilet through"

Nowadays you can't tell who's a hoodlum, cause
Everyone tries be packin' to suspense to
Like robert ludlum
And every cupid proclaims that he shoots it
And front with a stunt to move - troop it
All portray, quick to say
That they're hard all the way
But he play seems to fade
When they have price to pay
Well I know so brother who buck you down for nothin'
Listen up stupid, cause I tell a little something

Some chitchat, some pull a gat for that
Some chitchat, some pull a gat for that

One day I had to witness this sort of heavy riff
It seemed like a trip
How they moved that quick
This pitiful vic never knew what hittem
Glock on the temple
Make the dome just drip some blood
Sure he was a young blood, physical prime and fit
And the whole neighbourhood shook heads negative
But he had it comin', ending stiff
Later on I figured out motormouth
Talkin' loud, now stonecold on the ground
Turnin' blue, these bodies do
But not because of shame
Talkin' untamed 'bout some name
Make your family mourn your name
So some don't start lookin'
When some words are spoken

Once again, I ain't the one who pulls all the stunts
Low pro, this I know
Calmer than one on the blunt
Never do what I'm told
And my head I hold
Then again I'm prepared for the man who acts bold
And my folks they know I love the glock
But I ain't packin' for luck
Cause then I'm stuck
The way you live is the way you die
Some food for thought, for ego bigheads who fly too high
And the brothers at the gym
Well they know gat on the lap, selfesteem grows
But I keep it as a secret, don't really live by the trigger
Just figure when you chat about that
Life ends much quicker"

やさしいKissで さよならしたね
遠く 離れて知った 心はいつも
君だけを 見つめてたよ
季節 巡る花たち
君の微笑みのようで Oh
そっと 立ち止まるたび
恋しさはつのり
涙がふるえて落ちた
会えない毎日に 交わしたMail
抱きしめた 眠れない 夜も
きっと 瞼を閉じるさ
明日の今は 君とふたりで
あの花を 見上げてるかな?
変わらない僕を笑う君と
照れながら そっと手を
繋いだまま
あの日ふたりを 濡らしたRain
傘も差さずにKissしたFin.
君の涙に 張り裂けてく胸
約束だけが 輝いてた、雨
くちびるに 隠していた
ためらいに 気づいた日は Oh
君の心を守る 自信を失くして
愛も 疑ったけど
小さな左手の 君のリングが
ポケットの 片隅で ずっと
消えない 夢をくれたんだ
明日の今は 君とふたりで
この街を 歩いてるかな?
変わらない愛を信じながら
ささやかな しあわせに
頬をよせて
桜雨、しずかに流れ 未完の時間
はじまりのSpring Rain
虹だけが知ったPain
きっと僕たちは また恋をしてく…
花を散らした せつない雨も
ふたつの心を 繋いで
とまらない時に 触れてゆく
永遠の 恋を叶えて
明日の今は 君とふたりで
あの花を 見上げてるなら
変わってくすべて愛してくよ
君とまた 会える日に

Damn, already 3 in the mornin'
It's going down, leanin', drink your drink
Candy sweets, third coast nigga, ugk 'bout to wreck shop

Man, I'm larger than life
These motherfuckers ask, ""Is it the bark or the bite?""
It's both, chillin' on streets you scared to park on at night
Just forfeit just like I'm becoming part of the light
And you, you goin' to be the biggest mark at the fight
I never understood what made you think you was handlin'
You half-ass runnin' through my neighborhood vandlin'
Next time I'ma light your world up like a canon
Get some Italians to play your ass like a mandolin
These cocaine wars got my mind in a frenzy
The feds tried to confiscate my 'llac and my Benzy
Colombian assassins hunt a nigga like Lindsey
And one of my workers came up short with my ends see
Shit, runnin' the streets used to be complicated
But now it's all easy, drug is strong arm related
But never can a bomb be faded
Fool ring the alarm, pour the Don

[Chorus:]

I'm comin' down real shiny like candy paint
'Bout 3 in the morning, yawnin'
I wish I could come down but you know I can't
'Cause I'm leanin' off the dank and the good ole drink
I got 5 on the weed, 50 on the drink
Fool comin' down fuck what these hoes think

[N. O. Joe:]

3 in the morning, just turned over
Pimped into my clothes
Got to get around some hustlers movin' in the Chevy Nova
Done flagged me down for some more of that brown
To go with that green, now they sittin' on lean
Now the light is green, got to get the snaps
So I bails from the scene, the watch is still packed
With dealers and fiends freakin' for G's and greens
See it's the same everynight
Niggas creepin' down G way and keepin' they head tight
Watchin' for laws 'cause you know they wanna hate
Jealous 'cause a nigga gettin' ahead of this paper chase
Can't place my face in these streets
But some niggas gotta hustle just to eat
Niggas jackin' and packin', they playin' for keeps
No peace of mind, keepin' my heat behind
No seekers see a lie to be caught sleepin'
By another nigga out creepin'
While I'm chillin' gettin' sweeted

[Chorus:]

[Pimp C:]

What you see is what the fuck you get
Young Pimp C baby comin' down real wet
I got a pump in the 'llac 'cause
These niggas tried to jack us
But we don't give a fuck, I got the ak in the back of us
Came out the night club, 3 o'clock struck
Tryin' to holler at my people she in Lexus, I'm in truck
We 'bout to eat breakfast, we in Houston, Texas
The city of the crack, and the 'llacs, and the Lexus
I'm hollarin' at the body Courtney came with the love
We comin' down baby blowin' smoke in his lungs
'Cause I'ma candy sweet dipper, a big 'caine pimper
I'm playin' with the guitar, I'm squezzin' on the nipples
Even though this hoe look good and the pussy was tight
After I hiy, jump in my shit, I'm scratching off for the night
Fuck that laying in the bed with the hoe 'til the morning
Bitch I'm getting out here yawnin', coming back to reformin'
3 in the morning
3 in the morning

Aiyyo, trill was the last one nigga, this time you better pull a gat
Cause the dick's hangin low, and it's still fat
But ain't shit whack so you better pull a quick guard
This shit is live enough to make your MOMMA'S dick hard
(C'mon!) Pick up ya phone and dial the 7 numbers that makes ya trip
For live shit comin from Bun B's lips
And I'm givin hoes the sensation of a big-ass nut
Gushin out, be in tele-cum-munications
Nine-seven-six, two-eight-six-two
Courtesy of Bun B, straight to motherfuckin you
Yo, the nigga was trill, same shit, new place
[?] [?], then bust in your face
Yeah niggaz be trippin yo, but still in the meanwhile
Your girl keeps callin me on motherfuckin redial
Now you're swoll cause your bitch runs your bill up
You catch me at the mo-tee, Bun big bone a fill' up
She might be shit to you, cause dude give her pay G
But pussy get played out, and pussy comes daily
As long as your game be strong ain't no thang
My phone always rang cause of the dope shit I sang
Keepin hoes on my dick yo, and ain't no lettin go
The net keeps flyin out, the pussy stays wet so
I turn on my VCR then I put a flick in
The hoe starts lickin that dick and pretty soon
I'm stickin that ass, like a fool in the bed
All I can see, is the top and back of your head
It ain't about conversation or make that hit
On a first name basis hoe that ain't bout shit!
Look trick, tell me how many rubbers to pack
I hit the room from the front, the ass from the back
And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!

There would be no money or rapping.

Hoes shrivlin up like raisins talkin bout it so amazin
How big Bun be rollin through Texas with s*** hoes keepin they wig done

That's too pretty to park, in a motherfuckin garage
My candy, it's like a part of the fam'
So lose my friends or my ends I wouldn't give a damn
But my candy, is an extension of me
So when you lookin at my car you lookin at Bun B
It's my candy, player, throwed, fly
And you can't fuck with it no matter how hard you try

Steppin' out the Caddy, bitch, I'm fresher than Dentyne
Slicker than Crisco, sweeter than Nabisco
From Philly to 'Frisco where the Don be a Sisqo
You better get some Blades if you still ridin' this ho

If you fittin' ta ride foreign, then, nigga, you gotta chop
And Southern niggas still got the nerve to ride D's
I ain't hatin' on Daytons, but it's 2000, nigga please
It's all about the candy paint, it's all about the Vogues
It's all about the slab, baby, it's all about the hoes
Got some cars and some pros: some real and some fraud;
Hated on by a nigga, hated on by a broad
So long as J's sell, and them boppin' hoes s***
I'll be ridin' chromin' blades, steady choppin' hoes up... Hoes up... Hoes up..

Big dick Cheney and Snowy Snow, (cocaine cocaine)

Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggaz, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose

Cocaine, cocaine

[Bun B:]
They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Columbia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine

[Hook x5]

You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fuck*are
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fuck*are
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
And my yayo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)

Gettin pussy from these bitches every god damn day
Kick it with a trill nigga so you best not trip
Bought the Caddy crossed the pier and kicked to Ganksta Nip

On the low my fuckin momma knows some [?]
Motherfucker either down or the motherfucker ain't
And if ya bitch-ass ain't, then ya dick is in the paint
If ya gal look fine you better hide the bitch
Cause if I find her I'ma fuckin make her suck my dick
That dope for your momma and your sister too
And if I'm locked down then tell that shit might go for you
Don't try to get no false nuts, I take 'em sucker
Fuckin 'round with C you'll be a dead motherfucker

But I just laugh, cause pussy games be triflin
The legs get spread, I cut that ass like a knife then
Bust a nut on her stomach, wash my dick in the sink
And buy a 40 at the store, from the god damn chink
Dope games keep ya sick, just like a disease
Movin ki's makin G's, hoes drop to they knees
Little kids on the corner, steady grabbin they nuts
Sayin, ""I wish I was Bun when I grow the fuck up""
Baby blue Riviera, Dayton and laced rims
Khaki pants, black sweater with the you. G. K. Brim
Black gat fully loaded nigga come with respect
Step up the wrong way I'll break yo' god damn neck
Big dick in my drawers, the niggaz from down South
Down to put a twelve gauge in yo' god damn mouth!
Think I'm playin bitch try me, it ain't no thang
Put them hands up bitch, and kiss this god damn ring
Cause I move tons of dope, twenty-four hours a day
Cocaine from Argentina to the 'Frisco bay
Dea try to stop me yo, but they shit ain't cold
Cause the nigga's got politicians on the Big Tyme payroll
Narcotic agents wearin cement shoes
Reported missin on the news, they singin the blues yo
Cause if they get my money nigga I'll let it slide
Just some mo' cocaine in the back of the ride, bitch!

Only out for one thing, and that's to get you undercovers
You wanna lick me down, strap me down
Think you're gonna toss on me, well I won't be around
For you to put wear-and-tear on my body
If you know like I know
You better go cause I ain't even hottie
To tell you the truth, you ain't that major
Cause you made a little album and you getting the papers
Well, it's my turn and you're catchin the vapors
Before you know it, you'll be askin for favors
Remember back in pa?
When you were constantly jockin and callin my everyday
The truth hurts huh, and you won't admit

You're crampin my style!!

I love you on the first night, ain't even gonna make it
Cause broken hearts, I don't had enough of
I need sensuality, not a bunch of broke love
If you can provide it, let's have it
Take your time baby, stop jumpin like a rabbit
Let's start somethin on a come-up
We can have it goin on here from sun-down to sun-up
Don't try to run up in me fast
I want to find out how long can B-you-N B last
Pass the ice and the honey, the money you can keep
Watch your back at all times, one eye open when you sleep
I can't have you for a part-time lover

No, not quite, I did my part, now I'm takin flight
You just might see me again, but not soon
You can keep the wedding
I just want the honeymoon!
You might be good, but see - that ain't even the point
I got all that I wanted, now I'm out of this joint
So, you can pass me my draws and pass me my cap
Cause, I ain't go be here when you wake up from your nap
And, that's the haps, no ifs ands or buts
Now, pass my matchbox, so I can hit the cut

I'm pimpin' down the ave. You know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife.
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that,
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine nigga never do that
Who's says he's going through a thang when ya'll ain't never lied.
I gotta a baby but it's momma act like he ain't mine.
Wicked women using children to live on
When I hurt and try to hate cause she knows the thrill is gone
Say man I stop smokin' with haters back in 94
But niggas thinkin' that a sweeps gone get the through my door
And niggas talk alot of shit in a safe place,
I know cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my thesis, see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, and all what it look like
So I keep swangin' I hear clanging tryin' to live my life

I see these niggas and days go and come
And for me just to wake, I'm know I'm pissed
I grab my cis and I split my sista with my bunk
Some of my sweets be tight And some of my sweets be fucked up
But all of my sweets gonna blow so killas smoke get sucked up
I looked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blastin' this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay Still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wipin' away my dead homey momma's tears... Shit..
But naturally them fuckin' laws is always after me
So I have to be in that matter on that 5-0-3
I'm livin' dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin' me streets keep on gettin' live with me.
They say there has to be another way but I ain't feelin that.
They try to steal a lad, and my wig they wanna peel it back.
But still the fact remains. It's all about the game swangin' bang
Peace to E-S-G and all the victims of the game

I'm pimpin' through the ave. Tryin' to see some good
But everythang is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hate, the wicked ways
We all lost children, pray for papers, and smokin' our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me but all we do now is fuckin' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin' dope and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gay to street fame comin' from this rap game
Lust for thankin' and compulsive drankin' is a normal thang
Some get a waste and misplace tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to there place by smokin' with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gonna change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the truck to make me feel good.

But they act like they can't separate a real nigga from the fraud
Rule number one: never send a boy to fuck a grown ass lady
And respect the game 'cause the game is known to be gone fast baby
Now It's a long pass maybe you should try diving for it

Knowing ain't a giving and nothing is
See all this candy-coated and bluffing is detrimental to our beautiful black southern kids
Enough of this man, let's get this here straight like creases

About the cheese, the green, the pills, the coke D's
I marry my pockets, so now I chase my queen
Keep a thang for the haters with the red beam
Every since fifteen I've been a big money fiend
Sippin' cold codeine and pulling up clean
Popping up at the spot and dropping the top
And keep a bad yellow [?] with my dick on rock uh!

A bad day for the niggaz in my click
I just got had a call from a bitch at the pa P. D. That's on my dick
It's seems the drug situation is so tow up
And poes down the fuckin T-X had to show up
I got shit on the scene so 99 can't hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret and there's no rest
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
In Dynasties.. I-Rocs... And Caravans and muthafuckas are swolen
Like paper stacks and a rubberband
Goin all out of tact on the local bird slaggin brothaman
And be servin as slow as fuck
Cause my niggaz are nervous
And if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggaz is happy with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town

Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my tags off my buick and yall know I didn't love that
Rollin on some white balls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, you gots to do your own nails!!
I told my niggaz to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town

God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back up!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my click
Got the birds, and reopen my lab back up
And told my boys, ""If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye,
Don't give him a chance to identify! ""
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at random, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Close to the dopeman - God damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
Cause in my yard is A big ass - I got yale sign!!!
It's time for tony montana stacks
I got niggaz on the corner holdin big ass bags and cans of crack
The land of Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fools run in with your glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last love
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight

So, we break the mall
Now and then we fuck;

Open face with them designs... Shit
Maybe a rack on top and bottom with a couple of diamonds to add some shine
Some niggas got that yella gold
Some niggas got that white
Some niggas got that platinum and bling, bling 'em all night
Shit, I know this boy with one gold, no ice;
I know a nigga who got robbed and bought the same teeth twice;
Muthafuckas with fangs, symbols of gangs or they squad
Some real and some fraud;
Spell the name of they broad
Got boys that praise the Lord
With open face and they cross
Some did all thirty-two, and paid a heavy-ass cost
So, whether you the boss, the runner, or the square
C'mon down to the South;
We got gold grills everywhere

Gold in the middle, they stay shiny
One on each canine;
You get one free if you not paid on government aid
Go get some shades
You blindin' hoes with 14 carat sun rays
But while they all up in yo grill
They vision blurry for days
Stacked, and ya say, ""But couldn't I just stop at one"" just like Lays
You left the whole jaw twinkle, to stick a rag in ya face
You buff 'em and shit;
They sparkle like the comets in space
I got two crosses with a diamond, heart, a club, and a spade

The game's been good
And all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
Bitches tryin' to price my diamonds
But that shit is just so common
'Cause they see a nigga shinin'
But I'm movin' too fast
96 karats if you think that you could manage
Got the drink and the salad
Now the bitch is on the?
I'm comin' down Gulf way, I'm tryin' to see what's up
I see big ass and some titties
Now we flippin' in the 'Bourbon to the city
The attitude's shitty but I bought no plex
Ain't talkin' 'bout the Malcolm but I'm ridin' on the X
The highway was so wet, I'm slippin' out my lane
The bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
I bet you never seen a big truck like that
I bet you never got a dick sucked like that
The bitch didn't know that I was tapin' the whole scene
Now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
The glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
Chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
I got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
Tryin' to close me down, but I got ghetto love
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm comin' down richer than rich

But don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
Breakin' off the jealous with pitch black Barettas

Bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex

Too $hort smoked you like a Newport, and you bought
A one-way ticket to something bigger than you
Over your head and got scared
Exactly what I figured you'd do

Busta playa moves and if you done it and did it

DEA is tryin' to stick bugs to me
Undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
What could be more throw
Mafioso puttin' bombs under my load
Never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
Now I'm comin' down shinin'
Pieces and chains full of diamonds
I'm winin' and dinin' and caligula

Bitches sayin' but I'm diggin' ya

And make ya make it man it make a niggas wanna pop trunk

Ball in the club 20 deep just to throw cash
If you lie doe, I got somethin for them jackers
A mean 17 they hit hard like linebackers
Boys talkin down I put it all in they face
Cause I set up shop and bop to 48 states
So when you see them Texas plates, you know it's goin down

And I'm a hold it down, I bar none and fade all

Rolled on a dolphin, get that shit up out your nose

I spend mine on Benz and Rolls, Royces choices, get on the pole
Slide down, move around and bring that money back home

Five inch heels and a dress that's see through

As soon as I saw her I knew that it was time
As soon as she saw me she knew that she was mine
If this is a dream then I don't wanna wake
And if this is as good as it seems, come on you gotta shake

Her body's not real it look like crunk drew her
If she don't step to me I'm finna run to her
And off top man, my mouth will drop man
For a minute it felt like the world just stopped man

Then started again, now I'm startin' to feel like

You got the dope but right now we gots to go

Grippin' the tie she ready to bone me now
Diggin' up in that belly got her moanin' now

And 'round and 'round I go

Dawgs in pens and the boys with the weed spots

Run up on me nigga I'm gon' do what I gotta do

Sippin art and smokin Lite Brite
The preacher talkin 'bout us in the pulpit
Behind closed doors he be on some day shit
I'm out here in the streets this ain't no place to play bitch
Show some weakness come up better catch a case bitch
I wanna change, but this the wrong time
I wanna stop, but these niggaz is harder now

Late at night, when I'm layin off in the bed
Countin bread, some crazy shit be goin through my head
I be wonderin 'bout this life that I live (that I live)
Aiyyo God got some better shit he can give (he can give)
I wonder if it's a better place for the innocent kids
In the ghetto they gotta suffer for shit that they ain't did
By no fault of they own, goin through struggles and strife
Havin to deal with a fucked up life (that's cold)
I know they thinkin nobody knows, or nobody cares
Why can't nobody see the shit, when everybody stares
Man we losin the children, we losin the youth
Cause you motherfuckers won't tell 'em the truth
So they runnin 'round unprepared, and uninformed
It's understood that's why the hood is dumpin on 'em
We gotta show 'em it's a better way (F'real) at any cost
Cause they the future if we don't save 'em then we already lost mayne

Niggaz doin life, I saw old men in that bitch

I wish today that the Lord take me away
I'd get to see my old man and I wonder what he would say

I'm tired livin' fucked up, tired of livin' bad
Tired of hearing grandma tellin' me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm tryin' to live up to the image
That she would want me to be
But I got one foot in the street
And every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G
But niggas depend on me
It ain't safe to hit I-10
So niggas fear with me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
I dealt selling that white shit
Pushin' cocaine, niggas holding pistols
Dependant on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20, 000, tryin' to turn it to a hundred
And ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas came to smoke, bad habits do exist
And if this bitch came thinking to ease my mind
By sucking my dick
Bitch make up for a minute cause that ship never lasts
In 1996 niggas is dyin' from layin' on that ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Eazy-E died
And you wonder why yo' niggas out there smokin' fry
I wish that I could tell you I wore a rubber everytime
But if I told you that nigga you know that I be lyin'
And I've been fucking pussy since the tender age of nine
It's gettin' to be a full-time job just tryin' to stay alive
And Crackers tend to smirk, offended by the weed smoke comin' off my shirt
But still I puts in work and front for my folks
Cause where I come from nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be gettin' married, and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe, some say that nigga's selling dope
And you know that I ain't lyin', that just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the Devil poke you with his fork
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers are false prophets
Fuckin' hoes and gettin' paid
I'm lookin' for the...

[Chorus:]

You only got one life to live
That's all they give you to do it
You could bullshit your way through it
Or stay true, it can be complicated cause niggas
Be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost
The people in the lane get tossed
The streets'll eat your ass alive
Take your positions with pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dusk to see dawn
It's treacherous how we was left to die
On the streets that we be on
Motherfuckers sleepin' on them corners that you pee on
Probably cause society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the fuck made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas slangin' that yay
Because it ain't like they make high levels gainable
And that punk piece of American pie just ain't obtainable
So how can I substain a full life before death
Man, I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now c'mon, who gives a damn when you can't afford the turkey or ham
Livin' off of Raemon Noodles, beef jerky, and Spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off that slab
Cause poverty will push a nigga over that brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your ledge
So instead of being without, I'm hustling
Tryin' to get through these ungodly days
Thinkin' of ways to get the fuck outta this maze
A man will committ a crime 'cause a fuckin' crime pays
I'm going through a phase you don't grow out
Until there's a reason a mother fuckers gots to pour out
His 40 on the curb, disturbed and left with no doubt in his mind
But still sometimes he don't know why
He walkin' around just hopin'
He can get one more try to make it
It's bullshit he going through, but yo, he gots to take it
You can't fake it, to get that hi life

I don't know no other way to survive out here

Just walk with me...

So I get cross-country with that thang, makin that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
Cause I put up sum from every sale, so all my chil'ren can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell, but just put me in wood grain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be, if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that Sweet down, cause that bullshit don't apply to me
Cause out here on the real streets, a dreamer always stay sleep
Cause out here the strong survive, and now they didn't die from thankin weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it hard, still tryna get right with god
Still read my Bible lone, cause Reverend do wrong, still livin fraud

Yeah, yeah....ah yeah
Heh heh, my man, My nigga D
*whisper* I left it wet for ya x12

[Verse]
My baby mama brother came and told me some shit
About a nigga talking about Pimp C ya wig'll get split
I laughed then I dashed cause I'm fucking your chick
She told me all she wanna do is ride my dick
She kick it with the nigga cause he give her the stacks
But every fucking night I try to break her fucking back
And now a nigga say that he wanna fight
But if you fucking around I'll put that fire in his life

[Bun B]
Man keep fucking it raw
And if he's trip then it's on
Never let a nigga say you a broad prove him wrong
Fool, I'm fucking this nigga girl now and he know it
Got a pistol but wont blow it, talking shit but wont show it
Yo it ain't nothing going on but nuts on they tricks
They never faking licks, sucking dick while I'm taking shits
I do a bitch bad and treat a nigga worse than that
And make sure you show him that fat gat you left wet for him fool

[Chorus]
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

[Pimp C]
I went to my nigga got that liquor dark
My nigga 3-2 came down with the water
A dip, dip, nigga trip, trip ya fried
I took my fucking pistol and shot a dopey in his eye
I ain't got no love for you fucking hos
I'm hot from smoking click, gotcha drippin on my fucking clothes
I got that fire bumpin in my brain
I'm thinking to myself, I need to go to selling caine
And all the time I'm bumpin W.C.
Cause it seem like he the only nigga making sense to me
And the shit ain't really the same
It's moving too fast, I just switched all of my aim
I'm rollin' in a raggedy ride, thinking about suicide
Puffing the green outside, nigga
And all the time I'm fried
I left it wet for ya nigga

[Chorus]
I left it wet for ya nigga (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

[Bun B]
I never loved a punk ass, sorry son of a bitch
Which is why I can't lie about the hate I said it straight
And never switched up my opinion, if you ain't down, you ain't down
That's that, just go get your gat little bitch
Holla back when your pistol pack
I promise anybody trying to be a bold bastard
Getting fried like that dip, I'm full of that dank and ready to trip
It's been a lot of niggaz swearing that they hard
Like I care and I be sharing slugs with some of them studs
And some of their barin, darin
Hoes and half playas, and hit the blunt and give it away
And see which one these niggaz wont be living today
Hey what's up? Got me a cup of that irk and jerk
Putting in work until I'm blown and never the 5-4 bitch
Cause I'm too cold, I expose like a bomb dropping them daily
So don't say we never told ya, how a trill nigga fold ya
Texas trilla O big baby, maybe you didn't know I gets my blast on
and let loose some of this stress, leaving blood all over your chest
Yes, I left it wet for ya fool

[Chorus]
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)
I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

I left it wet for ya fool (*whisper* I left it wet x3)

Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back?

Reconsider, read some literature on the subject

Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart

Man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart
Play your part, play your part

Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoe's get the most, not the lesser

Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love

A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot

Some hoe's wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

Oh, I choose you, girl

Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the seven wonders of the world
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl

When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dinin' room table
'Cuz you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable

We rock the freshest sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich

Easy as A, B, C, simple as 1, 2, 3

Eeny meeny decisions with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my projection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life

That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cuz it's gonna get wetter, better prepare you for the c-support
She supposed to spend in on that baby but we see she don't

Ask, ask Paul Mccartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter, slaughter them pockets had to tie her to a rock and
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cuz he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eatin' good

Like an infant on a double D titty, just gettin' plump

Sometimes you wanna quit, but you know you cain't
You gotta keep hustlin or you lose it all
If you choose to ball you pay your dues and fall
I said fuck bein broke, if I gotta sell coke
I'm a rock the shit up and raise hell with my folks
I'll be posted on the block, at night I gotta get mine
I'll pimp hoes and I do white collar crimes
Cause life is...

[Chorus]

[Bun B:]
Now life is to some people unbearable
They tellin on they homeboys and that's terrible
Was it way too much time or nothin big
Cause if you tell on us, we'll be splittin your wig
Now my freedom is to me my main asset
So I'm a keep it 100, and give like I get
Chill at the Ponderosa and smoke that good
I'm tryin to get rich while I rep for the hood
See everybody's got that same old dream
Of big cars, bad bitches and a mountain of green
Drive a brand new Bentley, Benzo or a Beem
But ain't none of that worth tellin on yo' team
It's on you homeboy, so what'chu gon' do
You need to take my advice and stop snitchin fool
Or you can close yo' ears, and run yo' mouth
But when they catch you homeboy you'll soon find out
Life is...

Say bitch I'm thinking of a master plan
And I'm bringing this paper faster than
These other lil bastards can
So I'm digging in my mind for the bitches I broke
And keep a player paid in full cause pimping ain't no joke
You want to pop that pussy that's a slim ass chance
Put the paper in the panties when you get that dance
This C.O.D. nigga, so you can keep your nuh plastic cards
No checks, no money orders, Visas or Master Cards
Original old school rock balling rappers
Bitches still say we high side call us sky cappers
But why slap us when you think a nigga down on his luck
You try and flag us when you see us coming down in a buck
Now what the fuck part of the game taught y'all that bitch play
See we makes a bitch pay
Like a bitch weigh
And then a bitch stay
Wouldn't sit still
Fuck how this shit feel

Can't forget to check my traps
Got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead
Never has it left my mouth
Optimos a fifth of crown
Red eyes with a frown

Fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover
Make your baby mama love us
Knot in my right pocket
Left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch
Stuffed shirt plastic glock
Back pocket Chevy keys
Ready for the brain wash

Always got to watch your friends

The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggaz pimping hoes

Make me walk up in the strip and kind of get like buck
Oh you fucking with my cheese oh you fucking with my paper

Cause she got to get it done but that thing ain't my world

No homeboys you come dead, well put em to rest
Bumba clocks em all dead, wit two in his chest
Botty bwoy you come dead, and if in all die
Will you run dead em again? Well go on buddy let em fly

And block out this stress my past criminal life might bring
The only way I use to nip it in the bud
Was ta try and put some bullets in some of you joker's guts

The next kaing of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(Ahh!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game ""True Religion"" before you found it in denim
Feel the, ""Wrath of Kane, "" and you could not escape
The hip-hop version of ""The Ring"" and you just watched the tape (Next up!)

And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We Trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (Understand?)

High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all o'em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(Dayum!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me (Next up!)

Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)

I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
(Aight) Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band (rock band!)
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (Aooow!)
High roller dose some hoes on the c*** plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em ""Hot Pants"" (Next up!)

[Pimp C:]
I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (Flame)
They call me Sweet James, or call me Sir Jones
Two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Board Nine, or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!
What you know about gettin cross country
Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey
You need to take that shit back
That ain't no emmy diamonds what the fuck you done to that...

But I live everyday like it's my muthafuckin last one
Every nigga and they mama askin why
But I'm in the game live by the game and in the game I'm a die
But if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the come and go
Cause tomorrow aint promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penetentiary
So I'm a take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin crack and pack two clips

Gangbangin got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Back in Orange my nigga Pop died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw once before he died wished it was twice mayn
I remember bein eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin us act bad not givin a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin to the end
And I had to quit lettin that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen for damn near ten
But now it looks like when he come out man I'm goin in
So shit I walk around wit my mind blown in my own fuckin zone
Cause one day you here but the next day you gone

One day you here baby

Ak loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin shife so I look shife back
Can't show no weakness in these streets you'll get yo life jacked
Mayn it's a trip where I stay especially for me
This bitches tryin to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my boy down in Florida Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B bitch I aint no liar
My man Roro jus lost his baby in a house fire
And then when I got on my knees that night to pray
I asked God why he let these killas live and take my homeboy's son away
Man if you got kids show em you love em cuz God jus might call em home
Cuz one day you here but baby the next day you gone"

And pimpin' ain't never died.
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry.

And straight threw off all the game;
Got all these hoes thinkin'
They could manage they own change.

Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy.
Fuck niggas watch them mack and pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what y'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.

No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis

Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior...and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny...sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again...that's why...

You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money...it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.

Gotta a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make

Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a pump

That talk down on every song (I hear you talkin down nigga!)
You steady actin like a bitch, you steady cryin your eyes out (stop crying bitch!)

Well it's been a long time my nigga, I shouldn't have left you (I shouldn't have left)
When I some real trill shit to go left to
Gotta lot of respect fool (yeah), for the ones before me
But when my time came they act like they ain't know me
I've been down with rap music since Cold Crush and Melle (Melle)
Before mtv put Run-D. M. C. On the tele (tele)
Back when Whodini tried to tell ya about ya friends
Nigga I was giving rap all my time and my ends
Bought damn near every record the muthafucka dropped
West coast gangsta music, East coast hip-hop
Now it's our time to shine and the tables is turned
Them muthafuckas aggravated 'cause we gettin some burn
""There's no room for everybody, just a few niggaz is swole"" (why is that?)
Proabably 'cause they favorite rappers ain't in control
But just let go of the past 'cause it's hurtin your hands
And pass it over to the next generation of fans
And quit hatin the South

[Chorus:]

You double standards and hypocrisy, remind me of Massa
We ain't good enough to eat at ya table but when ya dick get hard
You wanna run up with the?

Friendly ass niggaz jumpin bad on the internet
Ain't nobody typing that much, can't be a danger
Catch you in person, bitch I'll break yo' fingers!
It's some trash in the South but I promise you

As long as the beat knock and the lyrics hot, son

Like my syrup and swisha can't leave without it when I ride
Even though I'm the king of the city where I reside
I wouldn't and couldn't do it without my woman on my side
Sometimes I got it figured out, sometimes I'm confused
I win 9 times out of 10 but now and then I might lose
But no matter the road I choose and how the drama unfold
A playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
She gon' hold me down to the fullest, rainy or sunny
She seen me ball out of control and dead broke with no money
So when the game got funny, she ain't pack up and roll
She help me get back on my feet now man that's way too cold
If you got a down woman wit'chu keepin it true
Don't try to hate, appreciate her for the things that she do

If you keep it real wit your man, then put your hand up, c'mon

Pimpin' hoes slammin' Cadillac doors
Shawty understand this is how we roll
Parkin lot pimpin' on fo's
Va to H Town yeah you already know
Choppin' on blades so amazing
Look at them boys teeth that's crazy
The lean in the weed got us lazy
Yellow boppers is boppin' but you already know

Straight out the south with my nuts in my hand
It's the Swisha House the Third Coast the state of Texas that's my land
Whos the man that's in demand
It's Paul Wall baby yeah that's me
I put it down on that gulf bank but now I reside on that south beach
And I'm hustlin on the grind 72
Hours straight
No time to eat or sleep I'm slangin' licks and that just won't wait
I'm campaignin for a new Benz
On the rims with bubble lenz
I'm stackin' every dollar I see 100s 50s 20s and 10s
Doors open doors close never sweat hoes playas get yo's
Hustle and flow cars clothes that's the playa like that I know
Roll the dank up where the dro?
Pour the drank up where the fo's
Stackin money all on the low and we still ridin dirty

[Chorus:]

Got a drop top on them rollerskates
Candy jolly rancher paint
Enjoyin the spoils of hard work and grind more tryin to get bank
I don't know what them boys thinkin my motivation is benjamin franklin
I'm tryin to maintain this wealth that I been calculatin
Gettin money that's all I know
On my toes never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes I wave the trunk just like a pro
I grind it's off to work I go I hustle hard it's no stop
And if I flop I switch to hustle
I learned the game then set up shop
I'm strivin' to make it to the top
It's all or nothin no turnin back
I'm with them boys out on the block
Accumulating them paper stacks
I'm makin money this where it's at
Whatever it takes crack or jack
In love with my money and that's a fact
And we still ridin' dirty

[Chorus:]

[Paul Wall: Talking]
Right now we got the 5th wheel reclinin
Trunk popped up screens fallin from the sky
Candy paint sprayed by eddie and I'm ridin on that glassy chrome
All courtesy of my hustle game

Real hustlin's in my blood line
I don't complain or whine
I just get on my grind puttin in work overtime
I learned over time any hustle or any grind whatever it takes to make a dime I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind but now I see that road to riches
It's a long road full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Norv Freeman taught me keep it movin when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me keep it trill at all costs
I peep game from the best and since then I been playin chess
I put in work with no rest
To get that paper that's my quest
I'm on the slow grind towards success
One of the best 'cause I keep it fresh
I'm one hundred isn't nothin less
And I'm still ridin' dirty

That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Coming from the small town of madness, late night its all murderers
Player haters, scan'lous hoes, and 'Lac-driving slab hurters
Acting bad after 8, you can catch us on the late
Rolling dice, blowing, and sipping on the bar straight
We got the red drank, orange drank, purple drank
Laughing at these mark hoes that say they never heard of drank
Half-gallon Big Gulp, Big Red, big cup
Drink mixed up, blowing sweets, and lighting sticks up
Now in my new world, slow down, I can see
Niggas talking shit, trying to see if what they said got to me
But ho-ass type of skills say a lot to me
You just gon' fuck around and get yourself shot, to be
Or not to be, motherfuckers plot to see me crack
Under pressure, so they just impress a nigga to see me react
These niggas try to start me down like a scary clown
Don't dare me, 'round here we fuck your game up like Larry Brown
And carry pounds of killer 'round like groceries
With a presence that make you not want to stand close to me
Talking about we s'posed to be brothers
Don't make me laugh motherfuckers
You chose to be on the side opposing me
Don't matter what coast you be
From, Bun and C will light your world up explosively

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
Dj screw by the gallon, bitch the game belong to me
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
Dj screw by the gallon, bitch the game belong to me

[Pimp C:]
I got money on my beeper, dead trees on my phone
They call me Mick Jagger 'cause I ""roll a lot of stones""
It's a whole lot of clones but only one Sweet Jones
Turnin whores to carnivores, they just can't leave my meat alone
It's been a long time since I busted on a glock
But every corner that I hit, I left it screwed up and chopped (chopped)
Marooned up and dropped, like my Biarritz on top
Let the motherfucker bleed until it drip and let it drop
I'm still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
But now I'm sick and simply rich, grippin wood and flippin chrome
I got Bobby by the pound, Whitney by the key
Dj screw by the gallon, bitch the game belong to me

[Chorus:]

[Bun B:]
Man I pull up in your city and get my Bush on (what is that?)
Lay down the competition, take their cash crops, and get my push on (huh)
Moved up to Bentley with more chrome from a Lexus key (key)
All because we cornered the market on that Texas tee (tee)
And we don't bar no plexes, we way bigger than other men though (men though)
The diamond deuces on tinted windows, we in the wind yo (wind yo)
We ""Chevro way"" the wind blow (wind blow), that's the corner we been Joe (been Joe)
Don't know where you been bro, but it's no quiz to me, you win though
When it's ten fo', good to go, but in my Styrofoam good and muddy
We block bleeders (what?), leavin your neighborhoods good and bloody
We grippin that woodler, bud it (damn), sit back and scope it (huh)
Pay attention to Prince and pushin everything about to pump it

[Chorus:]

[Pimp C:]
Uh! I done smashed up my flyin spurt, it wasn't shit
I just parked it in the grass and brought some brand new shit
A Phantom Rolls Royce, 24's with the bump
I ain't trippin about the seat, I got them woofers in my trunk
Cut in my swisher, codeine on my whiskers
Fuckin with that Smoke D, Bundy, and that Vicious
Ugk Records, it's an institution
Know a lot of niggaz livin off of prostitution
Pimpin ain't dead, it just moved to the web
Bitch ain't gotta hit the track, ain't gotta give no tricks no head
Ain't got to give no tricks no pussy, just cameras and screams
Easiest money you can get, it's the American Dream bitch!

[Bun B:]
Man I'm a middle finger figure (figure), a million dollar mission
Poppin like Orville Redenbacher (bacher), with a whippin in the kitchen (kitchen)
Yayo like don'trelle Willis (what?), we the trillest
On the mound, I'm holdin that whole South down, I know you feel us
We the realest walkin the planet, can't stand it
Pass away, wanna fight us
Start to swingin, wanna kill us
Blast away, wanna stab us
Get to stickin but make sure you cut us deep
'Cause I betcha we comin back a couple hundred brothers deep (oh!)
Pimp and Bun, we run the streets, which streets? Man, pick your hood
Don't matter, we represented, cross us? (yeah) We gon' get you good

Hey, fool, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, dawg, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, man, listen up, I got this story to tell on the cool

Now, once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga, like myself had to strong arm a ho
Now, this was not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no God damn sense, tryin' to push me
He used to hold dick, now he wanna be in my shoes

Hatin' like a baby, mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryin' to hold on to my little chunk but now but a punk
In the parkin' lot bumpin' his gums with his teeth in the trunk
Oh, what? I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump
You aimin' that bitch in the sky, you chump

Point that muthafuckah this way and dump, oh, what?
You scared to go to the pen? Thinkin' them niggas gon' tap yo' rump
Man, I thought he played bold, be he ain't even fuss
Man, the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to bus'
But his trigger stayed cold, I wasn't surprised

I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise, a sheep in wolf's clothing on the prey
He tried to hunt the hunter, and got hunted down his God damn self
In pa, niggas, it's where we stay, ain't none of that K-K-K'n or playin'
So see A or E up out your life or you test yourself

And make a nigga break you off to piece the rest yo'self
Oh, yes yo' health is what's in question and I hope
That this ass whoopin', teach you a motherfuckin' lesson.

Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South, boy's comin' up cold
Talkin' down my name and what it's all about, you niggas
Better get some cut and get my name out yo' mouth

'Cause I don't know why you got flex with me, testin' me
But, I'ma pull my shit and let you see that all that carry the jack
Ain't what it's about, so you haters need to quit with that po'
Hustlin' and take another ride

Niggas, often crossed the line, the movies got this boy fucked
Up in the mind, not to mention the wine and codeine syrup
Combined easy access to 9's and shit talkin' hoes that's fine
And all they got time for is four Swisher dimes, committing crimes
Amped off water and some exaggerated rhyme, so, if bein' hard
Ain't in your heart, then don't start, niggas'll tear your weak mind apart

Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school, he don't know
I hang with killers, will erase that fool, wouldn't give a fuck about him
But he kin to my son if you think I'm that nigga, then you picked
The wrong one, 'cause I live by the gun, die by the gun, hot bullets burn
Some say that, ""Them bitches stun"", so raise yo' own children
Don't try to raise mine and when you see me, step with caution
'Cause I'm buckin' for mine, bitch.

Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You done crossed the line, now you gon' get fucked
I already told you before, but you ain't borrowing that

So, this time I'm handlin' mine and gon' erase you off the map
Such a shame but this all in the game and since the early sixties
Ain't a damn thang changed, we got haters over here
And haters over there but, I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air

I see you trippin' off that water, and you feel like you bad
'Cause yo' bitch done chose a pimp, and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt 'cause I fucked yo' girl, put big dick in her world
Bust nuts in her curl, when I hit it from the back, she said
""Baby, I can't take it"", push my dick up in her harder

Bitch, I'm straight up tryin' to break it, you a simp-ass nigga
You told that bitch, that, ""You love her"", but I'm straight up fuckin'
That pussy like that nigga off that colors but I ain't gon' get shot
'Cause you ain't shootin' shit, the best thing you can do is go and try
And beat that bitch, 'cause this man's style show stopper
Pistol popper, you ain't ready if I let this hot thing hit you

Feel your stomach like spaghetti, fool, you talkin' loud
But you move too slow, tellin' niggas all your plans
Got you tied up in a van, nigga, what the fuck is up in the place to be
First, I want the money, nigga, then I want the fuckin' ki's
Kidnap robbery 'cause you said you wanted me dead

Since you want a niggaare dead, buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40, nigga, I be comin' bad, got the sawed-off pump
With night vision, infrared, so, play me like a pussy
And you will get fucked, nigga, I'm hangin' out the truck
Buck, buck, buck, hit your nigga in the leg, hit yo' bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay, so your ass will get touched

Speaked the wrong words I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched because yo' ass deserve
To get done real fast in front of yo' kids to show 'em

What real type of bitch you is and it's that boy named
Three to the two, forever stayin' true just a player makin' due
And I gotta tell it to the whole wide world, how you got bitched
Razor neck just like a motherfuckin' girl, little muthafuckin' girl"

Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up

Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg

I went gold, but never sold my soul to bang
And bitch I'll hit you with that thang, I'm a Underground King

[Hook:]

[Bun B:]
Cross the line, nigga push my button
And you gon die in the very spot, that you thought you wasn't
And you gon look in the eyes, of the man you thought you were better than
T-are-I double L, that's with capital letters man
The Pimp and the Bun, Bobby you. N. And J. Are.
Big dick Cheney, and Tony Snow you know who they are
We the best than the rest, getting head for the showers
Fucking cowards get out the way, cause the rap game's our's

[Pimp C:]
Y'all niggaz, better reco'
That you ain't gotta like me, but you gon respect me hoe
17 years, I been rapping with that Bun
Fuck the fame want the change, it's been fun
The up's and the down's, the crying and the smiling
Fuck what you heard, ugk is a island
Away from you niggaz, but we still solid land
Sharks swimming in the water, put your nuts in the sand pussy nigga

[Hook:]"
UGK,Use Me Up,/u/ugk/use+me+up_20745316.html,"[Pimp C:]
I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin my mind
I'm trippin and I know it cause I'm all nerved up
Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin my car
And everyday it get better, I cain't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin, ""She ain't nothin but a scrub""
But she make me feel high like I'm, hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need, and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I cain't help myself, I know that I'm trippin
But she got it goin on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my, credit card
You know she get it cause ya know that...
(Chill, C) I know, G
I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin aw'lll limp
Why I let her play me? You cain't understand!
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man...

[Chorus: Bill Withers sampled from ""Use Me Up""]
I-yi-yi-yi-I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin used
Oh, you can just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up.

[Pimp C:]
I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and still ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin out them duckets and them, croka sacks
And everybody wonderin why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, axe me why I wanna this her
I told her cause her lovin ain't better than her sister
I cain't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin out, and Byrd say I'm trippin, too
But this time I just cain't listen to my whole crew
Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But '92 came around, and thangs go in-sane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You cain't understand!
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man...

[Chorus 2: Bill Withers sampled from ""Use Me Up""]
I-yi-yi-yi-I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up.

I-yi-yi-yi-I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin used
Oh, you can just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...

[Pimp C:]
To sum it all up, I'm breakin all my rules
Cause she got me droppin off her little brother to school
I be gettin bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on s**
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
Ugk sayin peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin Pimp C - uh, just a use me up!

[Outro: Bill Withers (Pimp C)]
Ah-hah well oh, ba-By, ba-By, ba-By (Yeah, a-just use me up)
Ba-By, ah-hah well oh (Uh, a-just use me up)
Ba-By, ba-By, ba-By (Yeah, a-just use me up)
Ba-By, ah-hah well oh (Uh, a-just use me up)

UGK,Wood Wheel,/u/ugk/wood+wheel_20745335.html,"[Pimp C:]
Uh... Whuuuut (hehe)
Smoke somethin', bitch... Smoke somethin'...

[Pimp C:]
I'm up early 'cause my nigga
Don't sell dope after night time.
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'n move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch... Holla at yo' bitch,
Now yo' bitch on my team;
Got her buyin' us sticky green
Lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch,
You lookin' at a candy boy.
I done came down Main and popped trunk;
Hit the switch on my candy toy.
We all young ghetto boyz,
That's why we act this way.
Tryin' to see a million dollars,
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today.

[Bun B:]
Pro smoke, pro choke,
Anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin'
In criminal court, it's civil.
In the middle of re-al-it-y
Unsolved mys-ter-ies riddle,
Knockin' over fat cats,
And gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles.
On note pads I scribble,
Write rippers that'll make you think.
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity,
Fuck it, take it, trick,
I fake it... Blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier
Cloud composures, all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya...

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Rollin' Seville (rollin' Seville),
Grippin' my steal (grippin' my steal),
My Tahoe real, man, I'm workin' wood wheel.
Sedan Deville (sedan Deville),
House on the hill (house on the hill),
Countin' up my scrill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.
Nigga, how you feel (nigga, how you feel),
I feel so trill (I feel so trill),
Might pop me a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.
House on the hill (house on the hill),
Marijuana fields (marijuana fields),
Grippin' my steal, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.

[Bun B:]
They tellin' me, ""Bun don't go there""
But, man, I just gots to bring it.
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas,
But scared to sing it.
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that bar 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that joint 'bout.
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain,
And leavin' stains on cerebellums.
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P. A. To Deep Ellum.
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em
To hell to heaven.

[Pimp C:]
I just spent 60 G's
On a brand new Eldo-reeze:
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac;
Northstar fifth wheel on back.
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
'Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman.
I love my wood wheel Grant,
'84 Cadillacs that slant,
Slowed-down screw tapes that knock,
Blowin' on Green private stock.
Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks,
Try 20-ounce Angus beef.
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas,
'n got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth.

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Fifth wheel and grill (fifth wheel and grill),
Candy Seville (candy Seville),
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel (workin' wood wheel).
House on the hill (house on the hill),
Flexin' mils (flexin' mils),
Countin' up my scrill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.
Comin' down so trill (comin' down so trill),
Nigga, how you feel (nigga, how you feel)?
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel.
Grippin' the steal (grippin' the steal),
Nigga, I'm so real (nigga, I'm so real).
Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel.

[Bun B:]
Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic... It's so ironic.
Sippin' gin and tonic: supersonic like Johnny Mneumonic.
We crash your party, piss on your parade,
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palasades to the Prominade.
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day.
That's the game we came to play,
It don't change, ain't a thang to say.

[Pimp C:]
It's goin' down in the H-Town,
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound;
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth...
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ain't got no time to play, girl;
Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk.
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was,
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow.
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go.

[Bun B:]
Gettin' ready fo'... Head doctors, show shockers, body rockers,
Late-night do' knockers...
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers,
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee.
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones: guerilla pimpin' at its finest.
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us...

[Pimp C:]
Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us.
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show,
And bitch niggas try to fight us.
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave...
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch-ass niggas ain't got no cheese?

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Blowin' big kill (blowin' big kill),
Million-dollar deals (million-dollar deals),
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel...

Uh... Puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
Smoke somethin', bitch."

To the Shores of Tripoli;
We will fight our country's battles
In the air, on land and sea;
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean;
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marine.

Our flag's unfurled to every breeze
From dawn to setting sun;
We have fought in ev'ry clime and place
Where we could take a gun;
In the snow of far-off Northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes;
You will find us always on the job--
The United States Marines.

Here's health to you and to our Corps
Which we are proud to serve
In many a strife we've fought for life
And never lost our nerve;
If the Army and the Navy
Ever look on Heaven's scenes;
They will find the streets are guarded
By United States Marines."

US5,Best Friend (Special Song From Richie),/u/us5/best+friend+special+song+from+richie_21300235.html,"And after everything that we've been
Through I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
For the rest of my live
'Cause you're my lady and I'm your best friend,
And I'm your best friend

In times when all hope is gone
And sadness fills your
Heart with pain
You wonder (Yeah)
If there's anyone
That you can call
To somebody who's left
All alone

You're such a loyal friend
And now I know that I'll never
Find somebody quite like you
I appreciate the day
You came and you stayed

And after everything that we've been
Through I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
For the rest of my live
'Cause you're my lady and I'm your best friend,
And I'm your best friend 

Some people said that we never survive,
We showed them that
Dreams can come true and it's for sure
Our secret lies behind an endless
Friendship and nothing could tear
Us apart

You're such a loyal friend
And now I know that I'll never
Find somebody quite like you
I appreciate the day
You came and stayed

And after everything that we've been
Through I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
For the rest of my live
'cause you're my lady and I'm your best friend,
And I'm your best friend

True love is so hard to find
Especially if it's someone
You can call your best friend
No matter what problems occur
You will overcame them with her

And after everything that we've been
Through I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
For the rest of my live
'Cause you're my lady and I'm your best friend,
And I'm your best friend"

Can you feel this endless feeling
I never felt like this before
In love

Now I feel this will last forever

Unified, side by side as one love

I'm prepared to sacrifice
Just to have you in my life

Out of sight, ain't out of mind
Because even though you were not here
You layed by my side

And all that I see
Is a vision of light leeding bright
To the one that I used to adore
Don't leave me stranded girl, I'm waiting
Oh baby baby baby yeah"
US5,"Making Of Richie's Solo Song ""Best Friends""",/u/us5/making+of+richies+solo+song+best+friends_21300177.html,"Sometimes in life when all hope is gone
and you feel like you're on your own.
True friends comes along
and makes you realize,
that everything is OK
And last you have gone through,
many ups and downs.
But no matter what,
you guys stood by my side.
And that's why I did sing
this song for you: my best friends

And after everything
that we've been through
I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
for the rest of my live
'Cause you're my lady
And I'm your best friend
And I'm your best friend (hm)

In times when all hope is gone
And sadness fills your heart with pain
You wonder (Yeah)
If there's anyone
That you can call
To somebody who's left all alone

You're such a loyal friend
And now I know that I'll never
find somebody quite like you
I appreciate the day
you came and you stayed

And after everything
that we've been through
I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
for the rest of my live
'Cause you're my lady
And I'm your best friend
And I'm your best friend

oh, hm

Some people said that
We would never survive,
We showed them that dreams can come true and 's for sure
Our secret lies behind an endless
Friendship and nothing could tear
Us apart

You're such a loyal friend
And now I know that I&#180;ll never
Find somebody quite like you
I appreciate the day
You came and stayed

And after everything
That we've been through
I'm still here with you
'Cause you're still my lady
'Cause you're my lady
I swear I'm gonna make you happy
For the rest of my lives
'Cause you're my lady
And I'm your best friend
And I'm your best friend

True love is so hard to find
Especially if it's someone
you can call your best friend
No matter what problems occur
You will overcame them with her"

The Educated Rapper's verses will stifle you
Scavengers, novice rappers, you're trifle, you
Haven't the slightest idea how much I ruffle
Your conscience, your insides, I watch you hustle
I don't just talk to be talkin
I don't bop it anyway to be walkin
I just try to be me, E
The only E, - E.M.D.

[ Kangol Kid ]
Yeah boy, that's my boy E.M.D., Educated Most Definitely
But right about now Kangol is in effect
And I'ma talk to my man Mixmaster Ice
Now check this out
You know that UTFO's all about talkin about young ladies, right?
Right about now we gon' talk about this young lady around the neighborhood, alright?
And this young lady, she is def
Fly, firm, dope, youknowmsayin?
She - yo, she's correct, youknowmsayin?
Now Ice, I want you to tell everybody here how bad this young lady is
Tell em right about now, Ice
[ *Mixmaster Ice cuts up* ]
(Bad meaning bag, but bad meaning good)--> Run-D.M.C.

Yeah boy
Now when Ice say a young lady is bad, she is definitely bad, youknowmsayin?
Ice, you see any bad young ladies in the audience?
(Yeah)
Like I thought, homeboy
But back to the young lady, alright?
Check this out
She couldn't stand still for nothin
She was always on the (go)
I mean she would (go) from one guy to another
And then she'd (go) from that guy to another guy
And if there was a whole bunch of guys in the room
Ice, tell me what this young lady would do
(Go) (go) (go) to him
(Go) (go) then to him
[ *as Mixmaster Ice cuts up ""go""* ]
Then to him, to me, my man B-Fyne, E, Doc, everybody
(Go) (go) (go)

Now you fellas are probably thinkin that eh -
It's kinda hard to get this young lady, right?
But let me tell you:
All you gotta do to this young lady is whistle
[ *Mixmaster Ice scratches a whistling sound* ]
And check this out, she's so much on a mission
She'll walk by you and wait for you to whistle
On a serious tip
She'll even hear you if you whistled under water
[ *Mixmaster Ice makes the whistling sound as if under water* ]

Back to the ladies
Let me tell you a little somethin
I've seen my man Mixmaster Ice in action
And when my man whistles ladies just cold go nut, youknowmsayin?
Ice, show them what I'm talkin about
[ *Mixmaster Ice scratches* ]

But eh - back to the original story, alright?
[ *as Mixmaster Ice scratches* ]
Now the young lady I was tellin you about, I ain't tell you her name
But eh - well eh - we call her Technic
Cause she be makin moves, youknowmsayin?
But yo, my man Ice, he video-taped what him and this young lady did, alright?
It was like a movie with Ice in it
Check this out
Started with one finger - two fingers - three fingers - four
His whole hand disappeared, you couldn't see it no more, youknowmsayin?

Now you ladies is gonna like this
My man's wrist disappeared, up to his forearm
Then he started illin with his elbow, serious, with his elbow like this
[ *Mixmaster Ice scratches* ]
With his elbow!

Now I know some of you young ladies out there goin, ""Euwww, that's gross!""
But you gon' love this
After his arms got tired
All we heard was
(How low can you go?)--> Chuck D
Let me tell you how low he went
My man put his lips against Technic and started illin like this

With his lips!

The women of today ain't with it
If you ain't gonna be loyal, forget it
I know the deal, so I admit it
Because I knew a brother that did it
He used to be a nice looking dude, the ladies' choice
He would charm them all with the sound of his voice
He's not a sucker, a bum, the boy ain't soft
He likes to be clean and dress his ass off
He was light-skinned with curly hair
He would make his girl think he was so sincere
Always said ""I'm cool,"" called himself an expert
Comin home every night with lipstick on his shirt
She took it like a champ and let him do it
Until one day he really blew it
Rappin to girls one day by the dozen
And one of those girls was his girlfriend's cousin
He was so blind cause he was on a roll
Comin home drunk one night singin James Brown's soul
""Get up-a!"" bangin on the door he said
""Get up-a!"" and banged once more
So she opened the door with a smile on her face
Brung him to the bed, untied his shoe lace
Took off all his clothes and then she said
""Good night sucker"" - and burned the bed
So

So never in life think that you're too great
Cause it'svery thin line between love and hate
You see, he wasn't just burned, the boy was torched
Burned from head to toe and then so-and-so was scorched
He's with the same girl, now he's sincerer
She ain't worried about a thing cause he ain't goin nowhere
When I see him now I say ""yo bro""
Cause he's the darkest brother that I now know
No more Casanova, that life is over
He used to drink heavy, now he stays sober
She burned him bad, now he stays alert
But I know when they make love, brother, it hurts
You wouldn't think the girl would hurt a fly
But she proved that to be a goddamn lie
From what I recall, he gives her much respect
Point blank, word, she got him in check
So

Smile in my face until I'm gone, then be mad at me

One day I react and then it's slow like radiation
Cause suckers bite my cuts, they keep tracin
Me, fraudulatin, then pretend to be the best
I got hands like bombs and they inflict death
My complexion is cream, my ego won't break
And I don't get conceited to the point where my head inflates
So if you wanna battle me, don't get sloppy
Cause when I start cuttin - yo, you better stop me

(Wack dj's, he cut the mess out of you)

[Verse 2: Mixmaster Ice]
It's somethin about my tactic that makes my scratch kick
A lotta disc jockeys bluff but I react quick
Stay nimble, win battles by landslides
Can do a cut better than you with my hands tied
Behind my back, so hold your breath in
I'm expellin a rhyme within a fraction of a second
Jack of all trades, so label me a veteran
You know my crew by the utfo lettering
My voice box interlocks on any intercom
I only cut to build the biceps on my arm
My name is Mixmaster, deejays be aware
Because I treat my turntables like car ware

Ts... Balls - my cut is correct

Me from a amateuristic opponent
You wanna battle me? Ha-ha, postpone it!
You can't make what I innovate
The indicator will break if you record me on tape
And yo, I get with it, keep the needle on the pivot
Leader of the Pack, this title I fit it
Jack of all trades but cuttin is my hobby
So listen to the property, the structure and the body
And if you wanna battle me from lack of respect
Ha... Balls - my cut is correct

[Verse 4: Mixmaster Ice]
I can take a record apart, then put it back together

Lost to any cause, cause it's vital
Practiced and rehearsed to keep this title
I won't be categorized as mediocre
Temper with your psychee and then provoke ya
Runnin off your mouth and talkin crap to me
Is like puttin your dome between a guillotine
It's been that way since block-partyin
I mesmerize your mind, then work your body and
No time for profilin or ladi-dadi-in

I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow

I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?

But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You Kango, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high iq
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper md will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an? Electric camp? That wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But emd, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne. ""
She said ""How'd you know my name?""I said ""It's getting around.
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief. ""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated. ""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?""I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body. ""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date

Because they ask who are, we what are you new?
We're the double Ices on the rhyme, and on the cut
Stompin out suckers like cigarette butts
Swing it, Ice - To the left? Whatever side feels best
I gotta bust it, yo, bust it, and don't you fess
( *Doc starts beatboxing* )
Well it's time to get busy ??????
But stay away from girls that got the heebie-geebies
After this scratch then Ice'll conclude
Like my boy Doc would say: rock 'n roll, dude

Sekkle dread

[ Mix-Master Ice ]
Turn up the volume from the mid to the max
Cause Mix-Master Ice is back
When it come to cuts, most deejays are neglectin it
I'm resurrectin it, puttin a concept in it (say what?)
My hands are bombs, please don't try to detonate
I'm so def, you can't avoid acceptin it
Mix-Master, I can flip disaster
Not too many deejays I know can cut faster
Don't fraudulate, don't try to be a clone
Cause I'm a ninja and I break bones
I stand by myself, not beside myself
This obstacle's impossible for anyone else
So bring a record and watch me wreck it
It's copy-written, BMI-protected
The needle ain't feeble beside my hand
I emphasize my cuts cause I'm the band
So look in the mirror and you'll find out
That I'm one of a kind without no doubt
There's no connection in your profession
You don't have my eyes nor my complexion
Nothin can affect me, nothin can defect me
When I cut, I got my hands to protect me
Makin me a barricade, deejay's can't nah me fade
I'm so def, hah, my middle name is Razorblade"
Utfo,The Real Roxanne,/u/utfo/the+real+roxanne_20734309.html,"Yo kangol
(Yeah what's up girl)
I'm the real roxanne and I'll rock your world
(But you're all stuck up)
Well you say that
Cause I wouldn't give a guy like you no rap?

I was walking down the street in the afternoon
I gave you a smile so you assume
That if you said hello I would be flattered
But I kept on walking and your ego was shattered

I'm roxanne, the lady devastator
I'll make you feel hotter than it is in grenada
The are-o-x-a-n-n-e
Roxanne is who I be

And kangol kid ya might be cute
But you aint gettin this cause your much too... ?
You wear that samurai sword on the side
I told all my friends and we all just died
I laughed so hard that my face turned blue
Why be a M. C. You should learn how to kung foo.

And by the way if I'm such a crab
Why all your girls look like scabs
First you call me a peach
The doctor wants to take me to the beach
I got a little rhyme for ya each
I've seen your girls they both need a leash
Such bow wow babies I think they got rabies
You think you're touching me boy you must be crazy
You got your nerve to wanna be my man
They call me the real roxanne

[Chorus:]

Now educated rapper I'm gonna give you a fit
Cause when you tried to talk to me you was full of shit
You see the truth and the fact is that I don't need you
Your I. Q. Is really one point two

I don't like your rap cause your rap is dead
Educated rapper no sense in your head
So when you met me I paid you no mind
Dictionary breath you're one of a kind
You said your name was gary
Didn't choose to call you barry
Didn't care if your name was mother madda harry
I choose to call you sonny because you have a tummy
My fathers not a fairy you're the one who walks so funny
You're nose is always runny
You look like bugs bunny
All your raps are old ancient as a mummy
Your house is so scummy
Your clothes are so bummy
But now with your hit record all I want is your money
Educated rapper you aint nothing but a dummy
You try to be chummy or you plays gin rummy
I bet makin love to you must really be crummy
You say it's customary to give your commentary
I say it's crap you're full of strawberries.

Your rap is so weak and your face is so scary
You always find a rap like yours in any cemetary
So do you know you didn't even pass
All you recieved was a kick in the ass
That's what you get cause I've had enough
Aint that right mix master ice cream puff

[Chorus:]

When I heard this record I said who's the producers
A group named full force a bunch of losers
They're a singin group so how should they know
Putting out records with utfo
I'm what's happening I know that's a fact
So utfo... What's that?

Since I'm the new girl around the block
The kangol kid and especially doc
Would like to sleep with me if he can
But you're just a boy you're not even a man
The girls know your name, it's getting around
Doctor Ice you're the laugh of the town
You tried to throw a game
But it wasn't working out
You lied about the beach
You took me to your house
I said me the rox, give up the box
So you could brag about it for the next 6 blocks?
Shee you must be crazy, you're goin to fast
Doctor I don't know where your hands been last
You can't fool me cause I'll be mean
You're a hood, a crook, a liar, a thief
I know how you operate from the start
You like to breakdance and you like to break hearts
So listen up cause I don't say this everyday
Ho girl... ?
The only operating that you do
Is ripping off cars in a minute or two
You stole every last cadillac
Sold it back and kept the hubcaps

You are the one you thought you had me roped
But you hung yourself with your own stethoscope
You said ""oooh"" now what the hell was that
Your voice ran high now it sounds real whacked
You call me at 9 to arrange a date
I said meet me at the beach and don't be late
(So did you meet him at the beach?)
Hells no, in the middle of december when it's 20 below
I'm the real...

[Chorus:]

Wheres the beat you guys can't deal it
I need a man who can make me feel it"
Utfo,The Ride,/u/utfo/the+ride_20304176.html,"[ *car crashes* ]

You wanna ride?

[ *engine starting up* ]

I got a ride

Hey girl, just imagine me and you, along the road
Switchin from silent gear to a moany mode
All you gonna hear is [ *scratching* ] that's the motor, of course
(But don't let it get hot, or you'll feel the force
Hello, my name is Kangol Kid (You can call him Kangol, if you choose)
I'm Dr. Ice (How can you tell?) You can tell by the mous'
And I'm the Educated Rapper (The brainiac
And Mixmaster) woo-hah (The four is back)
Individually speakin, though I'm speakin for the crew
We all have rides, I hope you fellas do too
Mine is very powerful, yes, this is true
Mine can do tricks (What can yours do?)
Mine won't disagree with me, it's never frontin
All I gotta say is: ""Yo, let's go skeezer huntin!""
After those command my ride will stand
Taller and prouder than any man
Crashin through vicious, on wet roads even
In other words, it's (Skeezin season!)
And brakes of course for my protection
So I don't waste my fuel injection
I'm makin it clear, the way I steer
I'll reach my destination - (Ah, I'm here)

I got a ride

I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I wanna die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You wanna know why? Well, because...

It only takes one passenger when it's hot
Unless I wanna share it, okay, why not?
Just imagine a volcano when it's bound to erupt
(You wanna ride?) Come on girl, hurry up
Tell your mother where you're goin, and don't forget
If your mother wanna come, tell your pops: ""Don't fret""
If he wants you home soon, tell him that's insane
(And if he says: ""Picture that"") consider it framed
(I got a ride) As if you didn't know
And if I catch a flat, girl, give me a blow
Cause I don't carry spares, cause spares, they cost
And plus my nuts are too hard to come off
(You dig it?)
You see, my ride is not a stretch-limo Cadillac
To tell the truth, I think my ride is much longer than that
So if you ever see my ride, girl, face to face
I doubt that it'll fit in your parking space
But I'll (push) if you wanna (push) if I gotta
And we can even (push) for the hell, why nada?
It's lovable and huggable and bendable
I won't sell it to ya, baby, but it's rentable
And if you're wonderin why, I'll tell you what for
(They don't make rides like this no more)

I got a ride

I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I wanna die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You wanna know why? Well, because...

You see my ride
A lotta fuel you give it, premium or regular
Any kind of fluid from a female etcetera
Four-wheel drive, so I can get there in a giffy
And turbo-jogs in case I'm lookin for a quickie
But the tighter the roads, the harder I'll pursue
And my goal in my life with my ride is to shoot
For the finish line, so I can get there quick
Ask Bobby, Jimmy, Jack, or you can even ask (Dick)
You can even ask my mechanic
When she saw my ride, she didn't panic
You see, I got garages all over these parts
So I can park the ride whenever it gets dark
I got a sunroof, so wide, you can't miss it
Before I stick my head out, I gotta unzip it
Hey yo, I never got a ticket, if I do one day
They'll have a hard time towin this baby away

I got a ride"

Because I need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You cold wanna be with me
Because you need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You wanna be with me?
Because I need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You cold wanna be with me
Because you need someone to be with, someone to talk to

[ Doctor Ice ]
Because the way I live nowadays
People are different, they act real funny towards me
They say, I think, I'm nice
Why, because I'm makin records? But I'm still the same Doctor Ice
[ Educated Rapper ]
The same with me, they make me laugh
People gettin jealous (cause we be signin autographs)
I try to figure it out, no doubt
(But the way things are goin) I'm ready to jet out
[ Kangol Kid ]
Word, gettin a girl is hard, it ain't funny
Kangol don't know if she want me or my money
So I'm bein picky, cause I ain't sure
And I'm livin a life you might call insecure
[ Doctor Ice ]
I want a nice individualistic that's not materialistic
Not bein egotistic, ???I decide consentualistic???
The body artistic, a little bit of lipstick
Those the type of girls that make the Doc lovesick
[ Kangol Kid ]
Well, I'm definitely a lover, hard when I'm undercover
I'll do kinky things to you if you swear not to tell your mother
I'll push, but I won't shove ya, as long as I'm above ya
When I leave just promise me, ""Kangol ???? I love ya""
[ Educated Rapper ]
I want a girl with action, 'control' like Janet Jackson
I hate the dark, I'm on the light so I can see reaction
Against all relaxin, prepare for steady waxin
When you leave you must pay E - for what? - satisfaction

[ CHORUS ]

[ Doctor Ice ]
Tired of these girls tryin to play the role
Everytime I see em, they're on a stroll
Teasin the fellas, wearin tight pants
Leadin us on after a slow dance
But in search of love that's how I'm livin
I want a girl to give me the same thing that I am givin
To her, from now till the day I depart
But she's got to be a redbone, a beautiful work of art
That is the way this pisces views
Like Gigi Williams on the Eye-Witness News
I hate a girl that knows every guy
Before you introduce, he already says hi
I feel like punchin her dead in the grill
But that's ill, so Doc just chills
Cause if it's meant to happen, that's how it'll be
Sooner or later you'll cold be with me
[ Educated Rapper ]
She wants to be with me and I know this for sure
I can tell as soon as she walks through the door
Swings and sways and shakes her stuff like Jello
Waitin for EMD to say hello
Skin-tight clothing with everything left hangin
And all the boys admit that she's well worth bangin
She only talks the talk, never walks the walk
She must be the most ???? up in all New York
Acts like an angel, pretends that she's a saint
A least that's the pretty picture she would love to paint
She's extraordinary, definitely rare
And anyway you want me, baby, I'll be there
I make you feel ??protect??, fill you with bliss
??Send a chill up?? your body with just one kiss
But if you don't show, I won't be stunned
Give your mother my number, I know she'll come

[ CHORUS ]

[ Kangol Kid ]
I want a girl that'll turn me on
When I say 'go', I wanna hear her say 'gone'
When I say 'leave', I wanna hear her say 'left'
And if I say 'was it good', she better say 'def'
Cause that's the kinda girl that I am lookin for
I really don't think there are anymore
But if one appears one day
I walk up to her and gently say
[ *starts singing* ]
I've been starin at you a while
And everytime you see me starin you crack a smile
You cold wanna be with me, it's true
If you didn't, I wouldn't be next to you
So please stop perpetrating
Girl, I'm tired of waiting
For you to hurry up and make your so-called move
That you been talkin about makin, girl, show and prove
There's really no need to talk about it
You know what I want, so what about it?
We can either go fast or slow
Cause I'll be in and out before you know
You say you're resisting
But yet you're still kissing
Everybody know that I been wantin you to kiss
Hey girl, here's a spot you missed

So cold"

You blew my mind like noone of the human kind
You were the only one I could ever speak
This secret language between us and the sheets

You made my mind and body so hot
You sent this wild child into a lady by night
And when I met you long ago I was so alone
My heart was beating so fast I had to write this song
And it goes

You make me feel so beautiful
It's like the sun is always shining when you are in control
You are my Mr. Mystery and
There's no way I can explain the way that you make me feel

Late night lovin' on your balcony
I'm feelin' lovely at the knees who thought that would be me
You lift me up to where I wanna be
You make everything so clear I can finally see

You are the one that I always thinkin' bout
My first love that I made this song about
You know me well and you always make me feel
Like I'm the one and I know your love is real

I love it when you whisper in my ear
You say the sweetest things that I wanted to hear
I never though I could feel this way
And when I leave you in the morning I think of you all day

I feel so peaceful after we make love
I'll lay with you forever just like the sweetest drug
And the whole worlds around us stops and stares
It feels so good to fall asleep knowing that you are there
Come on

You make me feel so beautiful
It's like the sun is always shining when you are in control
You are my Mr. Mystery and
There's no way I can explain the way that you make me feel
And when you left me out this day
I though you will come back anyway
Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?

But that's okay I ain't gonna fall
I gotta get up and roll that's the way you want it
And I won't help it
I'm off to search new love with my chance I might find better
I can make sure you will only bitter
And with the time you don't have to say it
Damn I wonder why I broke up with that fuckin' chick
Now we're wasting all of this time lookin' for girls to hit

You are the one that I always thinkin' bout
My first love that I made this song about
You know me well and you always make me feel
Like I'm the one and I know your love is real

I'm so alone,
I can't get her phone,
I can't call her back and ask her to take me back
Girl: Hello?
Guy: It's, it's me
Girl: Yea so?
Guy: I made a huge mistake
Girl: Uh huh yea you did

Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?,

No boss on my shoulders to check how I'm doing

For me to clarify a few things
I never claim to be an artist
I can't even sing, you know?
Everything happened so fast
And I never knew I could get used to it
Now I'm kinda trapped and the sun keeps shining (oh)
The stakes are so high, you know
Am I worth it all?
Do you believe in me?

They say love lasts three years
In three years I've seen a lot
All those countries by your side
Now this time is all behind
Sharing joy and burst in tears
Even to record make me burst in tears
Boring days, freaky nights
So many people could see us live
We just started up for fun
On a mission, you know the song
You and me, just as one
Few years later I'm all alone

Oh I would like to let the music tell you you been wrong
That's our song
And baby, one day
You will compile the everything on me
To let you stay
To let you stay

Write me this, sing me that
Love is the essence of all our tracks
Now it's gone and stakes is high
I am double under depths in lies
I'm a lost child, don't you see
Taking advantage of this industry
I look good, you want me
Buy my cd and google me
You work hard, I live sweet
End of the week, we gonna make the beat

Oh I would like to let the music tell you you been wrong
That's our song
And baby, one day
You will compile the everything on me
To let you stay

As far as my record sells
Feeling the quell on my name
All the tickets gonna sell
To my fans, I might look like the girl they want to be
To my friends, I'm this child, they are taking care of me
See I never turned too bad
All these tunes they sound so whack
All the fame, all the trash
I just want to make some cash
In the clan they chew you up
In the playing, that's for sure
On my way to somewhere else
It sometimes feels like I'm for sale"

And the boys on my back
On my back

Okay so um, where to park the cadillac
It has to be green
Green cadillac on the left side
Get all set, the stage
A alright
Now we're gonna need to train monkeys
Can we train 'em to mix
So we can maybe get the audience to finish the track
Can you do that
Do they work
Anyway, how many monkeys do we have
Is it a few monkeys like a michael jackson video
Do they have like clothes on and shit
Maybe get them sailor costumes
That's what I need

Making sad money
Take it all from me
I'll be getting paid again on Monday morning

I wish I had a falsetto just like Swae Lee
I wish I never found out about Gucci
I wish I knew the best things in life are free
I wish that I could get off this merry-go-round
I wish that I could afford to buy a brand new house
I wish that I didn't have to grow up at all

Making sad money
Take it all from me
I'll be getting paid again on Monday morning
Making sad money
Take it all from me
Blow it all just to feel like someone else

I'll be pretty 'til it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
Say ""I'm sorry"" to my future self
I'll be pretty 'til it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
I just want to feel like someone else

[Verse 2]
Pinky out, working my fingers to the bone
Working everyday just to sell my soul
Why's it got to be like that?
I know I'm not the only one
But spending money's so much fun
Why's it got to be like that?

Take it all from me
Blow it all just to feel like someone else

Let me tell you what I do when my day is over.
After picking the right clothes for about an hour.
Oooh, I'm turning orange from all the carats around my neck.
Tonight, I'm takin' out the bling and I'm dressed to impress.

I'm gettin' ready for my night out on the town.
I'm lookin' hot cause you know we are holdin' it down.
Rockin' high-tops and sayin' no to stilettos.
Cause I might get drunk off my ass and I don't wanna fall.

Out on the streets all the taxis are showin' me love.
Cause I'm shinin' like a princess, in the middle of thugs.
And at the clubs, the bouncers recognize my face.
So while your waiting in the line, we just enter the place.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

I'm callin' all my ladies at the table of 3.
Throwin' back a couple bottles and the tabs on me.
I been waitin' to get crazzzy.

Table dancin, smashin glasses, it's nice to get naughty.
Now we all ready to head out of the vip.
I'm lookin' good and I can feel that all eyes are on me.
It's time to show how em how we do on the floor.

So while my dj play the track I want my girls on the floor.

Now you know I made an anthem for all my hot chicks.
And I ain't about how we girls are raisin' your dicks.
I got the surround sound so why ya wanna see me fall?
I'm just tryin' to have a blast and I ain't takin' your call.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

You and me, c'mon let's take it to the next level.
Let's all go to the hotel pool as we finish the bottle.
Maybe kiss and don't tell, it's the rule around here.
You must have put me under a spell I lose control when your near.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Why be stopped?
We used to go all out, all out, out like mardigras
It don't seem like love
It don't seem like love to me
But I'm missin' you, that's all I know

Making love all day, all day, rosé bottle pop
Hoping for a replay, replay, replay, wind the clock
If it's not too much
You could make some time to see
'Cause I'm missin' you that's all I know

Min smärta är begraven för att alltid glömmas bort.

Jag brinner av en längtan, men min eld den är för svag.
Jag borde vetat bättre än att ensam slå mitt slag.
Jag blundat för det dolda.
Och gömt undan mina spår.
Men hur jag än försöker står jag stilla där jag står.

Om modet I mig sviktar.
Och rösten inte bär.
Så ställ er vid min sida vi ska samlas till vår här.
Jag brinner av en längtan, men min eld den är för svag.
För tillsammans vid min styrka som ger kraft till våra slag.

Jag har ondskan I mitt inre.
Jag tar ondskan I försvar.
För så länge som jag blundar, har den mig I sitt förvar.
Om modet I mig sviktar att inte rösten längre bär.
Så ställ er vid min sida så vi inte slits isär.

I mitt inre brinner ångesten, har levt mitt liv I skuld.
Genom lögner har jag älskat.
Har alltid älskat guld.
Det blir min mentala stämgud, men ondskan är min vän.
För så länge som jag blundar finns vägen för mig hem.

Why your world could go so wrong?

Refr:

You've got one eye open
While the other's still shut tight.
Take a look before you, 
To my knowledge you seem blind.

You've got one eye open, 
Staring one-eyed being blind.
Take a look or just ignore us, 
We're gonna get you from behind from behind

You claim the brand call clever, 
But to earn it you must be; 
The watcher looking all ways, don't you see.
While dark clouds drawing nearer
I can feel the fright in you, 
Afraid of what your eyes might show you true.

Alone you sit and ponder, alone you sit and stare.
Up above the minder I see your one eye glare.
The eye shut blind look inwards, admiring none but you.
Will you ever look for both sides, will you ever look what's new?"

For this he can't remember making way. All his fighting. All his life

And I hate that morning in their song
But if we sing up loud And stand up strong and proud.
Then that morning never will come

What we've got is not so much, but still it's what we got.

Lägga mig tidigt och sova
Ring inte mer är du snäll
Och det, det måste jag lova
Men ingenting kunde hindra mig
Jag måste ut ikväll

Med en bil av senaste modell

Och kromen blixtra I dess nos

Uti den gröna vår
Men tårar henne följt alltsen vi for

Jag minns den frukt hon gav mig
Från en apel utanför;
Ett frö som hon bar med sig hemifrån
Det vårdträd som hon vaktat
Nu växt och burit frukt
Den skörden blev min sorg och hennes slut

Svag och blek; en viskning:
Är jag kommen hem igen?
Så går hon bort min älskling och reser åter hem
Ett leende av lycka:
Jag är hemmavid igen
Så far hon bort min älskling och får ro

Över havet gick vår resa
Här I väster fanns vårt mål
Jag kunde inte ana
Hennes lidande och kval
Jag trodde allt blir bättre
Tiden läker alla sår
Säkert står hon leende en dag

Jag sett hon stått vid stranden
Med blick I fjärran fäst
Hur tårar utav längtan
Stal all kraft ut hennes bröst
Men ej hjärtat hastigt brister
När så saknad sakta tär
Ett hjärta blöder sakta, tynar bort

Och Vasa resta vapen då folket illa led.

Se tiderna förändras, se karg och dyster dag.
Däare hunger, nöd och bråd död blott lyder egen lag.
Men den vagga vyssat hjältar, härdat hud och vilja hård.
Givit luft och liv åt hjältar, mod och kraft att framåt gå.

Ve den bleke veke ledaren som ej ser till folkets väl.
Ve den falskhet, ve den tunga drucken slapp på folkets vin.
Med vishet må dock ordet på våldet lägga band,
Och finns nya stigar däare hjältar kliver fram."

A crucifix on the top
And an ant walked
Along the edge of his book
He heard another bell
And a braying mustache (?)
And a moped started up
Sounding like a chainsaw
Of tiny firecrackers
And he smelled tire again
A fly came dim
Along the shaft of sunlight
Coming through the open door
He watched it cross the room
And get halfway and then it
Turned around and left, he laughed

There is one bird in my house"

In the garden of the world
But a flame arrives to guide us;
Past the gold between the angles of the stars
Watch you over all the children in the rain;
And the streets where I remember
Where the fire that lights a candle soars again;
A flaring flame
Hear it call;
Through the darkness
Hear it call to us all
And start again;
Its beating heart
Comes again

When the light dries all the fields
And the joy drives out our pain
And the nations come to greet us
Waving molten loaves and waves of golden corn

May your light be ever near us
Always heal us from the dark that we may fall

There is no moon-in-the-water.
And likewise when there is no moon.
But when the moon rises, the water does not wait to
Receive it's image, and even when the tiniest drop of
Water is poured out, the moon does not wait to cast it's reflection.

Past is already past. The future's not yet here.
Things are constantly changing

For the moon does not intend to cast it's reflection,
And the water does not receive it's image on purpose.

And as the water manifests the brightness of the moon,
The moon manisfests the clarity of the water."

And I wonder for how long do I have to wait for someone to caress?

And there's noone around that I want to be mine, to be mine.

And Ever Since the rain fell on my lonely heart
I realize that there's no cure for love.
And ever since the wind blew through my tiny soul I wonder who will
I be dreaming of?
Be dreaming of.

Just another day, feeling just the same
Because someone put out my only flame.
And I know by now that all clich?,
They have a meaning in this empty space.

I try to concentrate and sort out who I need.
But noone's there to fill the heart that I must feed.
That I must feed.

Ever since the rain fell from the skies
Of hope my eyes are filled with tears that
Soon will flow.
And ever since the wind blew thru my tiny soul.
I realize the way that I must go.

And I found a way to follow.
It led me to another view.
Love had found a clue.

Somewhere down the lonely road she came passing by.
I no longer feel the rain falling from the sky.
Now I'm king and she's my queen.
We have gained the throne.
Now the fields are evergreen.
My heart is not alone.

Now the rain has gone away and the sky is clear and blue.
The sun's been shining since the day, the day that I found you.
You're the meaning of my life, the one that makes me sign.
Since the day you dried my heart.
You are everything!"

I'm living just for living's sake.
Falling apart like a puzzle in a storm.
The fire so bright that used to keep me warm it doesn't
Even glow. The ashes and the ground will soon unite
And then the stars will be my only light.
Reminding me of glorious days upon the seven seas.
But the memories are bound to fade to grey, to fade
Away.

The night will come and take me home to where my heart
Belongs. Dreaming of the waves that could ease my
Pain and to hear a seabird song. Oh God it is so hard
To defy my agae but I wish that you can see that I live to
See the harbour and the seaweed again and let the
Might oceans bury me.
No I won't open up my eyes until I'm where I wanna
Be. And the voice of the horizon It spoke unto me.
-I will set you free!

Leave me alone, let me die in solitude.
I am withering away like a water-lily, my bitter soul is
Nude.
Disorder on the ship, it's mutiny. My sadened heart
Will walk the plank, toward my destiny.

I am I just hiding again?
I am I just hiding again?
If you can see through all the lies,
I'll always be here, but in my fantasies
I am someone else.
I am I just hiding again?
I am I just hiding again?
And I know reality will always be here
To remind me that there's no answer.

And I know reality will always be here
To remind me that I am someone else.

Stranded, but there's an ocean in my heart.
I am just the one man, and I was born to
Face the truth. Standing at the point of no
Return. I see the fire heading for my bridge to burn.
Well you've never laid hands on another man
Although you love to see them drown.
You can never escape don't you understand that
I will be around, around, wherever you hide."

Messenger of fear and pain, messenger of time.

I stand on a wave in time,
Always searching for the clouded space.

And I'm never gonna be the same again,
Never gonna be the same again.

Caught within a spell.

Dreaming dreams of hell.

Do they remind you of how small we are?
We the people of the planet earth,
We cannot rule the universe.

But my love is bigger than all those things.
It makes me feel like I'm the king of kings.
When I see your hair blowing in the wind.
I close my eyes and I can hear you sing:

My heart belongs to you, my soul if you want it too.
But when I open up my eyes, it's like a
Big black hole in my heart that cries.

Because in every word you say
And every time I pray there is a wire bursting deep inside of me.
And everytime I read the words that you have seed
There is a fire burning deep inside of me.

Have you ever felt that you need someone
And you cannot breathe without her around.
I need her now so I can breathe again, it's
Been a lack of air for so long my friend.

In my dreams I see how she comes to me.
Oh, how I wish they were reality.
No other girl in the whole wide world can
Fill up the hole that she's made in me.

I can see the rain hit the window.
Outside I can hear the wind blow.
There's more water in my eyes, than
The rain that falls from the clouded sky.

Because in every word you say...

I, the king of kings, I fly with broken wings.
And I can feel and I can hear, what the future brings."

You have decided to leave and it hurts
Because I'm still in love with you.
You can never imagine the pain that I feel.
Tears will never stop falling from my eyes.
There is no tomorrow. No future for me. It
Feels like I want to die.

Just to make things up to me. Tell God I am
Coming home. Jost to prove it wasn't only me
Tell God I'm coming home, tell God I'm coming home.

I still remember the days.
How you held me in your arms when I cried.
Why can't you feel the same??
Why has everything faded and died??
You can never imagine the pain that I feel.
Tears will never stop falling from my eyes.
There is no tomorrow. No future for me. It feels
Like I want to die.

Why is there a world? Why am I alive?
Why is life so rough? Why do I try?
Take me a place where pain is denied
And tell me once again why have I tried.
Just to make things up to me, tell God I'm coming home.
Just to prove it wasn't only me, tell God I'm coming
Home.
Nother here is what it used to be, so tell God I'm
Coming home, tell God I'm coming home.

If a millionaire spends all his money. He still got a life
To live.
But if you're walking out on me honey.
I don't think I've got anything more to give.
It feels like you've flushed me down the drain. And I'll
Suffer for years and years.
You offered me so much pain. How deep is the sea of
Tears??"

Her grace will sell a million magazines
She's so obscene
And she's always entertaining
The boys are rising up to meet the queen
She's so lovely to me

Yeah

[Chorus]
Hypnotize, fantasize
Everybody knows
She got everything that she wanted
Hypnotize, fantasize
Everybody knows
She is everything that I wanted
Hypnotize, fantasize, you're hypnotized

Mother sits in waiting
For the letter that her little girl will write
She opens up the envelope
She's fighting back the tear drops from her eyes

She's everybody's girl
Her grace will sell a million magazines
She's so obscene
And she's always entertaining
The boys are lining up to view the queen
She's still lovely to me

Yeah

[Chorus]

(Everybody wants her, everybody needs her)
(Everybody loves her, everybody fucks her)
(Everybody wants her, everybody needs her)
(Everybody loves her, everybody fucks her)
(Everybody wants her, everybody needs her)
(Everybody loves her, everybody fucks her)

Hypnotize, fantasize
Everybody knows
She got everything that she wanted
Hypnotize, fantasize
Everybody knows
I got everything that I wanted
Oh, oh
Hypnotize, fantasize
Everybody knows
She got everything that she wanted
Hypnotize, fantasize
Hypnotize, fantasize
Hypnotize, fantasize
Hypnotize"
Union,I Wanna Be,/u/union/i+wanna+be_21492501.html,"Sometimes you know the words don't come too easy
Sometimes you feel alone and blind
You're walking in the dark
Somebody comes and gives you words of comfort from the heart
And you know that we've all had complications
Wrong roads where you feel you're lost and won't get very far
Somebody comes and gives you some direction and a start

[Chorus]
And I want to be the sound that rings in your ears
And I want to be your candle in the dark
And I want to be the hands that bring you back here

I want to be the one you see
I want to be the one you need

Your eyes have seen some things you don't believe in
Sometimes you feel disgust
No faith, should you just fade away
Somebody tells you hold your ground
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]

I want to see you, I want to touch you
I want to feel you, I want to be there if you

[Chorus]

I want to, I need you, I want you to know

I want to be the one you see
I want to be the one you need"

Music/ Lyrics&#58; Carlos Santana & Chris Solberg

Lyrics
Sufferin’ night and day
People all around me crying
Enough--what’s the use
We don’t even feel like trying
Hatred, doubt, and fear
It’s not the way toward the solution
There must be a way
To be free from all illusion

Love
Oh, love
All we need is love

History loudly claims
That we never learn our lesson
We kill one another
We put the blame on greed and passion
Wise men calmly say
Every man shall reach perfection
If we help each other
We will reach our destination

Love
Oh, love
All we need is love

Repeat chorus once more"

I guess its time as the sun shines through the dawn 
Another night is gone 
Seems like days since I saw her face 
In her place no trace of yesterday 
Yeah  but that's okay 
If she never comes back  it'll be too soon 
I'm doin' just fine just me 
And the man in the moon 

Well all in all it ain't a bad change 
I like it alone 'cause no one ever complains 
I don't confuse the names 
I heard about love is blind 
Well I found lying times and true deceit 
The way she uses me 
The air so think it feels like June 
I'm doin' fine just me 
And the man in the moon 

If she never comes back, it'll be too soon 
I'm singin' my song to the man in the moon 

Once in a while you can catch me smile 
With time to burn I turn the music on 
I play my favorite song 
All in all it ain't a bad change 
I like it alone 'cause no one ever complains 
I don't confuse the names 
I remember her face when I hear that tune 
I'm doin' fine just me 
And the man in the moon"

The seasons come and then they wither like a dying rose
My pain is measured by a sky that's old and gray
A misty morning I awoke to find it's much too late
Pieces of time they keep falling down on me

It won't be long I can hear your song, October morning wind
I keep holding on to the fading sun, 'till you come back again

The sun is hiding once again it's warmth is like a long lost friend
Pictures fading in my mind memories of a young boy's life
The weeping willow by the lake where we could run and play
Lost all its magic it's become a ghost in time
The seasons came and they left me, tell me where'd they go
Pieces of my life they keep falling down on me

You live, you laugh
But I see through your disguise
I know, you hear
My conscience in your mind
You bleed, I die
I always feel the pain behind your eyes

Another friend has come and left you
It's getting hard to recognize the truth
I know so every time they lie to you
I read between the lines
The smile that's on your face is just a show

You run, you hide
But I know right where you are

I can't stand this pain without you
Did somebody steal your heart away?
Do you love without me, cry without me
Do you feel this pain that I feel
You're the only one to mend my heart

Everybody give a smile and says to let you go
I don't know if I can be that strong
When you calls me on the phone it hurts to say goodbye

And all your gold won't wash away their fears

Stop sleeping your life away

Blew the video. Ras Kass
Organized rhymes, nigga
Listen

[Verse 1: Ras Kass]

I got the currier for thug passion, picture that, the atomic core
Black and wrist, with the crack get the gat.
If I plob more pressure my wrist gets snappy
Groupies get the bozack
Snake niggaz I'm gonna get your ass back, like your ass crack
Shit lowjack and you know that
I ain't never bout wit down nigga
Act crowback, round up, flip flap back wit more drama
Life is six figures, double niggaz wit babies mommas
You know this cat, and if not get the million wit butterflies
Mc's live like catterpilla (pilla)
Beyond some dreams, smoke fuckin get paid
Every thing I shave your blades, wit the same drawers
For three days, and run relays, all up in your pj's
Like I'm from there, where my chronic smokin crew
Hit trees like Sonny and Cher, I came to kick ass
And drink Heineken, so unfortunately I'm almost out of beer
Some say my attitude is fucked up and real crummy
Since I come from the state where it's always sunny
Ha ha ha ha ha, I had to find that funny, so I said:
No child, I work hoes for the money

[Chorus: Ras Kass and K. Born:]

So many days, so many nights.
So many mics blown.
So many ways to die, so many strive.
So many days, so many nights.
So many mics blown.
So many ways to die, so many try.

[Verse 2: K. Born]

How you do that there?
Tellin practically movin mc's, like keys and no C's, please
Fuck the trees, my senses provide the photosynthesis
I got my front and my back, like prevysesis
So tell me who this niggaz think they intimidated
I ain't havin none of that shit that bein constipated
My pants still gon sag on flat ends. Still gonna have cat ends
And I'm still on critically,
The queen of central corner vaugh matches lyrically
So what I'm tryin to say, is y'all ain't fuckin wit me (true)
I am goin to heaven for the weather, and inhale for the company
Once before the icore. Switch my soft war
Release the rugged more, wit the mark of the beast
Fuck a bitch in the mouth, but then pussy gets infected wit gees
Gotti John the Baptist (Who wanna get wet)
You know your mark. Get ready, get set, and lets start a revolution
Yo. Niggaz wiggin out like Whitney Houston
You feel me? I do shit

Fading pictures of wrong and right, my signature is written with your sage

Can you tell me what it means
Searching for my tangerine
I can't fine my tangerine

Holy water bag of mojo, cross my fingers say a prayer
Burn the incense kissing sunshine, tie a feather in your hair
It can't be what it wants to be, I close my eyes and see right through the end
I hear the words screaming in my head, the melody is flowing from my pen

You’re wondering if I’m insane
But you’re still listening, so I’m in okay

Is bad intentions what I have in mind?
You won't notice, it would be the perfect crime
Don't come back, as far as I can see
Say nothing, and the secret’s safe with me

You were willing for about a century
He doesn’t notice you, that’s why you notice me
It's not a question of leading you astray
More a matter of meeting you halfway
Why fight it, where’s the catch?
There's no strings attached

Just getting away with you, it feels so right
You love it, it will be the perfect crime
No victim, cause no one’s getting hurt
There’ll be no answer if you never breathe a word
Not a word, breathe a single word

Bad intentions, what I have in mind
You won't notice, it would be the perfect crime
Don't come back, as far as I can see
Say nothing and the secret’s safe with me

You write the books and then you tell me how to read
So quick to cut me down and then you tell me how to bleed

Om du vill leka en stund
Så finns jag här bara för dig
Kom och visa mig vad du vill

Runt ditt hus

Med dig vid min sida ser allt bättre ut
Låt oss göra något som vi kommer ihåg

Du är mitt liv

Jag har inga kläder som passar mig nu
Det enda som passar på mig det är du

Storstaden skller I ett spektrum av ljus
Knner du pulsen?
Du lyfter armarna mot skyn
Dina gon glittrar vrlden knns som ny
Jag gr nerfr gatan
Jag knner mig het
Asfalten brinner under mina skor
Alla dessa ansikten som are p vg
En del verkar s ngsliga
En del verkar tillfreds
Efter regnet kommer solen
I ett solregn kommer du
Under tiden som vi lskar
Flyter vi fram p livets flod
Nr jag str hr I ljuset
Ja, d vet jag vem jag are
Ett barn av modern tid
Som frsker dansa och le
Ett ansikte I mngden
Bilar far och kroppar rusar omkring
Nr jag flyger genom stan
Jag hatar och lskar civilisationen
Den frpestar och frgr
Den charmar och frfr
Efter regnet kommer solen
I ett solregn kommer du
Under tiden som vi lskar
Flyter vi fram p livets flod
Jag har inte kontrollen
Jag kan inte ens byta kanal
Jag har inte kontrollen
Efter regnet kommer solen
I ett solregn kommer du
Under tiden som vi lskar
Flyter vi fram p livets flod
Efter regnet kommer solen
I ett solregn kommer du

Som honung I min mun smakar dina lena kyssar
Jag har inte kontrollen
Jag kan inte ens byta kanal
Jag har inte kontrollen"

Det kan vara så enkelt, det kan vara så naivt.
Ett ord som löser en gåta, en famn att försvinna I.
Ja, det kan vara så simpelt som en sydlig vind,
Som föare med sig dofter och minnen som väcker det jag glömt.

En värld utan kärlek,

En värld utan kärlek,

Likgiltighet föder ingenting,
Den stjäl allt syre som finns runtomkring.
Vad vore en blomma utan värme och ljus?
Vad vore våare kärlek?
Man kan inte känna om man aldrig har känt,
Två lyckliga armar som aldrig sviker.
Man kan inte veta om man aldrig har hört,
Dom självklara orden av värme och tröst.
Jag kan inte be dig att älska mig,
Jag kan bara hoppas och tro på dig.
Föare detta vårt under äare det enda vi har,
Jag vet att du känner precis som jag.

Ja, jag vet nu att det finns så mycket mer
Som mina ögon inte kan se
Häare finns ingen rädsla, ingen bitterhet
Doften av frihet ger mig strykan tillbaks
Och min ande äare fri
Jag skall låta mina fötter trampa en ny stig
En helt ny stig

Det äare tid att gå vidare
- det äare tid att börja om
Det äare tid att gå vidare
- det äare tid att börja om
Det äare tid att gå vidare...

Den saknad jag kände förut äare bara ett minne nu

Det äare tid att gå vidare
- det äare tid att börja om"
Uno Svenningsson,Tiden är Mogen,/u/uno+svenningsson/tiden+r+mogen_20313397.html,"Vänta inte längre min vän
Lyssna på vinden ifrån norr
Det stora mörkret är på väg igen
Som gudarna spådde en gång
Den gamle mannen lyfte min hand
Och gav mig en skimrande sten
Den här skall du alltid bära runt din hals
Den ger dig styrka på din väg

Tiden är mogen
Ge dig av
Portarna i norr finns inte kvar
Tiden är mogen
Ge dig av
Den vita örnen kan ge oss svar

Jag vaknade upp ur min febriga dröm
Mina lakan var våta och jag frös
Jag gick upp och såg mig i spegeln
Där skimrade en honungsfärgad sten
Eldarna släcktes på bergen
Och nån blåste i sitt horn
Ljudet skar natten i bitar
Och jag hörde den gamles ord

Tiden är mogen
Ge dig av
Portarna i norr finns inte kvar
Tiden är mogen
Ge dig av
Den vita örnen kan ge oss svar

Jag vadade ut mot facklorna
Som prydde den båt jag skulle ta
Ovanför mig seglade den vita örnen
Och bakom mig brann allt som på ett bål

Tiden är mogen
Ge dig av
Portarna i norr finns inte kvar
Tiden är mogen
Ge dig av
Den vita örnen kan ge oss svar"
Uno Svenningsson,Till Fjärran Land,/u/uno+svenningsson/till+fjrran+land_20318932.html,"Livet äare fullt
Av saker att förtränga
Jag sökte vägar och utvägar
Men nu äare dom slut

Gatorna häare
Har trampats föare många gånger
Så stor äare världen
Så liten känner jag mig

Våra tysta ord faller
Som tårar I regn
Söta lycka, du äare ett måste
Vi fåare låta tärningen rulla igen
Och näare jag ser I dina blå

Kom, ja, kom följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Däare solen ståare högt
Ja, vi reser till fjärran land

Nån sa att dagen äare din om du tar den
Det äare bara du som kan göra något av den
Jag har förstått jag kan aldrig fly från mig själv
Men jag kan se mig I ett annat sammanhang
Jag kan bära min osäkerhet näare jag talat med dig
I dina vackra ögon försvinner min verklighet
Som en förlorad I en förlorad värld

Kom, ja, kom följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Däare solen ståare högt
Och tanken äare lätt som ett moln
Ja, kom, kom, följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Däare solen ståare högt
Och våra hjärtan sätts I brand

Näare jag ser på mig själv
Ser jag en man I andras kläder
I ett färglöst land däare allt ser ut att stå still
Så nu tar jag mina drömmar
Och göare dom till verklighet
Till en plats däare jag kan glömma
Till mitt eget paradis
Det äare den jag äare

Kom, ja, kom följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Däare solen ståare högt
Och tanken äare lätt som ett moln
Ja, kom, kom, följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Däare solen ståare högt
Och våra hjärtan sätts I brand

Kom, kom, följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Kom, kom, följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Kom, kom, följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land
Kom, kom, följ med mig
Vi reser till fjärran land"

Världen finns inte längre
Bara clownen mittemot
I detta spegelhus finner jag mig lustig
Ett böljande skratt
Tömmer alla sorger

Vågorna gungar mig
Under bar himmel seglar jag
Händer som gungar mig
Jag har hela världen under mig snart
Vågorna gungar mig mot det lugn jag vill ha

Jag tänker tillbaka
På alla stunder jag haft
Vid mästarens sida I närhet av vänner
Och allt som har gjort mig till den jag äare
Jag äare aldrig ensam
Aldrig utan kraft
Med solen I ryggen och vinden som viskar
Äare jag en del av alla livets färger

Vågorna gungar mig
Under bar himmel seglar jag
Händer som gungar mig
Jag har hela världen under mig snart
Vågorna gungar mig
Jag äare en del av en underbar dag
Händer som gungar mig
Mot det lugn jag vill ha

Sommaren 59
Helt Plötsligt fanns en jord en himmel blå
Ännu en liten själ klev in I detta rum
Nu ståare jag häare mot det stora blå
Med solen I ryggen och vinden I mitt håare
I ett böljande skratt förenas vi två åaåhåh aååhåh

Vågorna vågorna Vågorna
Vågorna gungar mig

What poetry tries to say with a word
You are a song
All the music my heart ever heard

I can't escape
The air that I breathe even speaks of you
And I'm not ashamed to say
That I feel this way

I will stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love, with, with you
(So in love, ooh, hoo)

Words can't express
What I confess with each beat of my heart
I'm overwhelmed
With a passionate affair from the start, oh

Our love will grow
As the years come and go, I will be by your side, oh, yes, I will
There isn't anything
That I would deny

I will stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love, I am so in love with you

I promise to honor and cherish you
For better or for worse
I'll be there for you
For richer or for poorer

In sickness and in health
Till death do us part
(And I will)
From this day on and forever

I will stand before God
(I will)
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
(I will promise you)
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love, I am so in love

I am so in love

I don't know what it is all I know is that you changed
'Cause we used to be so tight, never apart
And now it seems your only want to break my heart, oh yeah
And I don't know what I've done to make you feel this way
One minute you call, the next you don't have a thing to see
Until you bring me here, I'm telling you baby

[Chorus:]
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do

Where did I go wrong? What mistake did I make?
Is there someone else? Tell me baby, you found to take my place.
'Cause now you stay out all night, and you don't even call
We barely kiss, we barely hug, we barely touch at all, yeah baby
And I just can't take no more, this is no way to live
Something must happen, something has got to give
I can feel it, I know, I know there's...

[Chorus:]

[Spoken]
Hey Shawn?
What's up, Jay?
You know I was thinking, man, I haven't seen you with
Your girl so long, I mean what's going on?
Why don't you tell me?
(I'm so confused, oh, and I don't know what to do, baby)
You know, Shawn, I know just how you feel because of my girl

My name is J-Ski? And Steve?
I say, what's up, Ski?
How are you feeling?
