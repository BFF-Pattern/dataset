For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice

Bless the beast and the children
For the world can never be
The world they see

Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them

Bless the beast and the children
For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice

Bless the beast and the children
Give them shelter from a storm
Keep them safe
Keep them warm

Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them
Give them love
Let it shine all around them

Bless the beast and the children
For in this world they have no voice
They have no choice"
4 Non Blondes,Calling All The People,/4/4+non+blondes/calling+all+the+people_20001270.html,"How can you tell
When your wellness is not well
Make no mistakes now
Please do excuse
My itchy attitude
I'm feelin' righteous
Why, why are we always asking why
To lamely try to justify
For what it is a lack of drive
Calling all the people
Have you nothin' brewin'
Time to flap your big fat mouth
Let's rap how we be doin'
Say might what you say
That's really all it takes to break through
Where is it at
When your moral is a hat
Full of money
Can you explain
Why the messy kitchen sink
Is so confusing
Why, why are we always asking why
To lamely try to justify
For what it is a lack of drive
Calling all the people
Have you nothin' brewin'
Time to flap your big fat mouth
Let's rap how we be doin'
Say might what you say
That's really all it takes
Calling all the people
Have you nothin' brewin'

4 Non Blondes,Dear Mr. President,/4/4+non+blondes/dear+mr+president_10203161.html,"I'm looking outside of my window
The view that I see
And the child is begging for money
Is a child and mama
Tell me why, tell me why
Is she so broke
The woman is blind
The kid's dealing crime
It's such a beautiful city,
But the word is burning it down
I go to my room to turn on the tv
I sit myself down
And I start laughing hard
'cause this man he's asking for money
I'll send you stuff to make you rich fast""
He say ""if you send me lots of cash
But the man he's burning it down
It's such a wonderful country
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
One day I'm going to have lots of money
And it's called the us of A
But I'll have to give it up for this rich society
Oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future
'cause you'll just get it back
With the kid on the corner
From the little blind woman
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And the people full over, doin' crack
Yea yea yea yea yea
But the man he's burning it down
It's such a wonderful country
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's called the us of A
I'm walking outside on a sunny day
With no one around
And I wonder what's wrong
Then I hear this loud piercing siren
And everybody climbed right on top screaming
Oh my God the bomb has just dropped
What a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
He's burning it down
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
But the man he's burning it down
Yea yea yea yea yea

4 Non Blondes,Drifting,/4/4+non+blondes/drifting_20001271.html,"What a wonderful hesitation
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
Who would bear to feel sorry for me
Dropped another pill just to calm me
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
Find myself awake counting sad days
1-2-3 that's too many for me
Reached for my hand but it was already there
Dropped another pill just to find me
Then I started believin'
That I fell out of a tiny raindrop
That lost it's way when I decided to roam
Chasing me was a hungry dweller
Come follow me you won't expect the illusion
But I had escaped it by pretending to die
You'll see it's my imagination
Hand me your eyes
I will put them in front of mine
You'll see a little better
You'll see a little better
Where I am now
What a wonderful destination
I can no longer see
Dropped another pill just to kill me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
But I had escaped it by pretending to die"

4 Non Blondes,Mary's House,/4/4+non+blondes/marys+house_21564196.html,"Fried my brain before my time.
Looked around at all the beautiful people.
And then my arm turned red...
And all I saw was my blood just rush away.
Hid the needle with a smiling face.
Going down just to find my mind...
To lose it in a pile of waste.

Went on down to a merry-go-round.
Chased myself into a vertical hideaway.
And then I fell to the ground.
Someone, please, please,
Take me back to Mary's house...
To push it with a needle again
Don't tell my momma...
She was my only friend

Let me out...
I want out of here.
I refuse to break my hands again.
My best friend is an emergency.
And its Mary's fault..
That's what she said.

Plenty of nights of knotting pain.
Take a drink and help me anyone.
Oh I have lost all shame.
Was it fun?
Who will take me back to Mary's house?
To push it with a needle again.
Don't tell my momma..
She wouldn't understand.

Let me out...
I want out of here.
I refuse to break my hands again.
My best friend is an emergency.
And its Mary's fault...
That's what she said.

I am Mary's house.
I beg you to stay.
I am Mary's house.

4 Non Blondes,Misty Mountain Hop,/4/4+non+blondes/misty+mountain+hop_21091239.html,"Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby
What do ya  what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said,
""Hey Man, do you wanna score?""
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile  yeah, yeah, yeah

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
I was really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us, said,
""Please, hey, would we care to all get in line? Get in line!""
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun  oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh
Oooo, oooo, ooooo

Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming  oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes  WOAH WOAH YEAH
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
I really don't know"
4 Non Blondes,Morphine Chocolate,/4/4+non+blondes/morphine+chocolate_20001273.html,"Substitute my gloom with happiness
Substitute my sickness with health
Substitute my enemies with real good friends
Morphine & chocolate are my substitute, substitutes
Morphine & chocolate can bring me up
Can warm my heart whenever I want it
And every once in a while when I stop and think
Morphine & chocolate are my substitute, substitutes
And you can say ""hey, we've really come a long way""
And you can say ""say, it can only be this way""
But, you might be careful, it really, it really come a long way
And you can say ""hey, it can only be this way""
But, you might be careful, it really hurts when it's real
You might be careful, it really hurts when it's real
You might be careful, it really hurts when it's real
You'll go down, down, down, ooh
Set the alarm clock, baby,
Don't you miss the sun?
I'm feeling really warm hearted baby
Don't you know I'm feeling like someone
I'm fearing for my heart
Morphine & chocolate could never substitute my art!
And that's real love baby
And that's real love baby
And that's real love baby"

I get dressed then I get lost
I don't know which way to go
Where the hell was I anyways
I guess I'll have a cup of Joe
So I end up on the street

Walkin' talkin' to my own beat
In a fog, in a haze
1-2-3

I've been trippin' out for days
Can you help me find my way home
Don't rock teh boat now, just let it slide
Groovy people walking back and forth, that's right
So I hop on to this bus
Destination reads please save us
Not a soul that I know
To be found in this dark hole
Can you help me find my way home
I'm so tired of looking for the door
Can you help me find my way home
Please help me find my way
I can't find the door
Please help me find my way
Where am I now, where am I now
I find myself just out there floating"

I got a beer in my hand and I'm draggin' a stoagle too
The back of my brain is tickin' like a clock
I simmer down gently but boil on what the f
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight
Trouble is a word that stars with a capital T
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' right
I refer myself to the word 'cause I'm so keen
Little do they know that I'm struttin' such a style
It makes the trouble in me all worth the while
So get back 'cause I'm feelin' good tonight
Get back 'cause I'm feelin' right
There goes Billy and Susie walkin' hand by hand
I quickly caught up slurring yo what's the plan
They had fear in their eyes and bellies that ran like dogs
I barrelled down laughing screaming Susie
You forgot your clogs
Well, Old Mr. Heffer
I'm really pleased to meet you
And Susie wouldn't look at me
But Billy wouldn't talk to me
I didn't mean to scare your blue-eyed child
It made me so doggone crazy
I had to chase them for a mile
All wanted was change for a buck
Yea I'm back and I'm feelin' right
Jesus!
Well I'm back and I'm feelin' good tonight
So get back 'cause I'm feelin' right

'Til I realize the moon
It seems so distant yet I felt it pass
Right through so I see what I see
A new world is over me
So I'll reach up to the sky
And pretend that I'm a Spaceman
In another place and time

I guess
I'm lookin' for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me

Subtle wind blow me gone
Let me rest upon your move
I trust I'll end up sleeping
Cradled in my doom so I feel what I feel
I can't grasp what is not real
So I'll get myself real high
And imagine I'm a Spaceman
In another place and time

I guess
I'm lookin' for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me

I remember in my mind
They say I'm daydreamin'
Is it all that it seems
Or am I all te things
I'm looking for yea
So I see what I see
A new world is over me
And I'll reach up to the sky
And pretend that I'm a Spaceman
In another place and time

I guess
I'm looking for a brand new place
I remember
Living in a diferent life
Is there a better life for me"

2Pac,16 On Death Row,/2/2+pac/16+on+death+row_20000778.html,"Death Row
That's where motherfuckers is endin up

Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
niggaz gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow.. Turn em into forty-niners

[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me?  16 on Death Row

Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggaz countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row

[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me?  16 on Death Row

Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin
On the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair

[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...

It's to all my partners in the penitentiaries

And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm ""Losin My Religion"", I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin
Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish

I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant
2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted

[Chorus:]
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
[Tupac] Nuthin but a gangsta party...
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Nuthin but a gangsta party
It ain't nuthin but a
Motherfuckin gangsta party
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Nuthin but a gangsta party
It ain't nuthin but a
Motherfuckin gangsta party
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

[Verse Two: 2Pac, Snoop]

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

We got my nigga Treach from Naughty by Nature in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker

[Verse One: Tupac]

My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin quick and then I vic just tryin to keep from gettin blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa!  Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggaz bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin reckless
Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run
Some niggaz need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venomz

(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin em up with
That old deadly shit.  Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.)

[Verse Two: Treach]

We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk c***
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-Mc-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me?  I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin shit
Pickin pockets with a razor stoppin Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin styles in em
Like women I did em I'm in for deadly ready venom

[Verse Three: Live Squad]

Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin em down, I make em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin trails of brains and bladders
Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out!  A poison, a deadly venom

(Yeah Mad, fuck that!  You know how we do.
Knowhati'msayin?  Squad in effect, yg'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)

[Verse Four: Live Squad]

Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line em up single file, dome runnin in em
A nigga hit em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... Paid
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my ak, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz

Throw up your middle finger!  Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin up pooh-butts, cut em like cold cuts
Choke em with my boot lace, then leave em hangin like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim

Postal border was makin' me mad
So I get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
Till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
Another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's just a day in the life

Finally I'm on vacation and school is through
So here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to do
Tried to get outta my bed, but I can't move
Ya see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
But I was all alone so it wasn't no thing
Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So I'm askin' who is it? And the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it
I'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said: "" Sorry that I kept you""
I started rappin', girls started clappin'
Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'
Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come on
A day in the life

Stretch white limo hits the colessium
A crowd full of people sayin: "" I can't wait to see him""
Who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
Strictly Dope in the house, hear to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere I look are screamin' fans
Girls on my tip but I really don't sweat 'em
They'll tear my new clothes if your bodygurad'll let 'em
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
We hear the introduction, the audience is loud
I stepped out on the stage and then I moved the crowd
Winners all over, we tried to leave the scene
But there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
Pen and paper in my face, I couldn't be mean
So I was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's a day in the life

Kick it, kick it, kick it

Coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my cisco
Askin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' "" No""
Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slow
Dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
Roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busy
Suckers wanna battle us, we move in silence
Strictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floor
And more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get up
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
The room begins to spin, I pass out for the night
Just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it

Knew I was a genius, soon as you seen this
Avoid hoe's value, don't have to redeem this
Teenage terror, no room for error
A girl start dissin', and I scare her!!
Risin' like inflation on your favorite station
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls wanna kiss me, suckers wanna diss me
My mother didn't want me to be, but I'ma emcee
The ladies desire, emcees admire
That's why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip, girls on the ill-trip

I am the high type, my style is so right

When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the greatest pain uncovered
You taught me to be strong, but I'm confused to see you so weak.
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see you welcome defeat.
When your hero falls so do the stars, and so does the pereception of tomorrow
Without my hero, theres only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls

As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together..

Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment

It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh!
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club, I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it?  (Hahaha)

Cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..

Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you?  Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
s***s know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin
Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh - Benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems - my main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin everyday, times moving faaast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to servin this, Moet and paaayyy-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin
Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin against the grain niggaz still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act - shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay

Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane
Hustle til the mornin, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin high
These niggaz got me tossin shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burnin rubber

This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket

We goin all out, watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggaz
(That's right, fuck these fag niggaz)
Do it, do it, do it

[2Pac]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brand as my strap
Back like a cobra, I stay drunk, cause I'm a mad man
Whenever sober, on a one man mission
My ambition to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies, they don't fear me
So refuse bringin war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper, bustin caps to Jay-Z
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
And still avoid capture, while y'all caught up in the rapture
Still after me, I'm in Jamacia sippin daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin nothin, then grabbin somethin and bustin
Wanted to be the thug-nigga, that my old man wasn't
I came to a field, catchin cases, litigation
niggaz playa-hatin, got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin death row, throw my westside, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M. O. B. If you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this, I'm hard to kill, when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?
Live it up, of give it up, and my demons
Late night, hear them screamin; we goin all out!

[Chorus: edi]
We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps, betta go all out
Try'na see the next day, nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out

[Napoleon]
I'm on my land sled, walkin through the belly of the beats
Feelin like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mobb niggaz hidin' in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough, but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers, I'd die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggaz on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug
Just westcoast what?  To my real niggaz stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin?  Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my for-for put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggaz be bitin this
It's all from my heart when I was writin this
All out

[Chorus:]

[Kastro]
Now, we all ride, and down to die who wit us
Speak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us
Ain't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggaz swearin they Pac
Stop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha
These glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
Walkin' like a og, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy
Frontline soulja, till the heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggaz, they can't deal wit'
Holla back, right back, and watch ya mouth
Or get blood in it, what, we goin' all out
Nigga

Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggaz goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt

Ey, you niggaz just gon think that you gon be uhh
Talkin and slippin on all of these motherfuckin records

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, ""Fuck it,"" cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the tele hoe""
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me

That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught

Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson

Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Gettin much mail in jail, niggaz tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside

Niggaz die and mommas cry
Niggaz got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggaz fame, as the world turns..

Though I walk thru the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
Like last year, niggaz stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year

Nigga talkin thug walkin all through yo' squad
Y'all niggaz scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns..

[Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)]

(And my niggaz roll and ride, hahaha
Niggaz gettin swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit!  As the world turns..
Niggaz die for
How many you niggaz try for this?  As the world turns
Murderin methods.. haha OUTLAW!)

As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns..

[E.D.I. Amin]
Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn

[Kadafi]
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin
Only five years up in this bitch, poppa runnin from the Feds
Puttin peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns

[Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper (repeats as Tupac speaks)]

[2Pac]
Hahaha.. as the world turns..
And turns and turns and turns.. haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go
Friends come and go.. my soldiers, stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggaz gettin chin checked
From the East to the West best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you
As the world turns
Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns.. haha..

Now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me,
""what would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggaz grabbin me
For just a moment i was trapped in the pain, lord come and take me
Four niggaz violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, i could feel the grief
Thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No!  you got to find a way to survive
Cause they win when your soul dies

They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is

Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, pampers and food, just to stop through
But those, ain't my seeds, nuttin really i could do (nah)

The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob niggaz love to act up
The first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennesey
Talkin to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin ""Fuck the police,"" as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Chorus: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..

If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)

Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Chorus:]

Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the niggaz came out boom
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin niggaz in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder

All the niggaz with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggaz that want some and that don't take none

They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggaz'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin block, fuck the cops!
The police?  We run these streets nigga

Better days!  Better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days

[Verse One]
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
Wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. Got me thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days

[Verse Two]
Thinkin back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
That in my future years, I'd be stressin
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P. O. Won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin llello all day long, but they wrong
So I'm solo and so broke
Savin up for some Jordan's, cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I
I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
Lookin for them better days

For better days, better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. Got me thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days.. Got me thinkin bout better days

[Verse Three]
Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin like grown men when rollin
I went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin marks
Got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin you well, I know it's hell
Doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doin cool
I settled down, had a family, workin in night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days

Better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. I'm thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days.. Got me thinkin bout better days

I send this one out, to all the homeboys down in uh, Clinton lockdown
Rikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin homeboy, keep your head up

Speak

Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - poof
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)

[Chorus: Eminem]

Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care

[Kastro: Verse 3]

In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet

Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, it's cutains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you aint got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze

Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets

Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein on my enemy's wall (rest in peace)
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonite
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nuttin free, give back what you earn, no doubt
Gettin higher than a motherfucker, blessed and pleased
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah

And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy

[Chorus: Prince Ital]

Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud
Usin de name of de Lord in vein
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain

[Tupac]
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin devil niggaz daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severly
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
Doin wild shit, lookin at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly -- Babylon beware
Comin from the Pharoahe's kids, retaliation
Makin legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin
Niggaz in Jerusalem, waitin for signs
God promised, she's just takin her time, haha
Living by the Nile while the water flows
I'm contemplating plots wondering which door to go
Brothas getting shot, comin back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga check it (that raw shit)

And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy

[Chorus]

[Tupac]
The preacher want me buried why?  Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds, thinkin that they evil
While the preacher bein richer you say honor God's people
Should we cry, when the Pope die, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
Waitin to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin up cash
To the leaders, knowin damn well, it ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, time in D.C.
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
Times in this crime man, my Thug nation
Do whatchu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door?  I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door?  And my people say

[Chorus 4X]

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallow be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
In earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us, unevil
For God, is the kingdom, and the power
And the glory forever, and ever, and ever"
2Pac,Bomb First,/2/2+pac/bomb+first_20000728.html,"{*church bells ring in background*}
In todays music news: the ever controversial tupac shakur has
Just released another album under the alias makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album;
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only mr. Shakur, but of death row records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at tupac
Excuse me makavelis verbal assault
On mobb sleep, notorius P. I. G., and several other new york rappers
Jay-z, from hawaiian sophie fame, big little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everbody wants to know is --
Whyd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather makaveli, was not available for comment
But released this statement:

[makaveli]
Its not about east or west
Its about niggaz and bitches, power and money,
Riders and punks. Which side are you on?

{*gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground*}
These niggaz is still fuckin talkin?
You niggaz still breathin?  Fuckin roaches, aight
Aight, it's the raid for your cockroaches

(all day, everyday)
Its the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(the pump in yo ass)
This is it nigga! Killuminati style
(outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the don, solo shit - bring it!

[makaveli]
Allow me to introduce first {*gunshot fires*} makaveli the don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy quran
Niggaz get shook like 5-0
My forty-five guns next to me when we ride, for survival
Money makin plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dopefiends titty.. Huh
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My outlaw niggaz down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggaz duckin from my guillotine stare
I'm right there; my every word, a fuckin nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in em
Cut em down.. To hell is where we send em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gon cry
Me - a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper til I'm gone
Thug life runnin through my veins so I'm strong
(ha ha ha)

Bye bye bye, lets get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggaz but I'm not gon cry
I'm a bad boy killa, jay-z die too
Lookin out for mobb deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggaz down to die for me?  Yeahh-yeayy!
West coast ridah, comin right behind ya
Shouldve never fucked wit meeee
I want money hoes s** and weeeed
I wont rest till my road dawgs freeee, bomb first!

[Chorus:]
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider for you die
We aint even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo life, and ima bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider for you die
We aint even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo life, and ima bomb first

[e. D. I. Amin]
For so many days and some many ways weve been duckin strays
They delivers, but we still some bad boy killers
Got nuttin to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on death row
With outlawz, it's makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if ima leave this bitch
Yo I'm dyin with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muhfuckin nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made paparazzi
If you aint in this rap game, for the motherfuckin cash mayne
Then what is your motherfuckin purpose?  None can serve us
E. D. I. Amin born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first beatch!!

[young noble]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin patent leather
Causin massive terror, yall niggaz lack, you aint thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin
Yer tellin fairy tales dunn
King of new york, like you the motherfuckin one?
But I'm from jerz and we don't play that shit
From the claire down to north bricks, all my niggaz flippin chips
Gettin rich, even though it's hard
Tryin to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolv
With no warnin signs, cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine, ready to put in my time

[makaveli]
Shoot first, look at they head burst bleedin
Don't want to hear no shit this evenin, believe me
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider for you die
Gs, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider for you die

Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first"

Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin
Bustin, my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin, now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

Woke up with fifty enemies plottin my death
All fifty seein visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin 'round corners, homie sleepin in my vest
shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin Westside, bustin double glocks
Hittin corners in my Chevy Surburban
Liquor got me drivin up on the curb, hand on the steerin wheel swervin
Bless me Father I'ma sinner, I'm livin in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggaz that don't give a fuck, ridin as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

[Chorus:]

[Young Noble]
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my soldiers gone, we burnin the earth
Outlawz worldwide, we pack the block
Shootin rocks at the kid, I'll bust back for 'Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin

[Napoleon]
Now we was raised, ""Fuck this life,"" I rose my right
Holdin on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleepwalkin as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of, bitter food
Came a long way from my born day, dead away where there's war play
fuck friends I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag-ass niggaz, see-through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and the skin of my mash-ass niggaz
Breathin!

[Chorus:]

[Kastro]
Uhh, I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin bout a bad day, I live a life like that
It's unfair, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans
Catch me, I'm fallin out flat, yo I'm ruined and
Breathin in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I leaned to like it like that, when I was still in mommy
The side of seedy that the devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin!

[E. D. I.]
And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'are one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one motherfucker bout to do it again
shit, 'Pac still doin it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million everytime he drop I know you fuckers losin it
We movin in - for the kill, for a meal, holdin steel
Hold the wheel I'm bout to give these niggaz somethin they can feel
Fakin real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin thug lyin niggaz, give it up!
We hit 'em up!  (and we still breathin.. And we still breathin..)

Brenda's got a Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
Tha girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a
Junky
Puttin death to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger
But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, whos sexin her crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together,
Whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
Bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
What ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here
Everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
So she sees s** as a way of leavin hell
It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

Baaaaaaaaby

(Don't you know she's got a baby)
(Don't you know she's got a baby)
(Don't you know she's got a baby)
(Don't you know she's got a baby)

Fuckin' off cash that I make
Nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
If you never get tp play
I'm hustlen'
Stayin' out till it's dawn
And commin' home
At 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
Hand's on my glock
Eye's on tha prize
Finger on tha trigga when a nigga rides
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out tha door
Pick my money off tha floor
God bless tha tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on Gin
With a couple of friends
Sayin' those thug life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp
And if I die
Let it be
But when they come for me
Bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
Even when I die
They won't worry me
Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

More Trouble than tha average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Bein a G ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around get crossed
And get stuck in tha game
And for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to tha G's you can feel my pain
Till tha mothafuckas gets born again

You thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
When I pull tha trigga on my gauge
I'm on tha rampage
Makin' runs for tha devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind
Will get me in some trouble
I'm tryin to ride
No more loves
For me hard to figure
Get a nigga, smoke a blunt
Or is a jury starts (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust
Pull me to my death
But I'm a G to tha enemy

I got nothen' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' ta slangin'
Now I'm a dope dealer
All my life payed tha price to be tha boss
Back in school

Poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
Pack a 9 all the time
You wanna test mine?
Don't cry
I die before they play me
From tha cradle to tha grave
Bury me

Straight Thug G
Kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
Getten' drunk, smokin' blunts
A bitch said I was no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in tha dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch
Instead slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs
Fake ass G's
Bitch niggas with no heart
I'm stayin' real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone
Bury me a G

When I'm all in those guts and shit
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick

[girl]
I can't.  (Aww c'mon!)  He ain't gon' let me.
[2Pac]
Pleeeeeease...
[girl]
Nah.
[2Pac]
Oh aight.  What's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be ok?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin
Got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?

Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon.. Let's go.. Can you get away?
Can you get away?

[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know, I know
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Just for a little while love
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
I know it's hard but, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Let's go man, get up outta there
.. Can you get away?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Do you love him?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Do you love that man?

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?

[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know it is
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Yeah you can
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
You ain't happy huh.. Can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know.. Is he beatin on you?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Did he punch you?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Throwin you around the house?

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do?  Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?

[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Can't get away.. Why?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Let me take you away
All I really know, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Man..
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Course you can get away
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
If you really wanted to get away
You could get away

[Outro: 2Pac]

You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, yaknowhati'msayin?
I ain't tryin to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need but now.. He ain't even takin care of you
He beatin on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhati'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Yaknowhati'msayin?  You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to, yaknowhati'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin stitches
Cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good

[girl]
Can you take me from here?
[2Pac]
Shake that man, get away
[girl]
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh"

And lace my bitches with 9 figures
Real niggas fingers on nickle plated 9 triggas
Must see my enemies defeated
I'm cashin'
While they coughed up and weeded
Open fire
Now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh
And test
And get your chest blown
Straight out tha west, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like ho's
Open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe?
Nigga you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money
But baby I got to gets mo'
You scream and go
'2Pac'
And I ain't stopin'
Till I'm well paid
Bails paid
Now nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens
Niggas open fire
Buncha Thug Life niggas on tha rise
Until I die
Ask me why I'm a Boss Playa gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by
Niggas Can't C Me

My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what?
It ain't nothin but a party when we thug
And there I was
A young nigga with heart
Ain't had shit to loose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools
You know the rules

My words like a penatentary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed

To my Thug niggas in lock down
Witness me

You shoulda never put my rhymes with Dre
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day
Hey Homie if ya feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me

They ain't killed me
I can make a muthafucker shake
Rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor

Quick to jab at them ho's
And I can make ya jelous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a niggas aim is
I'm just a rich muthafucker from tha way
If this rappin' bring me money
Then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm getten green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these ho's
And see how many I can go through
Look to the star

Don't be a dumb muthafucker
Because it's crazy after dark
Where the true Thug niggas see ya heart

Now that it's gone (what's wrong? ) Im feelin tired and sick
(how did they do it? ) I don't know I wasn't sleepin that long
When I woke up (what happened brother? )
My microphone was gone
At first I panicked (how? ) I put the cops on the case
But they were stuck (damm? ) without a clue or a trace
So sure as smokin cigarettes is bad for your health
If I want my microphone back I'll find it myself
So I picked up the phone (for what? )
I called dizzy
Dizzy: what's up?
My mic is gone
Dizzy: word?
Lets get busy
Before I could tell dizzy what I wanted to do
He was over at my house with the tms crew
He said
Dizzy: word is out in every mouth
In the street now that your mic is gone
Its not long yill your beatand then it hit me (damm)
I got a battle at six
Without my microphone Im guaranteed to get whipped
U might think it's unbelivable but word to the strenght
When it comes to rockin rhymes Im a musical nymph
They gave me other mics but yo it wasn't no use
I tried to rock one two one two
But I couldnt get loose I said forget it
My microphone or not I gotta do it
Give it all that I go (what if u loose? ) it be the first time I lost
But if I beat em I'll finally prove Im the boss
I grabbed my leather jacket walked through the streets
Suckers was hopin and preyin strictly dope would get beat
I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight
Yo I was confident that I'd win
To hell with the mic
I hopped up to the stage dizzy started the beat
Suckers shivered cause he tasted defeat
Then I signaled to dizzy bust a rhyme off my head
Perpetrator fell back (huh? ) and then he was dead
I was happy as hell cause I was lucky that nite
Put my hand in my pocket and there was my mic
The case of the misplaced mic
Strictly dope in the house"

You certified crazy

I got to work with what you gave me
Claiming' I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
now I'm lost in this Holocaust headed for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
and got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
and if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a nigga got to do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm gettin' tested
And if I don't say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are gettin' restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
And since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck, buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when I'm fool, bust
They make a nigga be a killer I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder If the Lord ever heard of me (uh)
I need loot so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues

Why did you pack straps (Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch (Cause I had to)

Poppa need brand new shoes
but what the fuck can a nigga do
My little boy got to eat too
So why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockafella?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to drink
Cops want to hit me with the book
And you're hooked on my eye don't give a fuck look
Make your rules I'm a break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em
You show me bacon I'm a take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty
to my brothers In the barrio
You livin' worse than the niggas In the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
Got love, you got problems with the punk police
Don't run from the chumps get the pump from me
We ain't free I'll be damned if I played a trick
For a blonde hair blue-eyed Caucasian bitch (Bitch!)
Down with my homeboy Rich
Fuck a snitch and a groupie ass bitch
And the nigga with a cellular phone
Leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone (That ain't right)
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas
Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas (What's up kid)
And they bound to be fuckups too
Drinkin' forties of brew singin' nigga blues

Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin homey, when we ridin?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M. O. B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?

Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old sl
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T. I., P and them sweet?  (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet  (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out
M. O. B.!  Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation
Gimme mine, or I'm blastin on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries bleed
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man

[Chorus with 2Pac speaking over it]

[2Pac]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

2Pac,Changes,/2/2+pac/changes_20000742.html,"[1]
Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor & even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

[Bridge with changing ad libs]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
[Repeat]

[2]
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""
Well hey, well that's the way it is

[Bridge:]

[Talking:]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive.

[3]
And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
& I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some punk that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room (hey there bitch, where Suge at nigga?)
Call Suge, call all the niggaz tell em to meet me downstairs

Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(fuck that, I lost some money nigga)
Aw nigga, damn

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Now I'm up early in the mornin breath stinkin as I'm yawnin
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into s*** capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alize and Hennessee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

[Chorus: 2Pac]

We gotta go [2X]
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time
We gotta go [4X]
Gotta go nigga, gotta go (y'all know what time it is)
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shoe, cause we out this motherfucker

[Verse Two: Kurupt]

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true, with Janet on, I'm in a Escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies runnin through the halls room to room, so I assume
Since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's Trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak into your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my atttention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

[Chorus: Kurupt]

We gotta go [8X]
Aiyyo man 'Pac ay where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin
The only one not to leave
Yo man it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
You seem them bitches?
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece!  Yo nigga whassup?

[Verse Three: Syke]

Hey I'm livin the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin but I'm checkin out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin your thoughts, cause I'm livin Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin out, you're yellin out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream, and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight, for 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go [8X]
Ay, it's check out time
Ay 'Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin, where my shoes go nigga?
Where my motherfuckin drawers and shit at man?
Man y'all niggaz was in here partyin too fuckin much

From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

June 16, 1971
Mama gave birth
To a hell raisin' heavanly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me
But I smacked him back,
My first words were ""thug for life""
And ""Papa pass the Mac.""
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas
When will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin'
Will I escape in prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
And if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
Cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind
This motha fucka's tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
All about mail and bank
Never die
Be a hustler mothafuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas.
From the cradle to the grave.

[Chorus:]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. Easy

From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave
Since a little bitty child
I've been known to get I'll and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!
Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Survalience on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young niggas bein' raised by the streets.
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A striaght thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
One black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
So stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.

[Chorus:]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard
And all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
As the warzone I got no home
Don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my ho.
Never leave home with out my sugar.
I'm hafta plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money
And through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.

[Chorus:]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

March 18th
A rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc
But my family's broke
And my pocket's short
So now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
Shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
Hear my glock c***
Thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.

[Chorus:]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easyy
Living in the ghetto.

Time's movin' fast
Will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone held me
But they never did.
I can't take it
Will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me
Crazy.
Do or die.  Nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high
Then my mission is a walk-by.
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' ""evil mind"" as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The begining is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.

It's time to let the vallet step
Gotta make my ends, so business on the undertip

If Oakland gets to hot, I'm headed for Marin City
Though hunted like a fugitive, those punks will never capture me

The smoothest criminal, a lunatic for violence
So I be taken no shorts, when the shit get scandalous
Rippin' of this vest see, so nigga we can handle this
Run up and get smacked up, packed up and smacked down
I'm a playa, there's more in the J town
Bitches wanna jock, and run they hands all in my hair

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breakin all the rules
I she'd tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & ""Sweet Franklin"" with 2Pac]

Lady...
Don't cha know we love ya?  Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't cha know we love ya?

[second and third chorus, ""And dear mama"" instead of ""Dear mama""]

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act craaazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Sweet lady
And dear mama

[Mother:] I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' ak all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
You don't do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the- corner, anyday
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin and strivin, my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my ak, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
But I see death around the corner

[Chorus:]

(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)

I see death around the corner,
The pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
Who was buggin'
My homie told me once,
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screamin, please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

[Chorus:]

I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor til' you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin on them niggas til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin high was a way of gettin free
I see death around the corner

[Chorus:]

This is for all the real mothafuckin niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
All right

[Movie bites]

I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that

I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head

I want that sonova bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care"

The lord has taken you away
To see a brighter day
You know we miss you Tupac.
Repeat Chorus 3 more times
Dear God I wonder can you save me
The ghetto's got me losing my mind I'm going crazy.
From shootouts with suckas my opposition collapses
They got me rolling dice with my eleven I don't want a crap.
With black fools gonna attack those and I hit their ass first
Cause in the sea and in a sqeeze got me feeling like I'm cursed
Have you forsaken either way got me actin like a villian
With a million dollar dream, kill the sceam and scandelous ass women
I'm bending blocks and toting glocks on a daily operation
And facing death around the corner if I let these suckas take me
But I'm a ridah so I'm a ride 'til the wheels fall off
And shove these bastards in the caskets, haul they asses off
Though we barried ghetto soldiers who lie close at heart
And separate from family members in the tears of support
Wash your tears through the years knowing our love aint gonna cease
Increase gun rates and poverty got us stuck on our knees
Beggin the lord why have you cursed men with white collar and gun play
About the projects with no money, still stuck on this one way
Streets with no peace with myself let alone somebody else
Savagely livin for the cabbage pulling ak's off my shelf.
Its jealousy and envy that got Pac licked
Most definitely Mr. Makaveli going be missed
All eyes on a ridah, with ambitions that aint hard to find
Got around and made a 5 out of a nickel and a dime
And now the lord they love to shoot cops instead of niggas
Hollar thug life and pour out a little liquor
Well here's a jug of the thug passion just for you
Are and P, Killuminati, 21 gun salute.
Chorus 3x
Life is living hell busterated and jail cells
Back against the world colliding heads with white males
From state to Cali jail, why surrender if no bail
You're zipping your lips because you fail if you tell
Packing the shit on your side because you're too scared to die
You want peace on the streets but instead you're strappin the nine
Dead brothers fallin behind got a cemetery and line
He's getting barried for dying, for a minute I was worried and crying
You're lying flat on your back, it was a stream of a blood bath
Escape from my thug staff, and ventured the wrong path
Die in the bay, but I still got props for la
Rest in peace Makaveli meet you at the front gate
Even though we never kicked it, god lift it, man you was hella gifted
In this rap game, aint it a shame, but I bet we wont forget your name
You remain to be the most influential, on top of instrumentals
Stories so real but so resentful,
To the hard times, the hard crimes, was the death of Makaveli
And hunger aint the pain I'm feeling up in my belly right now
My stomach keeps turning, visions of murder got my blood burning
And best believe them suckas gonna get what they deserving
Makaveli, aka Tupacalysa, I reminisca, you carrying a clips and talkin shit a
Keepin up with the bad boy, in a bad boy, but a bad boy,
Carrying all them feelings towards us, was always ready to go to war
I never knew ya, but in my heart I wanted to meet cha
Sort of like a teacher, guys will preacha, watch you be the reaker
I miss your video the way you spit the realest lyrics
I also feel it when I hear it makes my mic go wicked
I cannot fix it, the love that you brought to a nation
Keepin' it real with the reputation, fire up the insulation
Don't ask any questions, I'm gonna keep your mind steady guessin
Is that another hardcore rapper trying to start some messin
I'm not affiliated with the drama on the streets
I'm only a G when you messing with my family
One love goes out to the deceased who die by my peace a
We all will miss a, the man they call Tupacalysa
The lord has taken you away
Such a gloomy day in this game
I guess ill see you next lifetime, yeah
Cause life goes on

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
That's right, sucka for love
[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
[repeat 2X]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
Damn, sucka for love... Sucka for love
Sucka for love
[Chorus:]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
Sucka for love, know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love

I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love

They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
Never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer

My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlawz, Makaveli niggaz ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggaz be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life

[Verse Seven: edi Amin]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

2Pac,Don't You Trust Me?,/2/2+pac/dont+you+trust+me_10201953.html,"I ain't got time for this man I'm out

[Chorus:]
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing by (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?

As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

[Chorus:]

Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's think of the evil break don't make it scandalous
Try to be mature I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're saying I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fighting back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl... Don't you trust me?

[Chorus:]

I hangup the phone (click)
I can't bare to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)
Just let me pack my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not because we rushed it (hell no)
But girl don't you trust me?

[Chorus:]

Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?

Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?

Not that I don't trust you"
2Pac,Dopefiend's Diner,/2/2+pac/dopefiends+diner_20661606.html,"[Verse:]
Late night coolin' with my homies
Drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local bar-b-q
It's just another boring Monday
And there's nothing else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement
The brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dope man had an ak
Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up getting shot up
Now I could not walk away
Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wondering what would happen to this
Poor and helpless fiend
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
And all the Dope Fiends waived to me
Heard the sound of several gun shots
And I ran outside to see... (What's Going On?)

[Chorus:]
Another gun shot rings (What's Going On?)
Another siren sings (What's Going On?)
Another mother cries (Yo what's Going On?)
Cause another innocent died (Yo what's Going On?)

Another gun shot rings (What's Going On?)
Another siren sings (What's Going On?)
Another mother cries (Yo what's Going On?)
Cause another innocent died

[Verse 2:]
All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know
But for me I held concern
I wanted to see the outcome
Would the mother see her son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
Almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
My heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Tried to make my way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
But she whispered
Mister could you please save me
So I screamed out, someone help me
But I don't think they could hear
And if they did, they didn't care
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
And I wondered what could I do
The camera men and newspapers had come
To get their interviews
To them it's just a story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
Cause it ain't it wasn't their family
I don't think I'll be back
Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here
Though some people say it's crazy
And the poor could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night
At Dopefiend's Diner

[Chorus:]

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do... (Repeats until song fades out)"

Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared,

You think God had a plan for me?
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me,
Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch,
Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me,
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree,
Young George or Jonathan Chat,
Your guns clap,
Mine will go 'br-are-r-are-att',
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt,
And come through cockin' tha black pound,
When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down,

So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box,
You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards,
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket,
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage,
The flesh to the bones,
The bones to the ashes,
But I'm not dead,
I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing,
They don't really want no drama, I know they goons,
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound,
This God given, he keep givin' me better music,
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement,
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin',
Songs of evolution,
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it,
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid,
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless,
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it,

Niggas wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thugging
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free

Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Running silly through the court) They don't really wanna start
(How you wanna do?) Yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime)
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting

Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin what you thinkin but you musta been the ship
Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin back, for everything you owe

Bustin at my innocent family, say they lookin for ki's

Bust in, talkin bout, ""Where is the quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed ""Nigga motherfucker""
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin this in federal prison, givin everything I owe

Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willin, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you c** sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me?  ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
bitch you ain't doin me no favors, fair exchange

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin pussy, but baby you gettin dick!
And since you bein laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin like you can't hear the bed shakin
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggie style steady pumpin on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin like you did somethin, givin me a piece
I had you mufflin your screams in the sheets, fuckin with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

Pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons
Meet Jamaican like you god {U-god?} and 'em handing you lessons
We learn a lot from the 60's like glaring 13 necks
Mainly the niggaz get shot for flaring out their larynx
And get to speakin' on a conditions of black people
that's illegal they enforce it with the force that's lethal
make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on
head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it's us
the FBI probably bust a nut if we self destruct
call it militant but ain't nobody killing Barry {Goldwater}
you can't be militant if you ain't got no military

back then my people bust shots for the free breakfast

you could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
everybody act hard, like they got no regard

this is for Medgar Evers, Martin, and my brother Malcom
sometimes we be sittin and wishing for another outcome
my head be spinning, it be full of why's and the how come's

we need leaders, we looking at entertainers
it's about the cash, so we respect the biggest gainers
niggaz get paid then they run away from the community
that ain't gangsta nigga, you the opposite of Huey P
don't be confusing me with haters, player
get your paper, just show respect to the folks who made you (yeah)
blessed by the creator so give money nigga
just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry nigga
out on these streets the police is killing
I'm spilling out my heart on these beats so I can feed my children (yeah)

because we don't need no more fallen stars

stalk the stage with the pride of the panther
hands off Asada and the blood of a dance floor
word, rock on, throw the Tupac on
he's not gone, you hear his influence in pop songs
shine brighter than those Vegas lights
illuminating that Vegas night to the party after the fight
'til the gunshots disturb the peace like Luda
too bad he ain't a white chick in Aruba
they'd have a whole department dedicated to finding the killer
you'd see Afeni Shakur on Larry King, and motherfucking Dennis Miller
word, Bill O'Reilly would be flapping his gums
how much respect do they have for my people?
actually none
you either do the nigga packing a gun who hate niggaz
even though every time he pass a mirror he staring at one

Though we exist and breathe
Some believe currency comes to g's
Stresses half the ghetto
With success comes greed [echo]
They got me hot
When they shot me
Plotted
My revenge
To increase my ends
Enemies gettin dropped
Win or lose
Red or blue
We must all stay true
Play the game nigga
Never let the game play you
And for the fame [echo]
Niggas change fast [echo]
That's a shame [echo]
What's the game
Lost souls
Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? [echo]
The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane [echo]
I'm hoping we can change with time
I'm living blinded [echo]
Searching for a?? Curse
I know death follows me
But I murder him first
And worse yet
With each breathe
Steps I take
Breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes
Coaster
Crystal glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards
With a ski mask
I'm the first one to warn them
Blast it
Wrapped in plastic
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws)
Ain't nothing left now
Treated like a stepchild
Was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck em all)
Be rocking beats
Fake in fame

Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperados
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts
Sipping Henney
Drunk nights
And hot days
Cocking my heat
Shooting it sideways
A wife on the run
Full of common blunts
Unconditionally married
To my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny
On knees
And ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage
Like priors
Stuck in the trance
Searching for something higher
Fortune and fame

One thing we all adore

Lost in the rain
A lose of the game
With life the cost of the game
We forcing the change
Mother fuck flossing the chain [echo]
All the blame
Belongs to the part of the brain [echo]
That we never use nigga
Plus my heart is in pain [echo]
And if I ever lose homey
Bet I'm at it again [echo]
Outlaws don't die
So united we stand [echo]
And if family 'come a foe
All the fortune and fame [echo]

As I walk up in the crib
Laid to rest me head
Say some rhymes to angels
Hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down
Outta town
I sent him a kite today
Man that hate in your heart
Your gotta cleanse it dog
Praying for my downfall
And I can sense it dog
I was passed down the street fame
Like glocks clocked
And keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded
But still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man
But you is a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got
From generation of game
In the road of life dog
We need to switch up lanes
Think about it

Something worth dying for
It's been nothing but pain

Searching for fortune and fame

[Verse 5:]

I can't complain
I've seen my fair share of the fame
It wont change me
Now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange
I got so use to the hood
That when I finally got out
At first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby
Still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit
Ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me
I made myself
Poverty raised me
Thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health
My mind
And my family too
State of myself
My grind
And my family crew
Where one hand watches the other
No we ain't blood
But we still real brothers
The struggle is real
Nothing can steal
What we build
And that remains the same
'Till that day we killed
And that's real
Life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree
That's fame to me
How about it

[Chorus:]

One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame

The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame"

Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and still not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin, I'm hellbound
Rather be buried than be worried, livin held down
My game plan to be trained heavy, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetary
Cryin, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus
Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin

Shoot at me, try to corner me, orderlies try to get at me,
Flip it like fake identities, sticking it to my enemies.

Till they put me in a courtroom fighting for mine,
The only reason I got foes that used to be friends,
When niggaz mumble under their breathe, I'm under thier skin.
I pray for the strength to handle what my city bring,
Better stand for something, or your bound to fall for anything,
The pitfalls, the pot holes, I spit flows that generate straight crack sales, we got those,
One hitter quitter split a nigga like a embryo,
Bring it to your crib, to your kids, to your vidoe shoot.
Give me the loot, my dudes all paid up,
The half assed getting rat packed and sprayed up,
You say ""What?"", speak up punk I can't hear you,
Your transparent, rentals rap, I'm seeing clear through,

And then you wonder why I shot him (boo-ya!)

But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped

Hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse:]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce thinkin of bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to 'em
They test, it was stress that they under
And nowadays things changed
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, cuz the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed and it hurts
Cuz any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nottin
Don't it make you get teary, the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, cuz we're human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel

[Chorus:]
Those who wish to follow me (Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 2:]
Tell me do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin outta bags, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady
Crack got her crazy, guess who's givin birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me
From outta the frying pan we jumpin to another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brotha be a better one
If I upset you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But I'm less holy?
Cuz I took a puff of blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war on the streets
My Ghetto Gospel

[Chorus:]
Those who wish to follow me (Yea, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sounds of guns

Lord can you hear me speak?

I pay the price of being hell bound!"

And witness game official

While I remain inside a paradox
Gone my block
Though gun shots is promised to me when will I stop
I hit the weed
And hope to god I can fly high
Witness my enemies
Die when I ride by

Send they bodies to they parents up north
With they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off

Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... Ghosts
Feel me?

Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-Oh!) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mausberg goes boom, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs
(Give it up nigga) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
Die motherfuckin die, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
Boo-Yaow is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin to my fuckin block
Took a shot, tired of runnin from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on!)
And then we'll be ghost

Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt & a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time

Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed

Ever since I was a little motherfucka wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all she'd tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police & all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
By keepin gun & never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early
All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime

I pray before I go to sleep
""Dear God save my place before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm covered to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock I buy?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of comin from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin, so I'm flowin goin crazy
Slip for c*** the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
For spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big

Fiendin for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was

I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin ""Fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin 'til I earl, spendin money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggaz got it goin on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggaz eat a dick a day, bumpin this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

This is the good life, fuck my foes

Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die

No one knows what the, future holds, but you
Haha.. Listen close
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
.. After living so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggaz, and my girl - livin the good life!

[E. D. I.]
I spend my days and nights not knowin if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin big ceiling
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin
Better start to get to runnin 'fore my click get to gunnin
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
I'm still tryin to get a hold of the game, livin that good life

We're venturing into the mind of young black males
Let's take a peak...

[ Young Lay ]
Cuddies perved by the corner, stout, herb
Got me twisted, mo' cold killin murders
Them brothers gettin further
Got my pencil for utensil, this'll keep they mind knownin
Spot some thugs at the club, and they got the nines showin
Dirty pimpin g's, one of my dreams, player now listen
Lotta blacks locked down, but comin back around in '96
All the gals my six (what else?) my track crew and my mother
Make these police wonder: how is he so undercover?
Never been a lover, but America had broke my heart
I was told to tear up out this before this tear me apart
Eat through scrap, black tracks, free milk and cheese
While the Japs stack scratch with the Vietnamese
But I'm finna squeeze, stack cheese they left on a trap
A young playa mack, hit the bud', spit a rap
It's just that feelin, that feelin that I have for children
Are able to love us, but these crazy devils try to kill us

""I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho""
""Smokin that dank to deal with the pain""

(My nigga Ray love, when'd you get up out the pen, man?)

[ Ray love ]
June 2nd '93 I returned to the streets
Did 2 months in the county and I opt to the beat
Now the cops keep watch, cause they know that I rap
Tell the world that I'm a gangsta, cause I ride with a strap
But I ain't yo gangsta, just a young nigga caught up in the struggle
Born hustler, goin for the jugular
Out to take the beast down, piece down might be too late
The funk is on, high, drunk off Thunderbird and Grape Kool-Aid
Would love to catch a playa slippin, take me down and book me
Guilty as charged, hit the switch and try to cook me
Silence a nigga for the shit I'm spittin, I know I'm scarin ya
A poison you created in the veins of America
Miseducated, incarcerated, institutionalized
That 3rd strike will have a gang of them rollers dyin
Ain't no love where I'm goin, no love where I'm comin from
Remember me, that real-ass nigga you been runnin from
Got us sprung off the cocaine and the welfare
While the black babies die without health care

[ Mac Mall ]
Now how could I pledge allegiance to a racist-ass flag
When the rollers at my do' with A. 44 mag?
Got my mother spittin drag 'bout I ain't home
Got a double homicide warrant on my dome
I hear em pushin in the do', I grab my Mac with two clips
Cut through the back window and like a g hit a fence
I'm thinkin 'bout my folks gettin sent for violation
Foes and punk police, them devils still at my do'
I peep a group of ten tryina get information
I threw the clips in the Mac, start lettin off frustration
It's better than incarceration any day, we gonn' die anyway
So if I go out blastin, call it my fate
I got niggas in the pen like my cousin Bud
Lunatic Insane, and my partner T-Love
Big Tom, Ray Ray, Killa Cuddy, Mac Dre
Cleek, Jamal, Jinx and Bluebonic, man

[ 2Pac ]
Now I been called a crook, a killer, a thug
A no-good dealer of drugs
And Blood or Cuz, doesn't matter what set you was
Cause where I'm at, if you black, we strapped
As long as ki's make g's these thieves attack
And ain't no rules on the streets these days
Muthafuckas better watch they back and take it eazay
I'm livin in the dangerzone
And learnin lesson from the game, it's on
Niggas was gone when the frame was on
I'm gettin breaken them balls daily
Is there a ghetto in heaven or do I go to hell?
See, seems I was senteced to death, takin my steps with my head down
Why pour I liquor for my niggas, cause they dead now
My memory since I was a little seed
Was a penitentiary full of niggas like me
These cops can't terrorize us, they despise us
Niggas, cause we on the rise
Plus everybody's searchin for a piece of the truth
And the youth turn the streets into a piece of Beirut
And the truth is

""I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho""
""Smokin that dank to deal with the pain"""

With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
Would it be the greatest mc of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that asss shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet

But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls

Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind

So my fuckin sac won't collapse

Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an mc with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villian
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that?  Cuz smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to mc's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere

The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again.
Like percision, cut the two lines in the division.
Plus, what I add loose as flutes. Its gaming foe sale like prostitutes.
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt.
They want me in the back, but bitch I'm in the front.
Don't front, and really I don't need a reply.
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye.
I'm on a whole nother level, them hoes is left
I told you befoe, keep ya pussy to yourself
Goodbye, some many niggas lied to have
Funny what a muthafucka do for math
I got rats caught up in my everday actions, point
Equal to your realist satisfaction
Buckin anybody that forbid mine
When will they reelize, I'm set out to gwt mine

{chorus}x6
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

Eternally thug nigga Hilfigure made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my? Mommy
Oh come to poppy
I love it when you sweat? ?? More peeps
Until I come to wake no one can stop me
My bump and grind
Coming through ya everytime
Come get a blast of this thu passion
It'll blow your mind
Hey throw up your? ?

While they suduce my jimmy I'll
Be screaming give me body

Give me my? And don't cha? ?

Get with real niggas bullshitting never get your pay
This is the dream of a black tenn
?? Hoes cross-country like a greedy crack fiend
Now come on"

[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, ""Hi,"" and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test.. Of givin
But be thankful that you're livin.. Blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

""Yes I'm back"" - [Special Ed]
""Tupac is"".. Back!!

[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black take
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, why me?
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back?  No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?

""Yes I'm back, cause I never did front"" - [cut 'n' scratched]"

Makaveli in this... Killuminati, all through your body

Uhh, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me; eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh

[Chorus: Makaveli]

Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la

[Makaveli]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listenin
Seein niggaz comin for me, to my diamonds, when they glistenin
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killin fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
The solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well, Hail Mary

[Chorus 2X]

[Makaveli]
Penetentiaries is packed with promise makes
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin
Instutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin, in the liquor store
That's the Hennessee I hear ya callin, can I get some more?
Hail til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin in my bedroom; I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nuttin to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, sellin drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin, life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doin they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Kastro]
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since the Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off Hennessee and Thai
Tryin it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high
Visions of me, Thug livin gettin me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin with slugs

[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feelin rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashin in a stolen black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back, sixty seconds til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preachin church, I gave you love now you eatin dirt
Needin work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up

[Kastro]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate, hoping God don't close the gate

We've been traveling on this wayward road
Long time til I be take a 'eavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary

We won't worry everyting will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree

Now we've been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin Alize and Cristal, whylin every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
It's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

Ha.. Ppy.. Home..

I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin, a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home

Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free

Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe untill the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'g'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Untill the moment that they let me breathe again

The Heartz of Men

My lyrical verse with so much pain
That to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, fight long
Tonights gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'g' to this 'til the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
If ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men

In The Heartz of Men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up
But still flowing
Energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again

Cause I've been sent

Hoping my information, eleviates the hesitiation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation
""Mr. I get around""
My temptaion got me dripping wet
Perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking? Strip naked get the love making
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes

Turn around one more time

Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of scarifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your bloodpressure
This Thug Passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
Baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time

Your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin to make a livin
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bitches
Who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, playa-hatin but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, niggaz know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo

Be true to this game and this game will be true to you

Shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot em right between them niggaz eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die

Thug livin, hell or prison, never losin my focus
I'm makin money moves manditory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin
Til the cops come runnin, duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
Livin carefree, til I'm buried - and if they dare me
I'm bustin on niggaz until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul?
Got tired of small time livin, niggaz tellin me no
I got mine, fuck them other suckers, that's the mentality

Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, bein broke is hell 4 a hustler

Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'

Listen tho' I'm missin dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son

Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? Gettin blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin close to my third, I live a trouble life

2Pac,Hellrazor,/2/2+pac/hellrazor_20000785.html,"Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor... Born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
Not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class
And I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me?  I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh

[Chorus: Stretch]

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unnh
[Repeat 4X]
Mama raised a hellrazor
[2Pac] Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)

[Chorus: Stretch]

Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unhh
[repeat 2X]
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major

Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin high til the bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like Latasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trugger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die"

Cause shit was hectic for me last year 
It appears that I've been marked for death 
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest 
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary 
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the 
cemetery 
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary 
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin worried 
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic 
And certain death for us ghetto bastards 
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire 
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die 
But don't cry through your despair 
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare 
And who cares if we survive 
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five 
My neighborhood ain't the same 
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game 
And I swear it's like a trap 
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back 
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props 
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block 
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots 
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops 
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail 
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well 
And the system's sucidal with this Thug's Life 
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life 
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job 
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard 
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt

Life in High Speed
Fuck the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time

[2Pac]
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me
My army, niggaz decieve swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna hang out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less provide protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past, blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the D.A., be heavensent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned str8 severed then, why?
Then they wonder why niggaz die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime rate, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and tie weed
Puffin' through these High Speedz
And people say

Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun

Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Grab your shots', callin'
Catchin niggaz while they stormin'
Kickin' his door in

Wonderin' why it keeps on passin' bringin' me the danger

What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla

By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
Niggaz is dying tommorrow

Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't knowin'

To beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house

Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a I'll year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on

[Chorus: repeat 4X]

Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on

There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
Let they ak's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on

[Chorus:]

[Interlude:]

Hold on, be strong
I know them ain't tears comin down your face
When it's on it's on but
Wipe your eyes
Hold on, be strong
In this world
When it's on it's on but
Only the strong survive y'know
Hold on, be strong
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
When it's on it's on but
Welfare
Hold on, be strong
Aids, earthquakes
Cause when it's on it's on but
Muggings, carjackings
Hold on, and be strong
Yeah we got problems
Cause when it's on it's on but
But believe me when I tell you
Hold on, and be strong
Things always get better
Cause when it's on it's on but
God don't like ugly
Hold on, and be strong
And God don't like no quitters
Cause when it's on it's on but
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
Hold on, and be strong
God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause when it's on it's on but
Y'know?
Hold on, and be strong
You got to stand strong
Cause when it's on it's on but
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
Hold on, and be strong
You stand there to they face
Cause when it's on it's on but
Tell em hold on, and be strong
Hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
Cause when it's on it's on but
Hmmm
Hold on, and be strong

One Thug, One Thug

How do we keep the music playing

One Thug, One Thug

I wake up early in the morning
My state so Military
Suckas Fantasize, Pictures of a
Young Brother Buried
Was it me, The Weed, Or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckas then
Tonight we Bleed
Out for all that
Knowing that this world brings drawbacks
Look how this shit bumps
Once I deliver these war raps
Meet me at the cemetary
Dressed in Black
Tonight we
Follow the dead
And those who won't be back
So if I die
To the same for me
Shed no tear
An Outlaw, thug living in this game,
For years
Why worry,
Hope to god
Get me high
When I'm burried
Knowing deep inside me
Only if yah love
Come rush me to the gates of heaven
Let me picture for a while
How I live for my days, as a child
I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold Your head

[Chorus:]

How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
To many young black brothers are dying
Living Fast, too fast

These felonies be like prophecies
Begging me to stop
Cuz These lawyers getting money
Everytime they knock us
Slashing pockets lyrically
Suckas fleed when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli
Had the rap game closed
Expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows
They froze
Now suckas idealize my choosen Blows
More money mean litigating
More Playa hating
Got a cell at the penn for me waiting
Is this my fate
Miss me with that mistermeaner thinking
Me fall back
Never That
Too much Tequilla drinking
We all that
Make them understand me
Hey I'll stay all night out with my Posse
Everyone roll with me is family
Cuz everybodies got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision
This life we living
Got us all meeting up in Prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog
Written in Blood
Saying, ""Please show a young playa love""
Hold your head
Hold it

[Chorus:]

How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
To many young black brothers are dying
Living Fast, too fast

God bless the child that can hold is own
Indeed
Enemies Bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be to last
To my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation
In this world of greed
Currency means nothing if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy
Take the game from me
I hope for better days
Trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities
Till they capture me
And my aim is to spread more smiles than tears
Utilalize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right
Rest your head
Straight converstion all night
Bless the dead
To the homies that I usta have
That no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul
Watching time pass
Through the glass of my drop top
Hold your head

Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes
Of a nigga who don't have a thing to loose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket
Made you a man again
And now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape
It's a fools fate
Without your word
Your a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do?
If it was up to you

Courious
Spittin' lyrics
On tha verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency
Nigga that's why we're doin this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
And then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
This information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him
And let him see tha face of a mental patient
It's a celebration
Of my criminal elevation
With the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
To keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate?
To live tha life of luxury
Some niggas bought my tapes
So much jelousy it scares me
So be prepared
Cause only tha strong survive
Life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew tha way it feels to die
So you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me

[Chorus:]

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

(Ohhhhhh....)

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame
So much pressure on my brain
While she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
Only her and I know
Now I'm sitten' in tha state pen
Doin time for slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin'
Just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin'
Cause
Hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
Picture my prophecy
Tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from tha coppers
But never let'em stop me
Cause I'm a soulja
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
Of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid
Trust
A no no
Love is a mystery
Fuck tha po po,
Holla at me.....
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me....

Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?

But it's time for a new plan, bam!
I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They fell me when they rollin in they fat jeeps

Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -

Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash

2Pac,How Do You Want It,/2/2+pac/how+do+u+want+it_20000748.html,"(feat. K-Ci and Jojo)
[Chorus: K-Ci and Jojo]
How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game
livin in the fast lane; I'm for real
How do you want it? How do you feel?
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game
livin in the fast lane; I'm for real
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin it so bad I'm bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin
Body talkin shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me -- champagne, Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it
(Tell me how you want it! La-dy, yeahhhyeah)
[Chorus:]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
Cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin til the show is over, cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
and let you get on top of me, get her rockin these
Nights full of Alize, a livin legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others -- Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin millions, niggaz top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
livin in hell -- only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
nigga tell me how you want it
[Chorus:]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
on how to get a bulletproof, because I jumped from the roof
before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin major -- my adversaries
is lookin worried, they paranoid of gettin buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin fade em all, these taxes
got me crossed up and people tryin to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin like they know me
Hahaha, but I'ma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it
How do you want it?
[Chorus 2X]
[2Pac]
How you want it?
Yeah my nigga Johnny J
Yeah, we out

[2Pac]
Tell me

2Pac in this muthafucka

[Tupac]

All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry
Instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'g'
Bitch don't wanna die
Then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn)
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

[Chorus:]

I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another

How long will they mourn me

[Syke]

How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
Ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me?

[Chorus:]

I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me

How long will they mourn my brother

(Rated are, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)

[Rated R]

Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Reminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me?

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me?

[Chorus:]

Yeah!
I wish it would have been another

Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, knahmean?
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
[Danny Boy] I ain't...
Givin a motherfucker, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
[Danny Boy] ... Mad at cha
Cause I ain't mad at cha

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roller
Got stretched to Y. A. And hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain, then go head
Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)

[Chorus: Danny Boy]

I ain't, mad, at cha [2Pac:] (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin, that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasn't nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't she'd a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin mad, I'm knockin busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy]

I ain't, mad, at cha [2Pac:] (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha [2Pac:] (A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy]

I ain't, mad at cha [2Pac:] (and I ain't mad at cha)
Iiiiiiiii ain't mad [2Pac:] (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at mha [2Pac:] (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha [2Pac:] (I ain't mad at cha)

Call my mama and they scream drama [Kill you bitch!]
Could it be they don't know that they fuckin wit a G? (Rat-a-tat)
I'm goin to sleep but wit my eyes open
I'm gettin high and I pray that when I go, I can die smokin
Go to the funeral, My homie's dead, He passed away
Got caught up in the wrong place, Got blasted hey
It's just anotha part of bein black
It ain't no thang, But if you slang, You betta watch yo back
Cause these motherfuckers love to see you gone
You gotta stay strong, Young brotha, Cause it's on
And i'll be slangin these thangs till the break of dawn
Gotta make my ends, Then it's time to take it home
Got some hoochies on my pager
It's major, Let me play her like a game of fuckin sega
It's time to wake up, 2 in the mornin
You gotta leave, Gots to sleep by myself, Cause I'm a G
It's time to say goodbye, I gots to get my strap
I was raised in the gutter now I can't turn back

But yo, I can't turn back

But now, I can't turn back

[Verse 2: Uncredited Rapper]
I got 30 homies, 30 mackin, Jealous cause I'm stackin
I stay tackin, Keep packin, Heat in case these niggaz get to actin
Too sheisty, Shorty y'all get foggy and wanna leak
Or get restless tryin to test this, Get they ass put to sleep (Pow!)
I'm playin for keeps, And if a life ain't no turnin back
I'ma keep hustlin as long as dope fiends keep burnin crack
No love for these bitches cause when you down and out, They backs turn
Now dig em and ditch em be about my riches, Sip my liquor, And let my sack burn
Can't let these funky c*** hoes destroy me
Only quality time I spend in these only blocks that employ me
These punk-ass cops annoy me, Playa hatin on my cash got
Me bailin through them cuts throwin my sack and strappin the stash box
Tryin to crash my spot, Tryin to stop a nigga from earnin snaps
To hustle's all I know so it ain't really no turnin back

I can't turn back

I can't turn back

Comin up off a clip, So nigga don't trip, It's the S-P-I
When I step onto ya shit, nigga, Ya quick to die
So take this slug to ya chest cause then I'm turnin back
Reason the ghetto smoke a motherfucker slangin crack
I put my finger on trigger and he was rolled up
He was the key to me gettin my spizzot sowed up
So now I'm runnin like a motherfuckin fugitive
And all I carry is memories of how I used to live

[2Pac:]
Everytime I wake up, I hit the floor and thank the lord
I don't know what I'm livin for, I'm runnin out the back door
Ain't nothin nice in my life, I ask my nigga Spice (What's up, Nigga)
Don't wanna die, Am I livin right?
I hit the corner smokin weed and drinkin hennessey
Will I be sober enough to see my enemies?
And if I do, Will I empty my clip?
Or will I trip, Cause I ain't givin up shit
I can't turn back

Can't turn back

But yo, I can't turn back
They sayin I'm crazy

[Intro: Skit]
— What's up?
— Yo, this scene: rollers tried to jack a nigga 'cause a nigga with a pearl rollin' on a Coupé with goldens
— Yo, man, what's up? This riding motherfucker, jack me at rollin' 'round bumping, ’cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?
— Yo, this is P-O to the G-O
— Motherfuckin' cop just jacked me, 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley
— What's up, man?
— A'ight, man, fuck 'em

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I don't give a fuck
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And now I'm in the back on the paddy wagon
While this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'
I see no justice, all I see is niggas dyin' fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly, 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the motherfuckin' dope man
The Grammys and American Music shows
They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us, though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck tryin' to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we gettin' respect, now
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I'm pissed, 'cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break! How much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't going nowhere, no how
Bush wanna throw down?
You better bring the gun, pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the motherfuckin' underground
So, step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who do you think? A motherfuckin' 90's nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up, I had enough!
(Yeah) And I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Pogo]
Nigga, it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and they attitude is shitty
So, tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say we niggas like to do niggas
So me and a cop are just two niggas
A street-walkin' nigga and a beat-walkin' nigga
With a badge, I end his future and his past
With a blast, take his cash before I dash, I bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
'Cause a nigga like P don't really give a fuck

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit—ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere, but where?
’Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack? In fact, who's the blackjack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade, but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers: stay strong, keep your heads up
They know we fed up
But they just don't give a fuck
(They just don't give a fuck)

She tell me that she needs me
Cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me.
Lady take it easy...
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me,
I don't want it if it's that easy.
Ehh yo bus it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy.
You ask why, it don't matter
My pockets got fatter,
Now everybodys looking for the ladder.
And aint no need in be greedy,
If you wanna see me
Try a beeper number when you need me

Well I've been hangin sangin, tryin to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was bangin
Your home girl you went to school with
That's cool, but did she tell you about her sister
And your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for michelob
But it's a monday, my day,

Put a little twist in her hips
Cuz I'm watchin
Conversations on the phone
Til the break of dawn,
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn em off, time to set it off
Get you wet n soft,
Somethings on your mind, let it off.
You don't know me,
You just met me,
You wont let me,

Why you sweatin me?

Cuz a groupy bit the truth and told a lie.
You picked the wrong guy,

Broke out left me to be the man of the house.
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a glock, and I clocked grip

It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace, till the niggas get a piece too
I want G so you labeled me a criminal
And if I die, I wonda if heaven's got a ghetto.
I wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
I wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
I wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
I wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
Here on earth
Tell me whats a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move cowards get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Natasha, and many more
It's been goin on for years, theres plenty more
When they ask me when will I violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggas down in the streets
niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness on are own business
fuck the gaurd cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
But we couldn't afford the shit, now everythings free
So we loot, please don't shot when ya see
I'm takin from them, cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables are turned around
You didn't listen until the nigga burned it down
Now Bush can't stop the hit
I predict the shit, in 2pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the Hood, being around the niggas yeah
And the first time everybody let go
The streets is death row
I wonda if heaven's got a ghetto.
[Chorus:]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgraced races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be actin right
Cause both black and white is smokin crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
Although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready to have a black president huh
And ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin, and ask myself
Is life worth livin, should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull a trigga, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather be a dead then a po' nigga
Let the lord judge the criminals, and If I die
I wonda if heaven's got a ghetto.

Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Chorus:]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a lier
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My ak told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. Ar-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

A soldier dies but once

[Verse One]
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturin pitiful punk niggaz coppin pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evadin the playa hatin tricks, while hittin switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm duckin the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin my glock
Niggaz is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight

[Chorus:]
If I die tonight [repeat 3X]
""Tonight's the night I get in some shit"" - [Dr. Dre]

Polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
Callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
He got it by killer, preoccuppied with bein boss
Revenge is the method, whenever steppin keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
Picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's usin deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seein cemetary photos of my peers
Conversatin like they still here, if I die tonight

Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Livin when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggaz
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick, while drinkin liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps, for bein petrified and lame
Disrespectin the game, prayin for punishment and pain
Goin insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't she'd a tear for me nigga I ain't happy hear
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines readin murdered to death, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand

Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with ak's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

[Verse Two:]

It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

[Verse Three:]

Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of heat
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call"

Trying to get paid
Cause my mind is on my money
Everything is so made
I play game in the youngster
As a youngster
Trying to make my money
Trying to become a hustler
Finally made the status
Glad it's night in the pimp
Snoop Dogg 'bout to trip
Catch you grippin down our jiff
Making money is a must for me
I gots to have it
Cause you know my lifestyle is like Tupac's
It's just so lavish
Just moving on paper
Moving making and shaking
Leaving fools in a daze
Just if it's I was a Laker
Break 'em down and shake 'em
Pass it off to Tupac
And let him take a jump shot
Because he go give it all...

Back in the old days
Niggas was suckers trying to belittle me
But that was when I was much smaller
Just a little G
But now I'm a just a bigger baller
Niggas don't want to see me
Because I'm larger and taller
Made my money get bigger
Bank account is larger
Niggas don't want to see me
They label Dogg the father
When they see us on the street
Niggas scream peace
They don't want it
Cause they screaming they can't see me

Cause I gots to get my grip and fingers got to keep it on
I'm scratching for some scratch and some scrilla
Trying to get the big paper
Cause yo paper is a killer
Leaving niggas on daze
Cause yes, money pays
Cause if you ain't got it
Then it seems you weren't plotting
Trying to do you a robbery
Or some type of assault
But you just might get caught
But you know it ain't my fault
I'm going to dip away and sniff away
And find me a hide away
And look for my nigga Pac
Going to take the ride away

2Pac,In The Depths Of Solitude,/2/2+pac/in+the+depths+of+solitude_20646883.html,"[ Ludacris ]
Yes, sir
This is Ludacris
here to recite to you an original poem written by my man tupac shakur
Intitled; in the depths of solitude
And it goes a lil something like this
Eh, ehhm
Yeah
I exsist in the depths of solitude
Ponderin my true goal
Tryin to find piece of mind
And still preserve my soul
Constantly yearnin to be accepted
And from all recieve respect
Never comprimising but sometimes risky
And that is my only regret
How can there be peace
A young heart with an old soul
How can I be in the depths of solitude
When there are two inside of me
This duo within me causes the perfect oppotunity
To learn and live twice as fast
As those who accepts simplicity
Yes
If you read in between the lines you can understand exactly what my man
Tupac shakur was talking about man
You see in or outside the music industry
Everyone has heard the expression its lonely on top
Well you know
Pac was on top
It's only naturally that he exsisted
In the depths of solitude
Of course he was a young heart with an old soul
And individual that was way ahead of his time
And sometimes when you're ahead of youre time
You do wonder what your true goal in life is
When you get so highly critised and put down for teaching
What you've learned to others
And doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do
So with that
Pac like all soldiers fought, to be accepted
Specially by those who rejected him the most
And even if you did'nt like him
You had to respect him
See nobodys perfect
And off course everyone makes mistakes
But experience is the best teacher, if you ask me
So its important to learn from each mistake
And try hard, not to make the same one twice
His only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times
But it was the wild outrages Pac
Mixed with the sensitive loving Pac
That made him almost the perfect person
Also made him learn and live twice as fast
And I'm sure, he would rather walk through life
With these multy dimentional personalities
Than to accept beeing one side than simplistic
Anyday..
So being in the depts of solitude, if you ask me
Is were the true heros of our times stay.
Tupac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever
Rest In Peace, live in harmony...
This is Luda, signing out
Peace"

In the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a princeple
Or a belief that I had lived for
I will die before my time
Beacause I feel the shadow's depth
So much I wanted to acomplish
Before I reached my death
I have come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my demise
[Young Noble]
In the event of my demise don't shed no tear
I'll share my wisdom with the world, they'll know I was here
Know I was clear, every thing I said I ment
A outlaw, when I was born they prepared my ditch
Said I won't live long, statistic showed
I'm tryna past 24 realistic goal, listen all
You gotta stay cold inside
That's what I tell myself when I feel alone sometimes
But I can't cry, I don't tear no more
I love god, from death I don't fear no more
A part taken in this movment to better my people
Though they see me on TV, I tell them we equal
Don't look at me as a stranger, I'm one of your own
We was raised in concrete and grew as a rose
Still I rise, but never get a chance to fly
Mama please don't cry
In the event of my demise
[Chorus - Young Noble]
In the event of my demise
can't breathe no more
hope I die for a princeple
something I lived for
dying before my time
feel the shadows of depth
Trying to fulfill all my dreams before I reach my death
came to grips with the possibility
The world's killing me, and my soldiers die young with no sympathy
I wipe the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who stayed strong
In the event of my demise
[Napoleon]
If I should die before I awake
let my family be stairght of the money I make
Give my son, what he needs, other than his father
Is it self respect, better yet his honor
with the lord come to swallow my soul, it's so big
Cause the street took enough of my life, we all see
It's a cycle make you feel psycho
Everything struggles behind this man, see nobody love you
Got a piece of the streets and it's gonna die with me
may your, soul forgive me
Makaveli's within me
In principle we stand by stronger than power
We gon' die by the rules you can never devour
On the earth from my birth fell nothing but pain
only thing I ever gained was a baby to name
that's my heart, and if I should go I'll go on in the sparks
that's the event of my demise, and it lurks in the dark
[Chorus]
[E.D.I amin]
Now as I stand here, a man here
Not a perfect one, but a searching one
Seek in another, blazing time
Sound crazy but I'm actually tryin to escape my mind
Tryna erase in time
but hoping that you didn't notice
When i was at my lowest
So I knew they was watching, I couldn't stop it
So many things I wanted to accomplish
Too many dreams, wasted with no promise
From out the darkness I struggle to see the light
Rumble deep in the night
Hustlin with all of my might here
Some won't see it that way
But us is given praise
But all of them will dream
That I did it my way
In the event of my demise
[Kastro]
I was born to a storm that won't let up
And I was raised to stay brave with my head up
But thing ain't got better
We still gettin wetter in this bad weather
I need more than a sweater and a leather
Yo, ain't nothin ment to last forever
So the stuggling and the suffering ain't gon' last forever
And my will, probably be like two lines long
It will read I'm dead but my soul lives on
And my spirit still living though my body is gone
In the event of my demise I love all who stayed strong
I love all who stayed strong
In the event of my demise, com'on
[Geronimo Ji Jaga]
In the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a princeple
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time

Good Evening [sirens in the background]
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
[crowd starts chanting ""Tupac""]
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

With this new album"

Yall listening, but
Do you understand nigga? Revolution!
What's your plan nigga? *Gunshot*
Since my transition
I've been misquoted, disrespected, and turning over in my grave
Watching yall behave as if I should be proud of something
Yet I hear you speak my name like I had a divine shroud or something, but
Religions are seldom followed
Hollowed souls backslide easy
My life is tarnished so the whole world sees me as a menace
But I replenish the hate, with me with love for yall
I look from above for yall, but I can't find my soldiers
Who's holding the weight of the world on their shoulders since I left?
Who caught my last breath as I exhaled
The rail from the tracks
Who's riding to make sure they don't destroy the art form?
If they can stop me,
They can stop thirty more mc's before they're even born, So I
Sacraficed the longevity of life
To make sure that you got the message the way that you needed it
Existence turned into a lesson to be taught and told, confessions to be heard and heeded this
Kids walking these dirty roads and it's your job to pave them
If you see niggas dying because of what you're saying
It don't matter if you ain't kill em,
You ain't do shit to save 'em
You in the way nigga.
Save the day nigga, or stop playing hero
I've been yelling and screaming from my grave for ten years now
But yall don't hear me though
Which one of you niggas is going to step up and say 'Pac I got you?
God Damn it, who shot you?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2Pac,It Ain't Easy,/2/2+pac/it+aint+easy_20000770.html,"Keepin it real

[Verse One: 2Pac]

I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uhh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin roaches, cause we broke
Late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... That's right

[Chorus: 2Pac]

It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free
[repeat 3X]

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin
Wake up sweaty and screamin, cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin out for these killer kids, cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin shots
Til I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Til I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy

[Chorus 2. 75]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Lately been reminiscin
Bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin dreams
Of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', casue these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tommorrow, am I fallin off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin, I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
This high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these county blues
Gettin battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin in this, livin hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin to torture em to tell, I'm gettin mail
But ain't nobody sayin much, the same old nuts
Is makin bucks while these s***s is gettin fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy

Hopin you'll forgive me for the times I bullshitted

And when ya come around tha block brothers clown a lot

Don't believe him
And if he can't learn ta love ya, you should leave him

Ya know what makes me unhappy
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother ta be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman
And out game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?
I think it's time ta kill for our women
Time ta heal our women
Be real to our women
And if we don't
Well have a race of babies
That hate tha ladies that make tha babies

He had me feelin like black was tha thing ta be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tuff
I thought we had it rough, we always had enough
I often huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke tha rules
Ran with tha local crew and had a smoke or two
And realize momma really paid tha price
She nearly gave her life, ta raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dreams
Of how I'd rock tha mic and make it to tha big screen
I'm tryin ta make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard ta be legit and still pay tha rent
And in tha end it seems I'm headin for tha penn
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in tha wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take tha man in me
Ta conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain will never let up
I try ta keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed tha poor
Sad there aint no hope for tha youth and tha truth is
There aint no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant ta survive, cause it's a setup

Ya got ta keep ya head up"

Now diggy-die, everytime I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga cause I'm comin back like Jesus
Bow down to my I'll nation runnin from drug cases

Got a package from the devil, payin my deeds

[2Pac]
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin right from wrong
They say my ghetto intrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me, for the outcome, ban my records - check it
Don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin blinded
Hennesey got me feelin bad, time to stop drinkin
Rollin, in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin?
Sittin in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry; I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu, that I love her, but it's hard to take
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

(One, two, three, four)

[2Pac]
I see bloods and crips runnin up the hill
Lookin for a better wayyyyyy..
My brothers and sisters it's time to bail
Cause even thug niggaz prayyyyyy..
Hopin God hear me, I entered the game; look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin time fly; I love my people do or die
But I wonder why, we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga get paid.""
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say, c'mon..

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Bad Ass]
God help me out here, cause I'm posessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
Cause money's like a stong prescription drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin bout the paper wit the pictures of the president's, head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin money cause it's cursed
Makin money makes a difference day by day so I gotta stay
Paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my, peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life doin right, or did life livin dumb
Who has the answers?  I wonder; I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) Cause they don't even know
A million thangs run through my mind..
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin time..

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Chorus repeats while Tupac speaks below]

I feel fucked up in this bitch.
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate tye, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha, all that shit

Let me show you, the rhyme..
Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
And so does Mrs. Justice by her side
Both the broads are blind as bats, stumblin through - the system
Justice bumped into M'Tulu, trippin on Geronimo Pratt
But stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela
And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians
Slavery was just a learning phase, forgotten without a verdict
While Justice is on a rampage
For endangered survivin black males
I mean really; if anyone really valued life
And cared about the masses
They'd take 'em both to Pen Optical
And get two pairs of glasses
Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
I'm kickin asses up and down New York City
It's a pity
Brothers wanna be grimy and gritty to each other
What would your mother think, smotherin your brother?
I see you sink, into another level
Dancin with the devil
Turn up the bass, cause I'm player; also a rhyme sayer
Kind of fly, layer after layer
Why.. Cause I'm blessed
Cause I've progressed
I've learned my lessons
Class has always been in session, so you better take notes
And stop chokin on negativity"

So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?

Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With dj Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin through the street lights, cause we like, yo nigga
Get your mobb on show em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz poppin, welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin for a bitch that's half-black and filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tounge-kissin on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say em right
The club be poppin so I'm stoppin at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the late night

Probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as aids, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin Monday through Sunday

To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I dissapear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my niggaz up in Clentin gettin weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die

But rocking to the top where the cream of the crop

Stop think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Move on be strong with unity
Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo lives must move on
And never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop

Drop that [3x]

Yo I'm running so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
So listen up to the flavor I gave you now dropping it
We folks know ballers know no stopping it
Dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
I got you scared all you got to do is stay calm
For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this

Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me

And let me breathe a minute

By any means neccessary it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
I was waiting for a prayer god gave me a goal
I refuse to be busting like a sucker for I'm fighting like a titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I go as far as rock can see
Not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops

2Pac,Letter 2 My Unborn,/2/2+pac/letter+2+my+unborn_20000858.html,"To my unborn child..
To my unborn child.. In case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
[talking in background]
To my unborn child..
To my unborn..

[2Pac]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed since I'm born to wild
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin
Tryin to earn every penny that I'm gettin, and reminiscin
To the beginnin of my mission
When I was conceived, and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud, single parent but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
To school, but I dropped out, and left the house
Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin, so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again, or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it'll sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

[Chorus: sung, with 2Pac ad libs]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you, if you didn't know I feel this way
How I, think about you every day
I have so much to say

[2Pac]
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to bein anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be rapist
It's hard to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times but I'm still breathin
Livin proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right, or the wrong way?
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace.. When I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy, and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child

[Chorus:]

[2Pac]
Dear Lord can you hear me, tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in, case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?  Cause bein black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm kiddin?  I'ma thug 'til I die, I'ma rider mayne
Touch bases, eat lunch at plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein there
Just know your daddy was a soldier, me against the world
Bless the boys, and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal, restin in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

[Chorus - repeat to fade]

[2Pac over Chorus]
To my unborn child.. Please take of all my kids
My unborn child.. To my unborn child
This letter goes out to.. To the seeds that I might not get to see
Cause of this lifestyle
Just know that your daddy loves you, got nuttin but love for you
All I wanted was for you have a better life than I did
That's why I was out here on a twenty-four hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you up there in the ghetto heaven
Cause ghetto heaven gotta be there.. Haha, take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know that sometimes it's confusin
The rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day everyday
Watch out for these snakes and fakes, friends comin down the way.."

Whas happenin?
I'm writin you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. They ain't came true

Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin what's goin on.. Holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..

Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggaz fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get? Ride for M'Thulu? Like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Kastro]
Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
While your motherfuckin troops keep killin our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Edi Amin]
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President

Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up..

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

[Big Syke]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President
Hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin dollars

Think you got us lookin to lose
Tryin to turn all us young niggaz into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin for?

You ain't got to lie to kick it
To them tricks and them bitches
Out to get a nigga's riches

[Verse 1: Richie Rich]

Jack of all trades ballin' like Jordan you punk
Fake inside the paint in fact I know you can't
Do half of the shit that you was claimin' in the county
Suckas on yo jock you claim you run the block
Polyurethane busta cracked in half
You claim you folding bank but I know yo bank stank
I lived around the corner I seen you fully smoked
Must I say some more you weighed a buck 04
You sold ya tv for a buck cause it was way too late
Now they sent you upstate and you done gained some weight
You's a baller lying to them youngstas quick
Got them thinking you sick and representing yo click
But you's an old basehead kickin' too much hype
Yo bicentennial pipe it got rally stripes
And if they knew yo identity
You'd probably be the victim of a sticking (ugh ugh)
You ain't got to lie to kick it.

[Chorus 4x]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]

You ain't got to lie to kick it
Y'all don't hear me
I got these niggas yackin' in my face
About some shit that never took place
And what you see is what you get
That's what he told me
I peeped it in his pose
Exposed the fucking phony
I'm gettin' richer so they claim to be my homie
With them bitches they be freaky
They don't know me
Hey it's gettin drastic
Gunnin niggas down cause they plastic
Sleep on a G and get that ass kicked
And stuffed in a casket
Rippin' the shit like it's my muthafucking last hit
Hey they wonder why a nigga's nothin' nice
And everytime I bust a nut I fuck for Tyson
Cause I know the real on the bitch
She got to skit ya just to get a nigga's riches (fuck that bitch)
I pray to God that the bitch don't get no dick
And got a nigga screamin' fuck That bitch!

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Pac & Rich]

Well if a bitch'll be a bitch
Then a trick'll be a trick
I've got my nigga Richie Rich and we be all up in the mix
This is Thug Life baby rollin' hoes like Vogues
Stay the fuck up out of mine
And I'll stay out of yours
It's a Oakland thang and bitch you wouldn't understand
This Tanqueray got me screamin' fuck yo' man.
But now you beefing on the strength
That you was thinkin' I was jocking
Hey bitch I got no time for hoes I'm steady clockin'
And if it ain't about a buck I gives a fuck
It's raggedy hoes like you that keep a nigga stuck
So what's up with them low life bitches tryin' to play me
Bitch you better see Trojan about yo' baby (Ha ha)
Trickin' niggas better catch up on they pimpin'
Cause bitches love to catch a nigga when they slipping

As I bail through tha empty halls
Breath stinkin'
In my jaws
Ring, ring, ring
Quiet y'all
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
He's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alchol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall?
Raised as G's
Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Let's get smoked out
And blaze with me
2 in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I passed out
But now that your gone
I'm in tha zone
Thinkin'
'i don't wanna die all alone'
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death

While tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
When you passed....

Plus with tha drama
We're lookin out for your babies mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from getting on her...
Life in tha hood...
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hoties at chill parties
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you burried
Rest nigga
Cause I ain't worried
Eyes bluried
Sayin' goodbye at the cemetary
Tho' memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till' my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace

Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
Incase I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on...

Land of the Free, and home of the enslaved
Till the concept of time
6 hours, 22 minutes, and 3 seconds, I've been standing in this
County line
By the looks of the Gridlock outside
Its gotta be about 3: 39
Everybody rushin from place to place
The looks on their faces ain't no different from mine
Both of us look like we just worked a 9-5
See, but when I clock out
I'm not looking for stress, but for the kind share
Since I started this county line shift,
Huh did I say shift? I mean this sentence
I've heard nothing but sirens outside the door
How much you want to bet there's an ambulance rushin a short man,
O. D. Man, police abused black man to the hospital?
Now what they rushin for is my intrest?
Rushin through traffic jam to get to emergency room traffic jam, that's
Susppose to be a free clinic
Only to hear if you have or don't have insurance
It ain't nuttin but survivial of the fittest
So what they rushin for?
And damn this man at the window is slow
The concept of time has os all fucked, and on top of that,
Life ain't nuttin but a traffic jam.
(2pac)
Life is too short, I feel trapped
Hopping I don't get caught, watch my back
Lost in the traffic, heartless and tragic
Don't wanna get my ass kicked
So I walk in this mindless state, and a don't make me feel this way
I'll tell ya
Life is a traffic jam, I'm stuck
When will you realize your fucked?
Don't try to change my ways, I'm hopeless
Victims to the games we play, stay focused
Watch for the crazy ride, don't lie
High till the day we die
I'ts my life
Tell me if you feel me
I'll tell ya
Life is a traffic jam sincerely
Stretch your mind, spoon feed your soul
3 voices you can't control
Remember life is a traffic jam

Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin on a niggaz death

A bunch of adolescent niggaz spittin major shit
Tell me, young nigga if ya die let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watchin as your mother cries?
Will all your homies ride?
Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to compete
Gettin G's, packin heat, bringin havoc to the fuckin streets
Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
And loaded up on the whole front row (BUCK BUCK, BUCK BUCK!!)
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and show me, my lil' homie

[Chorus]

[2Pac - over Chorus]
Hahaha, whassup nigga?  YEAH!
You lil' bad motherfuckers
You motherfuckers know what time it is
Yeah nigga!
Juvenile delinquent-ass motherfuckers
Under eighteen.. better protect that shit!

[2Pac]
First to bomb, sixteen on death row
Bustin on them phony motherfuckers cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew I was a nut case, quick to blast
Livin underage, but he'll blaze on yo' bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace, shell-shocked souls
Makin money off of crack sales, young black males
Unable to change cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows.. the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K. Kastro
Big mouth Hussein, call them Outlawz
Tellin the world to be equipped
When these young motherfuckers rip shit, they don't quit
Drew down on me, pull a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me, my lil' homies

[Chorus]

[2Pac - over Chorus]
Whassup nigga let's do this shit!  My lil' homies!
Lil' bad-ass motherfuckin adolescent niggaz!  My lil' homies!
What the fuck you niggaz wanna do?  WHAT NIGGA?  My fuckin lil' homies
Sixteen, fifteen, thirteen, my fuckin lil' homies

[Chorus]

Lord knows
['Pac is choking on blunt smoke]
Lord knows

Lord knows
[one final cough]

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
[still coughing]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
And Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows

Lord knows!

The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

One-time!  One-time!
Fuck the five-oh cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin, fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin up
I'm gettin lost in the weed, man, gettin high
Livin everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
Probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...

Duckin one-time! (Lost Soul)
How it start, how it start
Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
Only streets livin do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time
Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time! Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls...
Lost Souls nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a Lost Soul
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time!

My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with
a three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack
My stack's fat, I used to take new
One love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you

But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day
Crime for pay, I'm on my way, but don't know, where I'ma end up
I swear to God, it's just a setup
And these are the words from the mind of a Lost Soul (I'ma Lost Soul)

Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin crazy after dark,
These narcs be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin Gs buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'ma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on wit it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game

Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'ma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paints the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggaz in penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggaz with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

[Chorus with ad libs]

I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin Cristal, start thinkin 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

My shit's phenomenal, droppin like domino
Comin with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggaz nationwide doin work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
(nigga!)

[Chorus:]

[Big Syke]
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

[E. D. I.]
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin my own that's tokin chokin off-a glocks smokin
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
Gettin niggaz fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin a watch out for cops
Gettin kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my bitches

Money over motherfuckin bitches

Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes

She was..
Born A heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold
Still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die
Was only 15
Should have been a beauty queen
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
Little girl don't cry
'Coz even though they died
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery
But look at what you gettin'
It's a blessing in disguise
When you find out your pregnant
No money, no home
And even though you all alone
You'se got to do this on your own
So baby go on
I wish you luck
And if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand
The way it feels when you fighting the world
Facing all this drama
When mama's just A little girl

[Chorus:]

Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she's a??
Time ain't on her side
Mama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high

[Verse 2: Tupac]

At 16 what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
She didn't listen, had s**
Watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines 9 months
Then finally it's time
What do we find?
A little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime at no time of the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police
Don't come home (why)
'Coz mammas acting crazy
At the hospital
'Bout to have another baby
Like the rose from concrete
Grown within
Blessed with twins
How the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began a closest family
Such insanity
A happy home
For one act inhumanity
Plus mammas said the seed was corrupted
Used the rubber belly
Begging us to breathe if she love us
Now mamma sits quiet
Sipping peppermint schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)
How could mamma bring a thug like me into this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama
Cause mommas just a little girl

[Chorus:]

Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Liven if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Cause ama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high
(How could she raise us)

[Verse 3: Tupac]

Now
Would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot
Now look here
I see her clutching her son
In her arms she hurt
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfill prophecy
But who could stop the grief?
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top me
Probably be an innocent man
But still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse?
Nothing but pain
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen
Cause everybody's in paying back society
I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur
My eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die for we get it
Though we she'd tears
So many peers I done buried
Worried and scared
Knowing I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world
No-one cares
No it ain't fair
But we all there
And do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
Mamma told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about coward
What you niggas want?

(hey)
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha
You' just a little girl
See mammas just a little girl

And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this drama
But to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary
We would all celebrate it's tenacity
We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well
We are the roses (echo)
This is the concrete (echo)
And these are my damaged petals (echo)
Don't ask me why (echo)
Thank god nigga (echo)
Ask me how (echo)
(hahaha)

You see, mama's just a little girl"

Oh-hahhh
[2Pac]
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live?  No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

I got nothing to lose

[Verse Two: Dramacydal]

Could somebody help me?  I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route?  For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'l', but oh well

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finaly get to rest?  Through this supression
They punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game

Heh, hahahahahahah

So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

Sheeit, ju motherfuckin right
I'm the bitch that's keepin it live and keepin it hot
When you punk ass niggaz don't
Nigga Westside, what!  Bring it on

[Tupac]
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
Exorcisin all demons
Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
To bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me
Make the frontpage primetime live on tv
Nigga my girlfriend, baby forty-five but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

[girl]
What!! I'm bustin on you punk ass niggaz *automatic gunfire*
Run nigga run! *Gunfire* I'm on yo' ass nigga! *Gunfire continues*
Run nigga, duck and hide!  Nigga I'm bustin all you bitches!
Run nigga, yeah!  Westside!  Uh uh uh!  Die nigga die!

[Tupac]
My girlfriend, blacker than the darkest night
When niggaz act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend, though we seperated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine, started out my life of crime
Wit you, bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
It's true, nothin compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin, me and my girlfriend

[Chorus: Tupac]

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend
[repeat 2X]

[Tupac]
I was too immature
To understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drop of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes -- now it's time for war
Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
Loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang wit the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend

[Chorus:]

[Tupac]
I love finger fuckin you, all of a sudden I'm hearin thunder
When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home, me and my girlfriend

[Chorus 3X]

Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind -- look for me

For each other, cuz we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgettin the party poppin
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop actin phony
Don't forget tto bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, duckin bullets,

Introduce a drug called crack
To us ghetto teens [echo]
Got a law for raw niggas now
Playa what it be like? [echo]
When will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes [echo]
Can't seem to focus
Hopeless
With violent thoughts
I wrote this
Got these devils petrified
Hiding from my hocus pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency
And over time [echo]
Affiliated
Clearly click a military mind [echo]
May god forgive us
Though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealing
>From the womb to the block [echo]
My live mind got me surviving 5 shots [echo]
My 45 got me fortified with live rounds
When shit stick
We plot hits
When our block spits
All hail
Out on bail
Wrath of 2pacalypse [echo]
Forever ghetto
Necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw thug niggas
Never left the boot camp

One of the suqads finest [echo]
Skilled in gorilla warfare
And blessed
Work with firearm [echo]

Contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black smith and wessons [echo]
Putting up on?? In the military state of mind [echo]
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovas pan the borderline [echo]

Picture being put in position to move [echo]
And you can't move
Cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock
That's when the madness beings [echo]
So I start to focusing
My thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law [echo]
And the law that we live by is to stay true to self
In this case beady eye [echo]
Why try
Everybody lie
About the block
True soldier mentality
This is how we rock and move [echo]

Stick and move
Time to show what kinda nigga
Move or get moved on
Lets see whos strong [echo]

In the days of the strange
Where nothing stays the same
With new faces come through with similar game [echo]
And who you thought them
Really ain't they (echo)
Catching deja vu
Of the game people play [echo]
It's a call for re-adjustment
Fine tune your positions
You slipping and tripping
Instead of bobbing and dipping [echo]
Will never let this world of stress get me [echo]
Taking breathing techniques
Slay you with tai chi [echo]

What did you change
To get a break
In the world of snakes
And those who fake
Elimination I'm facing
Destruction

Rushing to the goal line

One way out

For this black soul
Shit is outta control
I'm fighting for my position
To be a fetus in this world I am entering [echo]
And my face is sentencing for repentance [echo]
Before my body was fully formed into a human [echo]
I was already consuming weed
Cause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's [echo]
Maybe that's why in the 90's
I drop g's when I drop degrees [echo]
When I ease across the block
With Pac [echo]
And got all you niggas shot
You didn't think
Boot Camp click would link
With the outlaw minded
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep gorilla tactics in every line

2Pac,Minnie The Moocher,/2/2+pac/minnie+the+moocher_10202052.html,"(2pac)
I know this girl and her name is Minnie
Livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
Met her at a school dance so I took a chance
Walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance
Got to my car, put the key in the ignition
Turned on the slow jams, I was on a mission
I was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
I was ""J"" and knockin' boots right down the socks
She was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?
But when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet
I couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?
But that was my first experience with minnie THE moocher!!

(2pac)
Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from
A dream girl to many brothers, but true to none
Her reputation was enormous - a real go getter
And once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her
Maybe it was her smile, her personality or
The way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
But whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert
Real heart-breaker, but never get hurt
She had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond
Helpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'
Met with Politicians, peace to many others
Suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers
She took the power that they possessed
And Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
Minnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
But he wanted payment for the things he did for her
He grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
Minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand
She was a legend to everyone who knew her
That's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher

(Ray Tyson)
Minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler
Addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker
He took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown
He bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds
She was an addict, tired of the static and poverty
Sick of the same ghetto misery
See, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
Smokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement
Then one day their relationship stopped
When Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops
Minnie was hurt, lost without a clue
To her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new
So she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems
She cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams

(Ray Tyson)
She had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that this girl was much needin'
A plush house made of gold and steel
A diamond car with a platt in the wheel
Now you might think this is a lot of stuff
But to Minnie this was not enough
He bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses
His meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a fortune in nickels and dimes
And she sat around and counted it a billion times
She had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'
Had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin'!!
She would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
Then she dissin', with zero reply"
2Pac,My Block,/2/2+pac/my+block_10201893.html,"Damn, take a ride, to my block
My block, that's right! Heh
F'real on my motherfuckin block

[Verse One]

They got a nigga
Sheddin tears, reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin on a four - five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... On my block

[Chorus: a bunch of kids - see the liner notes]

Livin life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still playyyyyy
But on our block we still playyyyyy...

[Verse Two]

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
And the system's sucidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... On my block

[Chorus with minor variations]

[Verse Three]

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from ak's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus... On my block

[Chorus with minor variations]

[Verse Four]

And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybod knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... From my block

[Chorus with minor variations; kids repeat last line over and over]

I lay awake tonite
Because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see you the feeling gets stronger
You sit with me closer we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter
Cause I want you taht much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty
I'm fallin' for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinkin' into
I wake up sweaty when i'm thinkin' of you
Then we make our contact
And I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
What have I gotten into
I feel possessed by you
I have these thought at nite of undressin' you
It's kinda obvious blind men might see
But he doesn't so he keps on trustin me
Leaves me alone with you when he's on vacation
But how could he leave me with this temptation
What do I do go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher cause I suffer from a burnin' heart
My burnin' heart
Ray:
Girl you are my one and only
You are my angel and now you wanna leave me lonely
What did I do baby did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken and now you wanna make me sad
I remember when this love affair first started
We were so in love and now we are departed
Girl I'll buy anything your heart desires
I have to let you know baby your my fire
Warm and wet each kiss I prolonged
It's your sweet caress that makes life too strong
Just being with you and see the two of us
Walking along the beach you know you are my peach
So sweet and my love I surrender
No need to pretend that you want it to end
I'll neva let you go your foreva my girl
You know why?
Cause girl you are my world

Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know whta to do
I could forget about you pretend taht we neva met
But when I hear bout you I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks to reinforce thoughts
That are already there
So many times my eyes are caught up in a passanger stare
Play the role like you don't matter
He swears taht we hate eachotha
Your my addiction cause I fiend for you desperately
Stand here fantasizing cause you're next to me
What can I do with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times where every curve is
I think he reads my mind so I'm feelin nervous
I wanna tell you how I feel but that wouldn't help
I would only cause problems so I keep to myself
It drives me crazy to see you sittin' with him
A tear goes down my cheek because I see you kiss him
I know the words ya sayin' b4 they could be said
Hear the thoughts you're thinkin' b4 they come into your head
Wouldn't hurt the bratha for anything in this world
But damm I feel in love with his girl
My burnin' heart
Ray:
My heart is burnin' you know it's yearnin'
For your sweet caress
I lay in exstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
You know you love me why must you deny yourself?
What I could offer you yet you want somebody else
It's not taht girl well then girl what could it be
I hope I'm good for you cause girl you're good for me
Many nites I cried and tried to make this work
Then act a fool and croon the cruel like a jerk
Well I'm sorry baby I have to let you know
You are my life my strenght I refuse to let you go
You are so fruitful baby you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream that you'd become my wife
Day in and day out it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart don't make me stay out
I love you honey cause you're like a work of art
You've got me on fire My burnin' heart
Repeat first verse"

Hahaha!

Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil duck when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin from the future, escapin in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz

[Chorus: sung]
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin out for all mine

Haha.. Bring artillery and roll with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M. O. B. Soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer, ain't tryin to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M. O. B., 'til I die, when we ride niggaz disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin sign
Two hired guns bustin everyone, yellin everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
Bleedin like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz

[Chorus:]

Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin
See me in physical form, my niggaz swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin jealous niggaz 'til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
And send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggaz, observe and shake niggaz
The only way to see six figures, is break niggaz
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on..
Set to explode, my M. O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog

These are

My words to my firstborn, nothing left to hear

Can you picture

Young niggas in the a rush to grow

The hard times in the pen

Had to crush his throat

Probaly never even saw it coming

To busy bullshitting

Caught him with his mouth runnin

Ain't that a bitch

They got me twisted in this game

The fedz, and the po police pointing pistols at my brain

I wonder if I'm wrong

Cause I'm thugged out

My homies murdered execution style

Runnin in the drug house

What was suppose to be a easy hit

Now shit is flipped

Cause niggas died over bullshit

It's not my dream

Seeing pictures of a broken man

No witnesses

Only the question of a smoked man

Young addalicent in the prime live the life of crime

But what ain't logical

We hobble through these trying times

Living blind

Lord help me with my troubled soul

Why all my homiez had to die before they got to grow

And right before I put my head on the pillow

I saw a prayer

One love to the thug's in heaven

I'll see you there

It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born

Help me make it threw the storm

The words to my first born feel me

My words to my firstborn

My words to my first born

And I be rocking mike since funky drummer
These... make habit, bit lavish lifestyle,

You're laughable, you won't survive no more
I turn the channels, you niggers ain't live no more

Now of course I want peace on the streets
But realistically
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash
I learned fast
Using violent measures
Memories of adolescent years
Their was unity
But after puberty we brought war
To our community
So many bodies dropping
Its gotta stop
I want to help
But still I'm stepping
Keeping my weapon
Must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow
Ain't never reach me
Plus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty
It seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my 'lil homies
Lose there childhood to guns
Nobody cries no more
Cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace
If you can't grant it
Niggas fighting across the whole planet
So we can never be peace

[Chorus:]

Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace,
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there can never be peace

[Verse 2: Kastro]

Somebody owes me
Will they control me?, nah
I ain't a hater playa
But I want all you got
Your babies have babies
Now we fighting each other
My dogs got rabies
They biting each other
'n' it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Big fully is a bully
And he don't mind dying
And I gotta be bright
Miss sign after sign
Time after time
After time after time
And I don't like nobody
They don't like me more
And I'm cool with that finally
But they heard it before
Dog
We living in a prison
Losing our religion on em
Thanks given when thankful just for living in hell
Damn homey I don't mean to be harsh
But it's the devil in the ghetto trying to tear it apart
And if we make it up out
We still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace?
Just the peace in my heart
Never

[Kastro talking]
The only peace we got
Is the peace in our heart
Or the peace in our mind
Right there in piece that we hold in our waste line
Feel me dog?
Cm'on

[Chorus:]

Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace, (never)
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Coz there can never be peace

[Verse 3: Napolean]

Things are changing
Nigga you better fantasize
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto where peace is not a part of it
We all goin' need God if we plan to get out of this
Niggas spending too much time hating on each other
Niggas buyin' guns
Load em up
Aim at each other
And the victim is you and me
The secret is true indeed
The good die
Mostly over bullshit
Repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love
But the rest of me knows war is what's waiting for us
So I stays ready
Keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns
Never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the imposters
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
Cause they'll never be peace
So don't rely on it
Soldiers die for
And in the ghetto, they trying for it
Fuck peace

[Chorus X3]

Will there ever be peace?
Or all we all just headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know there never be peace,
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Cause there can never be peace

[Tupac Talking]

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength till my niggas get a piece
We can't have peace
How the fuck we gonna live happy if we ain't got none?
You motherfuckers is smiling, but I'm mean mugging
Why? Cause gotta be thugging
I've seen drugs done turned this motherfucking hood out
All us niggas acting up
Wild ass motherfucking adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood and you have a funeral every motherfucking weekend
And you motherfuckers talking about peace?
Nigga, it ain't no motherfucking peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker?
You ain't heard?
Little babies getting smoked
Motherfuckers killing there whole family
'Lil kids getting thrown off buildings
Motherfuckers gettin abused
Peace? Niggas you out your motherfucking mind?
Fuck peace
We can't never have peace, till you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'Till you fucking clean up the dirt you dropped
'Till we get a piece
Fuck peace

Give me a mic to light and competition will drop
Fast or slow, I'll go and no one is gonna stop me yo
You must be kiddin', you swear you're gonna drop me no
Well sure as battlin' is bad for your health
Know you're confident my friend but don't fool yourself
My mic's a weapon, I'm steppin' with a capable rhyme
Yo, your time for playin' is over you got your crew I got mine

Proceed with caution I cannot be stopped
A deadly weapon that is kept inside a sentry lock
Strong hold holdin' on but there's no holds barred
Fuck around and feel the wrath and you're forever scarred
Anybody want to battle just step the hell up
I'll toss your ass like a salad and eat you all up

You get discouraged because I hold the other end
If I let go, like all the others you will fall

Upset to get to me sweatin' me for the rhymes that I write

And the lyrics are the bullets that I'm loadin' it with
You wanna beat me homeboy, you will be destroyed
Get dropped like a habit and played like a toy
Never defeated not conceited, but let's face facts
Couldn't beat me with a motherfuckin' baseball bat
If I gave you a bomb that was nuclear armed
You could shoot it at me sucker and I wouldn't get harmed
Cause punk you can't stop me, bullets couldn't drop me
Stand on a mountain and still couldn't top me, huh

It was true when you heard I'm the wiz a word

The needle on the nuance stuck in overload
Don't laugh cause I'm serious mister mysterious
Don't make me mad (why?) Cause I get furious

Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my Dogz from the County Jail
Sendin' me mail
Heard the blocks in the same shape
Ain't nothin' changed
niggaz slangin' at the same place
The same faces
We suppose to alwayz hate our foes
This lifestyle is forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding Crocodile tears

maybe now they feel us
In this act of war
more casualties
no survivors
Any man the defies us
Quickly dies
Cuz we Ridahs
In my quest for chips
We wear vest
Equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
Cuz niggaz died over information
How much more can we take?
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet
So lets make Clinton pay

They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we posses
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smoking weed
Bumpin' his beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery
Till he got a friend like me

Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell,

I could picture livin'

Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die
Nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties
Why the fuck should I let you live?
When I'm dead inside
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at their whole crew
nigga remember me
Hit up my Outlaw set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask

My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
When ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain?  Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain

[Chorus: (interpretation of Method Man's ""Bring the Pain"")]

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain) [variations]

[repeat 4X]

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Line up my adversaries, blast on sight, and fuck your boyfriend
Bitch, I want some ass tonight, you know my steelo
Alize and Cristal, weed sure you heard of all the
Sure you've heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin, my glock's spittin rounds
Niggaz fallin down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me?  Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin no more pain

[Chorus 4X]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Bury me that's what they all say, it's time to make a killin
Sure to make a million with Devante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin it ain't nothin we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin so watch the guns bust
You niggaz'll bleed, fuckin with me you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace nigga, with no more pain

[Chorus 8X]

[Tupac talking over the chorus]
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah
No more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga?  Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggaz, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain

Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do?
Hey that's Devante droppin that beat like that beyatch
In case you wonderin
And jealous niggaz, hahaha, see y'all niggaz
Motherfuckin niggaz are shit
Hey

[chorus being whispered in the background]
Westsiiiiiide!  Death to everybody that ain't down with me
That's on, feel me?  Hahaha
Oh yeah, to the cowards, you know what I mean
Just feel that, Thug Life, shit don't stop
Motherfuckers got Downs Syndrome, motherfuckers
Weak ass niggaz, skanless cunts, fuckin C. E.. O. 's
Put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Put your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga no more pain
Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse
Feel me nigga, haha
No more pain
Hey Devante I'm givin these motherfuckers choices
Niggaz can roll with us, or they can be rolled under us
That's on you nigga, what you wanna do?
Last year we was lettin these niggaz kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust

2Pac,Nothin But Love,/2/2+pac/nothin+but+love_20000792.html,"Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin Hennesey, smokin weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin, everybody havin fun
And it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and..
He's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love

[Chorus:]
[singers] Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
[2Pac] I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
[repeat 4X]

I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin, his breath still stinkin
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love

[Chorus:]

When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me, ""That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love

The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money we never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
At 13 can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me
Wish he would've helped me
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age gettin' paid
And I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me?
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose
Everybody gotta die
Say good-bye to the bad guy
That one you fucked when you passed by
Buck buck [gunshots] from a Glock
Tempured glass fly
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes
And you'd be crazy too
With nothing to lose

[Chorus:]

I got nothing to lose
(that's why I got gang related)
Got nothing to lose [5x]
Nothing to lose

[Verse 2:]

I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of the Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen'
Here we go again
Ain't nothing seperating us from a mack 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustla older
Straight soldier bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply
See me striking down the block hittin' co'ners
Mobbin' like a muthafucka livin' like I wanna
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
Chase me nigga
Zig-zaggin' through the freeway
Race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die
And you could walk a mile in my shoes
And you'd be crazy too

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm startin' to lose hope
It seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo
Peepin' out the window alone on my own
I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household I'm out cold
In the streets give me muthafucking peace
I got nothing to lose
And something to prove
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true
I wonder when they kill me
Is there a Heaven for a real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke
With no hope li'l skinny muthafucka wantin' dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too
With nothing to lose

We be the craziest... Muthafucka!
You know!
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest!"

A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets

Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin
Cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, ""Why them niggaz swearin?""
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
Or takin leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Riker's Isle

Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. And why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...

[Eminem]
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
There's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we aint
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing....

[2pac]
One day at a time

Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Khaddafi, but Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
That's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains

I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride

Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game aint changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin...

Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?

They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
Marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me
My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin, two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious
Of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her
Like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm Thuggin, and every day
I'm a hustler lookin to get paid

They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer?  I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... Well Hell
Can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me

""Only fear of death is comin back reincarnated""

I ain't scared to die
To my homies in heaven

I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
Or will you scream, when you fry?

I don't fear death
My only fear of death is comin back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P.
And Big Kill, R.I.P.
And all you other O. G. 's, who go down
I don't fear death"

Only God can judge me, is that right?
[synth voice] Only God can judge me now
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

[Chorus: 2Pac]

[synth voice] Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
[synth voice] Only God
Hahahahahahahaha

[heart monitor: long beep]
Flatline!

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

I hear the doctor standing over me [heart monitor: beeping slowly]
Screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my iv
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me [beeping sound stops]
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this?  I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me?  And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that it's
A million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me

[Chorus with variations]

[Interlude: 2Pac]

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live

[Verse Three: Rappin 4-Tay, Tupac]

Pac I feel ya, keep servin it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz, ""You can fade him,"" punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me

[Chorus with variations]

[4Tay] Only God main
[2Pac] That right?
[4Tay] That's real
[2Pac] Hahahahahaha

Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
And recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
Over the fence and open fire

""Alright now, here we go""

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
At the coppers that persue me, beotch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas

""Alright now, here we go""

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear?  I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

Hahahaha, Thug Life!"

Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause it's major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail

Out on Bail (You know what fuckin' time it is)
ThugLife will never fail (I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm going straight to 50,000 BIATCH!!!)

Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a President)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild thru the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail

[Chorus x1]
Out on Bail
ThugLife (see) will never fail (Out on bail - biatch!)
Thuglife niggaz (You know what time it is)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)

[Tupac]
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require may be closed casket
Who can you blame?  It's insane what we dare do
Witness an evil that these men do, bitches in, too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
Pull the fuckin fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last?  Heaven or Hell?  Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell?  Aand if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy?  Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin to hover over niggaz til we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I comense to get wicked, spittin rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a

[Chorus:]

[Dramacydal]
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just.. Swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck em!""
And if I'm next.. Just let a nigga step with somethin
I ain't fearin nuttin

Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin
(now he mad) Top speed (smokin weed) blasted (biotch!)

Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin in the river, what is they sayin?
Talkin bout prayin -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin to take my wealth

[Chorus 2X]

[Tupac]
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggaz run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin real strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel

Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin bastards

Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out
Rolling a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out
So when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas
Conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business

Ay
What's happening Pac
Yeah I know we never to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through
Meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see
Now they all in the court room blaming me
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live

Only real niggas stay on top

Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus,
I was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust,
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain,
So I'm hopeless,
Rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry,
I'm about to crash up on the curb, 'cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me,
What should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family,
What else could I do?
But be a thug,
Out slangin' with the homies,
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs,
Got my mind on danger,
Never been a stranger to homicide,
My city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys,
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young,
But still a victim of the 12 gauge,
My memories of a corpse,
Mind full of sick thoughts,
And I ain't goin' back to court,

As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation indispute nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my answer shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power

Coming straight that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor can't last
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out

It's ya panther power that makes you a star""

Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history

Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community think of unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
Panter power

[Chorus]
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

[Tupac]
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation indispute nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my answer shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power

2Pac,Papa'z Song,/2/2+pac/papaz+song_20000825.html,"Daddy's home...

[2Pac]
Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
For you to be comin home talkin that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the fuck off, pops.. Fuck you!

[2Pac]
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

[Chorus:]
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Wycked]
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

[Chorus:]
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
I'm so sorry
For all this time
For all this time (so sorry)
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[2Pac]
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""wanna be your father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry..

[Chorus:]
I'm so sorry (so sorry)
For all this time (so, so sorry)
For all this time (I'm so so sorry)
For all this time (fuck that!)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (no)
For all this time (so sorry)
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Tupac - impersonating his father]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggaz, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin
Know there's dope bein sold, but +I+ ain't the one sellin!
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggaz put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottwillers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?  Will God forgive me
For all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggaz shootin at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheamin on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin and my hands is swollen

This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss playa
Thug, branded to be a women layer
So mny playa haters, imitaters steady swangin
Make me wanna start back bangin
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin forty glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While I'm sippin on Re-mi
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
Ninety-six big body, sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!

You watch you mouth around my mama you couldn't cuss man
I had a down ass homie though; we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin forties, lil' shorties livin naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin on the block, slangin rocks and makin profits
I couldn't fuck with the schhhoooollll life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a toooollll man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin
Hustlin in the rain felt no pain cause we drinkin
Playin them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck that's how we do it (ha ha!)
It's two niggaz comin up out the hood
Livin life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the po-lice, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin on my nigga in jail
Tryin to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!

Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor
Pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin on?

Drinkin on gin, smokin on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
Cause I'm losin all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin with them suckers til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, ""Son there'll be days like this""
Don't wanna think so -- I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin big and strong
And I'd love'm like one of my own, til you come home and
The years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin back to back
Throwin dogs on them suckers runnin up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture

2Pac,Power Of A Smile,/2/2+pac/power+of+a+smile_20646872.html,"[Layzie Bone - reciting 'Power of a Smile' poem]
The power of a gun can kill, and the power of fire can burn
The power of wind can chill, and the power of mind can learn
The power of anger, can raise inside until it tears you apart
But the power of a smile, especially yours, can heal a frozen heart
[Krayzie Bone over poem]
And tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise of a smile, smile
Yes, maybe tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise, of a smile
[Wish Bone]
Rest in peace..
Tupac, Bone Thugs
In His Own Words
Let's go
[Wish Bone]
And tomorrow, morrow, morrow, and tomorrow, morrow
And tomorrow, morrow, and tomorrow we
[Hook - Krayzie Bone (Wish Bone)]
I see the light... (and tomorrow, morrow, morrow)
I can see the light... (and tomorrow, tomorrow)
I see the light... (and tomorrow we)
See the light that shines... (and tomorrow we)
[Krayzie Bone]
Well, we still looking for better days
Hoping tomorrow can bring us some bigger and better things
So we can escape this maze, and they give us our change in every way
And maybe tomorrow, can bring us the truth
And there'll be no more use, for the pain and sorrow
Let's put it to use and then maybe the youth, can come and follow
And we can leave all our problems in the bottle, tomorrow
Maybe god'll wipe our eyes and we'll never have to cry no more
Or even better, have to die no more
Politicians can't tell us lies no more, he decides no more
Maybe tomorrow, it can be our daylight
Just might be our sunshine, sunshine..
Yesterday is filled with so much misery and drama
And today it don't seem like I'm getting any further
Praying tomorrow we can somehow come out of the struggle
And need no more hustle, no stumblin cause we all one muscle..
Still looking for a better day, day, and a better way, way, way..
So let's hope tomorrow... Can lead us to the place we tryin to be..
In heavenly harmony, in heavenly harmony!
[Hook - 2X]
[Wish Bone]
Where there's a will there's a way, don't let it stand in your way
Look 'em straight in they face, let 'em know you ain't playing no games
We searching for better days, wanna live them better ways
What I promise, heart is all you need to rock
Be honest, succeed, just look at me!
If I can do it, you can do it, we can do it, just believe, believe, believe!
When I lay down, I think about some of the wrong things I done
So I pray now, for God to erase some of that wrong
Wipe my soul clean, to be wanted, when he calls me, when he calls me!
So I can't sleep, cause I'm worried, I done did things, lord forgive me!
It's a damn shame, the things we do to get it our way!
Snitch on thugs, just to get it, your pay!
Nowadays I act right, in the past we used to fight
Where the loyalty at? Where them real street thugs? Where the thug life?
Where there's a will there's a way!
[Hook - 2X]
[Layzie Bone]
So as the hours pass by, in the event of my demise
Tell my momma not to cry, these are the words of the wise
Look at liberty needing glasses now that the promise been broken
For the better, keep on hopin, powerful words that's spoken
What I'm quotin is a G, acquired his knowledge from the streets
Makaveli, Tupac Shakur, was the rose that grew from concrete
America's most complete artist, regardless, one of the hardest
On a mission to make it better, with the soul of Malcom and Martin
Mixed with a little Garvin, today he got us callin
Our brighter star is fallen, but now before he was ballin
Out of control, quick to let a nigga know what he stood for, be a friend or foe
And I bring the truth in the booth cause ain't nobody gon help me
This is life, it's a gamble, and I'ma scramble till my pockets wealthy
Fuck what they tell me, I'm all about my biz
Bitch, street biz or showbiz, I'ma make y'all know this
And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child
Don't you ever be afraid to smile, smile for me now
And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child
Don't you ever be afraid to smile... The power of a smile!

Verse One: 2Pac

Now up and at em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin, I'm all in
Shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
Chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, are you Still Down?

Chorus: 2Pac

Raise em up... Are you Still Down?
(repeat 5X)

Verse Two: 2Pac

I'm gettin high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin on with the wasted youth, please God
Come and save me (save me), had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
He need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin my ass and gettin no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin lace niggaz with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin, see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you Still Down

Chorus

Verse Three: 2Pac

I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin wrong, my mama told me, ""Baby it's on""
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin cheese
Buyin all the things on tv, and gettin skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin wild through the town
Please tell me, are you Still Down?

Are you Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me (repeat 2X)
Are you Still Down, to raise em up?

Are you Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me (repeat 3X)
Are you Still Down, to raise em up?

Are you Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me (repeat 3X)
Are you Still Down, to raise em up?

That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
Raisssse em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me? Now get that shit written down

Of this shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me

Dump em and get dropped

Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga, I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot
Takin on your gat while your girl gets hot and rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Hold it to my grave
I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some come to run while the others cause static

Sendin slugs to the guts
I'm bustin up outta the page cuz they got me locked up

Always want static, like boom holla at ya later
Homie this ain't no love in this town that I come from
Niggas be wantin funkin then I stomp em, they don't want none
Girls be on my jock and they playin me for that
But fool I can't help it cuz I was raised up like a mack
Jealous because I'm black, Jack wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me and watch the Klan bury me
Got to pack the steel for the personal protection
Ak, 45's, assault rifles, Smith & Wesson
I'm no longer stressin
Learnin, gotta live long

Get a bag a spliffs for the homies, blaze up all of these
But if you wanna flex, get in my Kool Aid punks, raise up offa

Just back the fuck up of me, cuz you can't get none a these
It's that og female comin straight up out the pp's
So step to the side then raise the fuck up off me, brah
Cuz if I take it to that level I'ma light this motherfucker up
Now it's on you, you better try to lose your shit
Cuz if you don't, trust me I got you trick
You better try to choose it and lose it
Stay outta mine 'fore this shit get way stupid
These niggas I fuck with believe in passin gats
Can't leave hoe, without my strap
Not givin a fuck about nothin
Slidin through the spot with my face mask muggin
Lookin motherfuckers up and down

Why these fat niggas floatin around?

And you ain't goin' back
Nah, nah, nah, we got to show

This is for the honeys, the [Incomprehensible]
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well, let 'em know

You fuckin' with niggaz that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't beggin', just tryin' to relocate between ya legs
Drippin' wet as we experiment in sweaty s**
When you met me, you wouldn't let me
And now you straight beggin' to s** me
Got you undressin' to test me and uhh

Shut me down if ya want and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharin' skirts

I hopin' you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin', got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin' to make my songs pay
Makin' love all day against the wall in the hallway

Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try

I see ya blushin' like ya want somethin', come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touchin'

Erotic fuckin', my up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of bustin' until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top
500 Benz and plenty cash to help a nigga get the ass

You can ride out the spoke coke to get your lobster and crab
'Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never say
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave

I'll be your nigga as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga whose spoke, coke can be the man
He wine and dine but me and you, we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines

Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweatin', let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin' 'til yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang

If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention the multiple positions I inflict
A boss playa, freaky motherfucker, can I dick

Uhh, it's on and poppin', now you see what I was seein'
Why yo' eyes rollin', Luke seen ya girl, I ain't goin'
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock, I stretch out the c***
Hold the boots and let the nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm goin' home tonight

You say you don't need a man but I don't care
You in the presence of a playa

From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain, so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister!  It's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on tv
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin mc
They won't be happy till I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face, pump up the bass
And join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay

I guess they scared of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
In fact, they tryin to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they don't like what I'm talkin bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about

Seen A Show With Marvin Gaye Last Night, It Had Me Shook
Drippin Peppermint Schnapps, With Jackie Wilson, And Sam Cooke
Then Some Lady Named Billie Holiday
Sang Sittin There Kickin It With Malcolm, 'til The Day Came
Little Latasha Sho' Grown
Tell The Lady In The Liquorstore That She's Forgiven, So Come Home
Maybe In Time You'll Understand Only God Can Save Us
When Miles Davis Cuttin Lose With The Band
Just Think Of All The People That You Knew In The Past
That Passed On, They In Heaven, Found Peace At Last
Picture A Place That They Exist, Together
There Has To Be A Place Better Than This, In Heaven
So Right Before I Sleep, Dear God, What I'm Askin
Remember This Face, Save Me A Place, In Thug's Mansion

[Chorus:]
I Reminisce On Tha Fast Times
Can't Explain, Just What Attracts Me To This Dirty Game
I Reminisce On Tha Past Crimes
Gold Chains, Some Extra Change, And Tha Street Fame

[2pac: Talking]
I Owe Them Everything. That's Why
I Owe Everything To The 'hood.
I've Got Love There.
I've Got Love From Thugs
And The Street Dudes.
And That Focuses Me Back
On What I Should Be Doing,
Lay Out The Real Mat
On The World And How It Is.
The Message Is,
Young Black Males Could Do Anything
If You Just Give Us A Shot,
Stop Trying To Beat Us Down.
And To My Homeboys, We Need
To Be In Control Of Ourselves.
I'm Not Saying I'll Change The World,
But I Guarantee I'll Spark
The Brain That Will Change The World."

2Pac,Resist The Temptation,/2/2+pac/resist+the+temptation_20695777.html,"[2Pac]

Resist the temptation of the beast,
You'll slip and loose your grip
And forever fall a sleep.
The venom is contagious, beware of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turn's out to be hell.
I wonder if she knows the devils taken off her clothes, deep into her soul
Slow, now he's in control.
Poppas doing worse, a victim of the deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first to leave the ghetto in a hurse, and oh how it hurts.
The children pay the biggest price,
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life.
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone's at the top supplying us with much crack.
Keep them in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let'em all get paid, wont live to see another day.
See they never got a breath of the sunshine,
Now the kids addicted and only hit it one time.
We are destined to be dead as a nation,
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation.

Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low can you go, before you reach the lowest level.
As everybody sits and stares,
There's no use looking in you eyes cause there isn't anybody there.
And though it may make you wanna cry,
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why.
I guess you think they will understand,
You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman.
Now there's no turning back, in fact
It's decided that would live and die for the crack.
You got no friends cause you cheated them all,
You feel lonely, low, defeated and small.
No one was there when I took the wrong path,
And nobody cared if I died in a blood bath.
But is this my destiny?
Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me.
Cause I'm ready to end it all,
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all.
I didn't mean to be a bother,
A failure as a son, a husband and a father.
I wish I could turn back the time,
Go back and let it find why I let it crack my mind.
And my only explanation, it came to this
Resist the temptation"
2Pac,Revolution,/2/2+pac/revolution_20646870.html,"(2pac talkin)
You know what gang violence is, mostly
And the people don't want you to hear this
Somebody shoots your family member
So of course you retaliate, You know what I mean
Same thing the you. S does except nobody even shot their family members
You know, they see that, somebody bomb a school
And all these people get killt
So the united states feel like ooh that's messed up
We gotta go show em who tha real killers
This country was built on gangs, you know
I think this country still is run on gangs
Republicans, democrats, the police department, the fbi
The cia, those are gangs, you know what I mean
The correctional officers,
I had a correctional officer tell me straight,
We the biggest gang in New York state
Straight up
[Verse:]
Supress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack, to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggaz, now playa what it be like?
When will niggaz see they got us bleedin with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency in over time (muahahaha)
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin, from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin five rounds
My forty-five got my fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our glock spits
All hail, Out on Bail, Wrath of 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug niggaz never left the boot camp

Now I was born as a rebel, making trouble for the devil
Take this gang bang shit, to a whole nother level
Can you feel me now? Armies in every city
Definition of power, players are you with me?
See the war is the profecy, survival is the strategy
Rest in peace to my comrades that deceased
(Busta Rhymes: Notorious B. I. G)
Organize these streets in time
Youll have these devils petrified of a nigga in his right mind
They tell us that we hopeless and hell bound
This for the brothers in penetentiaries jailed down
I got you in my heart till tha day I die
Think of tha damage we can do, if we wasnt high
Can you picture me loc? Its a thugs wrath
Political contracts and blood baths
For Matulu Shakur up in the rikers,
Though they got you, I never let them stop me
The struggle continues

Now if we do want to live a thug life and a gangsta life and all of that,
Ok, so stop being cowards and lets have a revolution
But we don't wanna do that, dudes just wanna live of character
They wanna be cartoons, but if they really wanted to do something
If they was that tough, alright, lets start our own country
Lets start a revolution, lets get out of here, lets do something

I need more than just romantic feelings
When shit is frantic need a bitch that's just as

To be a pealer and have a bachelor in cold feelings
Mind for numbers hate to wonder with this drug dealin'
Thug feelings make me a villain to them ph imbalanced
Civilians
Don't let them hurt feelings turn this lesson to a
Killing
Game spilling my prophecy fore filling
To be involved with a killing must be immune to
Squealing
Listen lady what does it take to get you out of crazy?
Pass you a loaded 38 and bust on fools who play me
This is how I plan a night
First we ride on them bustas then we dine eating dinner
By candle light
Be alert and put in work with a thug passion
I'm a king and you the queen up in thugz mansion
Me... Imma neva be a busta I ride for keeps
I know you shy but please reply
Would you ride for me.

[Chorus - 2Pac]
Tell me baby Would you ride 4 me?
Bust on them mothafuckas when they lie 2 me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie just confide in me
Would you die 4 me? Tell me baby would you ride 4 me?
Tell me baby would you ride 4 me?
Would you bank on them niggaz (Bustas) when they lie 2
Me?
Don't ever tell a lie just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride 4 me?

C'mon babe wont you ride for me
Do the time for me just c*** back the 9 and see
How many niggas put a gun in hand
Tell you to take what you can while you running with
Your man
On my order you shoot
Straight counting the loot
You disguised in my boots dip and slide in the coupe...
Unorthodox tripping catch him on missions
Styles twisted daily weak emcees trail me show me how

Telling me
Smoke me instead of jailing me
You know it ain't no Fatal dog and ""J"" without felony
At the telly they yelling me
Play me I give you one try
And I'll let you live long enough to let you see your
Son die
This evilness and wizardry Thug Life specifically it
Can be
Found as deadly as them bullets that keep missing me
So what I'm supposed to do
Just to open up your eyes and see... You got it good
All you have to do is ride for me

[Chorus 2 - 2Pac]
So Tell me baby Would you ride 4 me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie 2 me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie just confide in me
Would you die 4 me? Tell me baby would you ride 4 me?
Tell me baby would you ride 4 me? Would you bomb on
Niggas when they lie 2 me?
Now don't ever tell a lie just confide in me
Would you die for me? Tell me baby would you ride 4 me?

Seen all my homies and it was all to the good
I'm Kurupt... The half-inch villian cold chilling
From the floor to the ceiling and illegal living
Civillians
So much cash is in the bundles
Been there and done done it everything you've done seen
And ever wanted
I'm Kurupt...
Piece me up a piece of the pie many try but many die in
Attempts to ride
Who's the man with ten thousand plans got the grants
And my my squad
We world wide homicidal klan
So many strech their arms out to touch my loot but fuck
Em dog
Beware of the owner cuz the owner will shoot
Meet the dog in the worst way and a nigga like me's
Tight on my worst day
I been rockin mics since the first day my eyes opened
Wide
And finally re-a-lized tell me baby would you ride for
Me.

My thoughts will make you feel the pain of a trained killer
Please believe that I'll never be shamed again
But can I leave the next heavy weight champion?
Call me crazy but no one can fade me
I'm the product of the projects
Lost and crazy
Throw your hands up Mr. Bruno, why?
Big Mike Tyson bout to brutalize that ass tonight
No hesitation for the whole nation
I beat that ass so bad I probably violate probation
Through demonstration as I strategize information
And intend to kill so it's real like I'm catching cases

I let the world know I plan to die
If I don't leave with what I came for I'm leaving high

Now, my first round is for the times that I sit in this cell
The second round is for the media and the lies they tell

Runnin' from the police (Yeah I know what you mean)

No matter what I do, they got a nigga

Still runnin' from the police

(Put them motherfuckin Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)

Verse One: Dramacydal

I ain't got nuttin on my mind, but gettin in some trouble

Lickin shots to they block leavin bloody blood puddles

For some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight

I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight

It's on me, but if I die bury me a motherfuckin G

A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me

With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece

Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the *police*

Nigga, you know that's true

Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin wit a crew

Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re

The O. J. And it's all ok

To that fuckin fake *I shot*, got to play the man

Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand

Damn, I hope it don't spill

Nigga chill, shit is real c*** back my steel

Still runnin' from the *police* I gets no sleep

I got you peepin in my window while I'm smokin indo

But I ain't no motherfuckin track star, *Trator* got a Jeep

Like Big Mouth, runnin through motherfuckers backyards

So I, grabs my piece before I flee

And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me

Lick shots hits spots off on my piece

Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the *police*

Interlude: Don Gargon?? (some ragga toaster, this is a very rough guess)

I bust off! What about the time they pull me from the Bronco

Lay, they tried to c*** me, but them can't gun store

When a batty bwoy do it from the mob

Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad

Look around, look around, punk police

While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test

Look around, look around, punk police

Me hafta blast back, cause de blast is best

Verse Two: Stretch, Notorious B. I. G.

Yo I was, schemin and fiendin for loots and took the crooked route

To, ghetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game

The insane brain, cold gettin fly like a plane

On them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin ruckus

Check it, I grew up a fuckin screwup

Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up

Choppin rocks overnight

The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White

And we got the workers choppin rock, Benz by the flock

And we gettin it, the dirty *pigs* jealous so they sweatin it

I'm lettin off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke

And provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide

We keepin it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel

Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin meal

We had to grow dreads to change our description

*Tupac* on the milk box missin

Show they toes you know they got stepped on

A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon

Run from the *police* picture that, nigga I'm too fat

I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (heavy breathing)

That's why I bust back, it don't phase me

When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze

Summer break, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight

Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Interlude: Don Gargon?? (again this is a very rough guess)

Now it's war, me tryin to sell, runnin from the punk po-lice

They try to c*** me, but them can't gun store

What about they come to hold up me North

Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck

Look around, look around, punk police

Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me

Look around, look around, punk police

Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best

Verse Three: 2Pac

They got me runnin' from the *four-five*

Duckin and dodgin in my survival

The Benzo and I let off with my *nine milli*

I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for s**

Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next

Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price

He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life

Tell me is it me or my upbringin

I split that dove shit

Nigga Motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands

On tight, cause I ain't givin up

I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night

I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch

They'll never catch me

Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the, sneotch

Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend

I focus my locus thought on the enemy
Sick of the Hennessy, it's necessary to finish me
I'm antisocial, immortal when it come to the vocal
Jersey them niggas down, and won't approach 'em 'til it's time to smoke 'em
Hussein the terrorist
Nigga they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they try to find me a therapist
Rapid fire, I clap an eye 'til you die a liar
Strapped and next hittin' corners dropped 'em didn't want to spin the tires
My man will find ya
This 357 anaconda is enough to brand ya mama then turn around and hand you drama

Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted

Now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash when flaunted
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me? Fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police
Who run the streets really?
In every hood legends grow
From the hustlas up in Harlem to shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress, we stressed
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'

(Hey where that nigga...)

Halfway thugs don't budge when we stalk the streets
Sort of like chalk and narcotics when they walk the beat
You speak the beef pussy, draw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Gettin' mines with nine cocked extortin'
Blocks pop with 22's in my socks with the butt hangin' out the chocolate
You never seen time I travel across dream crime
My rolls like a million dollar bill, folded with green lines
With my foes erased drink my Henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like cases; 5 minutes from the station

Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
No finger prints that mean there was no evidence or proof that I was present

After they made this punk, fag motherfucka bleed
Money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bowin' off to one knee shit
The Glock to your head nigga, don't make no sudden action
Hit innocent bystanders when he blastin', dumped fuckin' backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life and G-rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have told me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napoleon ain't no cell they can hold me in
Or cage me in, crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like them niggas gon' fade me in
Havin' a fiend page me (page me)
When they want the product, nigga I got the smoke
Got this weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you workin' with?, I'm on some ol' immortal shit

Runnin' my Glock, put the lead in pop, fuck the law
Carry steel 'cause I live on the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin'
Quick to blow and dispose if you plot on hittin'
Ridin' high, blazin', kryptonite got a nigga dazin'
Burpin' and smirkin' at enemies before I grave 'em
Ride up, looked behind him, I see him, he slippin'
At a stop light on this lonely night
(This motherfucka trippin')
Slide on him, so I can dip and put it in him
(Damn, I guess this motherfucker know the vicinity)
Hit the pedal now we high speedin'
With the metal tryna make these motherfuckers die speedin'
Up the way I seen him slow down
(Shit! I think I done bucked these hoes down)
Caught 'em runnin' on E, that's kinda funny to me
They knew they was funkin' with me but they dumb to see

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Open up fire watch 'em expire when my shells split 'em
Plus all them trick-niggas bitchin can go to hell with 'em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin' they homies but they foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily, while we nailin' they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words are known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
A crooked thought, cops get bought, no longer caught
Out on bail, raisin' hell, nigga fuck what you thought
Did you cry when my girl died?
Put out the hit, politic niggas worldwide, grabbin' my dick
I’ll never learn, take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin' 'em burn
Kamikaze, I’m shootin' up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piñata and party
His last breath, a straight lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E..

They say good things will happen to those who wait
Shorty stuck in the game still slingin' weight
None of that's yo' life that ten in the brown
For XL six or seven fo' pound

Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with camera's in the mirror nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights with flying cooks
'cause my verse sound nice when they flyin' hooks

Now im blowin' weed-o in Beverly Hills
Some bad free hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer
Stash box with the llama drive through in the blue data bomba

Heaven or Hell will prevail when I'm a goner
'cause I Eat up tracks Like Hannibal and Dahma
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
This life is a hustle any day you be a goner

P89 Ruger with the silence off
Little clipper sellin' spitballs goin' through straws
We got plenty of rap sheets but not on sale
We even got dillingers that hold shotgun shells

These rappers is talkin' 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it my work is never watered down
So on the first I get more checks than Nike town

Swingin' 31 Money's  I been on the block
Since nigga's did the snake runnin' man in the walk
When I was 15 I didn't want no workin papers
I worked the strip all night, servin' niggers

Listen nigga, We live like Italians in jail
I got CO's bringin' cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill you ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil

I jumped out with the Ruger rapid fire
I had you on the run like Omar on the wire
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun

I'm a hustla' OG's love to hate
'cause I got old school money put away in a safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback

I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck judge wong he gon' catch me on the corner
Nigga make poor attacks, homie ya owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for yo' see through rollie

I begin in a mansion stripin' the models
The bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many Indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the gun's if you ain't got enough peeps

The shit I spit will cause an all out riot
In my new 4 fifth will cause a hollow tip die
Im the type to tie up your lady, gun butt your baby
Im like the mob nigga fuck you pay me

Im'a hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick 20 mil and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now it's time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggie spot

I Need 12 12's
And 58 58's

And they all gon' wait motherfucka

Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Would you still have love for me?

If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl... It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Would you still have love for me?

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Yo Black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that crack me
He aint the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you want to get your ass layed out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers, remind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like 'What up Conrad? '
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summertime still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an og remind me of Chaz and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didn't know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on the S-Class
Heard in dc he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked, he on lock still controllin' his block from constop
Pop pulled up in the cl5 his project changed
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga Bean popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there and Richmond main.
In the black 740 I sat, hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What!
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes
Coming up wise emotions closed
Most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin heroin in Maryland reverse back to Diesel
Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Got the gats out the stash box popped 2 glocks
Peace ""All Eyez on Me"" 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Dime in the blue ts stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his stelo, He on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to murk him, most them got fount
Some turnt away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a Black hummer he blew 90 on that

Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati

The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass

I got, ""God, understand me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck""

My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here

Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons

I threw a b-boy style, bullet wound in my smile
That beef I cook it, n-ggas I gets down
Call it what you want, the clip, the ladder, banana

The hoes, that's a whole different story
Find out the baby aint mine, right there on maury
Me I make the whip fishtail, trunk full of fishscale
Raw market itself, sucka the shit sell
That's 36 o's of love, give me kiss, give me love
Get to talking in codes, the phones bugged
This ferrari I get to the green, half man, hald machine
*Tu, tu, tu* I'm on ya head with the beam
So focused ferocious, I shoot ya pretty ass out them gucci loafers
You're f-cking with the wrong one
The strong one that god gave the gift
Stop the hater shit, you wanna make it
Why would you be mad I dun made it bitch

When that eagle get to chirping on the front lawn
Where's teh love, I don't know but here's the snub
Sucker barrel swallow the slug, die like a thug
You know it's really not worth it
To f-ck with me, you'd rather tongue kiss the serpent
Don't cry we all die

N-gga one shot from the nine will shatter your spine

So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggaz rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggaz hate when you do good

Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
""Chi Chi, get the llello""
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggaz, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)

The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like ""50 nice chain""
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
Or 'cause niggaz feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggaz in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga

I was innocent then, I ain’t do no wrong
She said, “you mommy little man,” I said, “yep, uh huh”
She was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare hustlin', they killed her for that
The first shot, bullet wound in my back
I’m fucked up, look at my sneakers, I’m fucked up
Now I’m on my own, mommy gone
Sam said, “you a young boy, why your clothes look so old?
You don’t need fish, little nigga, you need a pole
You don’t need no new kicks, you need an O”
Chop that, bag it, get right back at it
That touched me, it hit me in my heart
I’m a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start
I am what I am, Sabrina’s only baby
Practicing in the mirror, pulling out my .380
Oh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will, see
Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look, I’m outta control, my gun go
Off like it’s legal, call the cops, you need to
Give ‘em my description, I ain’t bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn’t last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me
That’s nine shots, we just call it fifty

But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all
And only cause my man heard of y'all
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob

Nigga tryin to flip and it's a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal

So when we count on the paper it better come back correct
We out in New Orleans baby niggas hungry for brick
I do that knife for stuntin get shot in the head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case
New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and your dead
You should be very afraid
I don't know how to behave
I'm tamed fresh out the cage
Urrrrrrrrrrhhhh

I'll be in this bitch till the club close
What should I do, one thing on all fours
Now that that shit should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down)

She got a thing for balls I mean a thing for falls
I don't turn her ass out so im the one she calls
On the cheek she kiss me and tell me she miss me

Hold a gun big enough to fuckin hold shaq down

And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his +Knight+ to be Suge

We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass start smokin'
But we have a bond and it's not to be broken

[Chorus thingy 2 times]
We got a love thing girl you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[Verse 2:]
Baby you know, on the low your sister be eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know, soon she be tryin' me
I heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night, she fell in love, then chased the feelin'
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote ""Sexual Healing""
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Ozbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lyeman and Jimmy Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this ain't new
I lived a lavished life, listen if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister could do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you're hyper I make ya calm
I be the incentive and reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come and see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's tv
I love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me'd be easy

[Chorus thingy x2]
We got a love thing girl you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[Verse 3:]
I love you, I got you barefooted on glass, chasin' a dove
That monkey on your back, symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up, you down they got nothin' to say
But when you call, I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away
They set you up, to let you down, they crowned you prom queen,
They know about me - behind your back, they call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone, so I can kiss and hug you
Plus, me beside you, no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin' you, like a real man should
It was written long before, ? It was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand, when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

[chorus thingy x2]
We got a love thing girl you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be"

So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around wit them pounds and berreta's
Yea faggot, if I want it I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
I'm cocky, raps rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, 8 levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, it's ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
You rattin on niggas is only gon' leave you smoked
So the only thing left now is toast for these cowrads
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
I'ma break before I lay floor berry
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, nigga plad ain't bulbary
You can't tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
You changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy
I know the rocks botherin ya vision
But reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like it's part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?
I'm blowin a 10 'cause Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there aint problem gettin dressed 'cause my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, move startin to raid
And leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
I'm the young pimp pardon my age
I don't got long hair but if I did she be partin my braids
We just find out what club they at
Take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mat
Yer advance is a grey acura
These record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa'
I go to college on a tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean, tec's polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
By now, you probably heard of me
Fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me
Burglary, were leavin wit cha nike's burgandy, White T, burgandy
You match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
Besly in the robe, re-motes for liftin chairs
We ain't rich, but we be glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcha
You better off wit ya stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive
You ain't gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio layin my vocals

Hollerin poster when i stunt the sammy sosa of the month
Better yet the hoe teas and nigga im still breathin even though my dollars are green
I rap for the kids that's to poor to waste eggs on halloween

Slidin from the stash box to conceal extortion
And a good silencer to make it sound like the wheel of fortune

Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you

Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I lived, I learned
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, guess I'm blowing some hoes
Shoot the bullet, the strap, learned to rap with a jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving with no hesitation

Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more control substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big wrists, big wins, keep on bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition

From the shooting on the bus at jamaica station

I was trying to get away from the area, after the first shot, it was very
Traumatizing to me like I've seen this happen a lot of times and didn't
Want to be involved. I didn't want to be that person that get a stray
Bullet or nothing like that

Bring me the head

or something instead
in this season of the witch.

Keeping one hand loose
Jesus loves you anyway
you knew this job was dangerous
from the first day.

Listen if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
It's a secret, I want the world to know dat you mine
But on sum real shit, communications could be betta
So I'm writin this song instead of a love Letter.
They gon play it on da radio a hundred times a day
I figure, when you hear it, you gon stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you Smile
Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get Down
When times are tough, tell me dat I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, dat I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girls best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them
If so, I'll see to it dat they'll always around
Nothin but da best, now how does dat sound
If I drop a jewel when we talk, you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all da time, dat's a secret shhhh

I think about you thinkin dat you feel da same way
Was it just my imagination, again runnin away
If you ready to ride, girl come on, lets roll
G5, 5 how I fly,  ma let's go
It was hard to measure da pleasure of havin you in my presence
Ya smile makes me smile, I show you my style
We can shop a lil bit, I'll pick out sum shit
One pair at a time, till ya shoe game sick
Now who knows, what the future holds
We be together prolly, for betta or  worse
Like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait.. Why pretend when you can move in
Before I'll b ya buddy in bed, lemme b yo best friend
Girl it's more then lust, I want ya trust
You keep it real wit me, I keep it real witchu
Cuz I know witchu by my side, there's nothin I can't do

50 Cent,Can I Speak To You,/5/50+cent/can+i+speak+to+you_21027338.html,"[Intro:]
It's hot as a motherfucker out here
Summer heat, hot murder plots
Niggas getting shot
Chrome rims for 6's, one wheel, one...

Throw it up, one hand wave back at the bitches
I'm silent, right before I snap, I'm violent
I calm myself through tussle,
I'm the boss and the muscle
Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creeping through the fog
If you scared, get a dog
Get a male, cause the bitch will get you both in the mall
Now pick the punch lines,
I'm punching these are the knockout flows
I'm cyber pimping, I'm so new wave, I got sci-fi hoes
This is next level mac shit, that's why my money stack quick
12 v's v 12's, half of them triple black bitch
Lust,... And greed, jealousy envy me
Your pride's blurring your vision
See I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground, still greedy
Still running cities, still andre and fitty
Fuck with me, I'm a usual suspect when it's a hit
Turn up the volume you hear my voice, yeah that's the shit

Pardon me please, may I speak to you?
Yeah can I speak to you
I feel this is something I'm compelled to do
Niggas talk that shit when I ain't around
But when I come, you can hear crickets
They don't say a motherfucking thing

Pistols and bad bitches, hustler and bad bindess
Rapping was just a hobby, that hobby turned to a million
Had that oxy for sale, you can get it 50 a pair
You sniff it all let it grill, wrapped before, you know the drill
Money, power and drugs, my only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers nigga
We played cribs and bloods
Like who the pimp saying who the s***s
Between... Slut's purses
God please forgive me but it's still was worth it
Man I swear I needed some change, chains
Golden rings and things
Niggas watch videos and think them dudes that rap the hardest
For real,... Make you a target
Into the pigs, or I'ma get you while you playing boy
Hunt you like an animal, strap with a bean that's...
50 told me ambition wins when you're telling they working
I say I'd rather relax, than be in that... And put in that working

Pardon me please, may I speak to you?
You see that? That's what I'm talking bout
I like that
I feel this is something I'm compelled to do
First name school, second name boy q
Oh, don't get it fucked up

Floss if you want to, I seen you home broke nigga
It ain't a secret I get money you's a joke nigga
Make what you make in like 2 years less than a month nigga
... To south side, but we up nigga, oh yeah
Don't fuck around and make a trillion"

On the phone with my connect should last about an hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work.

When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house, 
You know it's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick
They say I'm grimmey, yeah fuck it I line niggers
I show them where your shit at before they take mine nigger
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigger
Figure, this is a dog eat dog world, man
Ebony enemy today I'm tryin' duck I got that... 
Her head'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave up and down you'd be like ""I could just kill a man""
I don't fuck with them niggers from her projects
They're on section eight but niggers cars are straight
They ain't out in the day time them niggas's roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toasts'
I'm in the six four five hard top, not the drop
Leanin', I see them niggers schemin', dream on
Touch me, shitt I wish a nigga would
I'll have my niggas deep, I have them light up the whole hood.

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]

They said I fell off, my benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggas spot start gettin' stuck
I say 'I ain't know none about nothing'
I'm on the low, niggers really know me for stuntin'
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsom, your bitch blowin' me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the misses, damn
I'm starting think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't gotta hold that for me
And slide by my baby momma crib with the mac homie'
My sister's cousin in a car crash died
She said 'don't drink and drive', I say 'just drink, don't drive'
I had a morphine dream I got heroine ambitions
I see money cooking in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate I double up the cake (heyy)

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]"

Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a bring conversation, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley Azure
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

[Verse 1: Ciara]
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

[Pre-Chorus:]
That he does it with the best,
Runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants
His girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turing me on

But the dope boy's turing me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

[Verse 2:]
So when I had a good guy he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one compared to me
But couldn't matta when other guyz was staring at me
Now the top placed back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hills up in Beverly

He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best,
Runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)

And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)

So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

[50 Cent:]
The more I get the more my ambition tells there more
I'll move an A for that girl I'll move ahead for that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man

If he gets caught, it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy I promise I will be there for you
All my heart it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy I just can't leave you alone

Temperature rising, okay lets go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a teakettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider

Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she wind
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I ain't stoppin
Drippin wet with sweat man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle it's on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

I'm still a baller, I'm still balling

I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick

We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
He still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick

Copper-tops, get your ass popped, watch a body drop

See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers
I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker
Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, long ranger
Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing
Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga
Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame
You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper
Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper

She hump my leg like a horny pit
Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet
Now I ain't running after no broads, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green
She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why
Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look

You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up

Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up
Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way
You owe me, you better pay
Ghost, let the beretta spray
Hood want uncut dope and some better yay
I ain't chasing pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still robbing, still rolling, still need a mask
Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash

Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of DRAMA
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma
Materialistic still a nigga wanna consistantly miss her
Touch what she don't, she smell like CHANEL
She feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I been around been up my attitude if fuck it now, she a rider
I'm in heaven when I am inside her
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck
Twirl play in the deck four bit correct
Have her drippin wet
She look in my eye and said she like but I know she love it

Half the niggas jumped me, bumpin' my head
Thinkin' I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife, I'm finna poke me a nigga
Wishin' I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy
Now those were the days, where crime really pay
9 milly spray, got the fuck out the way
The shootout, the shootout
The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnap Drew granpa kid
Came through and shot Ms Leak in the head
Wonder why I got a gun so I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

Have to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say ""Give it up kid, before I put one in ya wig""
Picture me thirsty, ridin' round foamin' out the mouth

Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze
That shit)
A slug'll split a niggas ass, worst than the philly
I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita
My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her

You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggas, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
Its like tradition, rap niggas, dyin' they whips
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you gears behind
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99
Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed
Shallow up a seed, I'll write it down so you can read
If you've been listening, I know you've been loving what I said
If not you dumb fuck, I just run over your head

But I got a kind of flow that could stop the world hunger

Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall
Ice chucks in the chain way spinning
Green lining, bogus from the benjami's in 'em
Time forth oh Lord

Forever ever, forever in the drop

Oh let me tell you about La Ricky when he took his bullets (ok)
You want the trigger man, y'all was the ones that pull it (oh)

Before he let you cowards kill him, he just came and sprayed it (come on)
Now what you wan' do (whooo whooo), bitch I got a gun too (whooo, whooo)

Whoever was the pigs we would go and split his wig (haha)
And as the years passed, niggaz only got worse
Jumped in to the game, shit, gotta protect our turf (what up nigga)
We had enough of gettin' handcuffed and pulled over
We started tryin' knock they heads off they fuckin' shoulders (boom)
Now where my soliders at, get ready for combat
I'm livin' like them niggaz that dunn went to Vietnam, hey (G-Unit!)
So if you try to lock me up for smokin' my weed (whooo, whooo.. Whooo, whooo)
The whole force of police, is what they gon' need (whooo, whooo.. Whooo, whooo)
One of a kind, I'm the last of a dying breed

I come up with something
Come through your strip, fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinning
Haters hate that I'm winnning
Man I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fitting to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot
No I aint stopping till my clip is empty
I'm simply not that nigga you should try your luck with
Fuck with, hollow-tip shells struck with your bones broke
Gun smoking, still locing, what nigga
Lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling

'Cause they fronting 20 years
Of watching my mama's tears
Got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that Bong 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me bury
Thrown in the dirt, from shots flurry
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'mma stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gon' call my number
Under, my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lieing, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching
What I'm clutching, to give you more then a concussion
End of discussion
My blood is colder, so I'm bolder
Hennesy and soda
Hood on my my shoulder
Looking in the mirror, I see a soldier

In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games
Till they shoot 'em up bang
Then you see brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bully my way in this game, man I'm done playing
Man I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying any of these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'mma back down, like a goddamn coward
I can't, how would I look as man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me
Not Marshall, you wanna see Marshall?
I'll show you Marshall, I try to show you art
Put you just pick it apart, so I see I have to start
Showing you fucken old farts a whole other side
I wanted to not show you, so you know you're not dealing with

Not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot

Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted

See I'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And I'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down, before I make change

Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic

Used to never get high, now I'm never sober

That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

[Chorus:]

[Eminem] 50 Cent, c'mon!

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You can catch me in the studio, bangin out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady/Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

[Chorus:]

[Eminem]
Yeah!  Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that ""Detox"" album, it's comin
We gon' make Dre do it (ha ha)
50 Cent, G-Unit
Obie Trice, D-Twizy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin
Let's go!  Ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin out
Peace!

{*crowd cheers to fade and chants ""Em-i-nem*}

[Eminem] Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin with me!
{*gunshots*}
[Eminem] {*laughing*}

Nigga, this is not a fictional tale, this shit real
Who’s sittin’ in the Bookings? Charged, direct sale
Third shootout… who was fightin’ for positions?
Shell casings out my 9 flyin’ through your mama kitchen
Paper we stack it, yeah, pistols we pack it
You fuck around, we’ll blow your heart out the back of your jacket
Bitch, get down or lay down, my work is that chach
‘Cause he got big, now he lieutenant so he sit there and watch
I swear to God I think I had the same vision that K had
Woke up sayin’ “we gon’ turn them corners to Baghdad”
Yeah, we was young, but we had guns, we started juxing niggas
All you hear is Boo-Boo fuckin’ with them Brooklyn niggas
I had supreme schemes, call it Wall thoughts
Start shootin’, I bet I’ll clear off the ball court
I want it all, that’s just how I fuckin’ feel, boy
Get in the way, you gon’ take you a trip to Deramores

[Hook:]
I’m dreamin’ of…
My dream of freedom…
Financial freedom

[Verse 2:]
This is to big bags of bread and some coke, nigga
You can get with the program, fam’ll get smoked, nigga
We was a school of sharks - a bunch of young soldiers
Open your head when you’re half dead – you see? I told you
On the island, got that burner, got the flamethrower
A couple niggas got blown, I got my name known
Over the phones, soon as I’m home, the game’s sewn
I got connections – look, bitch, I’m connected
And I ain’t givin’ niggas no passes, so respect it
Or get dealt with, I’ll break you off proper
You ready to die, huh? Too much Big Poppa
Easy – nigga chill or get laid out
I’ll put a hole in you then find out what your gang ‘bout
I do my dirt, I’m hardly ever by my lonely
I got that tek with that cooling system on me,
You think you want it, you don't want it with me homie

[Hook:]
I’m dreamin’ of…
My dream of freedom…
Financial freedom

[Verse 3:]
We stackin’ paper ‘til we strong then we takin’ over
Grab a gat, bring the crack back with baking soda
Bridge the gap, get slapped, actin’ like you know us
North Pole, nah, Southside produce the colas
We’re the last of our litter, this is what they taught us
We’ve got to kill what we eat, that nigga came up on us
If you ain’t gamblin’, get the fuck out the spot, boy
Shoot an ace off your foot, that’s some shit you should get shot for
Fuck it, when I win I’m a winner – when I lose, I’m a winner
‘Cause to my niggas y’all niggas lookin’ like steak dinner
You screw your face the fuck up, you goin’ through what?
The strap big enough in my truck to chew your crew up
Nigga stand down or get manned down
Mack, two clips, 30 rounds plus 30 rounds, flip it around
You gon’ fuck around and get jammed up, blammed up
Hit your spine, a standup nigga can’t even stand up

Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Dont listen to the rumours they say 50 feakin' crazy
50 dont know how to treat a lady
They Wrong, I like you a lot I dont wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers God forgive me for
tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson say ""I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch""
And smell your scent, Baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model Lingerie""
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty If its okay
You can be my Beyonce I'll be your Jay

I gotta great sense of humour, first I'll make ya smile then I whoo ya!
You know how I do ya, or do ya?

Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
After seven hours New York, to London, you wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop
I told you, Im'a Don you gonna know im'a don
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Milan
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherrish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say ""50 we love 'em""
Without them, there's no me so I love them
Man their the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less then the best so perfection I guess
That's why niggas are stress'd, I'll pass the test
Everytime I drop, Im burnin' hot
So I dont care If she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could fuck and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
I get it done with speed..

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead

I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you see
I react like an animal, and tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art.
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)

Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my c*** back hollow tip in the chamber
Will daint ya, anger will change ya

He's got my back, I got his back... Back!

Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit like we're conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
Some shit will never boil over
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left alone, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
The days that Zino, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you

Show me how you do that girl
I like the way you do that shorty (uh)
Now can you do somethin' for me

[Chorus:]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And I don't wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If I could, get her outta here I would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me I should
Get Low!

[Verse]
Yeah..
I'm in the 2006, brand new wagon
Lookin' for a diva to handle a dragon
And even if there's two of um, i'ma move in and bag um
Make sure I'm strapped, keep the Uz and the Magnum
Yeah the gun talk, but I'm talkin' 'bout the condom
They followin' me home with my dog right behind um
Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion
Another bad bitch half black and italian
I don't know if she likes me or my medallion
You think I give a fuck, I'm just tryna get a nut
I don't need no-one to build my self-esteem up
I'm fresh out the hood, but fuck it its all good
Why you can use me, cuz i'ma use you
For menage-a-twage, you know the usual
And if you do me maybe i'll do you
A favour and walk you outside, rightt

[Chorus:]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And I don't wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If I could, get her outta here I would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me I should
Get Low!

[Verse]
Naa, I aint ever aite pussy before
But I'm close to the edge if she pushin' me Lord
Her body language is that a nigga stiff as a sword
So she can't be a angel this bitch is a fraud
Head prolly took a nigga on a trip to the morgue
Pussy good enough to drive out the Michigan Ford
As soon as I hit the door she's squeezin' my arm
Hoppin' all on a nigga like Christina Milian
It might take a couple rounds to make me get to calm
But when she does go to sleep she might need a alarm
Cuz I'm gone, she wanna be with a don
But I'm stuck so i'ma keep it about me on a song
Aint nothin' wrong, with a lil' bumpin' and grindin'
Especially if they got somethin' behind um
I'm high as hell, pussy drunk when I climb in
How a nigga unfortunate I'm in

[Chorus:]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And I don't wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If I could, get her outta here I would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me I should
Get Low!

[Verse]
Shorty looks like she's datin' a fashion designer
Damn, she musta got that from her momma
You know me somewhere in the back with the Llama
Keeps one of the cats with the drama, i'ma
Get a lil' closer to her, ma look so sweet
She remind me of a lot of broads aint Monique
But a bird nigga tryna holla, they all speak
Do you write up her phone number down, they wont keep
Lemme get her, I have her burnin' Haze all week
Givin' me wop to the music, mine plays on beat
Yeah, I'm so street, I'm so cheap
I'm so fly, but you already know that I
Dunn been all around the world, they don't know that guy
But lil' man gon' talk to, I oppose that I
He just mad that he aint got the kinda clothes I buy
All ride in the you. F. O I drive

[Chorus:]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And I don't wanna miss my chance, to jump on her

And he ain't really got to live
Unless you got something that you really got to give

I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin, we make the guns come out

When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed

I guess I made the kids want slang
And N. W. A. Made the West Coast bang
Nah, it's just music man, it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

Switch gears till you won't come down

But Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout

Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time

[Chorus:]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again, just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again

Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof bm, uh huh
His hair'll get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
Then roll an Easy Rider and then get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap, how he go out like
That?
Rumors in the hood was Jus was snitchin
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first gsx-are
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be suprised
Of how freely I throw out names of games who dealt up with pies
Like L-A-N-Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

[Chorus:]

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin
Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin
Go against crews like Bebos and killers like Pappy Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie Vuttuon interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asians
Feds couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

[Chorus:]

Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky
Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Bennyhannas heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanrence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the Mac will.

God gave me grace
Put my willy upon your face
God gave me style

God put a smile on my face

God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault

[Bridge:]
I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down

[Verse 1- 50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my cds drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a trackstar, runnin' through life, chasin' my dream
Best deal I made was tradin a mic for a triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it (Yeaaah!)

It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down

[Verse 2- 50 Cent]
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A old G told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind
I'm a spunge, knowledge and wisdom, my insult off fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

[Chorus:]
God gave me style
God gave me grace
God gave me style
God gave me grace
God put a smile on my face
Haha, God put this smile on my face
God made me shine like the sun

Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
Been to icu once I ain't going again
First Zee got murked, then Roy got murked
An homies still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt
I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggaz switchin sides on niggaz just like that
You know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees
An give    s away in the hood like government cheese
Spray on Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's
More plate on the back, straight squeezing a Mak
In the hood they identify niggaz by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make      hot
I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block
Cause he'll spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggaz if you round me son

I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, for goin through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggaz
Get close enough to smack, get it clappin nigga
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome at his ass
Point blank range I spazzed blew a bone out his ass
Two weeks later niggaz came through with Maks to lay me down
They sprayed I played      and got the      off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call ""50 waddup""
You send a bitch to me I send the bitch back cut up
I don't play that, I done told you boy
Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cousin twig shot up his mamma crib, now he in Jail
Trippin off Fliks of blue cantrell,       and black tail
Pop mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more
The shells from twig 4-4, blew the hinge off her do'
Without that check every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finis' come an take dem kids

I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for goin through hell
I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage
The change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference
The A80'll make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in ya head when you in K-Sac
Man I might talk to you while we up in the pens
But when we come home, dat don't mean we gon     in be friends
Shells pass ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling
Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya
In the hood niggaz runnin round actin crazy
Buyin little air Jordan's for maybe babies
See it might be his, an it might be yours
Cause them broads in the projects is straight up      s
Man it don't take much for you to get in them draws
You ain't can have 'em on they back or on all fours
You got to tell me, you feelin this
Because I hear what I'm sayin I know I'm killin this

I gotta make it to heaven, for goin through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for goin through hell

It feels so good to live sucker free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nothing but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip and let a motherfucker be
I'm a rap star
Who wants to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front and the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya
Haha I'm a bastard
Damn near showin' his hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see your man go in the casket
Rule number one keep your gun and get your ass hit that's it
Lights off and your body's stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with

[50 Cent (Lloyd Banks)]
Hands up shorty when you party with me, we goin' way past quarter to three (I said Hands Up!)
I'm good in the V. I. P. I got my hammer right here with me (I said Hands Up!)
You know when you party with crooks, you gotta learn to respect the jooks (I said Hands Up!)
Everything ain't cruise to fame, this shit ain't sweet as it looks (I said Hands Up!)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I cruise through the strip
22's on the whip
New rule: gonna hit
Thousand dollar outfit
Never snooze never slip
Follow rules or get whip
Nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now the jewels got him sick
Now it's 2006 I need a new bottom miss
It's aight they can talk I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks nigga who's hot as this
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice grill but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces they don't see the chains
Like Ooo when you get 'em they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This is regular shit the erryday mentality
They charged up don't make me put in the battery

Uh-huh..

Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, Check check out My Melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggaz had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nuttin good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus 50 Cent - Game]2x
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M. V. P.)
(And I ain't goin nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Game]
I told Dre from the gate, I'd carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song, I'd inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my nwa gold
And had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
Fo' I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm Raps mvp
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in dc
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck could vouch, when the dotch was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth?

[Chorus 50 Cent - Lloyd Banks]2x
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

From the beginnin to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's staying the same

[Lloyd Banks]
How many of them boys is with you?
When you had that little tv you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with the snub
Cause niggas do a lot of slip talking in the club
Til they coughin on the rug
I ain't ever had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin up his drug
I've had enough, they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an R.I.P. Shirt and my coat
Now I'm seeing, reminiscin
All of my weed here, never listen
If I see him, then I'mma lift him
And maybe I oughta even the score
But if not, It'll be me on the floor

[Chorus 50 Cent - Tony Yayo]2x
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M. V. P.)
(And I ain't goin nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Tony Yayo]
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that Lou Deuce Deuce and my Triple Phat Goose
Sippin Easy Jesus, Rocking the Leases
Mama whip me when she find my pieces
I look back on life and think God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

[Young Buck]
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look mayne, It's a hood thang
That's why I'm loved in Brooklayne
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, Homie I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I take the bullets out of 50, put em in my 4-5
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven-figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

You heard about it kid, you know how I rock
Went from pumpin shit on the block, to straight to the top
So the money aint a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hampton's
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cuz I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss playa play, nigga I'm ballin'
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in the cherry-red porsche, beige seats, red piping
You want me to teach ya how to stunt, aite then
Tattoo's on the arm, 30 carrots on the charm
Cuz the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the don
First night I find em, second night I bust em
Third night we call it quits, I aint fuckin with the bitch
Success is ma drug of choice, I'm high off life
Another move, another mil', lets get right aight..

Spit one verse, my whole cribs coughed up
Ma I got a fetish, fuckin' in them porsche trucks
Curtis got one so when I finished I tossed her
Y'all in to wifin', we don't condone wifin'
Only fuck with bitches that got their liquor license
Shot high prices, shook all vices

Nuts in the sand if you aint bumpin' my shit

Locked up I was in a box by myself

Now, shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get get shot it won't do 'em no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fuckin hurt when it rain

They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

Go against me, fa sho, you's a goner nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me man
I'd hate to be in the Benz clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit!""

I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model

Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib, sippin Guinness, watching Menace
Then Oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Niggas calling me to feature, man fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm doing good

Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

Through every altercation
I put no one above you, I love you
They shook up when we jooks 'em, you see how they be lookin'
It's frightening like lightnin', you crack off, they start bookin'

It's beef until I get out in broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illin' and when she get to killin'
Now my baby she precious I warn you not to test this
I aim her at your head, nigga, motherfuck the vestes

I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I gotta owe me
I'm ridin' with her ol' cocked Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow twist the indo, smoke it up, it's fundamental

You can't get to her, poke 'em up
When we get intimate that's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

I promise to keep you close to me, you give me a sense of security
Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down

When niggas get to trippin'
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slippin'
I take you out shoppin', get you clean, get it poppin'
Use my finger, get ya hot girl, I know your spot

I love you if you love me back you never jam
When I react to sucka shit, when they get hit
And we take off if you get tossed
I'll be back, I want you so I'll be back

I'll never change, I be the same, a nigga stunt I let it rain
I'm off the chain, I'm all in mayne
I'll hit you up you think I'm playin'
I be strapped, go 'head fuck around, I be strapped

24/7, I'm back holdin', mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

I promise to keep you close to me, you give me a sense of security
Through drama you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down"

I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I done went legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self and my back, God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics

[Hook:]
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on, These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on, hold on

[Verse 2:]
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds
But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one
Used to do graffiti, now look we major
Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor
Re-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure coco leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money coming in like we run the streets

[Hook:]
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on, These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on, hold on

[Verse 3:]
This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?
Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride
Check my dna, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined
We don't want your block, just cop your work from us
Those niggas you call allies can't be trust
That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid
Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again
When it's war, it'll be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
That sneaky nigga spray that Semi at your momma crib
With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit

We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on, These niggas, they watching every dime we make

From In Too Deep Soundtrack

[Madd Rapper]
Yo yo yo yo you know who this is boy
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I'm sayin?

[50 Cent]
R.I.P B. I. G nigga, R.I.P P-A-C nigga  R.I.P enough of that shit it's time to od, one tme, but y'all can tell us how you want it
Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz startin to look like somethin to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ""You wanna see her again?""
Get your ass down to the nearest atm
I have dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch
And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your shit
When I apply pressure, son it aint even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian Mcknight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel from my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up with that watch now
I mean right now""
The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob odb but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for
Don't want no nigga puttin four thru that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like ""Bitch get on the ground""
You ain't with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?
I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?

[Madd Rapper][Chorus:] 2x
This aint serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry nigga?

[50 Cents]
Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound
Like you gimme the cash and you put the hot dog down
I figured it out
Niggas Been robbin Joe before that's why his ass
Don't wanna be a playa no more
Mad at you I'm robbin J. D., fuck you!! Pay me!!
Had Da Brat with em, shoulda had his gat with him
Dmx wanna get down well you tell homey
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my +Dirt All By My Lonely+
I should rob Clue man his shit did well
I wanna stick tq but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios take niggas jewels and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and rza for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
Ill beat your ass like that white boy on mtv
Cannibus wanna battle while I'm stickin them up
Fuckin get capped coroners pickin em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, eh nigga try to stall ya
He said ""Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livid
I'll rob Boys ii Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real I'm bout to stick Mister C
That nigga still eatin off Big's first lp
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enuff I told him ""Gimme Some More""
Is you feelin this?  Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People

[Madd Rapper]
[Chorus: X2]
This aint serious being broke can make you delerious
Being broke can make you delierious
So we rob and steal so our worls can be bigger
50 cent how it feel to rob a industry nigga

Yo yo for real son this the madd rapper you know what I'm saying and
For real you know what I'm sayin niggas got to get stuck up that's just how it goes down

Itreally don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
You know what I'm saying that's just how it go down

Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the buses

America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal
Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle
The women in my life be confusion and shit
So like Nino when New Jack, I holla ""cancel that bitch""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze
I'll built an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life
The fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me..

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin get mine,

Yea, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black Tealons start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my code name, they called me chef boy are 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm sellin 'em for 500 a pop god damn it
I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the dna of a crook and
What goes in my mind, it's contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or spot, I'll be potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 3:]
It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Moussberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin' the drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
Or in the jewler switchin chains
I upgrade from 30 Bs to clean Vs
Rocks that I copped proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curv and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I'ma plan to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner will tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, Icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the niggaracci
Hello!

It started off a robbery, they blew half his face off

Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack
Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max

Up a fence runnin, cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire
S***s crazy, just a different day, it's the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split
They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin
What's the matter, they can't get that Hoopty started
Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked up, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, you's a busta
I don't trust ya, I shoulda sent niggas to touch ya

It's a habit I'm always prepared for war,
See my life's like some shit, you seen in a flick,
Bitches act like pornstars when they sit on a dick,
When I was hit and out the game I said ""one more flick"",
Test my aim in the range I'm like ""one more clip"",
It's my brain, I'm insane, I be on some shit,
Man I run Interscope, Jada's tryna annoy me,
Nuthin' but another disgruntled employee,
He been in the game ten years and he still ain't rich,
Even his mama upset that he still ain't shit,
And he keep runnin his yap, like I'ma take all that,
One more word out his mouth I'll push Style's shit back,
See the nozzle on my tre pound is three inches long,
And the trigger on the fo' fo's extremly strong,
With a little tre douche is like pop, pop,
Chase his ass up the block til his bitch ass drop,
And the verses he be kickin' none of 'em hot,
Cos he ain't got none of that shit he says he got,
And he ain't did none of that shit he said he did,
And I ain't got time to be talkin 'bout this shit, (fuckin' faggot)

Rule number two give respect where respect due
Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names
(gun click sound) the 45 will tear you out the frame
Its like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fuckin thing
Don't mean nothin changed but the things my money bring
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got pleany money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin shot while I'm sayin this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
An old timer schooled me don't burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head it's still shakin he had a lot of nerve

Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten you'll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred g's fore you see three hundred C's
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key's
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut (ahh oh shit) I don't want 'em next to me
If it's on mother fucker believe I'm gonna ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY

(Chorus)

They say I don't sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Here's a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I don't quit that there's more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now it's time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Don't nothin change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake

I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears,
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears,
The reason there's two carrots in each of your ears,
I spurge with the paper ma, I don't care,
How ya like the pumps, boots, jeeps, and coops
Make celebrities, 50 fall off never,
What's, mine is yours and what's yours is mine,
So when I shine, you shine.
C'mon the finest Champaign we can toast to life,
Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice,
Don't let your friends get ya confused, said 50 bad news,
I need ya in my life girl your too much to loose.

[J. Lo]
It's funny cause, for a while,
I walked around with a smile but,
Deep inside, I could hear, voices telling me this ain't right.
Don't you know, it's not for you,
I always knew what I had to do.
But it's hard, to get away,
Because I love you I just tried to stay.

[Chorus:]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright.

[J. Lo]
Friends of mine, say to me,
They say you got control over me.
You're not alone, I played my part,
I saw the way you were from the start.
Could I expect, so much from you,
You had a girl when I first met you.
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it

After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright.

[J. Lo]
Said I wouldn't walk away,
Some days I want to stay,
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay.
Never thought it would be true,
Me livin' without you,
But now it's time for me to make that move.

[50 Cent]
Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you don't respect it,
When I smile at ya you don't smile back to reconnect it.
You ain't been gone long but, I already miss you,
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you.
All the talkin on the phone, all the time we share,
How could you fix your mouth to say, ""I don't care""
I had plans for us, to buy ice together,
Engagement rings, and things and share life together,
Now when your friends tell ya 50 called, you're like whatever.
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start,
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart.
Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart.

[Chorus:]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright.

Oh no, be alright
Oh no, says I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus:]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright.
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it,

Haha it's easy man, it's easy man
Ay yo I switch my hustle, no more dice games dillemas you see blood
In the snow after the shots in december
Niggas is broke that's why they stay ice grillin
I'm in the aspens laughin snow mobilin
With a beautiful bitch she chocolate athletic
Ass poke out like serena asks banks he seen her
Plus she hood she aint hollywood remind me of trina
D's come shorti even down to hold down a nena
G stand for gangsta unit stand for you niggaz in trouble
Better lock and load on the double

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm so sorry
Niggaz all fucked up they aint gettin money in the hood

[50 talking:]
You know I could but I don't wanna help you out nigga
I'm so sorry

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm in that 6, 7 glass house
In and out of lanes
Murder on my mind
Old english runnin through my veins
I think about easy and it eases my pain
I drink a 40 ounce g unit soakin in the rain
I came into this world both feet in the dirt
No purple label no button up shirt
No harm intended no subliminal disses
But hard facts seperate the men from the bitches
I would popped your ass if I thought you was worthy
Lookin like boy george in that larry bird jersey
Buck pass the dutch I'm blowin that bob marley
Hop off the G-4 lets have a boston tech party G-Unit

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm so sorry
You niggas don't sound that good when you step in the booth
I'm So sorry
Nigga that it hurt but god dammit you kno it's da truth
I'm So Sorry
You see me do good it's makin your punk ass sick
I'm so sorry
That I aint got room for all you niggas on my dick
I'm so Sorry

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks:]
Yeah
A snap of a finger will make you guys cripple
I came up with this on the shitta, nigga
I handle bars like a bicycle
Stars make your eyes trickle
As stiff as an icecycle
The muffalas the sounds of land that's why I whistle
Fire your stylists you know dats wrong
For letting you put that foot locker noback on
Around here niggas get shot for performin that song
And hoes cut they eyebrows off and draw them back on
They try to merk me yo
That's why 50 bought me a trey pound with a nose longer then pinnchio
Pop shit I stroke your s***
And soon as her mouth open up what?
Same color as coconut

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm so Sorry
You aint from compton you aint gotta flow like game
I'm so sorry
You aint lloyd banks mixtape artist of the year man
I'm so sorry
You aint young buck you don't let the gun buck son you butt
I'm so sorry
You get outta line I'll personally come fuck you up

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
We don't chase no hoes
We dream about it while we make the dough
Ill have a hundred fuckin hatiains come and cut your throat
I still touch the dough
Niggas my ears to the street
I got niggas from your own hood workin for me
You got ya hand out
Can't even bail your man out
Real know real cuz the bitch niggas stand out
Nobody gonna miss you when the dessert eagle hits you
Just do like pac said pour out a little liquor
Picture gettin your chest blown open and no one there to save ya
You momma gotta wake up makin funeral arrangements
You kno who to play with and we aint the ones
This G-unit shit is deeper than a prick in your thumb motha fuckas

[50 talking:]
Yeah I wanna take the time out to apologize to all yall niggas

Somebody gon' die tonight

This is nothin' new, I been in the position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip
Thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
Wanna come test me, pussy boy don't try it
Police response, never fast enough, the shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son
'Fore we find out where ya bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch
Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Verse 2- 50 Cent]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Then pray for my downfall, I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that kevlar vest shit, that wild wild west shit
There's eighty one on one carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make mothafuckas wanna kill me
Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span
Hold the mic with my left, the knife in my right hand

Yeah!!

All through the hood, I keep hearin' nigga's sayin'

Hold up. Son, them niggas know who hit that nigga son. (I know I kno...)
How the fuck we gon know who hit em, and they don't know who hit him.
The hood talkin man everybody know. (I know it's fucked up)

Now I lay thee down to sleep, niggas tryin' to lay me down wit heat, if I should die do' before I awake I pray my lord my soul to take...

[Verse:]
If dead men could talk in your sleep
And your homie told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him
Or would you start switchin up
You think about the penitentiary, your bitchin up?
What if he said money aint everything
The hood raised us wrong
What it takes to get your money long
But look I'm gone
Would that touch your heart have you feelin funny inside
Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride
What if he gave you a lil list of things to do
Said he wouldn't have to die
He could live through you
Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Wether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength
Now you in a daze
Your homie turnin over in his grave
Cause you pussy!

Ya know who killed him! Ya know who killed him!
Ya know who killed him! (Ride!)
Ya know who killed him! Ya know who killed him!
Ya know who killed him! (Ride!)

[Verse 2:]
Them boys smoked your homie
You aint gon do nothin back
Not even if he told you, you next to get clapped
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples probably gon cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this 1-8-7
When you reach the pearly gates
How you gon explain
You gonna try and tell God you've been framed
Ya'll did everything together, he was your dog
Now you uptown coppin and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave pacs to they kept the cake
His sister and baby momma talkin to Jake
Da' niggas that rocked him they came to the wake
But they come inside they sat out in the ride
At the funeral homicide all in the buisness
Walkin round askin niggas to tell em who did it
Niggas is throwin' blows now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggas an animal, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga will body someone over a bundle
Man a three year old kid in my hood know what a gun do

And Grandma; who always gotta throw a 100 percent

When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up

Girl, feel special 'cause I don't spend
Nuttin' but time with certain other broads I rip

You belong in minks, bracelets and rings
Not handcuffs forget about that locket chain
And just leave lil' mama, this P lil' mama
I ain't them, I'm me lil' mama

When we first middle sex fif, knew that you was that chick
Wooly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes

Hell, I just dipped her number and talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife

Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you

What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone
The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was
He like the 'Sold-a-soul' man, who the fuck you 'cuz? I'm out

Every time I hurt you it's because of what someone else
Has done to me and I know it's not really fair
No I just can't trust you 'cuz I just got outta something
And I'm running, boy you know that I'm running scared

You treat me so good that it's just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should

Stunt if you want, my niggas will have your jacob on

Gimme a henny on the rocks and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this ol' nickel enough

I came to ball wit ya'll, pop the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes and niggaz call ya dogs
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might neva come home again, nigga aight

Teeth, neck, wrists all lights, my life's like
Ridin' in Ca$hville, they runnin' all stop lights
Homie is that real, I pray I keep livin'
My Momma jus' hadda dream of seein' me in prison

My Daddy's a dope fein' an' I don't really miss him
Ain't seen him in 10 years an' a nigga still livin'
Tha same ol' 2 step, we move to a rhythm
50 holla get em' buck, you know I'm gunna get em'

I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D.

I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D.

I know I'm sinnin' but I'm winnin' at tha same time
Take a couple shots from a nigga tryin' ta take mine
I'm back on tha block, wit a choppa an' a tech nine
Niggaz shootin' cops and the hood, runnin' stop signs

G-Unit, the game, bitches doin' wat tha thugs do
G's, D's, Vice, Lords, Crips an' the Blooz too
Move lemme come through
It ain't a pair of handcuffs can hold me

I'm ridin' in the ol' school listenin' to some oldies
My goals keep shinin', them hoes keep cryin'
The handle of my 45, outlined in diamonds
Just left Ca$hville, 'bout to fly to Miami

Hopin' yayo watchin' Eminem, perform at the Grammys
The reason niggaz like Eric Benet probably can't stand me
'Casue I know money will make Halle Berry come outa them panties
Bitch

Ya'll niggaz in trouble, they shoulda neva let me in

I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D.

I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D.

Bet ya I can make them bounce back
Teach em' how to stunt, teach em' how to count stacks
Now where ya hood at? Buck
If you want to, we 50 deep up in here watchu gonna do

Who want beif, I ain't come for no name callin'
Don't be mad 'cuz we is and you ain't ballin'
Gettin' money is my motto for you broke folks
Can't spend ya whole life payin' on ya car notes

It's alright if you still on the block boy
See I'm a cold, young thug, not a hot boy
You know I do this for the streets and my peeps thas behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go and buy them all cars, young buck

I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D.

I know you gonna let me shine an' get mine
I know you gonna let me in wit this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink wit no I.D.

We get the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers or run wit winners that win, ahh"

Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't goin nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
The thug, they pop shit
The thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks

Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear ""He say, She say"" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft through, be puttin up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, cuz niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like, ""Damn, 50 really spitted on em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on em""
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none

See em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't tryin

Keep my rent split up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Wooo!)

I just wanna love, for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morn, hold you in the night

[Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
'Cause it's sort of unique 'cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamamey you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is c***-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kitten caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no more humor in it, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag and tear a near hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

[Chorus:]

[50 Cent]
And all the bitches say
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought are. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a cd and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)

[Chorus:]

[50 Cent]
I love the burners, the money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold you, ha ha
I just wanna love you, yea"
50 Cent,"Love, Hate, Love",/5/50+cent/love+hate+love_20984854.html,"[50 Cent - Verse 1]
It's the same shit, feel like a nigga having flashbacks
I might have crack in my ass crack
Back to that rubber handle, 38 special vandal
Play Godfather bitch, you get dead like Marlon Brando
These bars hit harder than hard times
My flow'll make a lifer wanna stare at the sunshine
I'll bring a bitch, you bring a bitch
Lets switch, I'ma swing hit ya face with a pillow case filled with mop wringers
Penitentiary style, big monster swag
Bitch, I got so many tricks make me go in my bag
Yeah niggas keep saying I'm back
It's a fact ya shaken like ya ass got parkinsons, relax, confused
Acting like a white boy bored
Now you wanna jump a flight of stairs on a skateboard
Nigga, why the f-ck ya pants so tight?
You tryna show niggas your ass, your alternative life
I'm hungry like I aint ate, I lost weight
On a highway it's worth more outta state, I'm raw like Cypress
I could just kill a man
Blow from Mexico's cartels...

[Chorus:]
Hate it or love it
They love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch I don't pretend, p-ssy I aint your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it
They love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch I don't pretend, p-ssy I aint your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
I wore green, emeralds and my watch face drippin
Nigga aint no safe safe when I start trippin
I might call my next lp Death of the weirdo?
I'm high, check my altitude, I'm lounging in the Lear home
Feel a buzz, a little coolaid and Codeine
I say getting your ass whipped is a sure thing
It aint safe in the war, the war I'm playing my shark tank
On the trip to the mall, made your bitch ass plank
I touched more p-ssy than maxipads
Now Detox can be your little rap rehab
Bitch just a second visit from the repo man
And you can't afford your monthlys, I mean God damn
Man, you aint worth your shoes you standing in
When I party I bring a bitch to bring the cannon in
You said you was gonna see me when your homie got shot
It's been a while so I'm guessing you must've forgot
Once again you gorget, aint this some shit
You forgot about me bitch I wrote your hits
You know ""how we do"", ""hate it or love it"" and nigga fuck it I'm special
That's why your ass say my verse

My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Have mercy on many men

Some days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing

Is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel

But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
And I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that week
It was when Aaliyah died I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Of a real love

Telling me to run away

I fall to my knees when you're around
Time stands still
And you don't even try
I've got to have you in my life

I've got you on my mind

Television dreams of tomorrow.
We're not the ones who're meant to follow.
For that's enough to argue.

Well maybe I'm the faggot America.
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.
Now everybody do the propaganda.
And sing along to the age of paranoia.

5 Seconds Of Summer,Amnesia,/5/5+seconds+of+summer/amnesia_21080655.html,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though all your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

‘Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
‘Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them even when I feel alone
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to see you happy and it hurts that you moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

‘Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

I made a promise that I'll come home soon
Bring me back, bring me back to you

Time stops, I wish that I could rewind

And the shining as we fade into the night

5 Seconds Of Summer,End Up Here,/5/5+seconds+of+summer/end+up+here_21085275.html,"You walked in, 
Everyone was asking for your name
You just smiled
And told them, “trouble.”

My head spins, I’m pressed against the wall
Just watching your every move.
You’re way too cool and you’re coming this way
Coming this way

How did we end up talking, 
In the first place?
You said you liked my Cobain shirt
Then we’re walking back to your place
You’re telling me how you love that song
About living on a prayer
I’m pretty sure that we’re halfway there
And when I wake up next to you
I wonder how
How did we end up here?

How did we end up, how did we end up here?

Next day out
Everybody thought you were so insane
'Cause you are so far out
Of my league

My friends say I should lock you down
Before you figure me out and you run away
But you don’t and you won’t
As you kiss me and you tell me that you’re here to stay

How did we end up talking, 
In the first place?
You said you liked my Cobain shirt
Then we’re walking back to your place
You’re telling me how you love that song
About living on a prayer
I’m pretty sure that we’re halfway there
And when I wake up next to you
I wonder how
How did we end up here?

Call me lucky ’cause in the end
I’m a 6 and she’s a 10
She’s so fit I’m insecure
But she keeps coming back for more

How did we end up talking, 
In the first place?
You said you liked my Cobain shirt
Then we’re walking back to your place
You’re telling me how you love that song
About living on a prayer
I’m pretty sure that we’re halfway there
And when I wake up next to you
I wonder how
How did we end up here?

How did we end up, how did we end up here?
How did we end up, how did we end up here?"

I was looking for attention,
Needed intervention
Felt somebody looking at me
With a powder white complexion
Feeling the connection

The way she looked was so ridiculous
Every single step had me waiting for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me out the bar
To the back seat of a car

When the lights go out
She’s all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain, kissing in the rain
I can’t forget my English love affair

Today, I’m seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king sized bed
Means I can’t forget my English love affair

My English love affair

Next thing we were back at her place
A hideaway in Mayfair
All the great and good there
Drinking all the way to third base
Princess getting naked
Falling on their faces

The storyline was so ridiculous
Every single step had me begging for the next
Before I knew it, it was serious
Dragged me up the stairs
And it wasn’t ending there

When the lights go out
She’s all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain, kissing in the rain
I can’t forget my English love affair

Today, I’m seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king sized bed
Means I can’t forget my English love affair

When I got out I knew that
Nobody I knew would be believing me
I look back now and know that
Nobody can take away the memory

When the lights go out
She’s all I ever think about
The picture burning in my brain, kissing in the rain
I can’t forget my English love affair

Today, I’m seven thousand miles away
The movie playing in my head
Of her king sized bed
Means I can’t forget my English love affair

My English love affair
My English love affair"

And it comes with a cost of being alone

Everything is falling down
We’re suffering, helpless thoughts and
Out we sing, prayers go to the sky

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
(Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get out)
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out

And if we fall
It’s not your fault
Shadows covering
Our selfish foes
And as our love,
Can go out on a high note

Even when the sky is falling down
Even when the earth is crumbling ‘round my feet
Around my feet

And if the earth ends up crumbling down to its knees baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out
(Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get out)
And if the skyscrapers tumble down and crash around baby
We just gotta get out, we just gotta get out

We just gotta get out
We just gotta get out

So call me over set me free.

You say thanks for being a friend

Till I headed her way to say,

Woke up lying next to her.

Streaking past the neighbors house.

Singing songs on our guitars

Crazy, stupid, you and me

I wanna get lost and drive forever with you,
Talking ‘bout nothing, yeah whatever, babe

Taking the long way home

Yeah you know we took our time to get there
We’re hiding out in a tree
Catching fire like kerosene
And you know I’d never let you down
'Til the sun comes up, we can own this town
Something like make believe
Living in a movie scene

Talkin ‘bout nothing, yeah whatever, babe

Kissing at the stop signs, darling

And everything is alright
Now we’re turning off the headlights, darling

To turn it around, leave it all behind.
But every time you turn out to be
One step ahead of me.

Only you can cure my sickness.
Raise ourselves and our middle finger,

Once I got a little taste, 
Now I'm addicted to your fix.
Oh yeah, this time, maybe this time, 
Two wrongs make a right.

He stayed at home and played his X-Box.

He watched too much TV.
Then, somehow it got around
That his parents would be out of town,
And so they all decided
That he should have a party.

Climbing through the windows,
They were jumping off the roof.
They were diving in the pool,
Until he finally let loose.

He said, ""Tonight I'm superhero,
Watch me fly I'll never get low
And I won't come down again.
Tonight I'm superhero,
I'm about to lose my halo.
I wanna do it again.""

But this is the night his luck would change.

But she was so sexy.
Then, they started throwin' bottles,
Partied 'til they trashed the whole house.
But he just didn't care though,
Cos he was finally happy.

Clark Kent and Lois Lane.
They started making out and it would never be the same.

Maybe your reflection shows, you’re screaming out for help (woah)
And you try your best to just keep up, and your feet they fall behind
But the beat you’re marching to, you’re keeping perfect time

Oh the sun will rise

But she gets dressed down.

She's seventeen, I told her I am twenty.
I couldn't take her out cause mom's got no money.
It's stuff like this that makes me wish it could change somehow.
Sitting here at home, it's obvious

She's so out of reach, and I'm finding it hard
'Cause she makes me feel, makes me feel,
Like I try, like I try, like I'm trying too hard,
'Cause I'm not being me, and it's getting me down
'Cause she makes me think, makes me think,
That I try, that I try, that I'm trying too hard again
'Cause I'm trying too hard again

She's got a rose tattoo but she keeps it covered,
I play guitar but she's into drummers,
She's seen my face around but she doesn't even know my name
I pierced my lip so she thinks I'm cool,
I ripped my jeans and dropped out of school,
I followed her 'round the town but she thinks that I'm a weirdo now

That I try, that I try, that I'm trying too hard again

But now, who knew?
She's in the crowd of my show
Nothing to lose,
She's standing right in the front row
The perfect view,
She came alone on her own,
And there's something that you should know

You're so out of reach, and I'm finding it hard
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
Yeah she makes me feel, she makes me feel

I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty

It was more than just a neon weekend
Light slipping through the third floor curtain
Spreading love like the morning news from the day before

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty

It's enough to let the night let go of me
A few steps into the open doorway
Heart pounding, there's a noise complaint from room 304

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

You met me in your backyard that night
In the moonlight you looked just like an angel in disguise
My whole life seemed like a postcard

You were mine for a night
I was out of my mind
You were mine for a night
I don't know how to say goodbye

Making all our plans in the Santa Cruz sand that night
Thought I had you in the palm of my hand that night
Screaming at the top of my lungs til my chest felt tight
I told myself that I'm never gonna be alright

You had me wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm wrapped around your finger

And I know that I'm not always with you
But you need to know that I do love you
And forever that's the way it will stay

And I know it's hard to trust me
When I'm always out with all my boys
It's my job and I will never be broken
When I go home, it's with you I'll stay

I try too hard to keep this going
And I will as long as you do too
Plus I love you and I will always will do
I only wanna be with you

I wish I had a sign to show you
You mean the world to me and that's the truth
I don't wanna be with no one else, boy

Why?
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is
That I---Love you, I just
I don't know
It's just coming to an end
Then it's better for me, to let it go now
Then to hold on, and be hurt
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
It's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we've been and fell apart
I really wanna work this out
But I don't think it's gonna change
You do but I don't
I think it's best we go our separate ways
I'm the one who's been hurt in this relationship
I ain't happy baby, always lonely baby
'Cause there's so many other things you gotta deal with
I think that we should let it burn

[Chorus]
When you feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know you gotta let it go
Cause the party ain't jumping like it use to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of me being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's true
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sending pages I ain't suppose to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself, calling him your name
Fellas tell me do you understand?
And all my ladies do you feel my pain?
It's the way that I feel
I know it's too late
Gotta do what is the best
I can't go running back
What I gotta do now
To get my baby back? Oooh
I just don't know how I'm gonna do without my Boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been 3-eleven days, umm-teen hours
Imma be burning till you return

Hate the thoughts of me being with someone else

We know that it's true
Let it burn
Let it burn

I'm twisted cause one side of me is telling me that I need to let it go
On the other side I wanna break down and cry [Oooh]
I'm twisted cause one side of me is telling me that I need to let it go
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, cry

To break your heart and tear your world apart
Its feels so bad but feels so good
Watching you walk away from me
I don't wanna hurt ya!
Its for our own good
I miss you and I love you, goodbye

Sorry, sorry, sorry for leaving you now
I tried so hard, so so hard
But I'm done trying
Long nights, bad fights, all alone, all those nights
In my bed, you went out, I'm crying myself to sleep

I guess you didn't know
What I was about to do, to get through to you
But now that you do, it's just too late
I'm sorry but it's over!"

I remember the first the day, me and you first laid,
Eyes on each other made me feel so special
Like I had a angel holding me and wouldn't let go
So as I let go my heart, the one you had from the start
The one I know you wont tare apart, or leave in the dark
Your like a spark, you seem to light up my days
Everytime you smile I know there's happiness heading my way
At night I lay in bed and I stare at the stars
See the similarity in your eyes, and wonder where you are
But then I know the place you'll always be is my heart
Which you'll never ever part, since you made your mark
If I could I'd give the world only to you
Because the feelings I have are so true, so boo
Coress my life with your heart, mind, and soul
Promise me that you'll never let go, once you get a hold
Cuz I wont I'm telling you this now
That I'm yours forever and I'll always be around

I'd pour out my soul
I really wish you were here
Time is going by very slow
You were here with me jus a day ago
Didn't I mean everything to you
Or am I being selfish
I know I don't ask for much, just to feel your touch and here you say I loved you
Every now and then find a close friend, now you're gone
Now it's hard at the end of the day coming home to an empty house
I try to find the words to say but they jus won't come out baby

How could you throw this away baby?
How could you not be here today?
I thought we had everything, you left me all alone
Please come back home, I need your love
I can still picture the look on your face, when I told you I needed some space
I tried to work it out, make everything better baby I made a mistake
I never meant to cause you pain
I never meant to tell you to leave
I'll try to change for you if you change for me
I want ya back now come Back to me
I no I told you couldn't take it any more
But if your now here I can't go on
How could you throw this away my baby?
How could you not be here today?

And I never thought twice

Now I see that I was wrong
So I wrote this song, for you
To tell you that we belong together

Though you never thought about me this way
But I'm here to say today
That I love ya, I love you
He did me wrong,
But you were always there for me
But now I see, the only one wrong was me

How many years went by that I never realized
That you were there in front of my eyes
I never even noticed the way you looked at me
When I was getting ready to go out with him

Why did it take so long to see that I need you
Why did you take so long to open your heart
I wish that I knew now
What I didn't know then
Coz I would've been a little more smart
I'd have your heart

Though you never thought about me this way
But I'm here to say today
That I love ya, I love you

7th Heaven,In Time You'll Be Mine,/7/7th+heaven/in+time+youll+be+mine_20646320.html,"Chorus:
One day I saw you, you saw me
I said I love you, you said it was a mystery
I looked at you and said ""In time you'll be mine""

Verse 1:
I always thought that you loved me
All you said was to wait and see
Oh, how I got so happy
Just knowing that you loved me

Bridge:
So I'm waiting, always waiting
For you to answer me
So I'm waiting, always waiting
I keep calling just to see

Chorus: 2x

Verse 2:
Late at night, I saw you, you saw me
After the day you said you loved me
Hand in hand, was you and your ex-girlfriend
You said I hope that we can still be friends

(music fades)

Verse 3:
I cried and cried that night
'Cause I thought you were mine
Things were not supposed to be this way
Don't you see?
It's not ok!

I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you,
But you know, this thing ain't been
No walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

[Dara] How do you let it go? When you,
You just don't know? What's on,
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
Cuz I know!

[Cl] There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Boy it's not you, it's me
I gotta gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it,
And it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

[Bom] But I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
(Found myself asking, ""Why? Why?"")
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl I never
Meant to crush your world
And I never
Thought I would see the day we'd grow apart
And I wanna know

What I'm tryna say.
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
How you not gonna see it?

Bro I had a dream man it was buried in lore
That I was sailing on the seas and I was out to explore
And it was lucid in a way homey I didn't need bars uh-uh
I had a feeling that yo been there before yo
I hit shore it was shrouded in mist
And in the distance coming in view a primordial forest
A people then approached waving their hands
They were speaking in a tongue I could not understand
They led me through? To a beautiful fire
And it deepened in a way that I forgot I admired
What emerged was more than the wholeness within
I'd seen the men who had seen me the beasts I had been

A shaman held a rattle that he started to shake
Anxiety was filling me and was this all a mistake
An elder fell to the ground marking the dirt
He was drawing up a map defining sky and the earth
He pointed to the east, north, west and the south
And then he pointed to the heavens and he started to shout
The women in the front at once began to chant
While the men beat on drums and that elder man danced

Or stars above me
Are you a flower
Or more like a high rise tower
If so the soul of sweet delight
On you will shower
There's a place for us they say is somewhere
Not a dream but a place and you will be there

Amid the fractals and the combinations
Of the signs it's not hard to find
Patterns that flow bright
And the bluest light
Now enhanced with your crystal sight

Never forget
It will be wicked
Get your ticket
Bomb the town
With a sound
Shakes the ground
Everybody

Never forget
It will be wicked
Get your ticket
Bomb the town
With a sound
Shakes the ground
Everybody get down

A mighty stupid set of currents
To swim through around me now
A bigger task to hold location
Then to swim upstream some how

The art of remaining free
Is a skill upon itself these days
The overflowing things for you to see
Others talk you out of doing your way, yeah

You've established some telepathy
And tech-remote viewing
So you're all-knowing right
Answer me how the future will be
Is it the end or just the beginning
Follow me

First you gotta break with drastic measure
Then confusion gives way to flash of light
Next your gonna find blissful pleasure
In a freedom reigning through blissful foresight, yeah

Do it smoothly
Feel the love let it soothe thee
Send ya to bliss with all the wisdom
Of the sweetest kiss
World that you know
Sacred temple
Is what you're given
Receive the medicine

Never forget
It will be wicked
Get your ticket
Bomb the town
With a sound
Shakes the ground
Everybody

Never forget
It will be wicked
Get your ticket
Bomb the town
With a sound
Shakes the ground
Everybody get down

A mighty stupid set of currents
To swim through around me now
A bigger task"

Collision, no use in running from
My senses picking up the pulse
The silence said a mouthful
Intuition, didn’t know what I was waiting for

Can’t go very far, gonna notice where you are
Got a love for you so large, fixed to you like a star
Can’t go very far, gonna notice where you are
Got a love for you so large, fixed to you like a star

Every time I think I got it figured
Something bigger always jumps in the frame
Something gets in the way

Now I’m ready to turn the page on yesterdays and forgive them
Now I’m willing to disengage to seize the day and move on

Wanna swing you higher
Wanna swing you higher

Vibration, coming up from the ground
Translation, something just more than sound
When I move on to the next world
I’ll wait for you over there
Rotation, my head the other way around

[Chorus:]

If I’m not careful I may
Slip away before I get
One last look at your face
You now I’ll see you again
Somewhere in another time and space"

I wanna break out the maze
Escape the dark haze these days
So many kids I know your feelin' crazed
Crave material thangs and makin' slave wages
Baggy pockets only got laundry fluff
Livin' where rich people always buyin' some stuff
So you try to act tough and hide what's inside
Hold your head high gettin' fucked up and throwin' dice
As bad as yours and bad enough I'm sure
My heart wants to love but must navigate through war
Cuz seein' that we're wired to short circuit
Must mean the meek who will inherit the earth already work it

There's a land by the sand grab the money
Plastic the life end of the century
People actin' fake can't see the omens
Wake up yourself cause change is comin'
There's a land by the sand grab the money
Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy
And everybody starts to peep around corners
Before they take their next step they know their borders

In this $19. 98 plus shipping and handling type
Netherworld everytime merchandise dips in our coffers
We buy that image that cost of livin' uh huh
The fakest shit and act cool our friends are watchin'
Attention shoppers check the selection in our reflection
Don't you feel good does it enhance your fresh complexion
You gotta have it you got got to have it [2x]
As the world turns and all the money we burn
On the bullshit to make us happy sometimes we never learn
We're self centered we think were better
We look down as a people upon our elders

There's a land by the sand grab the money
Now let go of it cause it's dissolving
It created all your fears and kept you hustling
Made you sever all the ties to your family
There's a land by the sand grad the money
Plastic the life end of the century
People actin' fake can't see the omens
Wake up yourself cause change is comin'
There's a land by the sand grab the money
Hollywood is such a place fuelin' the frenzy

Back when I was just a kid
Skin was paper thin
Folded up like origami
Turned the sensitivity in me into an army
Standing at the castle walls that stood before me
I couldn't climb until I learned to let the people in
Even though it hurt me, lit the fire from within
Made me feel like I can make it through anything
No matter what they bring, tell me that I'll never win

Everything I need is right in front of me
I wanna bridge the gap and feel the unity
Yeah, everything I need is in the air I breathe
You get back what you give, and I was born to live, born to live

I know all that you've been through
Feeling like you might not make it alone
'Cause I have walked a mile in your shoes
Yeah, I know all that you
I know all that you've been through

[Verse 2]
I wanna see the empire fall
Before I go, I wanna see justice for 'em all
I wanna see my daughters get married
But I can't if I'm in the cemetery
I can hear it when it calls
The call of the void I'll avoid til the very end
'Til the bad guys lose and the good guys win
'Til the grabbers lose their grip, ripped from under my skin
I'ma take a deep breath

Pull the covers tight, the world could be freezing

Hoping they can see beyond the grey skies

311,Brodels,/3/311/brodels_20001052.html,"Ooh you know we pepper you
With a sonic assault side step a you
I cannot think of a better way
That we could celebrate freedom
Than make up a set of goals and cold beat 'em
See dumb verbal tags like audio spaghetti
Give a shout to the one they call yeti
I bet he put the cabash on any foes what'soever
Like original brodel Trevor
Positive vibe merchant grandson of Lord Buckley
Scotish ralston shows up if you're lucky
Ad raspler the sweed a friend in deed
He's keeping an eye on the other guy's gred
These are 311 characters I dubbed everyone
The story ain't over but my rhyme is done

It was the year that I first touched ground
So I grabbed the microphone and I got down
Just like James Brown gather round of our sight and sound
Pound for pound we throw down rather profound
I'll put you in another world I can't hear you
Like having phone sex with a deaf girl
No doubt we got the jams that'll smack ya
I penned three books of lyrics 2 for action 1 for backup
''cause I'm a cold rockin' brother got transistor tunes
And it feels real good to get close to you

The brodels is the nazz and the nazz knows where it's at
The brodels is the nazz who knows a cat who can feed a cat
The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter
To be one who loves to be one who works
The nazz not something that can be given
The brodel is inside you it comes from within
When I feel into the sea
When the world came and kissed me
Transformed my shit told the shark I was a dolphin
Swam quick funny though
Parranahs chilled and laughed at
The way that I took off my polka dots on top of that
The wales know I'm quick watch out
And I get funky fresh as for the fishes I'm lit luminous
I'm not nouveau techno I glow like a glacial
In skin that swims faster than speed
I am I be dropped out of nothing I will return to nothing
Rotate my style my rhyme my way magician of a rythm
Lover of animals damn I wanna hear 'em
Aquatic my way I got soul shape

Well I'm 6 foot 3 and like Mohammed Ali
I float like a butterfly and sting like poison ivy
Drive a 69 lincoln suicide doors
Around the town I'm slinking fat subs of course
We're the greatest show on earth
You know we turn it out daily
In and out of town like Baarnum and Bailey
I know that is a simile but I couldn't resist
From Solomon Roadie for the PJ's
I don't think he'll be pissed
I eat a cobb salad, smoked fish, duck, or clam chowder
Chill with indica and Guinness
Steer clear of white powder
I run into my brother give him a pound and a yodel
They know my word is bond talkin' bout the brodels

The brodels is the nazz and the nazz knows where it's at
The brodels is the nazz who knows a cat who can feed a cat
The goal is to be a poet and a carpenter
To be one who loves to be one who works
The nazz not something that can be given
The brodel is inside you it comes from within

And we're fresh dude just check my man P
He said I will not muddle my mind with impertinency
Lost a lot in vegas plays a lot of Sega
Saw a phrase that he likes and put it on his leg
And we're fresh dude just check my man D he said

Comin' in ruff and tuff all systems are tweakin'
People all over the world they must be thinkin'
All the shit that we kickin' our shoes must be stinkin'"

Won't take a dive, we're gonna thrive
We got a condition called ambition
To the cosmic utopian thrivin' mission

Chorus

Witness this, yo the pissed lyricist
In your face celebratin' a brand new race
We know colors are just brothers and some others
Drive on the ginger but they failed to mention
The consequence of no conscience
You can't fool, I'm schoolin' you with the new school
Now speakin on a round, step back mother fucker, I'm goin' to town

We get intimate

With the music and the people
Yeah they're into it

Takin' off cruisin' through the air

The sound is aerodynamic
Let me take you there

I am a
Cool and mellow man

Always got a plan

Copin' out problems every time i can

I'd like to be known as a great
Communicator

If you got beef don't save it for later

I battle evil weekly monthly yearly
But every step i take the devil stays near me

Otherwise maintain on the globe
Just another space trippin' vato

Massive yang and yin on this earth
We spin

Sometimes i gotta center find out who i am

I chill out i let in the wind

I gotta feel the pulse of the planet on my skin

I got news for ya it ain't nothin' nice
We all got demons we all gotta vice
The struggle never ends
To keep it in check
But i never stop trying
To make the trek whadup

Which one is it who ya gonna believe
Undivided in my material being
Undivided life
You can't fade me
Desperate the cling i make to positivity
Stay gettin' it on til the doubt is gone
If you could be dissuaded you were dead all along
Like what's up now you can't fade me
Still in that same old trade of positivity"

Beyond the limits of our mind
Direction leading all of mankind
Where there was music and the people who danced
To the players of the singers romance
Receiving messages encoded in rhythm
Encrypted secrets in the beat of the drum

[Chorus]
I can't believe in disbelief, but tell me where we are
I've spent lifetimes searching for you
A million years and some tears since I been on the farm
But I've spent way more looking for truth
I come again on the wind, bringing it back to start
What was the dream you told me?
I put together all the memories of a broken heart
About a world so deafening

[Verse 2]
We met, however unlikely
Came to form a collective psyche
We all have a voice that we have to deny
That'll say I'm not enough and that I need not apply
We redefine the mark of what can be done
We blaze it up and know we don't have to run

[Chorus]
I looked up into a sky and it was full of clouds
It's as clear as a photograph
Memories on a breeze, what were they all about?
Every time I see it, I laugh
Abandoned loves and some dreams, it's coming back now
We cannot help but thinking back
It all circles around, I'll nab 'em somehow
As well as looking down the track
What's next?

[Outro]
Sneaky and subtle
Between a kick and a cuddle
Get back in the huddle naturally
It's a cycle
Just like the day and the nightfall
Going deeper and deeper
And we'll never repeat along the way"

No suspicion
Only dreams without end

Will you let me retract let me take it back
Sometimes my words lack and my mind flies off the track
What I'm trying to convey is miles from what I say
And you slip away

In life there are times
When nothing will rhyme
There are days I slip
When I know I should climb
Breakin' the vows I swore I'd never break
A harsh word a white lie easy to mistake
Where have you been
Haven't you noticed
There's no map that exists
To point us out of this
My heart was the target
It found your arrow
Baby you know I want to be
Your straight and narrow

I been trying to transmit a feeling
I been hoping you receive what I'm revealing
See the main thing is hang with me and relate
As we communicate watch out
Fenced in like a dog between houses
Balled up by the trouble my mouth gets
Wrapped up in the things that I don't know
Don't you know

Didn't I know I'm wrong wrong wrong when you knew
You didn't have to give me so long long long to see through
Not predictable what I will do but you know
Cause you cracked the code

Your body is a country
That you know I'll return to
Craving like a family heirloom
That I am into
No baby how could I follow
Everything you do
Just remember when we touch
I feel so renewed

The first to understand me that would be you
It can't work if we can't be open and true
The best thing to happen to me let it be told
That would be the moment that you cracked my code oh oh

Easier than you would like to think
Your best friend could up and leave you
Playing tricks and cold deceive you
Standing there people stare
Let down by your own mind

Day of appreciation
For ways your mind has not yet let you down
The truth is that we will all go
Maybe five minutes after the show
You know you are a shooting star
A blazing flash then gone

Are we advancing
Or a collapsing visionary
Are we really here
Are we imaginary
As my thoughts separates
Into the many frayed parts
Torn shattered bits
My mind falling apart

Are we advancing
Or a collapsing visionary
Are we really here
Are we imaginary
As my thoughts separates
Into the many frayed parts
Torn shattered bits
My mind falling apart

What if there was such a thing
What if there's such a thing as dependence day
There's no self congratulation
Just a day of appreciation
Quietly humbly
For things that have not gone wrong

Imagine the frustration
Of losing bearing of the simplest thing
So come with your best
And do your worst before
You can't remember what you came for

Are we advancing
Or a collapsing visionary
Are we really here
Are we imaginary
As my thoughts separates
Into the many frayed parts
Torn shattered bits
My mind falling apart

Blazing out the mains
Hungry flames consume all that I see

Are we advancing
Or a collapsing visionary
Are we really here
Are we imaginary
As my thoughts separates
Into the many frayed parts
Torn shattered bits
My mind falling apart

Are we advancing
Or a collapsing visionary
Are we really here
Are we imaginary
As my thoughts separates
Into the many frayed parts
Torn shattered bits
My mind falling apart"

There ain't no reason why
Good things can't be
At another times
I see them make that money
Right in front of me

Days of '88
We had everything in life
If you looked at it right
We had reasons cause things rhymes
Because things rhymes
Because things rhymes

Then it hit me

This trip has taken me
Somewhere I thought I'd never be
To a place that feels a long time coming
When we're speaking easily
It really sets me free
Why don't we just go on jamming
See the energy shining all around you
Higher than the smoke that might surround you

It's like eat work play sleep
Drinking out jams eight days a week
It's like wake up what can I say
I want another one just like today
Come on

Looking back in my mind
How about those times
Were they all a dream
In the story would we I
Wild with the limes
We were all a team

We had everything in life

Here's a little story to follow
I bet ya
Humming through the same one tomorrow
You never know
It could have been a swing and a miss
Or just another go
It's something that we couldn't resist
I'll tell ya better know

And the stupid mother fucker who made you think so
That punk is a coward let that be told
I hear voices in the night that are electric
He kicks theshit out of her because he's heartless
She won't leave she has low self esteem
He's got gravitational pull
Sucks her body till her heart and her limbs grow cold

How can I love you after you're dead
Hang in there keep trying
How can I love you after dying

I'm thinking of a picture that's keeping me in stitch
You're causing me a mental glitch
'Cause jealousy is such a bitch
I hereby emancipate myself from that
You can consider yourself free to flirt and chat
With whoever you want
It should have always been that way
The way that you flant the way that you play

Stronger than you think, stand up if you care
Get up off the ground, don't let me down
Get up off the ground, don't let me down

Because I'm above it you hurt someone I love
It takes two to make a thing go right and that's trite
But one just to sneak and weasel through the night

If you hurt her again i'll fuck you up, fuck you up
If you hurt her again i'll fuck you up
If you hurt her again i'll fuck you up, fuck you up"

You should be adored for

Can you tell me that much

Ah-ah she told me don't dwell

Sometimes I need reminding
Regret is so blinding
But like I told me don't dwell

Cool breeze light squeeze life

Chalk it up as another dialectic
Hard like a jam
Smooth like a ballad
Call it what you want but I call it sound salad
A salad grown in the garden of Eden
Seekin' out pleasures like my boys in Sweden
That's right the grooves tight like
Sit back just relax, let your mind unwind
Pull your good thing close, let tranquility surround
Psychedelic freak out taco funk frolic
Grind fiend roots 'core soul music what have you

Step back and think about the topic of this song

In the break room waiting for a big boom
Smoke haze rising in a big plume
Everyone’s dissatisfied

The pools have dried the trial’s been tried
But the leak’s still spilling they don’t know what to do
The flow won’t stop pressure still won’t drop
Tanks are overfilling

Forward we crawl backwards we fall through the ebb and the flow
Living within a dream wading through the stream beyond the ebb and flow

Up late to earn the proceeds
All stressed out, working until your eyes bleed
Overtime to buy things we don’t need

Always on the go and you’re thirty thirty
Gotta make the ends and get dirty dirty
Will it ever stop will it ever end
Is it worthy

Reality of this is you go loco loco
And too much of this way and you’ll go postal postal
Happens all the time just get in line
And go comatose

The moms and pops have all closed up shop
And who can blame them? I don’t know anyone
The kids just hide scared to go outside
And just who can blame them?

We can see but we can’t feel
And no one’s at the wheel
Born here all alone

The ones who make you feel ill
And you think that nature should have killed
Those you curse when you're alone
Seem to be so close to home

To be on
Feels like standing still
For eons and eons
Stare it dead in the eye

To shut it down

now we abide by limits I cannot defend
it fits good and yet the best we reject
you get what you get I guess don’t get upset

got lots to do but time with you

I find a place where I can go where no one ever will find
I make a perfect exchange I'm making connections strange
Sometimes the places that I go make people think I'm deranged
If there's a reason that you're holding up the wall let it fall
I think it's treason when I'm seeing people throwing it all

Yes, and I am from Nebraska
My girl is satisfied, you can ask her
You know I've never visited Alaska

For polluting the sea, an atrocity

Rollin with the rhythm of the rhyme I'm rollin

Now the b-boys rockin breakin' moves on the floor
311's stepping out and you're yellin for more
I'm hoping, I'm poetry in motion

And in your mouth the rhythm is booming
P to the N to the U to the T

Just fuck the has-been's and their stupid-ass rambling
Brothers saying bullshit you can't come through with
Do it in the basement no complacence
It's time to kick the fuck in
Begin to win no sin and then
Share it, declare it in the public domain

I'd be perfectly glad if rap was a fad but it's not
So I'd thought I'd come out with a shot

Sa has the wisdom of a nobel laureate
I'm down for our days of glory
It's easy to do when you're up with Sexton
A rhythmatic genius, turnin' up the next one
Would you know, you're a bro, I flow in that circumstance
You'll get your chance

Becuase payback is a motherfuckin' mission
To the sharp-ass rocks slippin' on us but we rock
It comes to writing on us derision
Sendin you a voice now we're sending you a vision

And those who fought me they say they taught me everything I know
I go awwww, when I hear that, that chit and that chat, bullshit!
So sick of me knowing everything, saying!

Never give in never conform

Dead leaves on the trees in spring
Can't hear the birds sing
A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening
Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver
A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver
While I doze I suppose I could get lost
With a brownskin friend claiming kin to crazy horse
I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but
I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid

Steady drinking smoking the green weed
And head is sort of blinking
You're going with the flow
And everybody is getting plowed
The voices and the music and the noise is getting loud
You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around
So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown
Only nineteen but you know where you can get it
So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting
By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead
You really can't remember who was the one that said
Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck
He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up
Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed
You try for conversation
But you know you're acting strange
Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone
You just keep fiending 'til the fucking break of dawn

Reality is our intention

It’s like meditation
Beyond medication
And striving for the transformation

Quantum leaping through science
To cosmic compliance
By ending our fossil reliance

Now the miscalculations
Are causing mutations
Here’s your correction, boom!

It’s something beyond comprehension
We come from another dimension
It is our one true intention
To change your fate yes I’m telling you

Beings that once were cetacean
Resonating through earth’s vibration
Want you to solve the equation
Before it’s too late c’mon!

Power without control
Dig yourself into a hole
Rocketing on the horizon rising

Philosophy expressed to me
Moments spending silently
Listening to the horizon rising

The nuclei dividing before my eyes
I wonder why how can this be at all
Imagine a time
Before words made a rhyme
Before clocks to wind
Before they had the chance to stall

Across the ocean across the sea
Navigating disparity"

Got five of everything but I just need one

Into whose womb were you woven what kin of your skin dropped you then
Bodies cloven
Light of daybreak blinded next exit
The wild darkness forming inside it
My day wasn't promised me each death it brings reminding me we
Are rumbling through this cursed universe where death is birth
Think not but what your manifest is worth
Giving up a verse the curse occurs a thirst
To burst first breaking through the center of the universe
Slamming down on the lingo flow so jam to the bumrush single
Long ago has been become now when you find out there's no break

Come closer, come closer

Nothing could be half so compelling
As you and me, our senses telling us where to go
You give me quite a show
We’re stretched out horizontal throttle down
Upon the ground and always taking it slow
Here we go

I taste the salt on your skin and then it’s really beginning
I got the message you’re sending
Go again and again ’til we’re spent
I hear somebody coming

Oh

Oh, in the company of pretty girls and new vagrants
One drink away from sleeping on the pavement
I'm not quite sure what I find so appealing
About the happy hour stealing

A party, after party

Diving back in the abyss
And it gets so very stale

And I'm drawn to the night
And this damn neon light

Let me guess bet I know
Does it have a sign in the window
Ice cold six packs to go
Sleep it off if you have to
There's a booth always in shadow
The reality is all around you
It's the best reality show

Oh, in the company of the privileged and the nearly damned
Mixing like a cocktail of your spirit slam
In the danger zone is where you'll find me
In a certain dive so inviting

Don't even try it, you don't want to disrespect me
If dealing with punks was school, I'd have a Harvard degree
You can't make me hate you no mater how punk you act
No matter what you do I don't react
I'm a perfect example of not giving a fuck
About the catty rude people that just suck
What do you know all of the sudden, ah I usurp you
Look it up in the dictionary to find out what I do
I go back to the style I came from
It's not something you can fake son
You're a con man who's run is done
You lead a world wide web of deception

Everyone needs to forget upon re-entry
Orbiting space quantum saints, we're the only
Beginning from a planet so naturally
Gifted in the heart lies our technology
It's only right, right
Entering in a space of pure delight, light
Next contestant on this jam is, tight
Feels spontaneous you'll improvise, vise

From chaos comes clarity, I tell ya
What you appear to be, you ought to know
Glycerin tears don't fool me, I tell ya
Delusions plaguing everybody"

Awww shit
What, unh

We keep on searching from the seaside
To the mountainside, come on
Hardly outstyled and hardly outblazened
Nectar natural, completely amazing
Others more concerned with just fronting on hardness
I flow sweet with millennium niceness
I don't know if they're just scared or what
But a little sincerity would knock them on their butt
I keep my dogs at my side and I keep my shit tight
Let me tell you how I feel, all right

Y'all's radio rock ain't that tuff
Can't move to that ain't deep enough
One more time groove on the line
Chill's up my spine, ready, rewind

The only thing that never gets old is honesty
You'll probably be caught up fronting
The only thing you always try to be is hard

Livin' my life nice in pursuit of groove-ology
I'm getting vibes like you checking me out
Without a doubt I pull clout and crush crews in a rout
I'm a Doberman in any given reaction
Well-mannered and reserved, yet ready for action
I let you have it all, I got nothin to hide
I tell ya how we comin', we comin' full ride
Full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
As you'd expect we come correct
While others just run and hide
Full ride, full ride, we work in on the inside
As you'd expect we come correct

I get fucked up rockin the jams, I bump disco
Playin' records all day I then let go
I'm the king of my town
But when my girl is around
Parlay like the Count of of Monte Cristo
So simple the jams are in front of me
Get drunk in New York, make fun of me
When we play it's a serous thing
To all the people who that gather
Here's what we bring

The only thing that never gets old is honesty

Free energy has been harnessed
We don't use it why
Cuz the techniques been suppressed
The hour glass has passed through granules

Bust all these rules and switch
Change up the pitch
Rearrange our lives and this dumb shit we'll ditch

I found a bootleg of the cosmic conscious then erased it
Visualized the breath technique slowly became it
Now something is watchin' me
Since I have found the keys
To free this energy

Foundation is crumbling away
Fault lines in her words
Hoping to show her so disturbed that
Has shaped her to what she is today

Getting through to her

Sometimes when I call
She tells me things that were not her fault
And her surface starts to break
Breakdown a hurting sound
I want to tell her that it's ok now
But I'm not too sure just what to say

Getting through to her
Getting through to her
Getting through to her

All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon

Excuse me did she say
She wished she went away
And not return to the shame
Brought to her those days
We'll take man's dirty deeds
And suck them out like cosmic beings
Into the sun hoping
They'll be happy burning
But life is not T. V.
Life is not T. V.
Life is not T. V.

She's on wounded knee
And well crazy horse that's me
Her hard parts I'm cradling
I feel refreshed when I watch her sleep

It's all about the company we keep

And be sure it stays done

Bloom in your mind

Never left behind

You should just give me a call
You should just give me a call

I think about you much more than I should
Now there's a structure nothing had once stood
No more bluffing it's cards on the table time
What it must be we will take it as a sign

So just give me a call
So just give me a call

Sunset and my love left me
Winter and I'm so far
In darkness will it lead me
Where the meanings are

I miss and think of you often
No flowers I forgot them
The weather's the same
Nothing happens
No love's a hard lesson

Patience and years will refashion
What hours will undo
And circles not yet quite circles
Somehow close true
I keep on hearing the things that you said
I keep on feeling you go straight to my head
No more bluffing it's cards on the table time
What it must be we will take it as a sign

So just give me a call
So just give me a call

I call you up but you won't talk to me
No space for words there's just no room
I drift away but you pull me in
I'm the ocean you're the moon

Ooh how do I know if it's just me
Sometimes I think that it must be
You gotta know you can trust me

I think about you much more than I should

There's a door open to walk through
All I want is, just beyond
What if I could let my guard down
Into freedom, on and on

Somehow it came out
What I can't talk about
Someone to help me
As free as I wanna be
I cannot erase
But you helped me face
The songs and the flowers

At last, perception
Of my self-deception
And then the songs and the flowers

There's a door open to walk through
All I want is, just beyond
What if I could let my guard down
Into freedom, on and on

What if I could just let my guard down
What if I could live wide open
What if I could just let my guard down
And go beyond into the great unknown

Sweetheart I've been bothered
A golden sunlit path I've been after
Grass hills, wildflowers
Chaparral trails for our daughter
I want to be her father
I want to hear her laughter
Under meteor showers
Our dogs will howl at the midnight hour

A cracker on a truck goin' breaker breaker
Listen to everyone then disregard it

In your cranium surrounded by pot like a geranuim

Where the wild thoughts grow check it out

I look to absolutes and there absolutely none

Challenge comes and goes and there will be another
I say bring it on
The roots that grow underground are as big as the tree
That you see if not it will fall down
We waste so many moments standing on convention
The only survey is when our heart pays no attention

Move with persistence cover much distance
Knowing no perdition that's my game for instance
Three Eleven true to no tradition
And the Three Eleven crew not dow with convention
But a hundred different people already told what we about
So I make not attempt to try and suss the stupid out
I'd turned into a roughneck that was not my intention
It doesn't even really matter unless I fail to mention that

That's where I am when the lights going down
I'll find a way to make some fun
I know there is a leak of energy
Through someone

How do you feel?
Cause I couldn't ask for a single thing more
How do you feel?
The moment you know just what you were for

I'm on a quest with a vision
I've got love and tradition
I'll wear a mask that grins and laughs
So remember what I've done
I'm a vibe under the sun
I penetrate all dimensions
I've come again, rejuvenate within
I'm future animation

I feel the fuel rushing through my veins
In sunburn and flames
You can take on the world
It's all in your brain

How do you feel?
Cause I couldn't ask for a single thing more
How do you feel?
The moment you know just what you were for

How do you feel?
Cause I couldn't ask for a single thing more
How do you feel?
The moment you know just what you were for
How do you feel?
Cause I couldn't ask for a single thing more
How do you feel?
The moment you know just what you were for"

Found around knocked out of bounds wound into the mind of my stone cloud.
Taste the thinnest of oxygen rising higher a stoner cus I can groove something.
Wrecking nothing to prove see that's in my nature.
So fresh, the vital bud of the chronic tastes of something thicker.

Everything I eat is from the Earth, right.
I am what I eat straight up Earth, right.
Nothing but a walking sack of Earth nice to meet you how do ya do.
Guess what. Ya you're one too.
My skin holds me in my brain moves me then boom.
I jump straight off the speaker in a form a celebration that we're moving.
Freely disconnected I'm truly grateful I'm going back the Earth.
I'm not gonna waste life being hateful.

Chorus
Kingdom coming through ya.
Jumpin' out my skin.
The skin I'm in.
And the hydroponics' on.

Did it because we wanna toke up until it's gone an abstract notion.
Here to connect me to the ocean.
'Cause I'm water and carboand not much else. I felt compunction.
Conjunction junction what's your function.
I'll be hookin' ups verbs and nouns and phrases and clauses as to the causes.
Of misery quizzically I look to my own book hooked on trying to fathom.
The solar systems and atom in a larger molecule called a galaxy cool.
The milky way is where I stay.

Astronomy steppin' stompin' a pow wow I rock the mike and shake up the ground.
And I'm a bust out like wild dandelions in fat bloom.
I'm shooting through the cosmos because I loom
You know I'm higher I'm shining brighter yes yes.
Like where water comes together with other water foamin'.
Now I'm Homin'. Like a bird soarin' right to the mood.
I'm a wildflower busting out I go boom.

Of no return, I get burned

Let down my guard shoudln't be too hard
I know it's over, got to elevate, disregard

I told myself I'm gonna quit, but did it again

I won't freak out, let you tweak out
On ecstacy not next to me
Somethin tells me baby girl that you're testin me
I told myself to get a hold myself

Don't make me mad, you know I love you bad
I want to sniff the glue that hold me to you

And now it's all turned bad
Turned bad, turned bad
Your ploy to make me jealous
Is obvious and sad
It has the opposite effect
Now you're left with what you had
You had

The rain comes down as love turns to dust
I was joking she took me serious
The rain comed down as love turns to dust
I was joking she took me serious
Yes, serious

Mixing all the elements with alien technology
A secret message hidden in this tune

Gotta move to trust my instincts and surrender
Let my song sing itself
I am they who admit what they don't know
All my friends excitable they'll tell you so

So let the cards fall and fall where they may
In checkin' on our conviction dick
We run from the shit our own way
So what you will so what you wish
Follow your bliss on everyday
Never ask for an advantage
Let the cards fall where they may

So let the cards fall
And fall where they please

I do it with ease
Taking up space is the people
Who wish to hold you back
But in reality the majority
Really don't give jack"

To let your mind unwind, like you ought to
Feel the earth turn round when your heart rate slows
Contemplating the thing only your heart knows
That life's not a race

So hard to believe part of me will fade
In a mystery, in a future world
Long ago, parts feel for your love
And lives to tell you so

The world revolves around your mind in a golden spiral
The natural way that things organize
You can't stop entropy so why even try
Observe the conscious flow and don't mystify
Life's not a race

So hard to believe part of me will fade
In a mystery, in a future world
Long ago, parts feel for your love
And lives to tell you so

Slippin' into a trance
A chance encounter in the autumn
What do I see an opportunity
And then, I got' em
Saw the chill-out mix
Carve some space
To make you want to listen
It's a bubbling spring
And double in kings
Of this soundsystem

So hard to believe part of me will fade
In a mystery, in a future world
Long ago, parts feel for your love

The rising my friend
Imagine cloud like
You will form again
Through spacey boredom
In the autumn of late afternoon
You are calm, just like a sleepy room"

Leave you left with the blues
Trust me I've been there

Pending disaster
You're heading there faster
It's tearing me up
To know you get so plastered

Because you're caught up in the scene at the age of nineteen
Maybe so was I at the age but I had a dream
And those goddamn powdered drugs
They'll fill you with doubt
You're just getting sucked on up in it
And you have to break out

You blacked out on the floor
You told me, the next day they found you that way
Those damn medications had your back baby
It hurt when they took them all away

You're feeling so bad
You're looking for a place to land
Help me understand
How in hell it got so out of hand

I know that it's hard
But you're risking being permanently scared
You're hurting inside
So you're flirting with tragedy on the dark side

Those drugs that you choose
Leave you left with the blues
Trust me I've been there
To me it's old news
Hey little brother
You messed up another chance
Sooner or later you must take a stand

At the edge of it
All where you begin
To consume that product to it's very end
How much time is left
Will you collapse
Will you confess you're in a spiritless void
Spinning into excess

You blacked out on the floor
You told me, the next day they found you that way
Those damn medications had your back baby
It hurt when they took them all away

You're feeling so bad
You're looking for a place to land

unfolds to my inner devils sheer delight
a pointless fucking banter in an endless bout
with whiskey soaked frolic room tobacco mouth
then a sickening trip to what I call the elitist cesspool
beckoning all the sycophants and defeated yes-fools
hung over, broke, and a round of apologies

I get more from the hours spent
Man instead of free of descent
A day without argument

You said you long for the flowers
That you remember
A song sang from the shower
How I used to bend words
You ask me where did all that go
And I have no answer
I admit that I'm giving up hope
And wandering if it can survive

One day

Will we begin again

Don’t be afraid when it comes, fear is only skin deep
Just come on, come on, yeah, come on, come on

And when the world is crashing down, crumbling at your feet

Held over from a future would I've come to you so listen
There's a place out in deep space
Where all the brothers dance and chant and rant
And shave their heads like Buddha
I'm a fly guy you know I'm smoother
Of course no remorse is felt for all those loser crews

I do not care what you do, I always screw up
But when I do it's nothing like you, I wish you grew up
You're saying anything like promise to get clean
Won't kick half dead fucked up in the head
Just get him out of here
Get him out of here
Get him out of here

We push a sucker out
With much force and much clout
Didn't want to do it
That's not what were about
But we got to have a limit
How low can you get it
Seems about time to
Change the subject
And sing about the wise eyed
That makes me feel
Good and never do
I leave misunderstood

Damn you know I feel good true
I got a choice of what I'm gonna do It's like this that
Swingin on my bat
Mix a melody with some back chat
Tell 'em again
Dam I know you feel good too
You got a choice of what you're gonna do it's like this that
Nippin' on a cat
Mix a melody with some back chat

I'm rollin' slow no particular place to go so nothings changed
The more things stay the same the more it doesn't matter
To a latter day St. Bernard acting hard
But I throw down like a crazy retard
But what cold make a man
Wanna walk around the school yard with his tool hard
What could make the switch to call that girl a bitch
It probably downed when you couldn't get a date to the prom
And you were stuck with Beavis
Let's leave us on a note of positivity
I'm saying this for levity
But if I leave it brief I call it brevity
I said I see the people rocking
Which means there's no stopping the flow
And you can just tell 'em that you know

Every night yeah we turning up
And comin' off live
Like and final 311 battle breakin idols
On the one you never heard before
You know the hardcore rockin
Pumping the dance floor

Looking at a slideshow on a Sunday but it’s Monday
Well how would I know I’d be looking out the same old window
Years later on a Monday thinking something would come from doing the same thing 

Bout time to give up on the same old stuff I’m stuck on
Just say that it went wrong and move it along
Sayonara till tomorrow it’s just how it goes sometimes. 

You gotta keep on climbing the hill
Cuz if you think you’ll make it you will
Go swimming quick like a fish and every wish will be fulfilled
Strike up and start the parade
Cutting down the weeds keep slinging the blade 
When they fire that warning shot
You’ll have a spot made in the shade

Standing at a side street station
Feeling like a one way on the down low
Flying solo till further delay
Easy blame it on procrastination 
Always hoping somehow that the nonsense this time will make sense
Stuck in circles
Faces in the sunshine they never look at mine
People just walk by and keep their eyes low 
Sayonara till tomorrow
That’s how it goes sometimes"

Let the seasons be the air you
Breathe in and out
Patiently
Wait for spring’s returning

Try not to think too far ahead
The pendulum swings soon enough
We could stay on this side instead
But we wanna make it rough

There were times I thought I’d get there
I know you thought so too
The days have bled together
Now any day will do
If you’re looking I might have it
But you have to look to see
The image you have of me
Is what I’d like to be

I was so good at pretending
And denying when things bothered me
So shut the front door I’ll
Kick in the back
Metaphorically, I’m hoping

Try not to think too far ahead
The pendulum swings soon enough
We could stay on this side instead
But we wanna make it rough

Make it rough ’til they put you in the handcuff
Seeking out minds that are not yet corrupt
Woi-oh woi-oh and away you go
I’m a go on til the god damn juice gone
Far enough into the journey to feel the satisfaction yes
Action speaking louder than bombs
And we just go on and on, on and on, on and on and on

Hard exteriors and fake gold fronts
Loosing yourself in the flavor of the month
Gotta be a better reason to colonize a star
Gotta be a better reason man's come so far

Is that you in the mama-ocean-people-sea
Is that you in this dream as see waving at me
Closer with one hand, while the other shields your eyes
As if surprised to see the universe begin

Part clock and part man
Reconciling my life span

Keeps things whole
We move out of the space where air flows
When all of a sudden
Here we are, and here we go

The evolutionary mind
Turns twist backflips
In space-time the continuum
Real-life planetarium

It's a natural fact
Time is speeding up there isn't much left
Heart rate increasing
Bustin' through your chest, compressed

Is your life in the physical
But out of memory
Comes a vision which is a miracle
Yeah, that

Normally we just can't see
It's not natural or typical
Of our same old thing
Livin' too fast, unable to grasp the past
Or the future when at last we ripple
After our big splash

Running high

A melding of two minds
What's the worst thing you could find
A paper trail

It's time to find the kind titillate the flow.
Swimmin' and hummin'.
Can't say it any better.
My Stoney Baby.
My Stoney Baby.

And now I'm in here with my friend ruskie.
In their house but they're not home.
If they find out what's been on.
They'll kick us out and we'll be gone.
No pool and that's not too cool.
The songs I sing they don't mean a thing. If you're not there to hear it,
But then soon is the time you'll be by my side.
It's copesetic if you let it so set it up and keep the down stream down and up stream up.

My stoney, my baby, swings w/the groovin'. Funk the groovin' thang whistlin'.
As I rip my rhymes.
Time and time again struttin'. And in the summertime.

So screw it strip down and be generic.
Strip down and be a passenger, strip down and be a messenger.
In askin' why I'm bori come up blank in the winter.
In askin' why I'm born I come up on when I'm on her.
My summer his summer it could be one to go down to go down.

It's time to find the kind titillate the flow.
Forever together and then I kiss.
Swimmin' and hummin' with a body and soul.
It's time to find the kind titillate the flow.
Swimmin' and hummin'.
And then I kiss.

When there's no distance
In between you and me

When it becomes us and them
Need an enemy for ego to win

These are the good ole days
I don't care what they have to say
These are the good ole days
All together now

So tell me can this all be real
Find it so bizarre
Can this all be real
Hold them fingers up
Finding to a dance to be a coincidence
I don't think you got to let go of common sense
Can this all be real

We do it all the time
From Tokyo Bay to the Little Five Points
Keep on blazing a trail
Keep on rocking the joints

Here we go

Hanging out with my friends
We're traveling
Out and about
Good times that we're having it's
Harmonic bliss when we all are synchronized
Something got to see with your eyes

Sways away the haze
They spent contemplating, formulating, theory siring above me swimming
Pay tribute to the few we look up to
Come again
You my soul fool
Who will know us but our brothers
Those who down with us are thinking
New school, tip top, pound the feeble
Walking and talking
Low down and evil
Follow me now
Yo Vato
The nix hex is on

Would everybody just look at the hook
I took it strait from my brain
Reminds me of the time I was insane
And so I wrote it when I was loaded
And voted the least likely to turn out like a square

I'm singing it for your mind and no
I'm singing it for your ears
Jump up and down and leave the ground and know that's why your here
And they say down diggey down down, down diggey diggey down, stronger, longer
Line up your ways of know what I'm thinking say it again

And now I'm with my home team back with a good seat
I gladwick like chadwick to tell you what I mean
Were laying back on it just like good s**
Smooth yet physcodelic it's called the nix hex-um

The monologue of a singalong
Las banderas de san juan piden pa?????
""I'm feelin' fine, lord it's time""????? Go tell it on a mountain, then again bring a friend
You'll maybe get dizzy with a scence of vertigo

Uplifted soul from the view that I'm on nothin' but love
But love
But love in my blood sonic in the vortex
This is the hip thing
Called the nix hex
Dig it

Begin
Come see me now come see me now baby
Come see me now come see me now aye
Come see me now come see me now Baby
Come see me now come see me now

I'm wickedy wild I need to put down
I come without a wreck so let's get

I come without a wreck so let's get down

I want to make some music in this country
And I am the rhythm missionary with the melody
Wait a minute, just a minute
Yes yes time to rhyme and shine now rip it rip

Jump up and down cause that's the 311 style
Cruise on by the frowners, float follow me now with a smile

That's insane

Imagine if you
Had a child of two
You're a single mom
With a son named two
You work a long hard day
Just to bill pay
With no time to play
Then what would you say

Still in this world what it means to me
Losin' my grip as I trip on anomalies
My third eye is the prize of unflyin' horus
The pleadies will smash out of taurus
Energy pure decompose in the porous
Soil of life moving on it's courses

Crystals 'neaththe surface radiate the cycle
Combing minerals they will flex and let go
Toxically were built to never last
'cause the waste we make all day
Steady growin' fast
I get up intake my blue-green algae
Let it penetrate
Strengthen my grasp
Holistic healers dealin' our galactic growth
Reversin' fx of shit wrecked Chernobyl

Wanna take it further
Let's take that funk further
Wanna take it further
Let's take that love further

We've all got pain that's real
And we should say how we feel
And I've felt so alone
But I know I've always got a home
The question I'm upserving
Is am I really deserving

Gamma waves bacterial plagues
Cow mutilations all the time
Not to mention visitations
More than 2000 years
Of fuckin' with our fears
The only thing true
We gotta love each other
Try to keep a positive vibe
They make it tough for ya
You're cut off and lonely
While you hustle for dough
We can overcome the wrongs
While we're reachin' the point
Stick together all forever

That is a shot out to the words of Curt Grubb
The motherfucker is not scrub I said the man is the kind
With the one that I call Brine Shrimp
We never ever do skimp I limp on a stage in a huff
Like magic dragon I puff on the stuff of a Humbolt cone
Then I'm stoned watch out
Smoke the weed that come from Northern California
Don't do no cocaine that come from Columbia

Mash up your body and mash up your culture

What you think is solid earth can jump up and spread out
To the north and south that's what plates are about
Nature has no conscience no kindness or I'll will
The dreams they had make me sad because of the vides of them
When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened
To me and my family my bro's and I were driving
The rv bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving
Zoned with no home there was fire all on it
Umm let me have my life I want it

I'm gonna let you know that I said
We're coming in kill we're coming chill
We've comin in how we will
Gone to tell the whole world what's the deal
And I say know no critical boarder 'cause
We do what we want
Got more funky styles that my laser jet got font
Not one to get over sounding like the norm
Friendly to the radio all that shit is corn
All we coming with is a little bit of swing
And we go on like it ain't no thing

Omaha stylee did not think there was one
Where you know the radios weak and the shows are more fun
But you know we fuck up the dance since 1988
Many did not think when they hear that we come from this state

Still we're down like that x3
Makin the funk that smells of skunk

Such occasions occur back in the day
It begins you're a raw kid all the way
Son of a gun but they you drifted
All are endowed but few are gifted
At the break of dawn behaving like a spy
Lampin in the light the cold world awakens
Deeper is the light to open up the sky
Look into my eyes see the dialatin'
Omaha Stylee is the shit we come with man

Embedded in out souls it breathes out from this band We always knew that we could
Thank you if you too felt we would

We will arise explore these worlds and find the grass roots
How to crew to do the grinding of the grounds to brew
My dude on the one come off like Teflon
Rock your shit and you will rise on

If you're a farmer outstanding in your field say
Do as you eill do as you wish follow your bliss say
We travel round the world giving it our best
Like to see the people dancing and bouncing and the rest
The hammer and the chisel and the rule it compass
We forged the sword chariots of war our battle axe
There's much power in anger but loves a bigger banger

He reached it on out, and then bam
He bit him, he bit him so fuckin' hard
Blood was steady gushin' all over my back yard

He said man don't sweat it, that's the dog's meaning

Would you mind come but I gots my dog
Come you can foam the water with the bone

Will come back and pay you for your deed
A shortcut's a self defeating means, if you cannot do it clean.
You'll never reach your reward.
And when the day is done, what you receive is the sum.
Of what you took out, from what you put in.

Times deep in a dream seem a veiled realm.
Shadows what I think and feel is real.
Times in our tribe feel the tribe when we thrive.
We have no fear of death and no fear of life.

I can't forget you and our version of paradise.

What you did as a devil or did as an angel.
The favor returns itself somehow.
If you take my money I'll buy you a drink and you'll see.
That no one rides for free.

Afraid of what I said then your mind is stricken.
I'm wearing my heart sleeveless and I'm always up for kickin'.
This is my favorite city pity everywhere the enemy.
From the beginning serious history
Nothing's ever given to no one. Rides for free.
From the beginning radiant energy's
Music what I need to keep my sanity.

How did they get programmed to, your following?
Everyone's locked up in their suffering
The only way you can tell is reconsider everything

What if the truth is that there is no truth
The only thing I can prove is there is no proof
Don't be so sure that your source is correct
People believed it before, before they had checked

How many times can they tell you
Til you just give them their way
How many times can sell you
Til you let them have their say
Every time you will ignore your
Heart it will come back twice more
Never deny your own instinct
Reconsider Everything

Everybody want something they control
Some just want grass some they want gold
Either way does it feel good or feel low
Taking you down not fast but real slow

Rebellion done for it's own sake
Does not a true free thinker make
To go against for it's own sake
You're still controlled by the course that the other man takes

Reconsider everything, reconsider everything
Reconsider everything, reconsider everything
Reconsider everything, reconsider everything
Reconsider everything"

No matter what we think
We’re kicking against the traces, bludgeoning
Trying to make it sink

We’re stepping into the unknown
Peeling layers of the onion right down
Cuz that is part of my style to
Risk to be left with nothing
In pursuit of chasing something
Out of hand
I know, I know don’t tell me

I’ve been on this earth
I know the moon like a friend
I hear a tune or someone sing
Feel the beauty in them
These words woman
We have some children
I got memories with you
I wonder how it ends
It’s beautiful yes
What we have chosen
With love in our hands
We have made this garden
& I think I can ride
Although I’m not a horseman
But I have a patient mind
& it’s open

We don’t want to walk into the gray
Solo rolling with no map in hand
So we reach out for someone to grasp
Keep from sinking into the sand

Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
Don’t get stuck in the destruction looming near
Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
This is the revelation of the year

Picking up all the pieces here and there
To see if one might fit
Spinning them around and sideways and up and down
It kinda stings a bit

Digging through all the ditches just unwinding all the stitches into thread
Then hang it out to dry so
What was I expecting just collecting balls of lint up in my head?
I know I know don’t yell at me

I know you’re tired of the same routine
You have that look on your face
I think I know what it means
Out of sorts in a vast machine
A worker bee up in the scene
Never will be the queen
& yes sometimes you have to sting
Expose the schemes to unlock the dreams
Ignite quicker than the gasoline
To mask everything again in a smokescreen

We don’t want to walk into the gray
Solo rolling with no map in hand
So we reach out for someone to grasp
Keep from sinking into the sand"

Doin' that grind all of the time
Someone will getcha, know they'll out betcha
Swipe away your time find your bottom line

You're cruisin', don't even care about what you're losing
You're using anything that comes your way here today
Gone tomorrow all about beg, steal, and borrow
Can't stop, won't stop 'til there's nothing left but sorrow

The palace became a prison, the phoenix within you risen
Shot by your own device you paid the price so you give in
To the pity party, party of one, no one shows up
Another sip of poison slow death fills your cup

Your head's wrecked from your neck down it's out of your hands
Your arms feel tied down and you can't understand
When you try to stand up your legs have other plans
Oh man, damn, you can't get out of this jam

Gonna tell you a story
It's not a fairy tale and it gets a little glory
It happened one night when Tequila was full
We were walkin' to my car unaware unknowin'
I stepped up crossed the the street in no hurry
And what happens next - it gets a little blurry
This chump nearly hits me in a green pintow so I threw my bottle bang!
It broke his window
He screeched to a halt jumped out of his car
I stepped straight to him gonna make him see stars yes
The situation was going to explode
Thought I should give him a warning said ya better hit the road
I knew it would be easy if I dagged him first
So I cracked him in the face all of the sudden with a burst
I hit I'm with a right then a left didn't land
But he turned his head and I broke my hand

Whatcha gonna do?
Do whatcha gonna

Je vais a la plage parce que le guignol est chouette!

I bet you gonna wanna try this but it takes niceness
I like a beat that's unique and I like my head zooming
And in my Continental you know that shit's booming
With the diamond int eh back suicide doors
You can look from here to eternity
And never receive your morsel.

Will soon fall apart

Snapped back your eyes have bled
Your thinking' about a comeback

Better watch you back

Out sailing in my boat
I’m not really sure

I’m still singing the same tune
I’ve been kicking around since June
All morning and afternoon
Now it’s all a blur

I’ve been listening to sea shells
To hear the stories that they tell
Of high times and tide swells
That have yet to occur

Backsliding down the drain
Partially taking all the blame

Chasing coins to fill the purse
Is it really better or for worse
Is it a blessing or a curse
To pass the buck

Is it a bounty or a bust
Is it precious metal or just rust
Well it seems it’s up to us
So wish us luck

I kept making a you-turn
Ended up with a sunburn
But the lesson that I learned
Was worth the skin that peeled

I climbed so many mountains
It’s not even worth counting
All the drinks in the fountain
Before it was revealed

From the copper to the kettle
The stamen to the petal
We watch the value of sand dollars crumble"

Watch me gently breakin'
Watch me gently breakin' our hearts

With the thing you are wanting to part by a mile
Trying to make them right like a sonnet

Watch me plainly fakin'

Everyone joins a team
No one waves a flag
For all human beings

No one's excited
Unless they are divided

One of the faithful millions

Is an excuse for the killing

Should be a private thing
How about a spirit
For all human beings

How could something well guided
Turn out to be divisive

Staring at the door thinking about the mess you're in
In your couch sinking deep over the girl that's gone

Just sever that leash and release
Your freedom of speech
You just have to believe
Your deed will be received
Somehow, somewhere
You won't be repaid with a blank stare
Let me know if you dare

Now all you think about her
Drink about her in vain
But all else feels
Like you're betraying

We're wakin' it up face up, and shakin' it up
We know of an extended field
This is the deal
For letting and getting the vibes that we want
Open up your heart
And proceed to feel
Now you're inchin' up
To the summit never plummet
Boot your system up
And then bail with the middle finger up
Why are you so abrupt, baby don't be corrupt

Standin' in the club playin' the wall
But they're not her is all
You think, and that is true
But what else can you do
Trying to turn back time
Or just tow the line
Cause the space you're in
Is no place like home"

Work it out and try again

I feel like something is gonna go down
Don't say I didn't warn you
Looks like we're heading for a showdown
We'll gonna get it on you

The answer we'll be a name
Things of the domain
All the pain and the gain
Was more than fucking and fame now
No matter the sticks are high
We won't say goodbye
You know it all comes to this game

I feel like something is gonna go down
Don't say I didn't warn you
Looks like we're heading for a showdown

Look at that game like a neighborhood sauce street
You want it,I don't care'
I only get one part
To the body one shot
Like a volcano, it can't be stopped
In the vain, all we got is game
For the fame that's why we came

I can't settle for it
Everything that should be mine"

Get the lowdown son
We're mashin and bashin
The stage we're crashin
If you're on the roof
I know you're dancin
I bet we get the people jumpin overseas
And I know why you're bustin mp3's
The shit shit shocker
The hiphop rocker
Wiser than Baraka
Stronger than Chewbacca
Kiss never did this nor Ozzy Ozbourne
Shakin that ass and shakin your firstborn
Back to the future and past to the front
We appear like adrenaline it's just that blunt

Two score and five we came alive
A minor blow up has started
A song for the newly sane and
The broken hearted

Head rush
Come on, we take the stage
And what's up, it's on
From midnight til daylight
You best believe that we're sick tight
You're cryin' bout your life
I think it's absurd
What could be so bad
You come from the suburbs
Just like me
But I could never despair
Most people in this world
Ain't got shit to spare
Suckas look up to thugs
They like the attitude
But fuck that
I'm talkin' gratitude
They harder they act
Just to hide their insecurity
I'm talking honestly
We are assuredly
Dope, I smoke it
But not everyday
Cuz anything all the time's
A drag I say
Three eleven you want to get next to them
My name's Nick H, E, X, you, M

Two score and five we came alive
A minor blow up has started
A song for the newly sane and
The broken hearted
We keep an eye for each other then again
Our known associates endure
We make a sick tight connection when we
See our true people on tour

Keep it going now
You know we get it right
We keep it flowing now
We're sick tight

We keep an eye for each other then again

Much worse could come of that so much more delicious
To the dastardly basturdly plans of little mice and men
Ugly rears it's head and speaks from now and then
People love to disagree so avoid the endless bout make no attempt
To try and suss the stupid out
But of the racist institutions simple minds belong
Not happy just being human, no wish to get along
Little people need exclusions sucker groups to throng
It makes them feel special it makes them feel strong
Now I got a click but it's more like a family
Not an ethnic trip more like an ethic see
I write the rhyme today tell it to you later
Whether were coming in wack or what it's a waste to be a hater

Graffiti bombs-from the palms-love is so strong
Can't be stopped too long
For the night it will come
Shaped in the form of Mars that stone afar
Ghetto cool Oh well
Now you feel the spell
The color rocks the bell
The king of swing rise to the top
The thythm possessed in ya and it don't stop
The mise is broken The demon locin'
Dropping the bomb and all that is left is the smokin'
Cloakin' chokin; the lyrics are spoken
Infrared vision scopin' condition
Now breakin' 'em all to pieces like a sly rap bandit
Witha fly Lu-Kang kick in Mortal Combat and I land it
So get your own back when I jam it cold and
Hearing about you rhyme style been outmoded
The dopest flow upon the planet
Dope is the word the bro throw up on the down low goddammit

You juice your fucking friends like Dracula
But when we kick you out you're just brokula
You left a big surprise from Pacific Bell
Called all your relatives and your friends in Hell
Now let me tell you something you fucking piece of shit
You'll never have no money, now tell me was it worth it?
You leave a trail of lies that's why you keep moving
We won't come after you we'd only end up provin
In the end revenge send ends to the defendant
I know that statement's true I wear it like a pendant
I know you'll hear this song so I think it's funny
The name is theif or trust and money.

Like Captain Picard we come hard in light years
Our star has long bust but now reappears
In your sky at night rising and immense
Yes you see ourselves in the shine of it
And so passing under the dome of the great sky
Beware we are the stars holmes that you ruled by
Where death reborn into the world is a gift
So the future with no voice of it's own will uplift
All is gone
All is calm y'all

Set wrecked in L. A.
In the Wetlands of New York
Atlanta and Phoenix
Portland, Lincoln and N. O."

Six long years and seven heartbreaks
Broken strings and countless outtakes, why?
Never thought that I would follow through
Got a working title somewhere
And I know one day I’ll get there, I’m
Grasping here

I’m looking out for a simple kind of true
Don’t know what I am waiting for
I’m holding out for a simple kind of true
At least some kind of a metaphor

It’s simple, simple and it’s true
We got much to do
No excuses they’re just useless
We’ve got much to do

I’d say you hung the moon if they ask me
You help me so the plot won’t get past me

At least not by me

The jaded ones will wither
While the optimistic grow
I settle that a bet will let a large amount
So indulge me just for a minute imagine no one holdin out
All trying for peace my brothers down
Some others down it happens slow
Think you should know the direction that the world go peace

They number six to make them feel like men

Sacrament that I hold
Close and I feel noble
Solar marigolds light the souls
Return from that other world

Sometimes when I'm awake
I can't tell if I'm still dreaming
There's so much here at stake
When every moment is just fleeting
Sometimes when I'm awake
I can't if I'm still dreaming

It never gets easier so quit tryin pleasing her
Everything is a choice so let me hear your voice
Rip up the evening post
Kill parasitic hosts
We can shoulder all the karma
That came with Los Alamos

Return the sky bottle blue
Return that forgotten hue
A looking glass world
Seeing into and through you

Soul and body are my twins
The latter will give in
When the former views the ocean
As not too cold to get in

To martian life forms
These waters are real warm
But beware we can change the weather
And create a snowstorm

Sometimes when I'm awake
I can't tell if I'm still dreaming
There's so much here at stake
When every moment is just fleeting
Sometimes when I'm awake
I can't tell if I'm still dreaming

No I'll not renounce my views do what others do
I'd rather drink the hemlock than be like you, to my soul untrue
It never gets easier so quit tryin pleasing her
Everything is a choice so let me hear your voice"

Suckers step up and want to cause friction

Competion is waning circumnavigate the draining
Complaining about those who are steady maintaining the jam

Jump into the pit and just slam

Lose their shit once in a while

You think ""Where oh where am I""

Learned to harness see the next world inside it

Inside the dark womb inside of our mother
Prone to the beat and vibe of our tribe

Could ever on Earth be enlightened entirely

Running around know how we're going to get out of it, woah

A mental state that takes strength to avoid
All the hostility and fierce truth we challenge

Here's what's the point
Of living that way
So many close their minds to what others say
Which ever feeling you voice
And what's the point
We're gonna pay
So that I won't wait?? We'll all have that day
So make a choice

Well I disagree
A ray of hope remains if we take the reins we’ll arrive eventually

Keep all the lights on in the streets of Babylon
Then we’ll just dig for some more
Pull back the curtain cuz one things for certain
Action speaks louder than war

Look around there’s no time left to stall
(You’ve got to) stand up while you can don’t miss the call

Hold on here we go
Where we stop nobody knows
Breath and count to five
Live while you’re still alive
Right before your eyes
Your best laid plan up and dies
Cleverly disguised
The bounty materialized 

Now we’re moving fast
We’re picking up on speed
We got the energy
Creating fast 
As we tunnel deep
& no time to think
Here we just react 
To the things
We need 
Hold on to your world

Look around there’s no time left to stall
(You’ve got to) stand up while you can don’t miss the call

To live just in your mind
Is some kind of crime 
Stuck in your station
In isolation 
Never too late for beginning
To set your captive free 

Tonight the moment has arrived
To live while we’re still alive 

(Wake up and) look around there’s no time left to stall
(You’ve got to) stand up while you can don’t miss the call
(It’s time to) end the debate don’t hesitate this time
(C’mon on and) take a stance don’t miss your chance

On your mind and the rest
Of your body

Flow and imagine
Become Jackson Pollack
Air brush Chinese dragons
On a sky blue convertion
Van or an electra
Buick of the mind full of
Fuminous matter
And slowly all the pressure
Recedes and you stop to decay
Naturally think clearly
Ultimately though your grace
Will give way to traffic jams
Submachine guns in hand
City red-necks who think
Like the Omega man
Feelin' the extremes
Of the times we're livin'
Stockpile spaghetti-o's
And cheerios plannin'

Lift off and I'm into the sky
As if a hologram were created
To shift my conciousness
Changed again and I'm flung
In the riff

I move through the portal
To be purified

I jump into the valley of the far from mundane
My knees buckle a chuckle chuckle
Mutha fucka I get back up
Like there never was a scuffle

Strange like a tale from Brothers Grimm
They’re watching you we can’t look at them
Living life out here like on a limb
One or the other sink or swim
Maximum velocity
Yet speeding up so rapidly
There’s no where else I’d rather be, for me

They keep you high, won’t let you come down
Distract the facts ma’am, that’s the plan now
Where you work, where you lurk, what you search
Climb too much get off of that perch
Virtual reality your nightmare
On the grid, kid, getting nowhere
Get ahead, leave behind
Lose your mind find in time
A nowhere rhyme

Chemicals up in the atmosphere
Another meteor is falling near
Buried in the headlines disappear
I’m not the type to live in fear
You dream but I know you’re awake
Explaining a nightmare you couldn’t shake
Maybe the kool-aid that you drank today

We’re breaking away from the past
Reaching a new plane at last
Regardless of what cards get played
No one can keep you afraid

Unless you wanna be
You make that choice indubitably
They wanna play my emotions
But I’m like the ocean
Too calm to get upset by somebody’s notion

Future makers
Organ takers
A non-human intelligence is guiding
Worlds colliding
Far away star system
I string dna where I need ‘em

What we gonna get with a zero field
Gotta have the one to make it real
I tell ya that more will be revealed
The mystery don’t bother me
Everyday masquerade
There’s always too many plans we laid
Keep going faster down the grade we made

We’re breaking away from the past
Reaching a new plane at last
Regardless of what cards get played
No one can keep you afraid

We’re always beginning
As sure as we’re spinning
For it’s never ending from here
After all this time
I am sorry I’m not sorry
Hate me later
Something greater
Than the petty here and now

Venture on
The sketch is not completely drawn
Travel wide
It’s not hiding inside
Venture on
The sketch is not completely drawn
Travel wide
It's out beyond the great divide"

Time is precious as you say it is
I wanna know that we didn't miss
It goes by quickly youíll soon find out
I wonít go down
Time is precious as you say it is
I wanna know that we didnít miss
It goes by quickly youíll soon find out

When you fight to resist
Emotion with a fist
An irresistible force will always
Prevail

The fortress goes crumbling down
Around you where you stand
What was once strong mortar
Is now a pile of sand

Time is just as precious as you say it is
I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss
I've dodged so many bullets that Iím careful now
I wonít go down
Time is just as precious as you say it is
I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss
I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now
From reckless to recluse
And sometimes back again
Left wondering what's the use
Of a life of mischief spent

Makes cool the desert sun
The piece of mind that you gave me
Absolve me for things I've done
Only that can save me

Time is just as precious as you say it is
I wanna spend it and know that we didn't miss
I've dodged so many bullets that I'm careful now
I wonít go down

Time is just as precious as you say it is
I wanna spend it and know that we didnít miss
Iíve dodged so many bullets that Iím careful now"

Well, I'm tired of the ladies and the stupid excuses
Sitting on my ass makes me feel useless
Earth accelerate, hurry up and turn that's right
I'm starting to burn

Well I get kinda mad like a ????? crawdad

Hipocrites they make me ill
Young men yearn to turn the tables
That too is a sin

Younger again

We all look to the end of a certain social stress
I'm down for that day, but don't forget the progress
Of wakening things up the passion understanding
Here's to the youth who aren't afraid to put a hand in

By the world we need this

It's human nature, the tragic and danger
You look around but you won't see rangers

Act in a major

Not through sheer force but persistence
At the end of the day the relentless always win
If they wanted to stop us
Opportunity passed 'cause they hesitate

The road at a tow, the end it will drop off
The universe explodes, new galaxies pop up
New galaxies pop up

Blowing gas going fast in the passing lane
On the line In the tunnel was an oncoming train
Out of sight, out of mind, now I'm stuck in a bind
That was the end of the line

King of the block
It's going down

Relay the message from the downtown
With our sounds
We expound

Burning daylight to the ground
Wash away the ashes
Gonna quiet my head down
How do I keep it?

See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up but a quick ride on down
And nobody here knowing their way around
From the top of the world every which way is down
And who's gonna take the crown?

Breaking the cast of repeating the past

Oh, who says it's written in stone
It's been a long time such a long time
Finding my way on back out, whoa
Somehow you stood by beyond when you should
I'm amazed at how things have turned out
What is revealed
What is concealed
Makes all the difference
Say what you will
We unreel that human web
Just to see how it feels

Too much too fast for the moment to last
I tumbled to you while stumbling through
How do I get my head up off the tracks
Listening for a train?
Ah-ah, cuz that's just no way to live
I've got so much love to give
Much too fast ooh-ooh

Out of the blue it all comes in view
You never win if you don't go all in
The perfect hand can go just as you planned
I don't understand
Began right on track slipped through the cracks
We were two of a kind who seemed destined to find
We unreel that human web

Gone already to the bored of it all type, lingo
That I'm seein every single night I'm out
Bustin' head for it but your's gets busted right back
Lip split and, I messed up but I got back tryin'
Don't bother lying 'bout constant dissapointment
But the fun in the hunt so quit actin' on a front
You're unmotivaded You're sorta faded
But the remedy is not so get on with what you got

Remember ""Lady of Guadelupe""
The times my mother made mole
After mass we would get home
The girls running to the phone
And I'm in my bedroom the 45 on my record player
Was ""We're in this love together""
At the time I never realized how songs haunted
The ones that I heard I played because I wanted
Drawing on my wall from time to time coolin'
Making creatures come alive with no schoolin'

When I'm on the microphone
The method that I make is much patience
The method that I make is much patience
I wait for the beat and then I make sense
I'm comin' in hot forgot you definitely got no clue
I'm comin' in hot you got you definitely got so rude
Boy actin' coy but you got nuts like Almond Joy
I tell ya this is a tribute

No one looks as foolish as the excitable ones
But then again there's no one has as much fun
""X"" amount of action, ""X"" amount of games
For years again I tell you the same, ooh ooh ooo

Once I met a man who made nearly no mistakes
He would never bet on a longshot
Never bet on a break and
He's condescending and talks gossip galore
But the dude was definitely such a bore
Hear me now I messed up but I got back trying
Don't bother lying 'bout constant dissapointment
But the fun is in the hunt so quit actin' on a front
Yeah, unmotivated you're sort faded
But the real man is not
The one hiding behind the gunshot, boom!

Time travelin' through my memory
There's a younger doug gazin' at the galaxy
Space trippin' vato of the stars
Searchin' for ufo's from Neptune and Mars
Ode to an alien I know you're out there
Cosmic lonely heart tell me if you care
I'm listening for your sound, here on the ground
I'm listening for your sound, here on the ground

When I'm on the microphone
The method that I make is much patience
The method that I make is much patience
I wait for the beat and then I make sense
I'm comin' in hot forgot you definitely got no clue
I'm comin' in hot you got you definitely got so rude
Boy actin' coy you got nuts liek Almond Joy

Caught up in danger somehow I have survived

I was always looking for trouble, trouble it always followed me
I would always have to do a double, a double cuz one just ain't enough
Of all the liquor and enough of pharmaceuticals
All at once I up and pulled the bamboo out my cuticles
The bullshit, trouble was coming from me honestly

I got a mind full of weapons
In the battle of me versus myself
And everything that I kept in
I'm findin the courage to tell
The sweetness repose comes in the strangest of places
I never supposed clarity would find me

I was always looking for trouble, trouble it always followed me
I would always have to do a double, a double cuz one just ain't enough
Of all the liquor and enough of pharmaceuticals
All at once I up and pulled the bamboo out my cuticles

You're a star creator
Soul craft generator
Movin' through time and space
Son you're a liberator
But you're memory
Has been erased
The things you knew
Misplaced check it out

Life style we scorn
Now we live again
In la Tokyo and New York
Come on pay a fee
Smoke your booty weed
Put gas in your tank
Keep you city bumpin'

We will be
Together one day

Though the current will pull us apart
Two drops in the ocean

The other side of the sea
And we will be
Together one day

Swim your way though the tide pulls us away
I ask you, what you gonna do?
Oceans apart but I know no one else will do

Two drops in the ocean
Just go with the motion, dear
We'll meet again
From two rivers the delta to shore
Two drops in the ocean

Fall into me, dissolve in the sea
The boundaries between, they are nothing
The love we have, the only real thing, yea

There is a stone wall around your heart
Nothing left now to do but to start
Chippin away, day by day
Until we see it break apart
Hear me talkin 'bout
Let it be known, it can't be done
Bit by bit and one by one

If the two of us try from both the two sides
Until we see the sun your phenomenal

Just go with the motion
A lot of fish in the sea
Not for me

I wanna show it's purple essence
On your lips baby it'll fade away
Return your natural iridescence
On the scales of desire your absence weighs

You make me feel uncalm and I think I like it
Make me think of a song that I could not write yet
Melodies create themselves, I'm just a conduit
You make my heart accelerate and I'm on to it

To be near the sweetness on you
Funny everything seems so new when with you

Been spent on a dose of balancing strife
Inspiration it comes and goes
You can bet when it hits, I'm on the phone
Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down
In a sensation of shape shifting sound
You're telling fables to cover up your foibles
From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable
Designed to take my mind away from the truth
Try to make me out to play the sleuth
They want you to think someone's watching you
So they can make up a set of rules for you
I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach
Just trying to make some sense out from it, unh
Don't stop, don't stop what you got
Don't stop til you find the sweet spot

Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up
Move and rise up before your times up
Clock is ticking, your caught slippin'
Stop to realize, look and listen"

Sounds good when we're trading up places
When we fuck it daily I see something that sails me
From here to infinity it nails me
To do the groove til the suckas improve
On these so called grooves
That just don't move
A million ways to fuck it up and one to get it right

Between us and them, from the beginning
We're looking for such different things, it is insane

Caught up in the daze of mistaking this
Everyone of us is weightless

So weightless, weightless
All weightless, weightless
We're all weightless, weightless
Everyone of us is weightless

That slowly does appear
My God it's been gone for all these years
And yet it really is still here

Zero gravity, no pull has got me
Hurtling through space, all time is misplaced

Only matters if you are here with us
Because the route we take is so circuitous
We are floating now there's no hope, we're in space

Welcome to this groove you can move right
We gonna take you higher not caught in the quagmire
I can't survive on a stupid nine to five I'd rather be poor
Writing tunes livin' on a commune
Kickin' it with my brothers and significant others
Life in pursuit of only money we think it's funny
The only thing that money it could ever bring to me
Would be some gifts for my friends follow me now
Trips for my family

The only thing I love is freedom the people around me I need 'em I'd
Like to build the world a spliff but like I said I said
You could never get me interested in dreams of wealth
Myself my birthday happens to land on April twelfth whack

A Coney Island of the mind it's mine
I swipe the sweets strip the beats in the sunshine
Loco holmes I stroll because I'm thinking
A tone poem alone is love medicine then the demon
Spring revolution in my spirit here it is and I will kill with it

Traveling head spinnin' from the medicine
Illusions fadin' out an comin' on again
Unwind your mind then find entire minutes abstract
The tract of sight day breaking in it
Doles out my share of the world ocean and sun
Rising with whirling motion

I fought kicked and screamed my way to getting born now I feel
Warm and I say come on the night won't save anyone
Won't you roam
We've grown so we can write again our soul select it's own way for
The travellin'
We're here we're breathing and we wanna keep our
Blood running so we're gonna keep gunning till the next homecoming
I like the boogie to the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the bang bang come on"

They grilled her on where she scored

Down the highway you soared
Na na na, na na na

What do you do, I ask you
When they're after you, I tell you
You're going to go it alone
You know that you'll have to leave home

Two thousand miles to the sea
A new life with nobody
Stranger's faces everywhere
Medicating your despair
Feeling that no one cares
Na na na, na na na

Sometimes plans go as planned
And you beat the odds that they'll get you
It's a miserable life in demand
A paranoia you have to get used to
But they got better things
To do than to come and look for you
But then again maybe not
It'll drive you crazy

Now it's been about a year
You'd return but for the fear
Sometimes people get away
Still it haunts you to this day

You always raise me higher

That’ll mean we both got to give a little
I got no doubt that we can just work it out
Do you feel the same way?

There’s a reason to be mad
But I want to live like I can
I hope that you understand me

You’ve got a big cup
Baby let me fill it up
With all of my love
I said, with all of my love
Smoking that good weed
Getting high, we are stoners
On a highway with all of our friends
And with some loners

The coming of the light, that pure insighter
Covered in the day and the night’s divider
To be all alone with no one whatsoever
How in the world did this come together?
You wonder, will it stop
Cause no one can inhabit that mountaintop
Rubbing on my love just to get by
She is the one thing that keeps me high

Well it depends on whether or not it sounds true
It kinda defined the filter its gone through
It is a good time to be in my mind
Where possibilities will never end

There’s a reason to be mad

Do you feel alive
She said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head.
Welcome to my world
She said.
Separated world
She stayed separated.
Down poison.
Down poison.
Body withered, body died.
Time to take away this life.
Bad enough to die from one, not to mention four or five.
Welcome to my world
She said
Do you feel alive
She said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head.
Welcome to my world
She said
Separated world

Down
You weren't there for me, I was there for you.
You weren't there for me, I was there for you.
You weren't there for me, I was there for you.
You weren't there for me, never there for me.
You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
You wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, no!
Welcome to my world,

3 Doors Down,Duck And Run,/3/3+doors+down/duck+run_20001044.html,"To this world I am unimportant
Just because I have nothing to give.
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it costs so much to live
Tell me why.

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away, oh no
I won't turn around.

All my work and endless measures
Never seen to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch now
Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run
Cause I'm not built that way.
When everything is gone there is nothing left to fear.
The world cannot bring me down
No cause I am already here, oh no!

I am already here,
Down on my knees
I am already here
Oh, no, I am already here.
I must have told you a thousand times I am not running away.

I won't duck and run
I won't duck and run
I won't duck and run
No I pass away.

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run,
Cause I'm not built that way
When everything it gone
There is nothing left to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No cause I am already here.

This world can turn me down

Across these miles away from home that I'll never get used to

You take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
Every, every
Every time you go
Before it used to be
When you were in my arms

Every time you go
You take a part of me
A part of me with you
Every time you go

I count the days until you're back again, back here by my side
When you're apart it feels like, something in me, something in me dies
I hear your voice over the phone and God I miss you
Still all these miles away from home that I'll never get used to

3 Doors Down,Father's Son,/3/3+doors+down/fathers+son_10202147.html,"In the glare of a neon sign
She laid her body down
A man walked in beside her
And laid his money down

He said don't try to scream now
But I want this one to hurt
And tonight my pretty one
I'm gonna get my money's worth

He said they never listened
She said they'd never understand
That I don't this for pleasure
I just do it cause I can

I swear I didn't want to
And I swear I didn't know
That things like this could happen
To a 17-year old

[Chorus]
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again

In the haze of a smoky room
He chokes that bottle down
It's been a month since her saw her face
Underneath the blood stained gown

He thinks about that little girl
And the one he has at home
And wonders what if that was my little girl
Walkin' down that road alone

[Chorus]
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again
Never again
No

Maybe I'm just crazy or the devil got inside
But either way my soul is gone, I'll end this all tonight
The one hand throws the whiskey, and the other throws the gun
As he cries out to the heavens
I am not my father's son

And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away

Would you let me be myself

Behind someone else
I'll never see the light of day

Take back all of these times
That I gave in to you

That you're very tired and ridden,
But you never once blink.

Kickin' in the walls.
Trailin' my innocence,
Paralyzing all my thoughts.

Got a wide eyed view
From a chemical thrill,
Set in the pace of time
And prowlin' the killin' field.
Tracer from far away
To this life in my empty cell.
It seems life is just a lie
But there's still the lie to tell.

Kickin' in the walls.
Trailin' my innocence,
Paralyzing all my thoughts.

Do you ever think about not comin' back
Hoppin' on a train and we'll burn up the tracks
We'll jump off somewhere that we don't know how to say
Maybe hitch a ride from someone who can tell us the way
To where these things might change for the good

Where this road will lead for us

Feel the red sun rise
Set a fire this morning
To perform our last goodbye
Though so fast I turn away

Haunt her life, the memories
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more

Pictures of the life she's longing
For slowly appear
She's seen them all before
But somehow never quite this clear

How many days in a year
She woke up with hope but she only found tears
I can be so insincere,
Making the promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
Your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

How many lovers would stay?
Just to put up with this day and all day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes on the soles of our shoes
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of her shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
Your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there

And your hair never falls in quite the same way
And you never seem to run out of things to say

Her pretty face she hid from the world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there

Stuck a needle in your arm

One more drink fool, will drown you

Set sail through the sun

Take to the air
See how they crawl
Sparking a trail
Angels may fall
A single mistake
Kills us all

And they saw what they saw
And then we blow them away

Relieve me of this burden of despair

The same mistakes I made love
Will haunt me never more
They slew my where I lay love
They pounded down my door
Now that I - I am no longer keeping score

So kill me now I'm helpless
And dark may have this day
The hour is late for lyrics
The words have blown away
Now that I have she'd
The burden of decay

It's the last day
Of the world
All the stars fired up
To unfurl
Gonna meet you
In the space within
You and I
We'll race the light
And win

(Rain blades are portals
Burrowing in ether
Through fleshes of souls
Deeper and deeper
Into the flames
Of words with no names
An unborn teeming oblivion
Yet still
I breathe
Awake
In this fathomless void
This bristling darkness
What is there to see?
In the blackest of shadows
An echo replies

The answer is nothing
The truth is the question
A sun-crested searcher
Beaming her bones
Fills up my lungs
With a new song of question
How can there be now?
If only I'd dream
Faster than light
Set fire to the past
Set the furure to flight
See with the eye
For which I am the mirror
The pitcher; 
The catcher; 
The game

There is no rhythm in this silence
Blood in this faceless wind
Pistons of white flame
Firing perfect unity
In the machinery of the beyond
Swallow the heart of God with your hands
Don't trust your eyes that see only tears)"

Can someone please remind me where the hell we are?
Another night I feel it come to life
How could this go so far?

The life I love is the one I lead
It gets crazy but that's fine by me
Coz I don't see the day
When I run all night
But I've got to say there's no other way
Coz I'm having the time of my life

The words you say bring back memories
Of so many days that have gone
I look back and smile
At those forgotten miles
And laugh at all that went wrong

What I am is what I want
And I'll be this way til I'm dead and gone
Coz I don't see the day
When I run all night
But I've got to say there's no other way
Coz I'm having the time of my life

For me... That's all... I need
To live... The way
To live... The way
I please

The life I love is the one I lead
It gets crazy but that's fine by me
Coz I don't see the day
When I run all night
But I've got to say there's no other way

And it's been so long since I've been home

3 Doors Down,What's Left,/3/3+doors+down/whats+left_20974820.html,"A few pictures, two tickets, from a trip we took last year,
A handful of memories, some still seem clear,
A few regrets, a couple of melodies, that remind me of you,
I could say that I won't miss this, but that wouldn't be the truth,
There's no one here to blame, and this is the only way,
There's nothing left for us, to say

It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do,
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew,
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove,
And now it's time to turn and walk away from,
What's left of me and you,
What's left of me and you

Box of letters, that old t-shirt, still brings me back to you,
A few more hours in the day, not sure what I should do,
There's no one here to blame, and this is the only way,
There's nothing left for us to say

It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do,
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew,
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove,
And now it's time to turn and walk away from,
What's left of me and you

You were the best thing I'll ever give up,
And it's hard to see the truth,
When you think you're still in love,
The only way to get on with my life,
Is to say goodbye, so goodbye

It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do,
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew,
There's nothing left to say and nothing left to prove,
And now it's time to turn and walk away from,
What's left of me and you,
What's left of me and you

From a trip we took last year,

Some still seem clear"

Well, somewhere in this darkness,
There's a light that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away,
Maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind,

Chorus

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
And love me when I'm gone.

Everything I am,
And everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I'll never let you down,
Even if I could,
Give up everything,
If only for your good,

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
You won't always be there,
So love me when I'm gone.
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone...

Refrain

When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin,
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends.
Now roaming through this darkness,
I'm alive but I'm alone,
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone.

Chorus

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
And love me when I'm gone.

Everything I am,
And everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I'll never let you down,

Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own
Tell me what the emptiness brings

You are my african queen
And I know that this means that
You're the only one that I reserve

Who could think of ever hurting you
Sacrifice my all I've given unto you
You are my african queen for real

Liek I'm not gonna bore you with some flimsy kind of piece of rhymne
So pull a cushion, sit back relax and listen
To this introduction of me, myself and my mission
My vision is to let you all see
That there's more to this life than just faking up reality

I wake up in the morning and I stretch out my feet
Say a thank you prayer then I brush up my teeth
A little exercise then I grab something to eat
Put on a piece of clothing and then step out into the street
The into the studio just to hook up some beat
Later to the club to make the people feel the heat
Make an honest living and I'm proud about it
Making sure that all my mistakes I don't repeat
Like I mind my own business and I don't give a shit
I say whats on my mind I don't have time to edit
Got to thank the Lord that He's helped me find my feet
Oh praise the Lord he give me power to defeat
If you give me stoneness they got to give me meat
I try to find it and I try to forget it

Everybody know that me physically fit
Everybody know that me humble and cool
But some poeple them take me for a fool

I got to be strong, got to be ready for the strife
I know some people will say somethings that will cut like a knife
I know some people will say that I might never find a wife
But I'll do my thing my way oh my brother no be fight
Sometimes I might be wrong sometimes I might be right
But I'll keep my head straight
And I'll keep my game tight
'Cause what I can't see is the future where the pride
Got to have it all not just the vine
Got to have it all not by power not by might
But I can squeeze the cup by day and by night
And the Almighty Lord He never let me leave His sight
But upon on top of that I still will do my peope right
So I promise I go use my music to dey shine the light
I no go comform I say I know the sight
I go bear my mind I go bear am black and white

Will stifle the cry

The fear's rapid rattle
A desert inferno

No prayers or bells

The wailing of shells

On untraveled roads
The fear spreads like fire
As shrapnel explodes

To conscript our youth
Against their will
When plenty of our citizenry
Really like to kill

What sign posts will lead
To armageddon's fires
What bugles will call them
From crowded grey shires
The women sit quiet
With death on their minds
A slow dusk descending
The drawing of blinds

Make the hunters all line up
It's their idea of fun
And let those be forgiven
Who never owned a gun
Was it him or me
Or the wailing of the dead
The laughing soldiers
Cast their lots

Hungry for the word, but God would never speak through such as these,

They'll tell your troubles to the Lord for how ever much you can afford

Memories that linger from the cradle, placing puzzles in the grave,
In the grave
No mortal skin and bone can live on bread and circuses alone
The spirit needs, must drive the mystery of why you're alive

But their cold hearts say, ""Follow me""

Dance in the dust in the frenzy of the desperately in need
Led by the voices of the men who invoke ritual to hide their greed,
Hide their greed
Come every tongue, every eye across the crumbling earth and cracking skies
The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single

They turn off their lights for their tents they're fixing to leave

Teasing more and more....

You laughed
Until your belly was sore

In the brick laid aisle behind
The five and dime store

But doubt if you
Remember

Were my tears genuine
Or those of a skilled
Pretender

Plain to see
Don't make a fuss over me
Not loud
Not soft
But somewhere in between
Say sorry
Let it be
The word you mean

Never took a hint
Could never
Take a hint

In a door
Tossed my coloring book in a

Pulled spiders from my hair

Stained on the back
Running from a berry war

On the day manolete died
Teenage girls in soft white dresses
Standing silent peace respecting
Groups of boys held in their hands
The fragments of a shattered idol
The old men with their traditions challenged
Refrained from tears

Neck neck hook
Poles of wood
The picadores stood eyes ablaze
To view brutal contest
In the vale of years

Courage unfailing
Agility exhausted
Youth entered challenge
Reached for title shelved

Patrons in attendance
To disarm a common myth
Homage played to the victor of immortality
Cloaked in bold tones

In the stockyard the beasts
Did climb their barriers
Bid by a frenzied ring

Bred for one purpose only
To die in man's sport
Dash against his spindle

An instant fell to wounding
On the day
Swords penetrating
On the day
Torches igniting
On the day
Flower wreaths encircling
The day
On the day"

Talk talk talk about it, if you talk as if you care
but when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air,
tossing back more than your share.

Don't talk, I can guess it.
Don't talk, well now your restless
and you need somewhere to put the blame for how you feel inside.
You'll look for a close and easy mark and you'll see me as fair game.

Talk talk talk about it, talk as if you care
but when your talk is over tilt that bottle in the air
tossing back more than your share.
You talk talk talk about it, you talk as if you care.
I'm marking every word and can tell this time for sure,
your talk is the finest I have heard.

So don't talk, let me go on dreaming.
How your eyes they glow so fiercely I can tell your inspired
by the name you chose for me. Now what was it? O, never mind it.
We will talk talk talk about this when your head is clear.
I'll discuss this in the morning, but until then you may talk but I won't hear."

My youngest girl has bad fever, sure.
All night with alcohol to cool and rub her down.
Ruby, I'm tired, try and get some sleep.
I'm adding doctor's fees to remedies with the cost of three day's work lost.

I've tried and tried but I can't save.
The hole in my pocketbook is growing.

There's a new wind blowing they say, it's gonna be a cold, cold one.
So brace yourselves my darlings, it won't bring anything much our way but more dust bowl days.

I played a card in this weeks game.
Took the first and the last letters in three of their names.
This lottery's been building up for weeks.
I could be lucky me with the five million prize, tears of disbelief spilling out of my eyes.

Now I know lightning strikes again.
It struck me once, then struck me dead.
My folly grows inside of me.
I eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now.

Well, the egg man fell down off his shelf.
All the good king's men with all their help struggled 'til the end for a shell they couldn't mend.
You know where this will lead, to hush and rock in the nursery for the kicking one inside of me.
I eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now.

When the boy was a boy, the girl was a girl, they found each other in a wicked world.
Strong in some respects, but she couldn't stand for the way he begged and gave in.
Pride is for men; young girls should run and hide instead.
Risk the game by taking dares with ""yes"".
Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now.

Walk for two? I'm stumbling.
Breathe for two? I can't breathe.
Five months , how it grows.
Five months now, I begin to show."

To pick a rose you ask your hands to bleed.
What is the reason for having roses when your blood is shed carelessly?
It must be for something more than vanity.

Believe me, the truth is we're not honest, not the people that we dream.
We're not as close as we could be.
Willing to grow but rains are shallow.
Barren and wind-scattered seed on stone and dry land, we will be.
Waiting for the light arisen to flood inside the prison.
And in that time kind words alone will teach us, no bitterness will reach us.
Reason will be guided another way.

All in time, but the clock is another demon that devours our time in Eden, in our Paradise.
Will our eyes see well beneath us, flowers all divine?
Is there still time?
If we wake and discover in life a precious love, will that waking become more heavenly?"

To works of tyranny then

They steal cunningly

With gradual defeat

That had gathered in his cotton sleeves
While he thumbed
Yes thumbed I wouldn't say caressed

Soon to reply assuredly

O for man aged ninety years
No words to waste on sermons

Short and sincere

-- Taken from Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey (by Lillian Schlissel)
Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads. Pass the lone church spire. Pass the talking wire from where to who knows? There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains. Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces. The land was free and the price was right.
Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly. Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family. I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.
Who were the homestead wives? Who were the gold rush brides? Does anybody know? Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote? The land was free, yet it cost their lives.
In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters they would moan as they would read accounts of madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief."

Words no one had heard.
The girl was stronger, the boy was weak, with her new mother she
Learned to speak.
And wove a tale of a dying sun, the left the darkness, a dark world
Come undone.
They travelled so far. Believing they came from a star.
She fell through life, through time, through parallel lives.
The men of science, the men of fame, the men of letters tried to
Explain.
Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time to make her think she'd
Fallen from the sky?
A whirlwind spun them all alone,
Took them from their twilight home.
Believing they came from a star.

Tide of black rain
Cement seared shawdow traces
Reminiscent of their last commands

Instantly one thousand flames arising
Ill scent the burning hides surrounding
A settlement debased entirely
Enola gay had made a casual delivery

Please build a future, darling
With our bomb
Cherish and love it
For the sake of
Earth bound kingdom come

The undersides of fallen metal trusses
Evil debris of human bodies
Each window's glass shards pelted
Secure confines
Brittle collapse

Neighbors lay beside
Each other unknowing
Faces scorched of all familiar bearing
Too few hands
Many wounds for closing
Marred by
Thirsting
Anguish
Fear lamenting

Here we stand
At the door to gold atomic age
Don't spoil your face with worry
Trust in

European homesteads grew up in the colonies with civilized plans for wild hinterlands, their guns and God willing. Such a hateful hate.

And old rivers grow wilder everyday

Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say if he asks ""what's new?""
""nothin what's with you?""

And spot some hollow ancient eyes
Please don't just pass em by and stare

To think of my task is chilling.
To know I was carefully building the mask I was wearing for two years, swearing I'd tear it off.
I've sat in the dark explaining to myself that I'm straining too hard for feelings I ought to find easily.
Called myself Jezebel.
I don't believe.

Before I say that the vows we made weigh like a stone in my heart.
Family is family, don't let this tear us apart.

You lie there, an innocent baby.
I feel like the thief who is raiding your home, entering and breaking and taking in every room.
I know your feelings are tender and that inside you the embers still glow.
But I'm a shadow, I'm only a bed of blackened coal.
Call myself Jezebel for wanting to leave.

I'm not saying I'm replacing love for some other word to describe the sacred tie that bound me to you.
I'm just saying we've mistaken one for thousands of words.
And for that mistake, I've caused you such pain that I damn that word.
I've no more ways to hide that I'm a desolate and empty, hollow place inside.

I'm not saying I'm replacing love for some other word to describe the sacred tie that bound me to you.
I'm not saying love's a plaything.
No, it's a powerful word, inspired by strong desire to bind myself to you.

Tyler has the key.
He takes nail and hammer to tack up the banner of felt scraps glued together reading,

Wasn't it God that let Puritans in Salem do what they did to the unfaithful?

Boys at the Jubilee slowly sink into brown bag whiskey drinking and reeling on their feet.
Girls at the Jubilee in low-cut dresses yield to the caresses and the man-handling.

Through the tall blades of grass he heads for the Jubilee with a bucket in his right hand full of rags soaked in gasoline.
He lifts the shingles in the dark and slips the rags there underneath.

In the month of May
When all the birds
Were singing

I saw a lovely maiden stray
Across the fields at break of day
She softly sung her roundelay

The tide flows in
The tide flows out
Twice every day returning

Her cheeks were red
Her eyes were brown
Her hair in ringlets hanging down
Upon her face to hide the frown

Just as the tide was a flowing
The tide flows in
The tide flows out
Twice everyday returning

A sailor's wife at home must bide
She halted heavily she sighed
""he parted from poor me, a bride
I'm widowed by the sea"" she cried

Just as the tide was a flowing

The tide flows in
The tide flows out

Everybody's worrying 'bout where they're gonna go
When the whole thing's done
Nobody knows for certain,
And so it's all the same to me
I Think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say once gone, you're gone forever
Some say you're gonna come back
Some say you rest in the arms of the Savior
If in sinful ways you lack
Some say that they're comin' back in a garden
Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas
I Think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say they're going to place called Glory
And I ain't sayin' it ain't a fact
But I've heard that I'm on the road to purgatory
And I don't like the sound of that

Still echoes to bother my sleep at night

On the letter head of the company mail

And in mason jars
Tricked plenty seeds thrive

Cut it at the knuckle bone

Into every stick of furniture
From horn to tail

Trade your home and your maiden name.
For a list of vows and a veil of lace made a wife of you today.

Enduring silence and flame

The night a sleepless day instead;
A day when love came,
Came easy like what's lost now found.
Beneath a blinding light that would surround.

We were, we were, we were, we were without,
In doubt,
We were, we were, we were, we were about
Saving for a rainy day.
I crashed through mirrors,
I crashed through floors of laughter, then.
In a blind scene,
No ties would moor us to this room.
A day when love came,
Came easy like what's lost now found.
And you would save me,
And I held you like you were my child.

Defiant you,
Alone upon a troubled way.
I would send my heart to you
To save it for a rainy day.

By lighting up the mystery,
Free me from my history and show me where to draw the line,
And you don't even know that it shines.
You know I will always run to your shining light.
I'm not worried now about flying too close to the sun.

Though it takes me by surprise.

When the day ends
And church bells are ringing
When the valley is shroudedin snow,
When you're feeling that hope somewhere vanished
And there's no poetry left to console you,
With the smallest step you'll find a way
Oh of fate borne and life is a jewel
But stone will tarnish as dust will descend
Take a minute and wipe free the lustre,
It'll mirror a day without end
With the smallest step you'll feel
It starts a journey your way.
Oh they tried to tell me
But I'll learn for myself
And when they tried to tell me
You know the words disappeared on the wind
I was running away
And when the laughter echoes through you
In a pale beaming ray and you'll know always
And ever within you anyway."

Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

CHORUS
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

Detroit to D. C. Night train, Capitol, parts East.
Lone young man takes a seat.
And by the rhythm of the rails, reading all his mother's mail from a city boy in a jungle town postmarked Saigon.
He'll go live his mother's dream, join the slowest parade he'll ever see.
Her weight of sorrows carried long and carried far.
""Take these, Tommy, to The Wall.""

Metro line to the Mall site with a tour of Japanese.
He's wandering and lost until a vet in worn fatigues takes him down to where they belong.
Near a soldier, an ex-Marine with a tattooed dagger and eagle trembling, he bites his lip beside a widow breaking down.
She takes her Purple Heart, makes a fist, strikes The Wall.
All come to live a dream, to join the slowest parade they'll ever see.
Their weight of sorrows carried long and carried far, taken to The Wall.

It's 40 paces to the year that he was slain.
His hand's slipping down The Wall for it's slick with rain.
How would life have ever been the same if this wall had carved in it one less name?
But for Christ's sake, he's been dead over 20 years.
He leaves the letters asking, ""Who caused my mother's tears, was it Washington or the Viet Cong?""
Slow deliberate steps are involved.
He takes them away from the black granite wall toward the other monuments so white and clean.

O, Potomac, what you've seen.
Abraham had his war too, but an honest war.
Or so it's taught in school."

Shifted their shapes

A lute, a suit for jousting
And the poems of a balladeer
When all the Latin books were copied off
In golden script
Well hoarded away in
A monastery crypt

Superstition
Superstition beyond belief

Over mountain, over dune and over sea
Crude map and compass lead the caravan
And lead the fleet
Here's the loot and plunder
They bore home
Ivory tusk inlaid with precious stone
Raw silk and spices by the barrel load
A soft skin drum with mallets
Of human bone

A world wide rampage
Rampage of greed

So here the tour concludes
The Colonial Wing
The rooms of the most refined
Museum property
An early pair of spectacles
A claw footed divan
Ornate clocks with birds that strut
On the half hours and quarter hours

Knockkneed and cursing or coughing like hags
Men marched on sleeping some without boots
Fatigue drunken deaf still to the hoots
Of breaking gas shells
Dropping softly behind
But limped on bloodshod
All went lame all went blind

Gas gas quick boys fumbling helmets in time
Someone still screaming a man in fire or lime
Under a grey cloud dim dark through green light
In all my dreaming before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
Choking guttering drowning
Put in a wagon he had to keep pace
As his eyes melt to his face

If you could hear blood
Gurgling from ruptured lungs
If you could witness
Vile sores on innocent tongues
You would not tell me
Not with such pride and such zest
The lies of history
Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori
Some desperate glory
Pro patria mori
As witness disturbs the story
Pro patria mori
Stand firm boys breathe the glory"

There must be some creature mighty as you are.
The lambs go hungry (not fair), the biggest portion is the lion's share.

'til a stronger beast will call on you and pounce upon your throne.

Do we pay? Dearly, for the lion takes so greedily
And he knows that what he's taken, it is ours.
That's how the wealth's divided among the lambs and king of the beasts, it is so one-sided.
Until the lamb is king of the beasts we live so one-sided."

Sing of a lover's fate sealed by jealous hate
Then wash my hand in the sea.

Brother Marquis:
I bring home the bacon
Bitch I put it in your hand
But behind my back bitch
You been seen with another man
Oh I just had to she'd a tear
Bitch you got to leave here
Is it me or him baby?
So long my motherfuckin' dear

Luke Skyywalker:
Come lay you black ass down
Right beside me
Hold onto my dick
While I grab a little bit of that pussy
Suck it right
Bitch suck it all night
And if you ask me to eat some pussy
I choke your black ass all night

Fresh Kid Ice:
Since my baby left me
I been doin' well on my own
Fucked the neighbour's wife
And broke up a happy home
Now the bitch wanna live with me
This long dick Chinese
Bitch if you can't fry rice
Well get your bald-head ass out tonight

Mr. Mixx:
I met this raggedy bitch
Down on southwest eighth street
I fuck that bitch from the top of her head
To the bunyons on her motherfuckin' feet
I said Bitch as long as your pussy is
It's a goddamn sin
I gotta hold an ironing board across your chest
To keep from fallin' in"

[Verse 1]
[Kid Ice] here we go, back to turn it out
The nastiest niggas representin' the south
With the freakiest bitches from the sunshine state
Dissin' off niggas out to playa hate
Butt-naked hoes is all we do
'cause no one got the freaks like the crew
Runnin' through the nation without a care
Holler at your boys, 2 live is here!
[Marquis] you're fuckin' with the best of 'em, fuck the rest of 'em
After me there'll be no more left of 'em
The last booty-shake gangsta
Look at all the bread that the booty can make ya
I got the booty doin' big thangs
So bow down to the kings of the motherfuckin' booty-game
Well-known worldwide,
This is 2 live, until the day I die!

[Verse 2]
[Kid Ice] we're nasty as we wanna be
They dropped the ban and set us free
Lil' joe turned us loose in the united states
To see how much wreck we'd create
'cause a 2 live party don't stop!
'cause there ain't no party like a 2 live party
So come to the party and have no fear
Holler at your boys, 2 live is here!
[Marquis] unknown whereabouts, somewhere smoked out
Dickin' a bitch's mouth off in a trickin' house
Ridin', lickin', peepin', blowin'
Stop, pick up the bitch that's hoin', and keep goin'
Marquis ain't gon' ever change
I'ma stay in the street just as well as my name
When it comes to trickin' hoes, I'm a motherfuckin' master
Shine like the diamond I'm named after

[Chorus]
Verse 3

[Kid Ice] we're the first motherfuckers in the bass game
Respect is due when you mention our name
Representin' the south with the bottom-boy style
Known worldwide with the miami style
'cause there ain't nothin' better in any land
Than the brother marquis and the chinaman!
Bow down to the best from far and near
It's the real ones, baby, 2 live is here!
[Marquis] smokin' blunts by the pack, drunk off 'gnac
Watchin' my ones stack, I got it like that
Bitches know what's the time with me
I fuck 'em 'till they skeet and leave they name in the street
Brother marquis ain't nothin' to fuck with
So don't get mad if I fuck and I nut quick
I'm off the chain, I'm off the key
Uncut g, nasty as I wanna be

I am the dominating Fresh Kid Ice
And I am the Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
And introducing to you on the two turntables:
The Treach dj Mr. Mixx
(Word)

[ verse 1: Brother Marquis ]
We get the red carpet treatment cause we're well respected
Always accepted and never rejected
Our defense is made when we take the stage
The crowd gets excited and goes in a rage
Cause we're generating and demonstrating
All of the talents that we're accumulating
And by doing this we'll go real far
Because - 2 Live is what we are
We're highly publicized and advertised
Our music's in your ear, our face in your eyes
We're good to go and goin to be good
We've done the right thing like you knew we would
Because we are here for your dancing pleasure
With our microphones, cause that's what we treasure
Now the man you see, who has hands of magic
His name is Mr. Mixx, so come on a scratch it

[ verse 2: Brother Marquis ]
You can call me Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
The t-e-s-t I pass with with flying colors
I'm capable and on the case
Gettin straight to the point with no time to waste
The point is that this party needs to be rocked
Wioth drummin thumpin beats around the clock
>From odds to outspoken to opinionated
In need of a rhyme I will create it
The best is yet to come, with much much more
You got me rockin you with my rhymes galore
Now my rhymes won't stop, my rhymes won't quit
Just give me the mic and I rock it
On to the break of dawn
I will rock y'all to the early morn
Cause I'm the demonstrating, the dominating
Annihilator, brutalor, mc-hating
So all mc's must step on off
Cause I'm lettin you know who's the boss
Now Kid Ice, you know you're twice as nice
Why don't you get up on the mic and start to recite?

[ verse 3: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Cause they call me Kid Ice, the ladies' fire
When I enter a room, ladies fill we desire
Anytime I'm good, yes on the mic
I said the girls keep comin back every night
Cause I dress so fresh, my voice is clean
I can rock party people, yes even the Queen
In England, Germany, France and Japan
The ladies know that I'm the man
Who keep em from the kitchen just doin their dishes
Cause I have em in bed fulfillin their wishes
I got a degree in makin love
Yes I got it from my father just up above
I could take a girl from any man
With a twitch of my lips or wave of a hand
So to all you guys out there tonight
Grab your girl, hold her tight
Say treat her with respect and treat her right
Cause I might be in town for just one night

(Word)
(Do it)
(1-2-3-4-5-6 do it)

With my dick in my hand, the first lick, I'm nuttin'
There's no freak in the world quite like you
'cause you suck my dick until my balls turn blue

Verse 2:  [fresh kid ice]
I remember the first time I got a blow job
You know what I mean, when she slobs on bob
She was kissin' the head, then she blew my balls
It felt like my skin had started to crawl
And the bitch kept suckin' like a freak in heat
Movin' like a basser without any sleep
And after she was done, this is what I said:
""baby, baby, please!just a little more head!""

News reporter:
Earlier today in Broward County, appalling court
Judges upheld the previous
Ruling to ban the sale of Miami rap group the 2 Live Crew's
Double-platinum album, ""Nasty As They Wanna Be,"" in Broward County.

""We think it's the banning of free speech.  First Amendment protects
Material, presumptively. ""

Luke (being interviewed):
""We don't talk about, uh, harrassing and sexually brutalizing women in
My music, man! ""
""We don't do that in my music, man!  I'm tired of you saying that!""

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
We've got white-collar people trying to grab our style
Saying we're too nasty and we're 2 Live
Corrupted politicians playing games
Bringing us down to boost their fame
They must be joking thinking we will fall
But they're like flies movin' the wall
We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to help, our ancestors died
Don't keep thinking that we will quit
We'll always stand and never sit
We're 2 live, 2 black, 2 strong
Doing the right thing, and not the wrong
So listen up, y'all, to what we say
We won't be banned in the you. S. A.!

Reporter:
""Luke's concerts are for adults""
Luke (being interviewed):
""If it's an adult show you have to be 18""
""Our record is a year old, but with all the publicity, there's a lot of
People... Curiosity is around! ""
""We're selling records to a totally different audience.""
""I take a precaution that nobody else has not stickered my album, I made

Two versions""

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech
So what you sayin'?  It didn't include me?
I like to party and have a good time
There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhyme
I know you don't think we'll ever quit
We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip
We're gonna do all the things we wanna do
You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you
This is the 90s and we're conin' on strong
Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong
Wisen up, 'cause on Election Day,
We'll see who's banned in the you. S. A.!

Monica, I can't believe you did this to me!
I gave you a job, woman! Dammit, why did you do this to me?
Now what's America gonna think?
I mean, it could've just been me, you, and my wife Hilary!
No one had to know!
You didn't have to go tell everybody, now!
Ken Starr's on my case and...
Bringin' up all that Linda Tripp and Paula Jones and...
Jennifer Flowers stuff!
My wife won't even talk to me!  Hilary!  Hilary!  Hilary --
Chelsea, tell your mom I'm talking to her!
Hilary, talk to me, dammit!
Come on, say somethin'!
I'll blow somethin' up if you don't talk to me, woman!
I can't believe this! ...
My career's in shambles...
But I still love America!

(mysterious music)
""Absolutely no one under 17 will be admitted
Without parent or certified adult guardian. ""
""They'll fry your brain.  They're sick as hell!""
""Jolly good fun.""
""You'll die dancin'!""
""Dark, gliding shapes that glide every long inch ... ""
""Buy 'em or die a thousand deaths!""

Chorus:

(Boys with the bass!)
(""You better know it!"")

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
That's right y'all, you heard it 'cause we said it
And if you can't read in the magazines,
You read about who?  You know the Crew!  Fresh outta Pac
And the first to put the bass on the 24-track
Some said it wouldn't work, some said it wouldn't last
In New York, they say that the tempo's too fast
You disregarded, but the albums got charted
We put 'em in the stores and millions habe bought it
An underground sound, not liked by radio
You hear it in the cars and at the dicso
On the airwaves, we misbehave
We're too bold, too rugged in our nasty ways
From dirty minds come dirty rhymes
We're not gonna beg for your time
You don't play it?  That's cool with me
But somehow, our bass still reaches the street
As long as we got it, you can get it
People want the bass, so some try to steal it
From behind our back, and not in our face
'Cause 2 Live is the Crew, the boys with the bass!

Chorus

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Holdin' out own in the South-East region
When you come to the bottom, pledge to our allegiance
I'm glad to say that we're the proud owners,
The rock-and-rollers, you can't us this over
The name of the game is supply and demand
We supply the bass while you demand our jams
We could not wait to bring our bass to you
Because in this game, you lag, you lose
See, we serve our bass raw, straight up and not false
This is the kind you dance to, and not on 8-Ball
Plenty of bass, the beat, and the rhyme
That my homeboy Mr. Mixx carefully designed
Hittin' hard as hell, and always droppin'
Bass is the reason why you are rockin'
When you hear our songs, and you see our face
Put two and two together; we're the boys with the bass!

That Ghetto Style with a hard-ass beat
Our explicit lyrics tells it like it is
If you don't like what I'm saying, get the fuck outta here!
The king of the ghetto, down with the clique

Luke Skyywalker, the man, not a myth

Is one who rocks the beat so the rhymes I say,
To get the party jumpin', is how I get paid
The definition of a good dj
Benefits of a hit is when I get laid
So the rhymes we say will always be flowin'

Maximizin' the effect of our vocals

I'm the type of nigga that'll break it down slow
If you ask me to rap, rap for you I'll do so
Like the Mona Lisa, I'm a sight to see
I rhyme like an artist, such as Davinci
This is not a tale and I'm not a character
Just a kind of mc who loves to harass ya
Out my dome, I'll start thinkin'
I don't think slow when it comes to rhymes
Get so funky 'til I start stinkin'
When times create, I shift to overdrive
I'll take 'em out quick, fast and in a hurry
Now all the competition, they're my last worries
Now I can go the distance, I can go the length

It's not the weak, because it's all in the strength

I asked her for some pussy, she said ""I like girlies"" 
""What that mean, hoe, that I can't have it?"" 
She said, ""Nigga, recognize I'm a female faggot!""

Belly to belly, skin to skin 
Fuckin' like hell, but ain't no dick goin' in 
If they like pussy that much, then let me fuck it 
Stick it in, take it out, and let 'em suck it 
But they game is strong and they tongue is long 
A bulldagger beat and got yo' bitch and gone! 

A bulldagger done stole my bitch 
She'd rather suck pussy, she don't want no dick!

She'd rather eat pussy than suck a nigga' dick! 
A bulldagger done stole my bitch! 
Fuck y'all hoes, y'all hoes ain't shit!

Bulldaggers come in all shapes, sizes and colors 
A bitch that eat pussy makes a good dick-sucker 
Never kiss a bulldagger hoe in the mouth 
It smells like shit from all the ass she got 
Freaky hoes got them tendencies 
Why go that way, bitch, when you can get these? 
Some girls'll do it, some girls don't 
A bulldaggin' hoe will do what your boyfriend won't 
A bulldagger is the worst kind of player hater 
'Cause niggas still fuck 'em, that's why they can't fade us 
Sayin' they strictly dickly, but that ain't true 
A bulldagger got more bitches than me and you

They get all the pussy, and they don't share 
But they game is strong and they tongue is long

She'd rather eat pussy than suck a nigga' dick! 
A bulldagger done stole my bitch! 
Fuck y'all hoes, y'all hoes ain't shit!

I hate bulldaggin' hoes with a passion 
You motherfuckin' right a nigga gave bashin' 
You bitches need to get that gay shit off your mind 
Suckin' 'em up, that's sick, I dick 'em down at night 
Lickin' clits, suckin' titties, and playin' with kitties 
And sophisticated dyke's will treat a nigga shitty 
I can't understand how a bitch with class 
Would have another hoe's name tattooed on her ass 
Spittin' at my hoes but they can't be chose
Because bitch, my pussy's bought and paid for! 
Now you motherfuckin' dykes ain't got no shame 
French-kissin', holdin' hands like it ain't no thing 
Your game is workin', but I got the last virgin 
You doin' the slurpin' while I'm doin' the servin' 
But they game is strong and they tongue is long 
A bulldagger beat and got yo' bitch and gone! 

A bulldagger done stole my bitch 
She'd rather suck pussy, she don't want no dick!

Intro: (sound of woman being fucked)
Verse 1
Go to my house and fuck forever,
[Bm] When the party's over, we can get together,
And do whatever comes to mind
Let me stick my dick in your behind
Then suck my dick until I c**
You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[Fki] No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
You're not used to people saying things like this
It's called criticism, and not a diss
I only give compliments when they are due
Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
I'll be gentle, baby, 'cause we can do this!
You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest

Verse 2
[Bm] Love is the key to end all your woes
You'll be my bitch, not a dirty hoe
Together as one we will be
I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
Then lick my ass up and down
Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss
Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[Fki] bitch, it's time to spend the night
Holding each other like lovers do
Let's walk the beach in the moonlight
Makin' love, holdin' you near
When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
Screams and moans is all I hear
Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
Suck it, bitch, 'cause you can do this!

Verse 3
[Bm] Let's get it goin' on, let's act a fool
Listen and learn while I take you to school
You say you don't fuck on the first date?
Then fuck you, bitch! I ain't gonna wait
'Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
I'll find another bitch to get it on
'Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[Fki] As you move your body, the shit you say
Will make any man want to stay
'Cause being with you is all I ask
And fucking you will be my task
My lonely nights will be filled with fun
No more clubs and s** on the run
Just suck this dick, while here I lay
You can do this, so c'mon, babe!

(Mixx cuts ""Fuck me, bitch!"")

Verse 4
Now you wanna start acting dumb
[Bm] bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
You wanna play cat and mouse
When I catch you, I'ma stick my dick in your mouth
Just fuck me good until I skeet
Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
[Fki] Step to me and fall to your knees
C'mon, baby, 'cause we can do this!
Do something special you know I like
Suck this dick, put me at ease
Up and down, as I climax
Smokin' head and please don't bite
Slow and easy I pull the seat back
Steady in motion, I quietly say
We can do this, so suck it, babe!

This is a story about an MC
Who got real brave and challenged me
He thought that he was bad, he thought he was tough
Until I, what, until I called his bluff
And as the battle began, his rhymes got weaker
You couldn't even hear his voice come out the speaker
And as he started to get ignored
The party people turned and walked off the floor
They did not applaud and they did not cheer
And homeboys just said ""Get the fuck outta here""
So as I cracked a smile and started to laugh
I could see the sucka duck muthafucka gettin mad
He had a frown on his face, he was hotter than fire
He wasn't competition but just a little biter
So, as he turned and walked away
With his head to the ground and nothing to say
Cause he was busted, disgusted, and couldn't be trusted
He tried to battle me and found self-DESTRUCTION

Spoke to the brothers, sweatin' the ladies
I bumped into my homeboy Ice in the Mercedes
Went up on the ave. Where they hustle real hard
And kicked it to the girlies who was all on the tip
Skeezers on the side cold jockin' our cars

So let's find a hideaway in the Carribean
Sail the ocean like a long-shore seaman
Goin' to the Islands to have some fun
Hit the beach and take in a little sun

Feelin' the breezes of the cool winds blowin'
On a mission, not knowin' where I'm goin'
It's a free day, and I got free time
And I'm loving every minute of this life of mine
In a freak's cut bikini by the pool

Just tell Shannon, got the van with the cannon
When I hit, either the nine or the pound spits
I even flipped on a mob I was down with
So I'm packin a mac at night
And blue and whites are everywhere in a nigga sight
So come on, you little pigs, who's the bravest?
Cause I'ma spit on your ass like Larry Davis
Bumpin em off somethin decent
Jump out slow and drop the cocktail bomb in the precinct
And drop ten with the Glock-10 *boom boom boom*

Now Uncle Sam really wants me
But I'ma hit some more spots, then I'm flyin out the country

Ain't no time, for dumpin niggaz in the river
I ain't lovin you niggaz no more

Off with the legs, arms, and head later
And throw the shit down in the incinerator
Then I'm off with the drugs and ends
Now it's time to get some motherfuckin revenge
To the nigga that stuck me in jail
I sent his momma's fingers to him in the mail
Caught up with his ass inside the 10th floor hall

Because a nigga's wanted, I'm even hunted by bounty hunters
But I'm spittin out bigger lead
They got about a half a million dollar reward on a nigga's head
But I murdered the whole crew
I saw they spirits leave they bodies and I shot at them bitches too
I put the nine to their it's so simple
*bang bang* Now that's what I call a Holy Temple
You put a nigga to the test
But if you fuck with me, then you fuckin with the best
I'm wettin niggaz and I'm fleein G
Cause Sing-Sing ? ? ? ain't seein me

2 Live Crew,Do The Bart,/2/2+live+crew/do+the+bart_20000570.html,"[News Reporter]:
Well, it seems they're in the news again.
The 2 Live Crew have started a dance craze
That has basically taken the nation by storm!
Here's a report.

Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
There's a brand new dance and it's comin' to your town
It's done by the people who can really throw down
You don't need to be a queen or a jack of spades
It's done by the brothers with the hi-top fades
It doesn't matter if you're shy or wild
It's done by all, man or child
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it gets loose
Ladies, bend your back and also your knees
Shake your titties and let me squeeze
Then make a face like you wanna fart
Keep workin' them arms while doin' the Bart!

Verse 2: [Brother Marquis]
Jitterbugs keep pumpin'!
Why you frontin'?
On the Bart, I'll keep the house jumpin'
Everybody follow me, do that dance, the B-A-are-T
Just step to the right and left
Do the Bart 'till you're out of breath

[Fresh Kid Ice]
It's brand new, the dance to do
The move for the 90's and it's comin' through
Girls, shake your titties and fall to your knees
Show that ass so I can squeeze
Then make the face like you wanna fart
Work them arms while doin' the Bart!

Verse 3:  [Brother Marquis]
It's the Bart, y'all, the brand new dance
Fellas, grab your dick; girls, shake that ass
To do this dance you must wear Nike's
Girl, you need bikinis, and no s*** nighties
To do this dance, you can't act cute
Fellas, get upon that ass like you're knockin' the boots
In!  Out!  Up and down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're really gettin' down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're gonna get wet
Right Guard can't save you, 'cause you're bound to sweat
Fat girls, we ain't forgot about you
The Bart's the dance that you can even do
First you need a tight fade, a couple black medallions,
Some skiddo pants and then start dancin'
Unlike the Hammer, unlike the Humpty,
When you're doin' the Bart, you've gotta get funky!

[Fresh Kid Ice]
It's the dance of the 90s, motherfuckers act wild
Your Granny can do it, so you should try
It's not just a dance; it's a state of mind
The fellas need to hi-jump the girls' big behinds
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it get loose

[Brother Marquis]
Jump up and down, but don't freak or hustle
When you're doin' the Bart, you use every muscle
Don't hurt yourself or exert yourself
You can do the Bart all by yourself
So why you sittin' there in your seat?
Just get on the floor and Bart to the beat!"

Chorus {2x}: Mr. Mixx
I wanna do the damn thaaaaaaang! (Then do the damn thing!)
I wanna do the damn thaaaang! (Then do the damn thing!)

Verse 1: Fresh Kid Ice
I'm a bad motherfucker bringin' hoes to their knees
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
Always on a mission 'cause I like to fuck
The way I hit the pussy is in the buck
Strokin' up and down, always takin' my time
Doin' it all till I make you mine
I rub your body with motion lotion
Lick you down like waves in the ocean
Do it till you're satisfied
Have you moan even though you're tired
I've fucked many bitches across the land
And no one slangs dick like the Chinaman
You ain't been fucked 'cause your pussy's froze
Many are called but few are chose
Bust them guts like it ain't no thing
So bitch stop frontin', let's do the damn thing!

Chorus

Verse 2: Brother Marquis
Bitch, do you wanna swing with me?
S** is the best with Brother Marquis
All hoes let my record show
All my bitches come back for more
It must be the way I throw my thang
It must be the way I spit my game
Look 'em in they eye, tell a quick lie
Kiss 'em and they cry, I don't know why
Game so strong, yet so convincin'
Give me a minute, I'm up in it
Talk 'em out they draws real cool
""Bitch, give it up smooth, you know the rules!""
True love ain't so hard to find
It's right between your legs and mine
None of my bitches, they never complain
They like the way I do the damn thing!

Chorus

Verse 3
[Marquis] I love it when a bitch be like pro-per
A hooche with a coochie that'll let me pop her
The ""Blac Vagina Finda""
Once I'm inside I must remind her
Pussy's deception, dick's a weapon
After I fuck, I'm steppin'
Damn right, ain't nothin' changed
That's the way I do my thang!
[Kid Ice] Let me do it, like nothin' before
I don't need a friend, I need a whore
I need a bitch who'll fuck all night
Take plenty of dick, and the pussy's right
She'll keep me goin' till she gets me off
And bring me up, when I'm soft
Let's get together 'cause it ain't no thang
You and me, baby, doin' the damn thang!

Chorus

Mr. Mixx:
(Do the damn thang!) Hey, I'm doin' it, baby!
(Now rub the damn thang!) Damn right, I'm rubbin' it, baby!
(Kiss the damn thang!) Mmmmm-kissin'in' it, baby!
(Now do the damn thang!) Then turn around, baby!
Uhh! Uhh! Now throw the damn thaaaang!
Throw, throw it! Throw, the damn thang, baby! {2x}

{Everybody right there!}  {Get involved!}

{Everybody up there!}  {Get into it!}
And everybody o the right, we won't make you wait
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
All the people on the left, just participate
Because when we rhyme, we move people by the masses
And all the people inbetween, just shout and scream
And have a funky good time if you know what I mean
When they say they'll pay we'll play when they ask us
Suckas try to play they games of Dis-and-Die
Some say they don't know of us but that is a lie
And don't you try to shake my hand or be my friend

Unlike a hook made out of rubber I will not bend!

{Drop the bomb!!}
It'll be on radio and even TV
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
When we get ignited you can't diffuse us
To all you silly suckas wo try to abuse us:
That we achieved a level where you wanna be
Now step off the pedestal, give us the mike
So we can rock the people the way you would like
Just do us a favor, don't be a jerk

{But all we want to see is yo' body work!}
'Cause all we wanna see is your body work!

{Work yo body!}
Verse 3
You can't buy respect; it's what you earn
[Kid Ice] There's a lesson to be taught, that's the one you should learn
'Cause when you dis 2 Live you get yours in the end
It's not a threat; it's a promise, my friend!

Luke:
welcome to the fuck sho-O-O-Op!
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
There's only one place where we can go
Where the price is right just to fuck a ho
It's always popular with the girls and the guys
'Cause for all my money, it's the best buy
Ten dollars, two hours is the time of the stay
It's more than enough time to slay
Each room has a bed and also a sink
So you can wash your dick after fucking the pink
But be careful of the things that you use
'Cause you can get arrested for s** abuse
So as you hit the door and the panties drop,
Whole lot of suckin' and fuckin' at the fuck Shop!
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Please come inside, make yourself at home
I want to fuck, 'cause my dick's on bone
You little whore behind closed doors
You would drink my c** and nothing more
Now spread your wings open for the flight
Let me fill you up with something milky and white
'Cause I'm hopin' to slay you, rough and painful
You innocent bitch, don't be shameful
Bring out the ice cubes and the hot water
This is the second half, and not the second quarter
I'll fuck you 'till you sleep; you'll sleep like a baby
And in your dreams, you'll say I'm crazy
In the fuck Shop!
Luke (squeaky voice):
you're in the fuck shop, babeeee!
I wanna see you freak!!

Do the crazy thing while I fuck all night
I make her do things like nothing before
And when I'm done, she'll always be sore
>From the things I do when I'm fuckin'
And when I'm tired, the bitches are suckin'
A double team with a friend of mine
Luke's in front and I'm behind
Just ridin' you like a pony
While you suck my dick, makin' me horny
Then all of a sudden we'll switch positions
Prop your ass up and freak the pushin'
And when I c**, you'll hear me roar
I'll treat any bitch like a whore
'Cause it's the way I like to fuck
It's face down and ass up!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Face down, ass up, that's the way I like to fuck
I like the butt, it's my favorite position
I'm tired of the front, so that's why I'm bitchin'
Flip-flop it, baby, bend your ass over
In a full house spread, let me hold ya
Marquis, a raw dick motherfucker
Virgin mouthpieces, the best dick-suckers
dick-tricks, go round and round
Grip it with your pussy, go up and down
I got her callin' my name out when I'm freakin' out
I bust a nut, and then I'm breakin' out
So when you're naked, down on all fours
You better make sure that you get yours
'Cause a nigga like me will love ya and leave ya
I got mine, hoe!  See ya!
Chorus
Verse 3:  Luke
ok fellas, I got one right here, aaight? Check this out:
Lemme hear you say,
""pussy ain't nuttin' but meat on the bone
Suck it or fuck it or leave it alone! ""

With crowds of people, rockin' auditoriums
This is for all of y'all, I hope you like
My verbal expression while the music is playin'
Screamin', yellin', swayin' while I'm sayin'
This is designed to make you feel all right!

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Lady Godiva was a freak
By doing this a hundred years ago,
She rode buttnaked to the street
Romeo, where's Juliet?
It's all right for girls to be hoes
She's out gettin' her pussy wet
My man Samson and that bitch Delilah,
She got mad 'cause Samson tried her
All the ass was for a little head
But she played it off like she was scared
And couldn't wait to get in the sheets
Knowing all the time she was a freak
It's the devil's work, the Lord can't save ya
There's a freak in every demon
They even had s** in the Garden of Eden
We got it bad, that freaky behavior

Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
To some she's shy and to others she's wild
But to her daddy she's an innocent child
Not knowing what's happening when he's away
But like a bitch in heat, she's ready to play
She fucked five niggas 'till they all got sore
Then laughed in they face, and asked for more
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
A product of society with the freaky behavior

She does what she wants, and no one can save her
Hoe, you know you're my aphrodesiac
Before you suck my dick, can you pull the skin back?
You're a dog-ass bitch doing dirty deeds
Bitch, you belong in a s** asylum
If your period's on, then fall to your knees
Every trick in the book, your dog ass has tried 'em
Blame it on your mama, 'cause it's how she raised ya

Verse 4:  Fresh Kid Ice
I guess that explains your freaky behavior
She's also wild, but only she can stand it
Fuckin' all the boys and making 'em c** in a minute
The best dick sucker that could ever be found
Who'll suck your balls, then drink the c**
And to the boys, our own private skeezer
Up on the 'ave, she's more than a teaser
You can tell her daddy, but no one can save her
She does what she wants with her freaky behavior"

Of any of the dj's to rock the land
Like the ones from the city and the boys from Pac-Jam
Handsome Harry, you know the brother was strong
He ain't dared any man to get him wrong
L. A. Jay, this young brother doesn't play
He'll strong-arm any sucker who gets in his way
Baby Ced, Liberty City born and bred
Always known for the knowledge and sense of the head
Disco Gene, he's reunited with the team
He was gone for a while, but back in the swing of things
Amazing Chico, a king to his trade
Known as Bernie B. On 9-1-7 Bass
And G. I. Joe, who has the girls by the row
He always gets cased 'cause his game is gettin' slow
And last but not least, marvelous J. P.,
And we can't forget Cisco - we're glad you are free
So one day to your kids you will tell the story
Of how the Ghetto Style dj's achieved their glory!

Rollin' real hard in a six-tre ('63)

And all you fools in the game, you silly-ass lames
You can't fuck with me; I'm wild and not tame
Like a savage beast, I'm out on the street
So, motherfucker, what's up with that?  You wanted beef?
Punk, you got a problem?  I'll solve 'em!
I pulled his gat; his life cost him
So don't fuck with me while I'm around in the back
I'm always strapped when I'm hangin' out!"

I remember back when, how the Kid got scarred
Beggin' for pussy; bitches actin' hard
I gots no play for the lack of papers
For the dope boys, I had the vapors
'Cause they got the hoes for the money they were stackin'
And all I had was dreams of rappin'
But a few months later the scenario changed
With a record and a video; now the Kid had game
They jumped over buildings, straight on the dick
It hit me so hard thinkin' I was it
They tripped me out, a sudden change of flavor
Hoes kissin' my ass wantin' to do me favors
But no matter how they tried to fuck with my pride
Ice Cold Productions won't slip or slide
'Cause when I was comin' up you was talkin' shit
Now that I made a nigga suck a dick
I know what's happenin', don't think I'm dumb

Kid Ice is movin' up, so here I come!
Chorus:
[Make way, 'cause here I come!]

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Marquis is the man, and I'm on a mission
To make a lot of money is my main ambition
Fuck niggas, and fuck hoes too
The meal is made, so let's eat food
Goin' out like that makes me laugh
But some motherfuckers try to hold ya back
And you know and I know who I'm talkin' about
Some are white, but most are black
But they all can kiss the crack of my ass
Y'all need to shut your fuckin' mouth and step aside!
You better make way, 'cause here I come, motherfucker!
Chorus

Verse 3:  Fresh Kid Ice
Steppin' to the light, and out the darkness
To relieve the pressure and all the madness
So here I come, a young man on the rise
Doin' what's right to stay alive
We're brothers, down with each other for they own gain
In a world of negativity and full of pain
Statyin' above the others, you know what's happenin'
So I keep on steppin', and keep on rappin'
For the better of myself, and not the fame
I try to make a livin' in this hip-hop game
If you wanna try, come and get some
Step out my way, 'cause here I come!

And wanted all the things that your money could buy?

You gotta spend money to get that coochie
She'll find a man who thought he was raw
Then leave him heartbroken when his money was no more
She'll get any man and treat him nice

Is equallity?! No!
What do we want? Freedom!

Expressing my feelings before I exploded
About the suffering passed on to a black man
By the money hungry seeking white man
fucking up our streets with pollution
Then lock a nigga up for the solution
There they go now taking on the little man
fuck wit the cartel or the white
Arrest musicains for the things they say
But can't find a crime after it got sprayed
This is America in God we trust
We won just this but
A dick is in the dust

I'm streotype so I fit the description
A nigga has the stigma for pushing or pimpin'
Police harrass me and public embarass me
They use brutallity without asking me
I'm mad cuz I was caught and reached for his license
Cops pulls the gun and cold ice
And I'm a victim of society I got societal ills
It's harder to pay bills than pop pills
They send a brother off to fight for your country
When ask for ours we get nothing
I look for work and get my feelings hurt
They got my back against the wall
And my dick is in the dirt

Lets talk about this man they call Nino Brown
The black man they call Nino brown
You know there's a lot of Nino Browns in every city
In the United States of America
America had formed a Nino Brown in every city
Basicallly because we have no way out
Ah, Is that what America really wants us to think
That we have don't way out
Here's an example, You have never seen
A black man come into Miami with
Pounds and pounds of marijuana pounds and pounds of cocaine
You have never seen a black man drop off
A kilo load of cocaine out of a plane
Yet it is still in our community everyday
And we're the ones going to jail for it

The system is designed to lead us to stray
So we turn to guns and drugs for our pay
It's the sign of the times
I gotta get mine all I live is a life of crime

I come up hard from the ran down ghetto
You talk your ass off but tell me what a nigga know
All I see is a lot of neighborhood drama
Babies crying, I wonder where's the mama
C. O. D. Got rushed to tramu
A dealer had to deal to make a fast buck
She was just a patient, What the fuck
His back's against the wall and his dick's in the dust"

We are going to be up and here comes that black
Watch yourself, he is kind of smart, you know...

Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
This story began five years ago
Took a funky idea and began to roll
By doing something that was never done
While getting paid, still having fun
Being explicit straight from the streets
Not forgettin' our roots to an up-tempo beat
Taking what they say just for granted
For us to give up, that's what they wanted
To do it all, we'd be taking shorts
'Cause at that time we were given no thought
To follow another; we didn't see it
We're the example for others to see
In the beginning all we had was a phone
And trust in each other was how we lived on
Word was bond, we relied on true
Faith in each other backed up by Luke

Chorus:
We are
Ghetto Style
Perched in the South
The king of the ghetto
The man, not a myth

Verse 2:  [Brother Marquis]
The journey was long, but we fought the struggle
We paid off in the end by the bundles
In the beginning, some were against us
But we proved them wrong, and made them envious
So we kept on writing, the public kept on buying
What we were making, they took a-likin'
We found the market, hit the target
We started the fire, but it's you who sparked it
We stayed independent, and we didn't sell out
We started off with no help from the White House
The plot was perfect, though we needed a gimmick
So we thought up this dance called Throw the Dizznick
In no time at all, things started growin'
Charts were showin' that sales were soarin'
Then all the talkin', all the squawkin',
They tried to take the name, but keep Skyy-walkin'

Verse 3: [Fresh Kid Ice]
A black thing, from beginning to end
Brothers in the business and loyal friends
Steppin' on stages, movin' as one
For the money and for the fun

When once seem down, we all come clean

[Brother Marquis]
In unity, we all stand strong
We all step together,
No man walks alone
No matter what, they can't stop us
They ain't doin' us just 'cause, when it's just us
Any circumstance we must overcome
Let's keep the dream alive, and all get some
And never mind those people with the negative vibes
And never mind the people with the evil eyes
'Cause they all flippin' somewhere out on a trip
'Cause they don't understand the man and the myth

Never to the movies, just straight to my house
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is s**, 'cause me so horny

""DROP YO' DRAWS AND OPEN YO' LEGS UP WIDE, BITCH!"")

Verse 1: Brother Marquis
I've been wanting to tell you this for a while
I like your fake blue eyes and your hoey style
So let's go for a walk through the park
You can suck my dick in the dark
And just do what I ask; bitch, bend over
Let me ride your backside like dogs do each other
I know that you're with it, so don't start frontin'
I don't wanna be your man; I wanna move somethin'!

(Mixx cuts:
""You might as well give up the pussy.""
""Oh no!"")

Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice
Listen up, baby, you look real pretty
Let me pull up your shirt and suck your titties
Yes, pretty lady, I love you so
Since the time we met, my dick has grown
You had other men; now it's my chance
Give me some time to take off my pants
The time has come; don't be frontin'
Just drop them draws, and let's move somethin'!

(Mixx cuts:
""Now what the hell do you want??""
""I want to FUCK!"")

Verse 3: Brother Marquis
Let's rent a room at a fuck-motel
Then play this game called ""Ring the Sleigh Bells""
Put the ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door
And ride this dick 'till it gets sore
Then open your legs, put 'em in the buck
'Cause that's the way I like to fuck
It's real simple; it's not really nothin'
All you have to do is move somethin'!

(Mixx cuts:
""Now let's find a motel so I can see how you fuck!""
""Haaa?!""
""Big daddy....""
""Please...""
""Don't rush me, bitch!""
""Move your body to the beat""
""Haao, work on my ass, baby!!"")

Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice
Look, baby doll, don't lie or front
You know what I need and I know what you want
Let's go to the beach, we'll lay in the sand
And I'll prove to you that I'm a real man
And the way it felt, it was real tight
It chilled my body and the feeling was right
It's all for love; it's you I've been wantin'
Just roll those hips and let's move somethin'!"

My seven bizzos...
Seven days, seven ways, that's too much...
My seven bizzos...

On Monday there's Melissa, I like to be with her
I get all her money and, a-then I diss her
On Tuesday there's Sareesa, she's my homeroom teacher
She said, ""After school, I would love to meet you!""
I said ""Bet!"" with no regret
Because a night with her was one I wouldn't forget
So then I told all my homies and they all called me phony
And said I was kickin' a bunch of that baloney
But they soon found out, and now they all believe

My seven bizzos...(2x)
'Cause every Tuesday after school, me and her would leave
Seven days, seven ways, that's too much...
My seven bizzos...

On Wednesday there's Wanda, who looks like Jane Fonda
She said she likes bikes, so I put her on my Honda
She done what I asked right from the start
She got naked, then my dick got erected
I took her to the park, where it was pitch dark
Before I rocked her pussy, I had to check it
'Cause she doesn't want her rich friends to know the truth
But when we're in school, she tries to play it cool
But me and her both know all the facts
She's in love with the brother from the ghetto, who is black

My seven bizzos...(2x)
My seven bizzos...
Seven days, seven ways, that's too much...
Yeahhh.
On Thursday there's Trina, her perfume lingers

She likes to suck my dizzo, my tizzo and my finger
On Friday there's Frances, who likes to take chances
When her husband's at work, she does me dirty dances
She knows what I like, and that's to please her
She's my own private skeezer, she's not a dick-teaser
She steps in naked with her bare-ass booty
On Saturday there's Susie, who likes my ja'causezi
She takes a drink, then her head starts to sink

She slobs on Bob while I play with the pink
My seven bizzos...(2x)
Seven days, seven ways, too much...
My seven bizzos...

She's a tricky-dick bitch who's out for his money
On Sunday there's Connie, who fucks with slick Ronnie
She's always schemin' and hot like a demon
I thought I came in her mouth, but I was only peein'
Now all these hoes belong to one player
Now y'all ain't heard?  You better go ask your mother
A hard dick brother and a pussy surveyor
That your sister's being dicked by Marquis, your brother

My seven bizzos...
Seven days, seven ways, too much...

You're just a do-boy 'cause your boss is in charge
Tryin' to play big money, ain't it sad, ain't it funny
You're so blind you can't see that you're really playin' dummy
Gucci rags and Bronze, shinin' grills of chrome
Frontin' in a caddy you don't even own
You're soft, and you know that we know it
You try to hide it, but can't help but show it
Now the trues and vogues pull the hoes with nice figures

Comin' out of my room to the next man
It's a problem you had since you were a child
Always tryin' to be down but actin' stupid and wild
I remember way back just to be exact
We laughed at your ass when you got jacked
So, fuck-ass nigga, here's something to remember:
No matter what you try, you're a pussy-ass nigga!

Verse 3
[Kid Ice] You fix up your hoes like you fix your cars
Give 'em rag-top heads, make 'em project stars
You buy 'em Gucci bags, even Louie Baton
Spendin' all your money just to get some

Gettin' jerked by the man instead of paid

[Fki]  There's only one place where we can go
To see freaky hoes doin' shows
Doin' tricks to make us holler
On a giving night, all for a dollar
Silicone breasts, all on their chests
Nothin' like others, but above the rest
They'll do anything to turn us on

Throwin' that pussy the way you do!

Guards at the door, armed with gauges
As they dance and I get hot,
Keep throwin' that pussy!  Don't stop!

We don't stop

Huh

[ verse 1 ]
A revolution of mass confusion, brothers killin each other
Robbin their mother, father, sister and brother
They don't wanna get a job, or go to school
They think it's cool, but they're playin the fool
It's now 1984, five hundred years later
We're dominating both sides of the Aequator
In sports, music, and makin love
But yet we still have trouble rising above
It's said that in the later days
People shall be movin in different ways
There'll be many false prophets, devils in disguise
Performin illusions before your very eyes
Some have eyes to see, and ears to hear
But they cannot utilize them because of fear
You have sell-out brothers who will sell their heart
For fame and fortune or to get a head start
But in the long run they will see
That they are nothin else but victims of prophecy
Time is running short, the world is in damnation
Refuse to follow the laws of creation
You can not all be Jesus Christ
But you still can make some sacrifice
If not for anyone for yourself
Cause you have nothin to prove to anyone else
We don't longer have a sheperd now, we're lost sheep
Have to open your eyes, you can't afford to sleep
And a major factor is jealousy
Which stops us from obtainin the unity
Come on

You don't stop

[ verse 2 ]
Times are hard, and people are chillin
You can't get a job, but you know you're willin
So you go down to the unemployment line
And the man throws you out on your behind
Then you find some transportation, and you go back home
And find your wife cryin on the telephone
The police called to say that your job is ill
She tried to O. D. On a bottle of pills
Now you're mad as hell, and can't take it no more
So you grab your gun and walk out the door
You find another brother and you take their check
And deep down inside you know you're riskin your neck
How do you know they don't have a knife?
But you have your gun, so then you take their life
Now your pocket is full, but can't you see
That your soul will burn in hell for eternity?
See, I remember back in Brooklyn, when I was a child
Actin wild, cause that was the stlye
But as I grew older, I learned the deal
Because my old lady told me, ""Son, be for real
You have a chance to be an architect or scientist
So why do you choose to be like this? ""
You  have to get yourself together before it's too late
It's up to you to be a bum or someone great
We all have it in us, and that is why
They tell us lies to cover our eyes
So we are not able to see the light
And differentiate wrong from right
You see, the road to vanity is filled with flowers
You better be careful of its hypnotic powers
While the road to truth is long and full if distress
But if you make it through, you're truly the best

Yeah, bitch.  I know you used to clown and talk shit in high school
When we was fuckin' around... 'cause I couldn't fuck.  But now I'm
Back, bitch!  To let yo' punk ass know that I can really dick 'em
Savage in the sack, baby, I'll break ya back, baby
Down, 'cause I'm a...

Chorus (4x):  Mr. Mixx and Brother Marquis

It's like that from the front to the back, baby
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
An original dicksmith, one of the three
A savage in the morning, a savage in the sack
When it's time for s** I'll break ya fuckin' back
There's no time for slack, so give me 'nuff respect,
Throbbin' that pussy like a Tonka toy
And I'll dick ya down like a Trinnie roughneck!
'Cause you're fuckin' with a man, not a little boy
{Sho' you right.  All pussy ain't good pussy.
But nuttin' don't beat that savage pussy.  You know that
Ya head fucked up.  You know I'm a big muthafucka;
Pussy that breathes, the snappin' pussy, that have
I might lay heavy, but I damn sho' can't go deep, baby.}
Let me ride that ass from front to back
The one-armed bandit is a savage in the sack, baby

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Chorus
Beautiful but deadly; I can't let her get me
Very attractive, yet orally active
She's the baddest bitch to ever hit the matress
Despite all the things she does to try and tip me
Hot dick in a c***, smokin' head and them blue balls
Fattest [?] turd ever stinked a pair o' draws
The finest thing hoein', not like I ain't knowin'
She'll turn a trick and suck a nigga-dick
S** game strong, leave the savage alone
And don't want a nigga to nut too quick
If you slip she'll catch ya, you're caught in the rapture
Don't fall in love when the pussy's thrown at ya
You're caught in the spell {Ha ha ha ha... Oh well!}
Savage in the sack, fuck like hell
{You have to have a strong mind to fuck with a savage,
'Cause it'll have ya head fucked up every time.}

Outro:
Chorus
{Yeah.  I know y'all know who I am in here.  I'm just down here hangin'
We're players from way back.  We used to mutt out hoes together
Out with m' boys... Brother Marquis, Fresh Kid Ice, and Mr. Mixx.
And everything, y' know.  But uh, my lil' thangs jumped off again for
Me, so I'm just hollerin' at my peoples.
Y'all brothers stay strong, and
... Practice what you preach.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha

[""I'm gonna cum!""]

Verse 1:
Let me skeet, don't hesitate
It ain't good to masturbate
Hoe, I'll let you suck my dick
If you say you'll be my bitch
You'll be proud to be my hoe
I'll take you everywhere I go
If anybody else, you belong to me
I'm the one that has you sprung
Is this my pussy?  (woman:  Yeah, Marquis...)
When I skeet, we'll have a son
Skeet them jaws, skeet them draws
Pull it out and skeet the walls
Grab it, flip it, hold it, rub it
When I skeet is when you suck it
And the skeet will set you free
All you have to do is believe

Chorus
Jerk it off, jerk it off, ba-by!  [""I'm gonna cum!""] (3x)
[""I'm gonna cum!""]
Verse 2:

For the skeet you are a fiend
Don't you stop this freaky thing
Dick is the one thing that you love
You'll skeet off by yourself
And the skeet's all you're thinking of
If you can't skeet with someone else
Skeetin' nowadays is the thing to do
Skeet from the front, skeet from the back
You'll skeet me and I'll skeet you
Can I skeet in your mouth?  Do you like it like that?  (woman:  Yess!)
Taste my skeet, don't it taste so sweet?
For my skeet you are a freak
I skeet off twice and then I'm done
All you have to do is believe
I have to save some skeet for the next one, hon
And the skeet will set you free
Chorus

Verse 3:

Skeetin' is for the young and old
Before I go out and skeet a bitch
But it's best to skeet in a hoe
I always take my skeetin' kick
I like to skeet in big ol' butts
It makes me skeet off big ol' nuts
You can say that I'm a nympho
I skeet best on a one-night stand
Skeet in your mouth, then skeet your temple
Brother Marquis is a skeeta man!
You suck slow and I fuck fast
Don't get mad if the skeet don't last
It ain't love, it must be lust
In the skeet you must trust
All you got to do is believe
And the skeet will set you free

Umph
So funky!
Nasty!
Hey!

Verse 1:  [Brother Marquis]
I'm Nasty As I Wanna Be
I express myself so vulgarly
Obscene, or whatever you wanna call it
That's why some suckas wanna stall it
Some people worry about the wrong thing
But why worry about what we're sayin'?
'Cause we're gonna do what we wanna do,
And if y'all don't like it, well then fuck you too!
People don't know unless you tell them so
But it was cool when we were just in the ghetto
We did ask you to publicize us,
But it was you who created the fuss
And blew the whole thing out of proportion
You should worry about your topics like abortion
So I fiend for the funk like a dope-fiend junky
Fuck you all, and let us get So Funky!

Verse 2:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
Singin' this song, movin' along
Provin' to the suckas that I keep gettin'
Stronger than what ya been hearin'
Kid Ice is on the set, so suckas stop sweatin'
I kick it funky to show my courage
When schoolin' others, I kick the knowledge
For those who hate me, I pray you'll miss me
If you find out you had dissed me
I'll treat you like a child and smack ya head
Feed you dick, put you to bed
Look you in the eye and know you're fessin'
Make you take notes of the lesson
The rhythm is something I cannot hide
A feelin' that I feel, deep inside
So talk about me while I make my money
Kid Ice is known to be So Funky!

Verse 3:  [Brother Marquis]
Some say I'm crazy and I got problems
An evaluation might help solve 'em
The funky-mack-nasty, filthy-mack-funky
Stankin' (?), the wino junkyMentally scarred, always barred
Slightly deranged, a half-way retard
Goin' off insanely, tryin' to retain me
Tried to capture my rapture, but couldn't contain me
I put 'em in shambles, makin' examples
'Cause once I get started, I'm hard to handle
You can't keep me back, you can't forget that
I heard the chit-chat; you said that I'm wack
But anyway, that's okay
I try not to hear what the niggas say
So I just fiend for the funk like a dope-fiend junky
Excuse me y'all, and let me get So Funky!"

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
I like getting head, 'cause it's so convenient (Huh.)
You can do it any time; you don't have to beat it!
You can get it in the car, or even in the park (Yeah!)
But most head-hunters go out after dark (True.)
There's nothing like a pretty hoe on her knees
Suckin' my D (Yeaaah.) and lickin' my B's
We don't have to take our clothes off to bust a nut
When I pull out my dick, biiiitch, pucker up!
And gimme some!

Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Coolin' in a club on a Saturday night
Gettin' fucked up with the boys and feelin' all right (Yeah!)
When I saw this bitch who had to be a winner
And the only thing on my mind was to run up in her
So I got her kind of tipsy with some s** On The Beach
Then the bitch got hot and she wanted to eat
So, for me to get over, took her straight to the bed (What?)
She got on her knees and gave some good hot head! (Yeah!)

Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
Hot head hoes, some white some niggeroes
But I like the ones who suck toes and assholes
With tongues like razors that cut when she licks (Ooh!)
How can I fuck you with a skinless dick? (ha ha ha ha...)
You take pride in suckin' a good dick
And after I nut, bitch, you better not spit (ha ha ha ha...)
You're a dirt dobbler, a goop gobbler
You'll fuck Satan for the righteous dollar

Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
The strip club is the place to hang
Just watchin' all the bitches just throwin' that thang
In a smoke-filled room, filled with noise
On a special night just for the boys
I'll be sittin' at a table, just sippin' on a drink,
While the bitch is on stage, showin' the pink
Oh, what a sight to see!
It looked like the pussy just winked at me
They'll do anything for a tip
Like table-top dance, or even grab your dick
With my money in hand, lookin' for fun
Look out, man, 'cause here she comes!

[Luke]:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, y'all wanna get them four girls over there?
Them four fine mu'fuckers, the one over there makin' her pussy jump and shit?
Two pussies in one?  Aaight.  Y'all - y'all repeat after me...
Bring that pussy over here, heeeere!
Bring that pussy over here, heeeere!

Verse 2:  [Brother Marquis]
Chillin' late night, I was drunk as fuck
A nigga bored as hell, so I hit the club
Gave a bitch five for a table-top dance
She took off her g-string and shook her ass
Baby, all that?  You got to work harder!
Do some backflips to make me harder!
So I called the waitress, gimme a drink!
And by that time, a nigga start' to think
If that bitch in here swallows bottle tops,
I know she could make me hard as a rock
So shake ya booty, girl, smack the devil and raise the flag
And let Marquis bless and watch that ass!

[Luke]:
Damn, Mixx, get yo' face out that pussy!
Hey, Marquis, what you doin', man?
You not supposed to be doin' that!

Verse 3:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
She danced on the table, I poured with sweat
Put my hand in my pocket, pulled out a bet
She laid on the table, then opened her thighs
No hairs on the pussy, which made my dick rise
She went crazy, and I got loose
Gave her a 20 and the pussy juiced
It's the boys' night out, and we're lookin' for fu
nlook out, man, 'cause here she comes!

[Luke]:
Hold on, hold on, hold on, Chris, you gave her a 20?

Spendin' flow for stripper hoes
If the hoe ain't cute, don't even bother
And table-tops cost five dollars
Drop them strings and skin to win

She gotta show pink to get paid
And I don't want a hoe who's always afraid
I'll flip that hoe like a script
'Cause for all that flow, niggas might trip
'Cause pussy's a man's best friend
And she gotta keep shakin' 'till the record ends
'Cause I like them stripper hoes
The ones from Rolexx and Coco's
And I keep on gettin' them table-tops!
So come on, make ya pussy pop

Payin' 'em more than the club that employs 'em
Checkin' that booty movin'

Thinkin' they got that bitch to theyself?

How you gonna step to me, kid, you grew up off me

Called my nigga in Miami, ""Marquis, wussup?""

You can come on in for an hour or two

I'm down with Luke and the Ghetto Bass sound!

Verse 4:  [Debonaire]
I got pull like gravity but some got no juice
Deb in the flesh, well I'm fresh like produce
Suckas never bite my stuff when they competin'
It's just too raw for them to think about eatin'
If y'all ain't heard the word, my rap lingers
The drop sounds like it's hot and burnin' my fingers
This rapper's tryin' to front on a real smooth flower
They ass is grass, and I'm the lawn mower
Of course I put 'em out like trash 'cause I'm a lyncher
Attackin' punk rappers like a Doberman Pincher
They all be like vampires to me, so they oughta
Walk or get burnt, 'cause I'm the Holy Water
You say you wanna battle, but that'd be your doom
'Cause I'll have you on your ass like Fruit of the Loom
The name's Debonaire and I'm one of the best around
I'm down with Luke and the Ghetto Bass sound!

Verse 5:  [Brother Marquis]
Though I'm from the bottom, I'm placed by the rest out
Brother Marquis is one of the best out
There's no comparin' me, I'm far from bein' so-so
I top the suckas droppin' fast and flowin' slow
Puttin' suckas out like I was Nyquil
I rock on the mike like no other on the mike
We're your worst nightmare, if not scarier
Their loss in the (??) new to the area
The man you can't handle, 'cause I'm just too rough
They say that I'm good; they should 'cause it's true stuff
So ain't nobody sayin' that I'm not legit
They need to wipe they mouth, 'cause they just talkin' shit
When it comes to droppin' science, I'm the man you can't knock out
The heavyweight champ that'll take your whole block out
Marquis, one of the best around

It's just an oldie dance that you can do

Just get on the floor and throw that D

Just listen up close i'll explain to you
Just jump in th air
And when you land you'll mind like you just don't care
It's all in the hips, so go berserk
And let that D do the work
So while it's workin' you'd better start strokin'
To show your partner that you ain't jokin'
''cause this ain't a dance from mother goose
Better freak your body and turn it loose

Looking at my Rolex, it's 12:00
And my dick... is hard as a rock
My beeper ain't went off all day
I guess all my bitches went out to play
Fuck 'em, 'cause I ain't sweatin' 'em either
Hoes is jockin' me? I don't need 'em!
There's no time to waste chasin' a pretty face
Bitches won't have me in a rat race
They're very bourgeois and so seditty
When you ask 'em for some pussy, they get shitty
So I turn to the bitches who are not attractive
I'm like them; they're sexually active
All they want is a one night stand,
Some dick, and no commitment to a man
Never seen in public with an undesirable, 
But they come clean like old reliable

Big titties, big ass and kind of stacked
6'2"" and she's also fat
Rollin' 'round the club like a bitch in heat
But at four in the morning, she couldn't be beat
A plate of chicken wings and a stack of fries
Trying to see who's looking from the corner of my eyes
On my P's and Q's, and aware of my shit
The coast was clear, and I'm ready to dip
She want to go to my crib, but here's the trick
From the club we hit the Motel 6
Riding with no tints, so hoe, keep low
Trying to play it off so the boys won't know
She wanted to be seen but was out of luck
The pussy was good, but she was ugly as fuck

Chorus
Verse 3
Marquis:
Haulin' ass, trying to hurry up and get there
'Cause I can't be seen with this bitch here
It's bad enough that I'm rankin' myself
But I can't be ranked by no one else
U-G-L-why, bitch, you ain't got no alibi
So don't you roll down no windows or open no doors,
Jump your ass in the back and get on the floor!

Kid Ice:
She's ugly as fuck and you want to know why
She couldn't be worse if the bitch had died
Be my girl, hoe! It ain't all that!
Got weave in your hair, not neat, and fat
Guess I'm understanding you're just a fuck
I'm out for the pussy and just one nut
I'll call you next time when I'm out of luck
No offense, baby, you're just ugly as fuck!

Talkin' to the ladies with the sexy curves
I opened a bottle of Mo'
The phone rang  Hello?
Now this is how we do it

They rushed to crib before I knew it
The Crew don't know how to ill
But everyone knows we like to chill

Rollin' in the jeep to the APT's (apartments)
It's hot, I dropped the top to feel the breeze
Shoud we go to the beach or just chill?
Rollin' down the 'ave but I can't decide
I'm bankin', I can't wait to see Stacey
Today I lost a hundred-dollar bill, but still
It's gettin' hot, so I turned on the A/C
So I kept on rollin'; I'm changin' my plan:
I seen this girl in a tight-fittin' mini
When I get Stacey, I'll check out the Ice-man!
She looks kinda good but she's a little skinny
I picked her up, she said, ""Where we goin'?""

But Stacey was with me, but I still had to stare
[FKI]       About that time, I was gettin' dizzy
I grabbed some girls and a bottle of Mo'
I'm the Brother Marquis and it's time to get ill

I told the girl what Luke said

We call it Amtrak but some call it the train
We all would line up in a single-file line
And take our turns at waxing girls' behinds
But every time it came to me, I was shit out of luck
Because I'd stick my dick in, and it would get stuck

The Surgeon General says wear a condom

But you can catch aids nowadays from slobbin',
Gynecology, and urology
Take extreme measure for sexual pleasure
If I'm positive, too late for an apology
Protect your jewels; it's what you treasure
Use precaution to prevent abortion
All we need is another life lost in
The system that's designed to hold us back
All this shit is so confusing
Get off the heroin and the crack!
You can't even have a blood transfusion
For the fear of infected plasma
You won't be the first, nor the last one
Getting pussy's like death wish two
You've got to know who's fuckin' who!

Who's fuckin' who?
Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice

Living in a world where no one has trust
A lack of understanding, filled with lust
Where diseases are common, inflicting much pain
Gonorrhea and aids, too many to name
S** is alive in both young and old
But people are fuckin' without protection
But a lack of education leaves us in the cold
There may be a cycle that we failed to mention
'Cause Jim fucks Ann, then fucks Susie
Then runs across town to go fuck Stevie
Thinking he's a player, trying to get over
But all he's doing, transmitting to another
If you've gotta fuck, don't fuck yourself
Use protection for others, if not yourself
'Cause people are fuckin', and this is true
What you don't know is who's fuckin' who

[Marquis]

Verse 3:
Junkies use the intravenous
Then fuck each other? I can't see this
S** and drugs, you know they don't mix
So be careful, 'cause that shit's out there
It's a 4-letter word that you should fear
Especially when a bitch turns tricks for a fix
Don't be a fool and forget, my brother!
So please choose a rubber before you choose your lover

[Kid Ice]
The 1990's, the decade of disease
It seems like we're trying to kill our own kind
Just fuckin'... And lack of selection
By fuckin' each other with out protection
'Cause s** is alive in both young and old
So get educated; you're not too old
'Cause people are fuckin', and this is true
What we don't know is who's fuckin' who

Talk about, why?  Spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies
I'm real sensitive to the fact
Of why must you go out like that
You can't say nothin' positive
All I get are negative responses
They say it's hard to keep a good man down
But it's not hard to have one up off the ground
He said, she said, this-n-that
But who's tellin' the truth?  It ain't like that

But nobody told me what was goin' on

Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Larceny, meaning bein' jealous-hearted
Over little or nothin', it can get started
For example, a man wants to get ahead
Others wish he failed and rather see him dead
Always puttin' obstacles in your path
It becomes a problem you shouldn't have
It's like a disease spreadin' faster than aids

You gain more foes as your lifestyle change'
They want what you got, that's the dollars that you clock

Material things they couldn't retain
Still hopin' your loss will be their gain
Yet we strive to stay alive and live carefree
Others still have that larceny

Verse 3
(Kid Ice) You'll shake my hand, pretend to be my friend
And behind my back, wish it all would end
People mention my name, you'll frown your face
Hopin' in your dreams you'll take my place
The things that I own you wish you had
Every time I do good it makes you mad
You're not a friend to me, just an enemy
A sucker that rhymes, a wanna be

You wanna be down, but you gotta come clean
Rockin' boomin' beats on every cut

How do you live feelin' like you're dying more each day?
After the Fire Is Gone

You had the whole world at your feet and you stood so tall
You played the game one too many times, now you've lost it all
What got you started now is a million miles away
You wake up only to find that you're a little bit too late

Deprived of his victim, he's a ruthless man
He waits in the shadows 'til the man is gone
He moves to the door, now she's all alone
Far as you could see, that's her only way
She fears for her life and what her family would say

[Chorus:]
Back door stranger
A fair warning he's out tonight
A back door stranger
We gotta stop him if the chance is right

You read in the paper, most any day
'Bout back door stranger and his evil ways
The law can't judge because he pleads insane
It's a sign of the times that we got to change
You ask my opinion, he ain't half a man
He's as cold as a snake about to strike again
It's a slap in the face that we tolerate
The pain that he causes worries us grey

I've been categorized as a little wild
The police took my photograph
A hunted boy runnin' from his past
Some even called me the devil's child

At seventeen, I was on my own
Had the clothes on my back, from a broken home
Slapped in the face 'til my daddy got straight
I knew it was time to run

[Chorus:]
Now I'm back, back on the track again
I'm back, I'm holdin' my own, I'm leadin' the pack
I'm back, from a shattered home and a living hell
I'm back, back on the track

First indication, of trouble's up ahead
I saw the flashing blues, I saw the color red
A big commotion at the friendly store
Found a poor man robbed and a kid at the door
""Guilty as charged"", or so the judge said

I was sent to school to try to learn a trade
But when the schoolboys laughed I became enraged
I prayed to god that's the last mistake I'd made

[Chorus:]

Bad reputation freedom's my desire
I tried to clear my name, I came under fire
A bad situation was a way of life
With a cutthoat laywer given bad advice
The only hope I had was a proven liar

It was win or lose, out to clean the slate
It was some big news when I made the break
And I ran for years to avoid the state
Another chance I was forced to take

Now I'm back, back on the track again
I'm back, I'm holdin' my own, I'm leadin' the pack
I'm back, from a shattered home and a living hell
I'm back, back on the track again

I'm back, I'm back on the track again"

All day you're havin' to play the good girl
And you never be letting your guard down
But when the nighttime calls you to a different world
You turn your attitude around

With just a little bit of intimate danger
And a lot of genuine mystery
When the music's jumpin' it starts to change ya
You got your tight red dress, high heeled shoes
And a new barbed-wire tattoo... Baby
Bad looks good on you

It's not like your shakin' it for the first time
Only a fool wouldn't realize
And the way you move's about to blow my mind
You've got me wild-eyed and hypnotized

With just a little bit of intimate danger
And a lot of genuine mystery
When the music's jumpin' it starts to change ya
I'm mesmerized by the way you move
Keep doin' the things you do
Bad looks good on you

Underneath your angel face
There hidden in a darker place
A place where only you can go and no one else can see
And as the darkness starts to fall
Your inner voice begins to call
A wilder spirit trying to break free"
38 Special,Bone Against Steel,/3/38+special/bone+against+steel_20158314.html,"Rollin' out to Vegas
On an eastbound outta L. A.
I met a roughneck man who hailed from Alabama
His eyes had a lot to say
And his name was Rufus Champion

They call that train the desert wind
And it blew like a mutha that day
Thru the Joshua Trees
We were battin' the breeze
About our rock'n roll heros
Dead or alive

Chorus

Out across that night did we sail
Bone against steel against the rail
Boats against the stream
Cutting against the grain
Kept on rollin'
Bone against steel

As the moon rose in the window
Rufus began his tale
About an oil rig near the gulf coast
Puttin' man against metal
In a classic work-place accident
He told how the drill commenced to shakin'
The platform started to rock
The chain began breaking
They were straight out of luck
And then the sky kinda lite up
Just like a lightnin' bolt had struck

Chorus

Workmen's compensation don't compensate for much
With the doctors and lawyers and the irs and such
You can break up the bone
But the spirit just won't bust
When is bone against steel

With casino lights up a shimmering
We made that Vegas stop
And we laughed away our blues
Now here's the good news
Rufus walks off heels a kickin'
With his baby right by his side
And as they waltzed on out of view
We were back up to speed
And clean outta sight

Double chorus"
38 Special,Breakin' Loose,/3/38+special/breakin+loose_10202661.html,"It was the typical blues, it was more bad news
I was walkin' down a dirty street
Saw a man, I knew some years before
On the corner where the losers meet
He had rags on his back, as a matter of fact
Had a cold look on his face
He was standin' in line, groanin' words to the kind
As I passed I could hear him say, he said......

Don't live your life by the dollar sign
Live life to the limit, that's the bottom line
No guarantees what tomorrow will bring
Be the best at what you are, it's all a little insane>

Breakin' loose, breakin' the chain
You never know what the future will bring
Breakin' loose, breakin' the spell
I tried a part, now I'm playin' it well

Professional man, had the world in his hands
He arrived in the finest cars
He posted up his lifetime success
Every night at his favorite bar
He got off the track, he never looked back
He's an upper class renegade
Now he ain't got a dime, just his peace of mind
And he knows that he's got it made

Breakin' loose, breakin' the chain
You never know what the future will bring
Breakin' loose, breakin' the spell
I tried a part, now I'm playin' it well
Breakin' loose, emotional bruise
That's enough, It's time to go through
Breakin' loose, cut the line
It don't matter what your money can buy

Breakin' loose, breakin' the chain
You never know what the future will bring
Breakin' loose, breakin' the spell

Breakin' loose, cut the line
It don't matter what your money can buy"

Why'd we wanna light such a flame
Ain't no way to stay warm at the fire

Worked out some problems
Nearly drove myself crazy with things I can't change
But all that's history little darlin'

Why'd we wanna cry such a river
Why'd we wanna sswim that distant shores
There ain't nothing to see in the light
Of burning bridges

I'm thinkin' that we could start over
But rebuilding bridges takes time
Time to heal time to forgive
Let live and forget

So much water's gone over the bridge so much water

Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain Lightning - out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain Lightning - heavens above
Another day older still searching for love
Chain Lightning - too hot to fight
And it's hotter than Hell in Heaven, tonight

I was living hard - I was feeling down and lonely
When toward the boulevard a limousine moved slowly
Then I noticed in the back seat a lady wrapped in fur
Her eyes burned through me and mine stared back at her
And I recognized the moment as I opened up her door
I knew I would regret it - but I've been burned before

Chain Lightning - too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain Lightning - out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain Lightning - heavens above
Another day older still searching for love
Chain Lightning - too hot to fight
And it's hotter than Hell in Heaven, tonight

And, Lord, it's so hot when a chain reaction is set up with a kiss
And it's so tough when the satisfaction is greater than the risk
When you look in her eyes and you realize this time you can't resist

It's Chain Lightning

And the magic of the moment exploded with desire
When the time is right the sparks ignite to set the night on fire

Hot on the heels of a Saturday night

Chattahoochee, found my home

Who's to say who's crazy, it's easy to see
All you gotta do is turn on your T.V.
All the people on the outside tryin' to be someone else
I'm havin' fun here just bein' myself

In Chattahoochee

They brought me here and said
""You're so dangerous to youself""
But I ain't the one here 'bout to blow us all to hell
Just here to have a good time, let me know how it goes

Don't have to worry, the Doctor's always in
I'd rather be here with all of my friends

In Chattahoochee, I'm not crazy
Chattahoochee, I'm just lazy
Chattahoochee, found my home
In Chattahoochee

The moment I walked in the room
There's this tall, dark woman who's dancin' alone
And she makes me wanna howl at the moon.
Is this a dream, or is it that I've been here before?
Takin' my mind, takin' her time, takin' control. Don't you know?

[Chorus:]
That Deja' Voodoo, New Orleans hoodoo
She's got a mojo from hell
That spell I'm under, sometimes I wonder if she's
Witch, queen, or madamoiselle
If Kama Sutra's too hot to suit ya
Well, you're not her kind of man
That Deja' Voodoo- I will if you do
It's Deja' Vu all over again.

She takes my hand and she whispers to me
And says heaven's just beyond the door
She lights the fire and makes it all come to me
By tomorrow I'll be down on the floor.
Is it a dream, or is it that I've been here before?
Takin my mind, takin her time, takin' control. More and more?

The feelins won't let me go.

When pride seems to stand in your way
And the blues is your only companion, walking these streets in the rain.

Feels like I'm so far from home.

It pierces the soul.

Three songs for a quarter each time I open my case
Four chords and the voice of a good man fallen from grace
No pity for me mister, I'm proud to be a drifter
A long shot from bein' a star

For me and my Homeless Guitar.

Now I know how it feels to be judged in a glance
Stripped of your pride and your passion.
I only know that the rivers of the soul
Run deeper than birthright or fashion.
I see you look me over, feel the weight of your stare
I'm sendin' you a message but you act like you don't care.
I see a ripple, a crack in your facade
You know, it really don't matter who you think you are

Hot抣anta, I think I prefer your nights
With your cosmopolitan caf? Women
How they do go on and on
Down in Hot抣anta

In a fuselage in a crowded sky
I was trying very hard not to think
But in a paranoid vision of the worst that could happen
I asked my stewardess ""Just one more drink""

The cabin temperature had me in a blur
I was shaking by the time we touched down
We hit that tarmac
Hell bent for Mary Mac抯
Back in your sizzlin? Town

Every Little whisper, every little sigh
Everything about you gets me high.
Each and every movement, every single glance
Leaves me aching, aching for the chance.

Cause it's hard when you're with me
I've been hurtin' so long.

Never been an angel, never been a saint
Never been nothin that I ain't
Guess I always moved on, never took the blame
Stayin' one step ahead of the pain
And you shook me, rattled me right down to my soul

Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't
Sometimes your will tells me you won't
Can't put you off with just a shrug
Cause when you're gone it hurts like love.

Without a leg to stand on, without a reason why
I'm crazy for your love, no place to hide
Looking for a reason to leave it all behind
I'm hurtin for your heartbeat next to mine
Now you shook me rattled me down to my soul

I can't slow down, you are my drug
Your every breath is in my blood
Can't put you off with just a shrug
Cause when it's good, it hurts like love

I felt the danger to my heart, knew you were trouble from the start
Your lovin took me down so hard I caved in like a house of cards

Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't
Sometimes your will tells me you won't
Can't put you off with just a shrug
Cause when you're gone it hurts like love

I can't slow down, you are my drug
You're every breath is in my blood
Been holdin back this fatal flood
When the pressure breaks it hurts like love.

Just to stand here in my place

Feel so cold deep inside
Still it's hard to explain, oh

Have you closed the door on love
Can you be so blind
Did you think I'd just give up

Count my mistakes and the heartaches

From our first embrace
We were hungry for more

And when you hear that old song
Do you ever stop thinkin' about the love we made

Cause we're all in this together

And if our mission's to be true
It's got to start with me and you... So

For our children, no more killin
For all Man, take a stand

Jam on!
Together we can change the world...

It's a cryin' sound
When intolerance and hatred break the silence in our soul
Where tears soak the ground, a flower grows
To prove that love's the power that still connects us all

And if confusion rules the day
Just got to find a different way

Go and chance it for the planet
No time for, don't need war
For our children, no more killin
For all Man, give a damn
If you think you can change the world

Together we can change the world...

If we come together for one thing
One cause, one song we can all sing
If wounds can be healed with a joyful sound

Ready to fight son in the worst way

When I pulled into a jiffy the other day
Just to get some gas

Jumped in my car and took off fast

In the emptiness of the night, when you never feel satisfied.

Must be the reason why this place was shakin? Br> Down in the barroom it was
Loaded with servicemen
Elbow to elbow
I said: ""Scuze me blood,
Just what is shakin? ""
He say, ""Girls on the dance floor
Wrestling in jello""
And the joint was jammin? Br> From the pumpin? By the D. J.
They were rappin? And clappin?
When up steps Little Sheba

Chorus:

Little Sheba she抯 as tough as you find
She抯 the local color burnin? Like a Florida Pine
They raise the girls on gator down here
Doncha know
Little sheba she抯 the favorite one
Everybody抯 got money on her 9 to 1
They raise the girls on gator down here
Doncha know

Into the ring steps her worthy opponent
A nasty little vixen with a New York vibe
Before Little Sheba could say,
""Welcome to Dixie""
She抎 kick all her buttons
And punched out her headlights
And the crowd was reelin?
They were chomping and chanting
They can抰 believe what they抮e seein? Br> Didn抰 look good for Little Sheba

Chorus

Now to make a long story
Just a little bit longer
Little Sheba was humbled on that humid night
She returned from emergency
With a fistfull of fractures
Our fabled femme fatale
Spoilin? For another fight

It lifts you up when it's all too much
We can join the numbers, we can call it quits
Or tough it out
Make some sense of it.

Remember how it was when we began
Young lovers taking on the world
If there's a place for us to start again
I believe it's time to take the turn.

But loves a joy that can't be rushed
It lifts you up when it's all too much
We can talk it over, we can call it quits

Make some sense of it.

With every moment passing by
Were just wastin time
When we're not together
This is the first day of our life
When we're here today, we're livin without

How that first love made our hearts
So crazy when...
All those summer nights together...
When every touch between us
Brought a lightning flash in the dark.

Baby won't you wait, just a minute now,
Before you go, turning away
Don't you know, what the two of us
Might just throw away
'Cause we got tonight
And the same old feeling again.

Don't say no,
Though it's a game we never win.
We always ran against the wind.
The love we made yesterday,
Leads every move we make.
And it takes us back to
The same old feeling again.

I don't care
Where you've been without me,
No looking back no questions asked
Oh, it's in the past.
You know good love don't give up easy.
And nothing can change it,
What love is meant to last.

And we got the night
And the same old feeling again.
Don't say no,
Though it's a game we never win.
We always ran against the wind.
Love we made yesterday,
Leads every move we make
And it takes us back to
The same old feeling again.

Baby, won't you wait, just a minute now,
Before you go turning away.
Don't you know what the two of us
Might just throw away?
So let's just float away...
Into the night
And that same old feeling again.
Don't say no,
Though it's a game we never win.

Leads every move we make.
And it takes us back to

I was alone, a single beam of light
One glance and you changed my blues
To a prism of light, a thousand hues.
Now, I must climb to the rainbows arc
Who knows, I might find a halo for your heart.
Whenever I'm lost for words
And my whole world's fallin' apart.....

You are my Saving Grace
You are the light of a love everlasting
I find a hiding place in your arms
My one and only Saving Grace.

I fought the world with a restless heart
Kept my emotions locked away in the dark.
Then you came to build me up
When this world could only tear me apart....

Don't say it's over I just can't say goodbye

Why can't you forget about, forget the past

38 Special,Sheriff's County Line,/3/38+special/sheriffs+county+line_10202656.html,"(Jim Peterik-Don Barnes-Donnie Vanzant-Johnny Vanzant)

In a place called Sheriff's County
There's a story goin' round
And it echoes through the swamps of fla
About the sheriff and his daughter
That he guarded with his life
With a shotgun just to keep those wolves at bay

But she was a fire beyond control
No chains could hold her captive soul

Now the legend grows as days unwind
About passions strong and justice blind
To the reckless deeds that hide behind
The Sheriff's County Line

Now the sheriff had a deputy that he treated like a son
But he warned Calhoun not to see Estelle
'Cause he knew that she was trouble
Had her mama's wild side
And if he slipped he'd make his life a living hell

But flesh is weak and passion's strong
There in the backwoods around dawn
They say it was a murder in the first degree
When the sheriff caught them in the heat
Just one shot killed the deputy
On the Sheriff's County Line

One step closer to midnight
Sittin' there just waitin' to die
The young preacher asks if he's ready
To make his peace and speak his mind
He said ""Blood is thicker than water""
And my temper must've got out of hand
And just before they threw the switch on Old Sparky
He said ""I'd do it all over, Do it all over again""

Now Estelle is softly crying at the foot of her daddy's grave
As the preacher reads the bible verse out loud
You could see her eyes a wanderin'
As he turns another page
And she pulls him ever gently from the crowd

She tells him,
Oh she feels so all alone
And begs him to walk her safely home

And the madness starts all over again
Calhoun's curse is the preacher's end
Cause the forbidden fruit is the sweetest sin
On the Sheriff's County Line"

You sold my house, you wrecked my car,
And you keep telling me lies.
I'm gonna tell y'all the plain old truth
And I hope it's help you in time.

I'm gonna tell everybody
Make sure you got your woman's love.
I'll tell everybody
That a woman needs a man to love.

Can't you see what you're doin' to me?
Girl you got to change your ways.
I can't stand this running around.
Lord I got to find me a way.

Oh dreams are dreams, and love is love,
And that's the way that I feel.
If I'm gonna find a woman to love,
I gotta make her see what is real.

I'm gonna tell everybody
Make sure you got your woman's love.
I'll tell everybody
That a woman needs a man to love.
Yes she does.

Now she's gone and I'm on my way
To find me a better life.
No more time to settle down,
I just got to find out what it's like.
Life is real and time is right
For us to see how it is.
If you're lookin' for a woman to love
Make sure she's yours and not his.
I'm gonna tell everybody
Make sure you got your woman's love.
I'll tell everybody
That a woman needs a man to love.
Yes she does."

From the love that I've lost.

Time has changed me, I hope you'll see.
Another way to bring your love to me

Even now lookin' back on my past
Could have loved you, could of made it last.

And you tried to stay and take it somehow

Don't let it get to you

Carry the weight of the world

It's how we act here today
It's all in the play on the stage

Hey look at you now, you smile but I see you hurt
You can't hide that from me
You tell me you know
But that's not the way things have to go
When love breaks you down

Don't let it get to you
There's no real reason to
Carry the weight of the world

In moonlight and silver twine
If we make a wish

Needs a little help along the way

By letting it all slip away

Sorry but I'm not at home
The cute voice the sexy sell

I trip on my tongue I mumble and such

Would it hurt to stay in touch
Ain't gonna play I'm gonna lose it either way yea yea
Ain't gonna play no way my friend you win

Now you got me where you want me
Now you definitely got me
Now you got me where you want me
Now you definitely got me
Got up and headed downtown
Lookin' for some superficial action
Didn't really wanna mess around
Just felt kinda lonely
I walked through the door of our usual haunt
Liked to pop my eyes
There you were on the dance floor
Shimmying with some other guy
Ain't gonna play
I'm gonna lose it either way yea yea
Ain't gonna play no way my friend you win

Now you definitely got me
Now you got me where you want me

Holdin' on like a thread to a needle

Knocked down like a boxer in trouble
No denying it ain't gonna try and hide the truth
You definitely got me

It don't care who you are
You know you're marked for life
With your empty heart.

You've been far too alone for too many nights, oh
Someday, someway, somewhere, love is gonna find you
Somehow, someone is gonna beg you to stay
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away

I hear it whispered in the neighborhood
At one time you were the best, it was just understood
Then someone came and took you for a fool
The word is out on the street that love is looking for you

So open up your eyes to the light
You've been far too alone for too many nights, oh
Someday, someway, somewhere, love is gonna find you
Somehow, somewhere, don't look now, I'm comin' up behind you

So don't be fooled, you got me comin'
I ain't no fool, you keep me runnin'

No, I don't know why

Won't you tell me why
Don't you tell me goodbye, oh

They don't mean a thing.

That's your only game.

Was all in being cool.

With no right to be free.

I earned all my stripes like A-Rod, worth 25 mill
That's a whole lot of money, man somebody get killed
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners
We need us a doctor, for drinkinl the vodka
That piña colada, I might shit a lobster
I just said that shit with my eyes closed
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded
Cui nigga, watch I get to it
Cui nigga, the chopper under influence
Now watch how I limp to the bank, dreads hanging under my A hat
If I got sucked by a teller I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead
A1 nigga from the south side, I need a spot light
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike
Take her the to the room after dinner, and fuck her like it's prom night

When I get that check, I'ma call Madonna
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes

Birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that louie store

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl
When I die, bury me inside the gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the louie store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl

[Verse 1: 2 chainz]
She got a big booty so I call her big booty
Scrr scrr, wrists moving, cookin' to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a? I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, hold his tech
Extendo, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer, goin' on a trapathon
See I done have more bars than pakistan
Bomb, bomb, and a bomb
She?, I'm borin' you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the truey store
True to my religion, true everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to 2 bitches

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: kanye west]
Ah, yeezy yeezy how you doing huh?
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh?
She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T. V on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a menaj
'Specially if you put that bmw in the garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Weren't you at niece's graduation? Man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, ""do better""
She said, ""how 'bout I get you jewelry from the weston?""
How 'bout she hit the west end and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit
We in kanye west's benz, cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the mercy)
Tell the dj play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it good, get it good, get it get it good
I might switch it up and get you good

2 Chainz,Black Unicorn,/2/2+chainz/black+unicorn_21067593.html,"[Intro: Sunni Patterson]
And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said that ""The best thing you can do and be is you
This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due""
Ain't that the truth
And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah!
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm selling coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade

[Hook:]
[?] is all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practised rapping [?] I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze
Dad kept this in the dungarees, I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got [?]
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them [?] jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this, underscore, it's just me and [?]
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me

(Verse 1:)
What goes up must come down
And if I stay down, then I don't come up
Life a bitch, I got my had on the but,
Foot on the clutch
On my new wonder, smokin' a blunt.
Tired of all sililaquez, service squeeze
Still use a triple B for insominity
And please, if bein' broke is your disease
I took a test and passed and nigga I'm clean.
Promethazine poured in the 2 liter
Got my gorillas with me, and I'm the zookeeper
See, you ain't seen it all until you've seen it all
If life a movie you never know when it might pause.

Two hundred puppies and they all mine
Two million dollars worth of diamonds there

All animated but it's me, yeah
So I smoked a bong with a reindeer
Gave me the key to the city
And zapped me back kinda quickly
Mama on stage, sippin' champagne

When your dreams turn to nightmares
Transactions turn to Nike Airs
Went to Greenbriar Mall and bought five pairs
I stayed in the Creek, junkies used to preach
In the dope game, tryna reach my peak and go undefeated
I pleaded with the judge, this my first offense
High school b-ball, I'm tryna get a scholarship
No ACC, SEC, ClayCo APD
On a bumpy road like an ATV, EBT
Used to give me peace
I smile on the outside, inside discreet
As far as the past, wish I could press delete
Let my dogs off the leash
Rather buy it than lease or get murdered in the streets, fine line

Somebody shot his son, he didn't make it
My head achin', hands started shakin'
Foul beyond flagrant
He said, ""Bro, what I'm supposed to do?""
I paused, remorseful
We been partners since public school
Kids ain't supposed to die before us
As a parent, it's apparent, ain't no parents
Seeing stops once we leave the carriage
Cold of the streets react with the heat to create balance
One of the biggest revenge is prayer
Me, Sean, Dre, and Chris was there
Guess Flesh won't spend Christmas there
But in spirit, know you hearin' it loud and clear
Whole family miss you as we stare off in the atmosphere
No fear

Hey, I don't know need to hear this
Dead lies, that is how we livin'

Just let 'em all be forgiven
If you're doin' somethin' to make your parents have to bury you
You may want to slow down
Everything got a consequence, whether good or bad
Rest in Peace Shaylin
Bigg, I love you, bruh
You know what I'm sayin'?
My other partner lost his son too, right before the 18th birthday
We out here bullshit, for what?
Pray for my soul
You don't get another life
This ain't no practice life
Pray for my sins
These tears that I'm crying, let them all be forgiven
Let them all be forgiven
That's it, that's it

In all his majesty and might, his brilliance and his beauty
His black and his blue
""Boy,"" still slips from their lips when they address him
Still linger in the velvet of his dreams, the scene unseen
Black boy fightin' for manhood in a world that still sees through Jim Crow lens
Oh, them love him in his place
Separate, away, torn, disconnected, passive, submissive, and shufflin'
Oh, now just turn that shufflin' into dancin'

And singin' and ballin'
You know them love black boys' strength

Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you’re riding on your skateboard
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib
Man fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Outro:]
Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3
Right now it's me time
A little time for myself, me time
Oh yeah, right now it's me time
Don't want no one else now, me time
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone
Please, please don't stop by my home
No, no cause I feel it's just matter of time
Till you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind
Right now it's me time
You need to go kick rocks now
Me time"

That’s beside the point like a shooting guard, I'm moving forward
Had aspirations of college ball, I done it all
Back on the wall, I'm so appalled, I’m gonna brawl
My fashion sense commenced when I was young
Wore guns in dungarees next to a pack of gum
Unfit mothers that's on that butter, concrete gutter
Wanna hear that gun talk, that Draco stutter
This the life I chose, and it chose me back
They threw me out to the wolves, the wolves threw me back
Got no compassion for rats

I'm like a fortune teller, Orson Weller

Dear rap game, you are I'll homie
Havin me thinking we were gon' make some real money
Came from the streets, I'm a beast, capiche?
Lock my dick in the mail by the bills held

The way I'm murking these niggaz hope your will comin'
And when you're numb, it's kind of hard to feel somethin'

It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest
Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments
Bank roll was all we ever needed
While niggaz was weeded, playing space, and pumping crack in the ceiling
Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park
Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah who cares who you are
I'm honest, I make you cry like onions
Stay in your lane, beat the name and we done
I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it
Go ask the Rocky Glass, ""I class act?""

So many watches, I need a time capsule
Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel
In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle
I'm raw, using all caps
I got A on my ballcaps
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around
Yellow tape, never hesitate
2 Chainz derived from Section 8
Meditate, that's my stress relief
I've been stylin' on 'em, since a lease, preach

It will, it will

My pop' told me men don't cry
Then he turned around and died on me
So I didn't know what else to do
But motherfuckin' cry, homie
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me, I got more to see, more to be
Order three, started with a quarter ki'
I'm so ill I need penicill'
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will
And these days you can't tell who is really real
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Streets love a nigga, got a D-boy membership
We do it from the heart, I hope the aunt will remember this
Coke on all sinisters, cold but no fridge in this
No to all witnesses, lie or die infamous
My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship
Dealer what's the business? Don't call [?]
Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some benjamins
Niggas say a lie on their way to the top
But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops
I guess that's sayin' a lot
But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Death over dynasty, I'm talkin' major, not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'
Your niggas got rich, but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself
I'm scramblin', still hard to hold the tears back
Never saw what I became, can't get them years back
Death before dishonor

23 and I'm still livin',
Been all around the world and it's still Richmond
Because I'm loyal to my soil, good to my hood like oil,
Got me in that water, let it boil

Consider your bitch my employ'
Real to the core, straight up I never been fraud,

I give you something to see when you are looking this way
If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K

On medication, I can drink 200 a day
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling

Take a girl, it'll start spoiling

Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles, pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill, X-file
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
Mama see the baby, this is karmasutra
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past, nevermind that
I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass
And you must rewind that if you don't get it
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin

Gotta meet with my connect later on down in mallycomb
All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
Weed man coming with a half a zip
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick

Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit

[Verse 2]
I remember when I believed in me
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking herse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Kisha's name
In Jesus's name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh

[Verse 3]
I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big cause he younger than me
But he big, he was the high school team captain
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This shit forgot to call him on his birthday
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle
A partner lockdown, got a phone and an ipod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's march
We had similar stars
But I ain't figured his part
They had dough and we didn't
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture"

Imposed upon a taxpayer by a governmental organization
In order to fund various public expenditures
A failure to pay, along with evasion
Or resistance to taxation
Is punishable by law

You make over five hundred thousand a year
Sam want thirty-seven percent of that
Which is almost forty percent
Which is almost fifty percent
I remember, I been in the game a long time so I knew a lot of people, you know
Prior to bein'... Prior to the fans really realizin' who I was, and...
And one day, I told, I told Puff, I said...
You know, that's when I first started gettin' some money, I'm like
""They want me to pay like two million in taxes""

Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed but the high stay the same
Prices go up but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin’ in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin’ on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights so I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp, I smoke so much hemp
The world too small it feel like 4 walls
You see I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin, but I still took ‘em and nigga we made it
T roll that killer, weed up in the swisher, and make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin, they cry for help we get ‘em a hanky
Ain’t nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin’, the bitches we bangin’, the cinnamon danish
The pen is suspending, shit is restraining
It is a shame but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes, or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I’m maintaining
Real gangsta shit it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, 2 languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
Oh my god, it’s raining men
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
I send hella cash to the bank I’m with
What you do it for if it ain’t for this
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances

Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yea, lobster rolls for an appetizer

Codeines, Xanax and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils

My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune 2 loose screws
2 parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck

I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”

Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador
Looked at the top of my car, like what this lighter for?
I told him I was puttin’ girls up in the mornin’

Allstate, accident forgiveness
Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant
Doing a drive-by while you playin' different
This that Me Time at the finest
You won't beat me or see me whinin'

That money coming, trying to stack it enormous
You niggas pussy, fucking rat on your homies

I got some bitches here from California
Got on my chains, I'm lookin like a dope boy
These niggas don't want it, I put that on [?]
My chain into 100, my belt Feragamo
Go to la, meet the plug in the Quintanas
I'm still the king of my city and they know it

Never ran, we the fam, and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin'
One thing about it, got a problem? I've got the same one

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She said ''oh, you got that comeback'', she said my dick is a necessity
Drop my drawers, and pull out my longevity
She just hop on it, and then she forget everything
Oh she so open, who’s obsessed with me, when she leave me, she come back like she ain’t never leave
She talk bad about my new bitch, cause we got chemistry
She said ''it ain't jealousy'', allegedly
I thought you weren’t fucking with me no more
Girl, what happened?, you act like you don’t miss me , oh my god you suck at acting
I am like I thought you don’t fuck with me no more, girl I’m laughing
She said, she get real, when that vibrator out of batteries
She be talking about how she moving on with her life, she tired of my shit and she can do better
She told herself; she ain’t fucking with me no more
She lied to herself, she'll lie to who whatever
Talking about, she seen me with such and such
I say it’s nothin', just fuck and duck
She said ''yeah, right, nigga, what I look like?''
I said ''just like my next daughter''
So she said ''ohh, you make me sick
I love you, I hate you, I’m leaving, I’m lying
Cause none of them niggas, can never be you, they can never be you, though I don’t know why''
If she’s over me, I look up to the sky, I see her falling for me like a bomb
She said ''I know you'll miss me when I’m gone''
I just co­sign and we make up for lost time

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]

Quit lying to yourself, retrace all ya steps
Fucking with them suckers, they gonna have ya playing with yaself
I’m a smooth operator; you don’t need a vibrator
Licking everything below, the navel, cause I’m able
Ball so muhfuckin' hard, tape my ankle
Ball so muhfuckin' hard , check my bankroll
First talkin' bout you don't fuck with a nigga, go outta town like you done with a nigga
Really ain't much, she ain't done with a nigga
Shots, straight liquor, make a nigga wanna lick it
I put the ''ex'' in the exceptional, put the ''ex'' in the extra­ho
I put the ''X'' in X and O
I got the game in professional, yeah
My dick is the antidote
She like me on top like an antelope
That time that I smoked with ya bestfriend
I wanted ta fuck ya’ll on the patio
You miss when I kiss on your ear-ring
You miss when I kiss on your clit ring
Thats why I put you in this 16

Woo! They said be all you can be!

Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock

I ain't gettin' my hands dirty
Let you worry 'bout serving them 

Ya! They said be all you can be nigga!

Ya! They said be all you can be nigga!

Entrepenuer, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you hallelujah
Pour it on you hallelujah, pour it on you hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you'a
Red, white, blue'a, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's left overs I still gotta eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-poppin', her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew, to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

Woo! They said be all you can be

Pretty girls, my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top, escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'till I K.O
Eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll
Even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day and all night 
Like that shit's his mothafuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand in hand
When you got this paper hand in hand hand hand
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga na na na na na
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, 'cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

Woo! They said the truth set you free!

Woo! They said be all you can be 
Woo! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna be dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole

Poof! Just like that the whole check gone

So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun game, all black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in a tonic
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was similac
I'm from where they send sharks then we send 'em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the guns, where the love at

I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch

I got the chopper for the correspondence
The codeine got me standin' horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontas-es
And this shit is of the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, layin' with my seat back
We next, weed never left, holla, we back

You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That's all that took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
You beat around the bush
Like your scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don't think you understand fully
See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz's

Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eye balls, my insides crawl
and I clam up I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I've just been ripped
So I must then get, hope the bus didn't split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel the alone
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

[Eminem]
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be piegon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible, up on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
at Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm old, stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin on next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

8 miles and running, got my 7th album droppin'
And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs
But I can rewind the calendar back, back when it was now or nothin'
People said I would amount to nothin', that I had talent for nothin'
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by your gunmen
I could just hear the folks now, ""He got what he had coming""
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin'
Wantin' something, claimin' that they done something for him
Got their Jay-Z pom poms and their whole uniform
Claimin' they been runnin' and tellin' everybody like Martin Lawerence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claimin' that they threw it up before I threw it up
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up
Back on the block, gettin' it in, there wasn't no you with us

[Chorus: Jay-Z]

And my 8th album comin', feedin' a thousand growlin' stomachs, Free

6 miles and running in the Pontiac
Six thousand eighty six, trans might shift while the engine run
Anyone tell ya rider give me one more chance
Hear them smokers screamin' ""One more gram""
So I'ma bring 'em one
Homie, son, and my pop, stick close to my MOMMA
Keep toasters for DRAMA, mix a lot with my son
My son growin' and he learnin' a lot
That's when them toasters will the burners will pop, brain on ya own
Well a nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like the biblical scripture
Look back, turn assault like the sin is in
Most of ya heartless and self-centered like ""Me Shaq and me Shaq""
Set up ya brother cuz you jealous nigga
The heat back, like you never left
I ever rep, cops watch every step
Six miles and running dodgin' every trap
The rap gingerbread man, cheer us up
You precious breath, State P the second attack

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Back when nobody would found he had talent, nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but mommy blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothin' but love for me
When niggas would want me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm takin' all the industry's money
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Young is the illsest, Free is the future
Bean's and Bleek is right now, we can see our 8 miles nigga

Adrenaline rush before you leave motherfucker

When I speak I blow out your tweeters, a dog,
Show out in speakers roll out with heaters,
I'm just an animal eating the game,
Jumbo monkey, funky and obie's the name,
I rose solo, never been a hoe though,
Keep yak's vocal when cats act loco,
Where you at when I'm moving the crowd,
You get trampled, mashed on detroit style,
Up out your seats, pump out the E's,
Off the beat's the crowd overpleased,
Where my nigga's at smoking them tree's,
Off the cognac, finger fucking the ski's,
That's how it is when you party with me,
You don't like it, you L-7 like a square beat...

Yo, yo, since I came I rearrange the place with blaze,
Spays dope with coke-fevers DNA, I'm so addicted,
To gettin nigga's lifted, drunk off a liquid,
Obie Trice the misfit,
Douse'in the crowd with piss and voul's,
We underground motherfucker fix your frown's,
I beat the bore with a wisty tour,
Off a whisky you never been this deep before,
So throw up your hands and peep out your man's
When I come through next quarter trust it in you's,
And trust I'm attackin it,
I cook up the hot shit like Ainsley Harriot
That's why I'm so miraculous,
And hope to get you nigga's pumped up,
I see you next time I see him chump,
That's right, you go through Obie Trice fucked up,
on your knees drop for these...

Get live motherfucker when I speak motherfucker,
Out your seat motherfucker, I'm a reach motherfucker,

You had one hot single, but then your album sounds wack

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin how? Everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, plow!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
No he won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke

Lonely roads, God only knows

He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family

And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna

Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail

Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not

Seminars and tracks, hors, comas, and cardiacs
Broads and cats screaming ""Oh my God he's back""
Just imagine, I hit the lab and get it crackin'
A thousand styles in one verse, rhythms will switch patterns
Chicks get stabbed in the back, till they get spasms
Known to spit a magnum, or split an atom
Who woulda known that Jesus would come back to the ghetto
On that level, and that thorough, like a black hero
And pack metal, so rap rebels, will back pedal
The pharaoh of five boroughs, and take over the rap world
Gettin' bizarre, hardcore, this is for y'all

And learn ta, make this dough, where gangstas roll
Think like the late great Capone when the bank is closed
It's cats that claim they bold, but they ain't this cold
I'm from New York City even pretty chicks act up
niggas get clapped up, you stack up, they stick that up
Put the strap up, you think my name was ""Kid back up""
Big niggas (spittin' noise) pick that up, or lift that up
Raised by gangstas and gamblers, hustlers, con artists
And convicts, killers and dons
Drug dealers, playas and pimps, smooth talkers
Stick up kids, thugs, real niggas and gods
Haunted by every soul that lay dead in the turf
Close by every spirit, that never made it to birth
Since the Moon separated from Earth
That's why they say I'm the greatest that ever orchestrated a verse

To a soul slap, a smoke a track, how dope is that

That know rap before they turned coke to crack
To my dogs hearin' sirens on and firearms
Outcome die in wars or behind iron bars
The boulevard, tire frauds when I evolve
Try and rob, my dialogue, I am God
Chicks moan just to get next to my throne
And sniff my cologne and get Ra alone
s** spot's at home, I'm testosterone
Caress spots, stress drops, bedrock's the bone

You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school,

You made me crazy
You should a slayed me as a baby
Behavin shadier than Wes Craven
And you aint even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin a nigga down daily
You face me drunk of sober
You'll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass
Your neck will get snapped wit bear hands fuck music
Is he rappin is cool but fool don't confuse it
What happens these dudes get rude and then I lose it
I'm scantlas
I blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger
Then Godzilla's back nigga
You are not real and in fact
Your fruity effect of a crack dealer
Yall president sends me smack
Den got a mack 10 wit it
So I aint gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that
Don't mistaken me black
Or you be stankin in back of a fuckin caddillac

Cause I aint said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the white house is wiped out
When I see that lil Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out bitch adios goodnight (Blow!)

Think for a minute cause the hype has died down
That I wont go up in the oval office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down

Tell that C. Doloris Tucker s*** to suck a dick
Mutha fucker duck what the fuck son of a bitch
Take away my gun and I'm a tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switch blade with a lil switch to switch blades
Switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade

You think you can mess around and fool around but not in my tribe

Every bling on me is real
B, just flee
I'll leave you dead on the seen
Cut out your insides
And split your spleen
It will be the worst crime
Ever since you were thirteen
I beet you can't even read
I'm the king with the baggy pants
I've got the coolest shoes and the coolest hats
You see me thug now
You see me thug not
You see me fall down
Because I got shot
I've been prayin
That I won't get shot again
But it happened today
Those punk asses are goin to pay
No one shoots me and then gets away
You need to follow along

Tryin to break out of the cage

Dig my teeth into your chest
Don't worry, you'l go to a happy place
Cuddled up in heavens nest
No one lives forever

Now whose turn is it to die
Hopefully not mine

Act like I'm at the wrong age
But don't think I wont kill you
Kill you and your friend too

Everything goes the same way

Instead I always try to swallow it
Instead of staring at this wall and shit
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit
Can't call it shit, all I know is i'll hit the wall

I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feeling at that time
Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Just sometimes, its always me

The clock stikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper

Of this shit off my chest, again, stuck in this slump
Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped
But wait here comes something
Nope, its not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up and throw that shit out
I'm fizzling now thought I had figured it out
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade
Sign that i'll spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, jimmy smith aint a quitter
I'm a sit here till I get enough
For me to finally hit a fucking boiling point
Put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed
An mc's worst dream I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain linked fence
By the looks of 'em you would swear jaws was commin'
By the scream of 'em you would swear I'm sawing someone
By the way they running you would swear the law was commin
Its now or never and tonight it's all or nothing
Momma, jimmy keep leaving on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, i'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race
And I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face

No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congresses
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope there's a spark
But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive

You shouldn't take lyrics so serious
It might be confusing
Trying to seperate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it?
I get sick of trying to explain it

Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin' constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution

8 Mile,The Lunch Truck,/8/8+mile/the+lunch+truck_20646274.html,"[Vanessa]
Man I'm so sick and tired of fucking with this steel.
They only give us 30 minutes to eat lunch and chill.
My body achin just to get a buck.
I'm sick of eating this shit off this fucking lunch truck.
Nasty ass food. I'm in a nasty ass mood.
I should've called in sick.
Shit, I had something to do.

[Mike]
I can't believe I'm hearing all this ravin and rantin.
From Vanessa up in here at the New Detroit stampin.
You need to get your food and take your ass back to work.
Your dreamin if you think them corny ass raps will work.
Look at ya'll freezin out here like dumb fucks,
Rappin away for food off this ragedy lunch truck.
Who want what? Who pumped up? To get rolled up.
I spit venom in every direction, soak some up.
Look at this fat ass nigga, sloppy sucker.
You an ugly mother fucker
Your pop should've wore a rubber.
Stop rhymin keep your day job Vanessa.
Next time leave that bull shit home on the dresser.
Speaking of dresses take a look at Paul the fruitcake.
When you travel you probly pack panties in your suitcase.
Made out of lace from Victoria's secret.
If 10 men came in a cup you'd probly drink it.

[B-Rabbit]
Ok folks enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo
This guys a doo doo.
You've worked here longer then me
And I get paid more then you do.
Dawg, take a seat.
Wut's this guy standing in line for? He ain't got money to eat.
Check this out yo yo.
This guy cashed his whole pay check and bought 1 ho ho.
Fucking homo little maggot.
You can't hack it.
Paul's gay... Your a faggot.
At least he admits it. Don't even risk it.
This guys starvin to death someone get him a biscuit!
I don't know what they told you Mike...
You must had them comrolls rolled too tight.
This job you wanna quit but you can't.
You've worked at this plant so long... Your a plant.
Look at your god dam boots
For christ sakes they're starting to grow roots.
On this mic you get faded.
You look like a pissed off rapper who never made it.
Hey why you fucking with gay guy G?
When really your the one whos got the hiv.
Man I'm done with this clown its off.
Fuck it... I'll let home girl finish you off.

[Vanessa]
A guy like you would never get a read woman
You jackass go jack off
That's the only way you comin'..."
8 Mile,U Wanna Be Me,/8/8+mile/u+wanna+be+me_20805369.html,"Uhh, oh baby, baby, baby, keep it thug
And keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah

Now slowly, thinkin' of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fuckin' pitiful

First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you, hoe
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
'Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggaz too, ha

I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only

But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction

You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy
It's childish, should I have to resort to violence?
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album
And show you how to stay off my dick

That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans
No talent, you need direction, you a pussy with a yeast infection
You unlucky, I'm your fuckin' C-section

Plus I'm the last real nigga alive
Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high
Realize, how many classics I gave you
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only

But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction

You can't be me, I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
Why they tryin' to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line
Eating, alligators and hummingbird hearts
At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch

As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God Son, and I've come
From the God under pure peace to represent the streets

You'll see that my plan is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every mc reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative, what you made of junior?

'Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting

A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't cryin' laughin', to the lions, throw your ass in

What the fuck was you niggaz thinkin'?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin' that you comin' for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
Take me out, try try try, but you

Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only

But you wanna be me, you suckers, you weak
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day
But you wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson
Concernin' this mic profession, turn your direction, you can't be me"

If we get together, cop mansion, whip together
And if I slack up I get it together

Daytimes in the park we in a horse and carriage
Or let you push forces and karats
Don't take it as a gift, baby girl, if you my all you
Could have it
And (If I) could be that dude that you want in your
Life
And (If I) could put the future right in front of your
Eyes
And (If I) couldn't live after all that I say
Do you think that I'd go out of my way, answer that,

Talk with you, he don't do the things I do
Are for you, you know that my love is true
And I do anything you want me to come on

Is it him or is it me
Tell me what's it gonna be
Think it's time you deal straight up
Get real, it's now girl or never

Do he do his thing do he ever make you laugh
Do he ever make you smile make you feel proud
Make you wanna put yo hands up scream loud
Why you wanna keep a brotha like D waiting, anticipating
While he out on the street mad playa hatin'
He steady stating, that you and him will be together
I guarantee you go with him you'll fall like a feather

3Rd Storee,How Can This Be,/3/3rd+storee/how+can+this+be_20222188.html,"(Paul Allen, James Moss)

Verse I:
Ever since we were kids the love we had was real
Everything that we did we let each other know the deal
When we would walk to school we had each other's back
We were inseparable and strength where we would lack
B-section:
On that day when they called and let me know the news
I began to cry tears for you
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss
But there's an emptiness of the bliss that once existed
Chorus:
How can I tell her that I love her if she doesn't know me
How can I tell her what she means if she cannot dream
How can I show her that she's beautiful if she cannot see me
How does she know she makes me cry if she's not alive
Verse 2:
I remember people saying give them their flowers
While they yet live so they can see them
But you never think that day could ever come to hit you
Because the love you had was strong and invincible
B-section:
But remember God is the creator
And he has the power to shake her and take her
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss
There's an emptiness of the bliss that once existed
Chorus
Bridge:
Though I get lonely I know she's with me
Cause death can't take my special lady from me
God guide me along in Your will
Cause I know Heaven is real

Where love is highly esteemed
Taking a chance with my heart
Praying it travels far

Why would you dream if you could not live
Open your eyes see what is real
I'll take it from there now breathe if you will

You've ignited the flame in my life
Now I can see again
I celebrate that you are in my life
Now I can breathe again
Verse 2:
Roses are smiling at me
As if to say they share my glee
Violets then sigh as they gaze
As if they know that my day has been made
There she goes again tear in her eye
Whispering songs that make us cry
She says three words that make me feel
That I'm not in a dream and she's all so real

Knowing I love you is destiny
Finding that someone creates harmony
Keeping the same is matrimony

They told me to come clever, whatever,
It don't make, it's on you,
So I be who I be, and do what I gotta do,
I'm one of the few, the proud and the pimpish
In this business I be the swiftest when I kick this,
As if you didn't know it's Thorough from that Suave Camp,
Best Vemp chimped, or get licked like a mail stamp,
Amps and beats, technics is what I come with,
Gangsta's and pimps and balla's is who I fuck with...

(Mr. Mike)
Fuck nobody safe when I see demons in tha mirror,
Wicked as fuck feeling like a Murder & Killa,
Witness I'm on the defense like Johnny Cochran,
Now give up yo thangs mista, before this glock hit the proper spot,
Blocks on phones, they wont leave they homes, peeping through cracks
Cause blacks be coming back with all that past crap,
Strap on your bullit proof vest and combat boots
It's nigga nigga day!!,
And this time we go come on you,
Baby blue disguise that's wise,
Made me loose my 9-5 got myself a 4-5 I'm,
Aimless spraying not playing with their vertabrates,
These the Murda Dayz,
So many niggaz must come wicked,
We done heard of wayz........

(Eightball)
I see one, two, niggaz actin live,
3 seconds past before I blast with my 4-5,
6 shots, 7 cops, just to take 8ball,
9 witnesses reported all the shit the recalled,
Everlasting, blasting, niggaz running fast when,
Buckin gott'em ducking,
Putting sucka's in the past tense,
I be the holder of the gat therefore it shall not run,
A psychic couldn't see such a feature for my momma's son,
(Nigga) Breath taker, the overweight trouble maker,
Fake trick breaker, Tennessee earthquaker,
Shaking grounds when I'm walking smoking fat onion,
I get lit, and beat the shit out of Paul Bunyon,
Fightin, Clash of the Titans on your dial,
I'm gettin blitzed stickin on my tootsie doggystyle,
Word G, you heard me,
The wicked bitch served,
Now I'm playing soccer, gotta kick'em to da curb G,
But she's not with it, put a spell on the fat mack,
I hate stikin hoe's but I can't help but to go back,
I sound like a fiend, everytime is the last time,
Could this be reality or all in my mind?......

(Mr. Mike)
Spill 9's like fluid, do it like some G's
They know me from Columbian streets to Portugeese,
(nigga how you figga)
I got mo scratch than flea's,
I got mo gat's than these,
High powered sour nigga's,
Steady slangin crack to fiend's,
At ease, take a look at some black G's
Scopin the president, takin over residents like black kings,
Stack G's with phat key's,
Rats ease on your properties poppin me for my black jeans

(Thorough)
I had a cracker on my scope and my finger still itchin,
Visions of killing and then the strap start spittin, hittin,
The prez, plottin payback on the devil,
A rebel and a mason is what yall snakes facing,
Chasing traders with my data cause I hata should be corpe,
And peep game when it's being taught, or to picture this of us lyricists,
Seeing nigga'z taking shots and the same nigga'z getting hit,
Spit the gift and got fam like Gotti,
Hittin her like hobbies,
Killin everybody,
Let my head grip the bed and I check the time,
It's all a dream, I seen in my fuckin mind.....

(Mjg)
280 pounds of hay, every damn day I gotta test a,
25 lighters on my dressa', yes ah,
Breakfast being served by a hoe that look like Genie,
She press my every wish and keeps a tight ass bikini tini,
Tiny as a Barbie Doll summer set,
She all up in my house and I still aint hit that pussy yet,
I gives props to my butler, cause he know,
That I know on the downlow he's a chiefin muthafucka for ya,
Now as I flips through the calendar I spots the winter,
If it aint 3 mo freaky hoes wanna have dinner,
But I can't do it cause my schedule just to tight,
I just phoned, Quincy Jones said he needs my help tonight,
He wanted me to pick the strong from the wimps,
Them playa's with the limps to make a song called We Are The Pimps,
I call's Ball, Ball calls the crew,
We met up at the Penthouse, and Paris Round 2,
Do, you know the code to the fence, if you don't,
Then move on cause you aint got no home in this residence,
It's evident that I'm daydreaming high,
All the time ever last line all in my mind...."

Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme

[Hook x2: Eightball]
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho wanna kick it
Get down lick it, cuz I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy

[Chorus x2]

[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

[Chorus x4]

[MJG whispering x4]
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

8Ball & Mjg,Anotha Day In Tha Hood,/8/8ball+mjg/anotha+day+in+tha+hood_20584726.html,"[ verse 1: Eightball ]
Eightball the Fat Mac must express
While a nigga's gettin zooted from the potent-ass sess
Lookin back, damn, I was wild as a juvenile
Mama showed love and she struggled for her only child
But like my dad I was stuck in the streets
I never wanted to work hard, cause that shit ain't for me
Back then only 16, ignorant and curious
Mom's gettin ferious cause I wasn't serious
I said fuck school teachers and the church preachers
I wanted to hang with my niggas with the street sweepers
Back in the days sellin herbs on the [Name]
Me and Squeaky doin city-wide talent shows
Gettin dissed, gettin pissed cause of this shit
Cause it's so hard in this muthafuckin business
I said many times, ""Mama, I'ma make you proud""
But I could never leave the thug life of Orange Mound
I'm on the corner drinkin Thunderbird, slingin rocks
They in my hands cause the cops know 'bout the matchbox
But I can't sell dope, rappin is the way, gee
And this is just another day around the homies

[ verse 2: mjg ]
.. Mid day, I was deep into a sleep
Unconscious from that hate that they distribute on em streets
My world was constantly spinnin from the Remy that was in me
And we ain't half-stepped on them blunts, we chiefed up plenty
A penny to be earned in a day is what I'm looking for
Hopin for, some kind of way to make a little more ducats
Fuck it, shit that I just needed, I just stuck it
Up, hell, nigga might as well
Proceed to hustle like a p-i-m-p
Mj fuckin G
The nigga with the muthafuckin clout, no doubt
The pimps is in the muthafuckin house
Be up out [Name], black folk is takin over
You know how I know? Gimme the mic and I show ya
I teach ya, I reach ya with this pimpalistic knowledge
The shit a nigga learned back in Break-A-Bitch College
Started, to hustle at the age of 11
Started makin money when a nigga turned 12
Started to induldge at the age of 13
At 14 a nigga flatfoot was raisin hell
In the muthafuckin hood

[ verse 3: Eightball ]
So many rappers in this industry, I don't doubt
That it's a bunch of niggas broke with a cd out
It ain't new to me, cause me and mjg
Had to struggle just to hustle down in Tennessee
In Memphis, tryin to be a rapper
But rappin don't mean shit to Elvis Presley-lovin crackers
Plus I'm with a record label gankin me and fuckin me
Niggas always promsisin me shit that I will never see
Trick-buster always talkin 'bout we family
But while I was rappin he was snortin up my royalty
So I got smart, hit the streets and said fuck that
That's when this nigga named T Money heard our first track
Pack em up, move em out, straight down to Texas
Me and jg ridin drop-top Lexus
""Coming Out Hard"" on the charts in the 'Billboard'
Second album droppin and we waitin on our first award
Niggas talkin cause the crew ain't walkin no mo'
Them jealous busters tryin to start shit over hoes
I don't know what is worse, livin bad or livin good
But the whole world remind me of my neighborhood

[ verse 4: mjg ]
See, I'm a self-made hustler, trustin the
Niggas who think that two heads are better than one
And ready to get the job done, son
Mjg gots game in the street sale
That makes me get lifts in the studio
Even though it was kind of hard as far as I can see
Growin up in the Orange Mound Tennessee community
Could it be the future had love for a nigga who
Struggled through all type of shit for a bill or two?
Still I do shows for my fans cause my fans buy my tapes
And the tapes make my g's and the g's keeps me straight
And I hate when the busters smile all in my face like a hoe
And talk shit in the down low
Look out, punk, mutha-fucka, sucka, niggas
My finger's gettin tired of the trigger, dig a
Grave, shit, cause I don't want his boys to have to deal
With the smell of the trick I just killed
???? If you can't hang with the stress, best
Wipe the big 's' off your muthafuckin chest
Press issues, makin sure they fully understood
'bout a young nigga life in the muthafuckin hood"

Your family now, welcome to the Suave house

[Thorough]
Well I was broke down and out sitting at the house
Two blunts see wit the third blunt hanging out my mouth
Thinking bout how these no clout niggas feel they got cash
And guess a nigga want smooth
Get they ass, but pass me the mass and the mag (uh huh)
If I don't act bad like P jab you niggas should be glad
He had plush pads from coast to coast
Happy capping ass nigga who love to boast
So I post at the strip club, the trick site
Cause I know that's where he spend most of his nights
I'm right outside, when this fool gonna leave the spot
4: 30 in da morning we headed out the parking lot
Trailed him up the block made a left at the stop sign
Lame ass nigga rolling solo in a 9-9
At the red light I pulls up on the right
Put two up in his heart he's another armed robbery

[Gillie Da Kid]
Let's get this money run in the crib c*** your hammer
Nigga move then you pop your hammer
Shit is real, you react you get killed
Playboy this the deal
I want the dough, the bricks the keys to your whips
A nigga act fly you pop him in his thigh
Let him know that he can die nigga eye for eye
Where the stash nigga, Where your cash nigga
Suave house cut you from neck to ass nigga
Pulling out your heat but you scared to blast nigga
Fucking around wit me you be under grass nigga
Family, friends a thing of the past nigga
Defintely ain't the first and won't be the last nigga
Grab the bag put the duffle over the shoulder
Ran down the steps hopped into the rover
Hi speed chase fuck it take the shoulder
Suave house real niggas aint pulling over
What

I met this nigga in the streets talking plenty lip (lip)
Saying niggas who rap wit da Suave house they ain't shit (shit)
Never knew that was my fam, god damn he never knew
So I played the game strutting my ass had his brain blew (yo)
Never knew he was fucking wit a bitch from the streets (yo)
Never knew cause the thoughts of pussy had his brain weak (uh huh)
Never knew when he stopped for some rubbers at the store
Never knew bo was coming out busting the for fo (pow)
Shot him three times in the chest
Let him stinking in the lex
Took his jewerly, took his money, took his car, took his neck
I spit in his face you gets nothing wit me (nothing)
Somebody should have told you about fucking wit me
Lil daddy you thought you was getting some pussy quick huh
You just got fucked by the Suave house bitch
Lil daddy you thought you was getting some pussy quick huh
You just got fucked by the Suave house bitch (bitch)

[Big Duke]
Now I've be peeping at this motherfucka nigga for two weeks
He got two rocks and two keys, I got two glocks and two sheets
I'ma try my best to catch this nigga ass when he sleep
It's just me, bo in here smoking keel in the jeep
We just seen him in the club popping cris with some scrubs
Copped two bricks today from cous so we gonna have to git up
So I kicked the door in he had a hoe in fuck position
Must be knowing about me cause wasn't no type resistence
Told the bitch to shut the fuck up
Handcuffed her, boy must have wanted to fuck her cause he pulled out a rubber
I said no time for that smacked her wit the gat now we back on track
Git the G stack keep pack be quick or be splat
Start acting like retarded I'ma show you just how we act
Gonna do him just like tp just to make sure he don't be back
Cause these niggas from the galloroe known for leaving lame hoes
Riding deep in cruiseing boats flipping foes and pimping hoes

Whats the deal
Whats up with a nigga, Eightball up in this here

Historic hits, nigga like Ali's fist
Rock the world
Get freaked by a different bunch hot little girls
Speed it up, and let a real niggas see what ya got lil' girl
Got lil' doe, got something to blow
You wanna get like that, gimme head in the Benz
I love a chick that suck dick like that
Dirty, Southern gritty
Bouncin' through yo' city
2000 Rocketship sittin' on some chrome 20's
Choppin', collar poppin', platinum droppin'
Space Age 4 Eva means that we will not be stoppin' (Yea Yea)
Eightball, mjg, dj Quik collaboration across the nation
Hittin' licks, shawty me and my niggas so official with it
Poetic pimpin', ain't no playin' when we step up in it
Like this, go all out nigga don't be scared to bust
Futuristic, what you need to do is catch up with us

[Chorus x2: Eightball]
Bounce, Bounce
Man get up on you feet and help me get it
Crunk, Crunk
Everybody up in here let me see ya
Bounce, Bounce
If a nigga trippin we gone make them heaters
Buck, Buck
Dime pieces let me see you make that ass

[Mjg]
I'm a killer with the mic
Before I get buck with the gun
1-9-7-2 was the birth
Tell a nigga was the worst
You can't fuck with the one
Nigga take ya foot out ya mouth
Get ya ass off the couch
Mjg bringin the heat when Quik droppin' this beat
I know that ya'll can rap, but I'ma rock this beat
Breakin 'em off with dope seeds
The nigga with the most of this
Coast to coast to hit
Roll the shit, Broke the shit
Kept somkin'
Then put it down on tape again
I got a fifth of Hen
Fifth of Gin
A fifth for now
And a fifth for then
Takin my time
Take it down shot for shot
You ain't got Con-gac it's not the spine
I got a stack of hoes
Matter a fact a nigga smackin' hoes
Straight up mack them hoes
If you a platinum hoe, You gotta keep workin' the bitch
Don't stop and relax them hoes
A lot of niggas be claimin' to pimp
And a whole lot of pimpin' what a nigga be talkin' about
But when a bitch tell a nigga to spend some money
The mothafuckas still be walkin 'em out
Takin 'em home, givin 'em cheese, beggin 'em please
Talkin' about he'll take my ki's, big trick
See I was born to pimp for this shit
Mjg equipped for this shit
Ain't no niggas in here found time
Fake ass niggas is scared of my rhyme
Pimp tight, break a bitch quick
Futuristic niggas take shit

Rappin' niggas ain't no joke

With an mp and piano chords
Gettin' back to my evil ways
Lick him 3 times, he gone pay
Sidetrack, forgot your point
It's a 10 to 4 bet that you ain't gonna forget that
Get your peeps up off my cheese
Put your money in the pot, go squeeze
See the bright red dice just die
Shoot a whole meal, I might just try
18 thou with the jewelery on the floor
When I hit a lick don't flex no more
Gamblin', scramblin' tryin' to get up out the hood
Nothin' but scavengers and the bettin' ain't good
Show me where it's sunny at, where it's funny at
Hoes with the polished toes, I'm a money cat
Tip toe blow walkin' on a rift raft
Put that shit back in ya pocket I don't sniff that
I'm lookin for the bud, and the brew
And some X with a broad with some thug in her jewels
(Got Sex) 6 uniforms all on my back
I was gone chill to, they didn't peep that
Had to be something else to make them irate
Give a nigga a minute let me clean the slate
No, I ain't have s** with ya wife
No, I ain't make threats on ya life
Bitch, help me get my mind off this shit with an ounce
I don't wanna see, I wanna feel you

Not a trick on a stroll
Ya gotta pimp that thang and keep a trick on hold
Stay on top of the world, wit a gun in ya hand
Take control of a woman and fear no man
It be hard for me to see a day with outkast
If you got it and I don't I'll blast your ass, with the quickness
Because a pimp don't play
I got to work on top of my game and think of ways to get payed
Born in the Mound, down, deep in the south
With the brothers with the curls and gold teeth in they mouth
And the cheverolet impalas with the craters and vogues
Fo'teef, with the yak, smokin' fat mac indo
Fall up in the club with the pimps, the tone
Gotta tuck in my pants, ya step to me and it's on
Gotta family in Memphis, gotta gang in Texas
T-Money in the Jag and  jb in the Lexus

And one who tends to always keep his business undercover
But still I wind up in the middle of a click
Some I heard, he heard, she heard,
Should I continue to listen to the rumors, the garbage

Wait trick you missed, I hit darker, into the sleeper
Now you feeling weaker
Man don't slip when you think you got backup
Looking for some help but ya boys just slacked up
Punked out, backed out
Way low headin' to the front do'
Sneaking out real slow
How ya feel now?
What's wrong, what's the matter
Mama never told you not to play with those rappers
Mjg got loose in the 9 deuce
But for the 9 tre the pimps don't play way
I'ma stay true
Some of ya'll goin' tre
Some of ya'll i'ma lay
Some of ya'll i'ma hate
But see I'm in it to win it
Lining up for a party
Just to consider it a job, for me to come out, damn, hard

Cool, feed on the next brotha's greed
J-Smooth cuttin' up, lil' Hank gettin' buck
Killers be shootin' up suckas with no gut
I'm scoping big bucks, looking for the payoff
Living like a pimpster, checking everyday off
Riding through the hood with my homies gettin' smoked out
Fall up in the mall, let my hoe stro' loked out

(Anyway, it doesn't matter much how you feel,
you know what you got to do, I'm here to do it,
how about you?)

[E-40:]
Our age, five-years-old
we were young bucks
scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter would send you to bed
but she would make me stay up
so she could give the young playa some viscious head uh
early symptoms of
time of nightway
gigantic factor from the
Caukenis bitch tamer
some had it all though
but less unfortunate
you had an alloy spoke Mongoose
and I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
three different lunch pails
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together nigga
sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin nigga
that ain't even cool
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around,
and ripped bad
barking up on the wrong tree
talking about runnin up in my past

Niggas have hateful thoughts
but they stop me from strivin
suckas be shakin salt
all in his gameful so find
some fools be gettin crossed
victims of 40-ness
man all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or doggfood
they had these marks for Tre and Max
fuckin off my high breakin rules
you got ya P's mixed up
you ain't no pimp
you's a forty
I spit for major mix
while you make tapes for ya homie
and then you work up tha nerve
to speak fair words
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators
that's why I wrote this verse
for every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
and take a look at what these fakers call real
nigga

I trust no man,
cuz man will let you down every time
that's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme
cuz I've seen better times
and I've seen worser days
when some of my so called friends
wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
with righteous thoughts of mine
cuz righteous thought of mine will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
they come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
and ask god to distinguish friend from foe
and what do you know
by the time morning comes I can see the light
and then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right
he made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
countin' greens
straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings puttin it down like a mic or not
replace the slot open up shop
we 'bout to make it hot
Stop
with ya devilish doins
because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know

Listen
I'm tryin to tell you my nigga to watch cha back
and trust few
Cause ain't no nigga gon watch ya back for you like you
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust
see let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make
don't want no bustas around me
playa hatin or actin fake
don't ever be wantin nobody to get to close
I don't know if it's effects of
from the marijuana that got me more than trippin
see nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
but if my loot was gone would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
and smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
who is to say what a nigga will do
who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help you
see what I'm sayin, listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people recieve ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny because my moneys loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin you don't already know
personal business, you got to watch who you friends is

I'm thinking about hard times
freeing my mind
who in the fuck goin be my crutch?
Holdin me up, helpin me out
makin sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to?
When I be low on my cash
who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin bout kickin my ass?
Who is my friends who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
somethin about somethin but I don't know nothin
my ignorance be keepin me out in the cold
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride?
in somebody elses car
How do I get from point A to B if B is just to far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's goin to give me the permission to make a decision
to come up in they house and live
when will I drive a BMer takin my clothes to the cleaner
How can I know
will I forever be payin my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin to lean
know what I mean?
when I be needin some justification
stuck in the fuckin same location
who is the friend that is helpin me?
who is the busta thats hurtin me?
who can I trust?
will you be there when the goin is tough?
Will I be hangin with dick in the dust?
Who wanna share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
or will I go crazy pullin the load alone?
constantly gettin my hustle on
when will I finally see, kinda suspect
or even actually know
Who is my real friend thick and the thin?
and who in the fuck is the foe?

Friend or foe, you just will never know
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold
playa hatin is everywhere I go
Friend or foe you just will never know.."

With lyrics that would leave most dead, I'm so close to the edge
That I could jump pop the trunk
Shoot the pump boom and give these niggas what they want
Hits for hardcore and soft asses
Hoopties to e-classes cups and blunt ashes I'm mashsin
Down the track doin all the high hats
Bustin at the bass line where the treble at? Fuck with that
Live at the show I make em clap
And say go Thorough when they see me rap in fact

Grab a drank and don't thank as we commence to get it crunk

Swooping through the hood where mostly ballas be
Steady hearing women callin me
Is it cause of the candy apple red navigator bumping Eightball and 'G
Y'all be tripping off the P's I can get plus I'm from my K-Town click
when a playa lay it down quick
to be no tease and no lick she gon' suck the sleeve off my tip
I get the right words in
straight up in this till the juices diminish
then I'm a menace like I'm Iceberg Slim
Lights blur dim with a slight curve grin
A fifth of yak and a sack a brother might serve 10
Spitting game I try to master the graphics
Never plaster on plastic like psychodamagic
and man a brother bad cause I status
Grabbing some asses freaking up plenty women by the masses
can't nobody stop this madness
The playa Twista looking great up in the Suave House tip
Never catch me in much but a Suave House outfit
Cars with some kick on the lick with the mob looking thick
Hit the club cause rug on the loveless
Ladies love this pretty eyes mug with a thug twist
Flowing I'm as deadly as a drug risk
Anyone high but killers high haters die from the slugness
Peep this like a deep dish
Takin my vision away like a eclipse I see hips
My scripts I dip game deadly as 3 clips
Plus I'm the one she already wanted to freak with
competition betta gone head on
Chicks betta gone head bone in the lac of the rear
so I can have a sack and a beer
Prepare for the atmosphere of the mack of the year

Pulling that dope when I hit the door
Pin roll aka the fat man got love for the ones who got love for me
Thug for me roll up with me and if come down to it shed blood for me
Real to the end me and my pen falling in love all over again

Taking control for the big time money foll and all the women are hoe
I think I shoulda had an eighth straight enough so I can see straight
Now baby why you still pausing when you know
Tou don't smell like you been through the last of the sea plates
Nan heavy as a e-weight, gotta be straight
First of all I ain't buying your clothes,
then doing your toes, then going to shows,
No bust no more, go run boots, hoe patios
and you feeling that you ready for a blackout
Huh girl I can see it in your eyes, you ain't each spit the mack out
Now you ain't even gotta act out, now I gotta throw the trash out
I'm a thug shout, where my pimping spot,
where the sun don't shine one time
Then throw me a dose of that straight shot hen
I'm running with all this hate stopping
It seems to be getting around late night
Tell ya man to lock the gate tight
Here I come to break the window smash that boy
and get up and then go heres some leaving a trail
with no clue no propane no buds and shoes
and you know the rivalry man blow up skull

Here comes the one they call the P. I. -- M. P.
Straight out the cut no one can see I -- bust these
Way out of touch with all them bustas in my rear view
But see they game, so lame, I can hear through
I Hens doggin at the bar, actin real nice (real nice)
Six pack of Hen, straight up, with no ice -- tap me twice
Did you really want my full attention?
Sometimes my mind (intertwine) with the tenth dimension
I see you inchin to my ride, tired, rest them legs
Soon as you open up your mouth (uhh) there's the head
Now who I be, mjg, certified, mic controller
(Uncle Sam, I want you!) Trick bend over
I'm a petrified rapper talkin, and you ain't nuttin
But an electrified shyster walkin, I'm tired of savin
People from takin these dead end trips, I'ma just go
And bust this champagne upside your ship, alright you hip?
You in a hurry? You can't relate?
Don't ever say that I ain't try to set it to you straight
I'm out the gate before you hate but I'll be back again
You saw me faintly through the crowd but now I'm in the wind
Once again

[Chorus: Eightball and mjg]

In the wind, it's a bird, it's a plane
Now it be them hustlers with that skin tight game
In your mix, scopin you, scopin me
Eightball and mjg to the end, bustas we in the wind

[Verse Two: Eightball]

I sold my soul to this hustle, homeboy scratch what you heard
T front me a keyboard, I flipped it like a bird, word
On them streets be them Suave House beats
In the Benz blowin Sweets got your gal between my sheets
Speak -- I ain't have to say one little thang
The fame of my name blew the ghetto freak brain
Lookin for a meal ticket, she let me stick it
Wicked when she lick it, tryin to make me trick it
Girl, when I was broke it seemed all about the luxury
Now I got cheese, I got a pay a girl to love with me
But I'm a jelly worker, like Smuckers
Workin against them suckers, big facin just to love a
Broad that done been around the world in a day
Bear lovin whoever got cheddar to pay
Ball like no trick ass, them shakers if I tip
I be drunk, in the club, smokin sticky cat nip
Slip, as if a banana peel was dropped in my path
Into a body bodyworkin not discussin no math
Playa haters all around me as I stumble and grin
Snatch my vest, twist somethin, hit the rumble and then...

[Chorus x2]

[Verse Three: mjg, Eightball]

I flip scripts on young dips who think they hip
Smoke up your whole zip, sess hydro or crip
Time and time again, stories have been told
About the super hustler dyin tryin to get the gold
Concrete jungle full of, carniverous firearm
Hunger for flesh, and pray on who ain't strong
Heavy weighters, with plenty hoes that buy em alligators
In the wind, breakin all big?

Pick artificial tricks stolen money makers
Money trees come in please, help a player shake a
Million down to the ground, feel them hits fall
Ride with me I'll run your game into a brick wall, trick y'all
Is what this false literary do, then reality come
(and snatch the natural dust out you) who speaks the truth?
Whose your leeches? Whose your friends?
I plan to bring the realness back again, but until then
I'm in the wind

[Eightball]
This for all my G's and my niggas that ride with me
Only God feel the pain and only he can really see
Through the eyes of a child
A baby born wild
Gangsta shit flow through his blood and no one had to show him how
Kill or be killed where I come from ain't no in between
Why trade the world just to be a dope fiend
Hoes have a child just to take a nigga change
Twelve years later he want to know his daddy name
Maximum security prison how we get to see
The only man resemble him and this shit here ain't on T.V.
Your favorite actor don't play this part
If you never live to sit you can't say his heart

[Chorus x2]

You don't have to believe me (believe me)
Unless you want to believe me (believe me)
But it's real (It's so real)
It's all real

[Eightball]
Yeah
Little girl
So precious and innocent to the world
Get swallowed up and sucked up by this world
Little girl you hide your pain with all them games
Gettin' high and sellin' ya soul who can you blame
Nigga love you what do they love what you do
It's aiight boo I know you gotta get paid too
It's a long road
Full of ??? niggas and hoes
Gotta be strong
Cuz It's so easy for you to be gone
Not here no more
You not breathing so yo not here no more
You touch no more
You feel no more and you don't fear no more
Not here no more
I know you don't want to hear dis
But somebody got to tell ya some real shit
Not sugarcoated
Cuz where I come from shit ain't sweet
You got a choice and it ain't shit for you in them streets
Black women be a momma to ya little babies
Get on ya knees and pray to God things change daily

[Chorus x2]

[MJG]
We ain't tryin to preach to ya
Just tryin' to reach to ya
See all of us are blessed with somethin'
But most of us don't take two seconds out of our days
to try to imagine somebosy elses hard times
Because ya too busy worried about cha own
If ya wanna know what real is
Real is experiencing good times and hardaches and being
able to balance them boats
But at the same time realizing that the world will continue to
spin with or without you
Lend me your ears, give me your spirit your conscience has to pay
attention to what I mention
I'm your eye opener the hope for the one to will never see the suburbs
And if good life is only the word
The phrase the life that somebody else is living
Although we human most of us continue to live in
In humane, dormanes whether pictures the same
Children being born using their mothers maiden name
We play the game of life but we don't all win
Most of us ride the bench until were called in
Struggling to get noticed in the side the one-sided
On nation under God so divided
Out of touch with each others cultural activities
If you don't know someone like me than how you feelin' me
MJG, the air we breathe makes us all related
So suck it up and realize it takes us all to make it

How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair

Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
That's when the fun came

Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he wanna hit that
Always wanna drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed

Instead of working you be begging trying to get rich quick
Faking acting like you interested just 2 hang around
Tell a nigga you a part of this and know you ain't down

Tellin them about the famous niggas that you know
You worst than the bitch you need 2 slow down dog

Top Stang, leanin to the left, gold dadens on them thang
I'm the mjg, pimp tight
Put it to the floor, 5-0 swang a right
In a pina, butta, guts is a must
Drivin in the shop, take a mile, grab em up
Paint a ten clear coats, to make it shine
Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times
With my gas tank full, drank a boor
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull
Me a young, stout woman, sumpin pretty
Nice round hills, with them wear shaped titties
As the sun goes down, I'm gettin dirty
Fall up and press a word get cleaned in a hurry
In my 77 Chevy, ass tight
Pull off cuttin rubber, disappearin in the night

Just like candy
Its the same feeling (looks good to me)

10 o'clock in the morning, his A got up
Chief and Haywood some Kool-Aid in my favorite cup
Comb my hair, get my grill right so I can feel tight
Havin starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes
As I strike, out the door, to my superb
Parked by the curb, candy coated bird
The sun got my candy lookin good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street
Hit the horn, but no stallin, keep ballin
4 o'clock sunday, I gotta hit the mall and
Fall in full of them green trees
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King
Fools all in the way with that econo-spray
Need to take a few classes, learn about Manassas
Pressure got me beamed, I'm talkin on the phone
Tellin Penny that's the way to do it, baby represent ya home

Mechanical to pain will bring flavors to your mind
And in the summertime we got the whole block blind
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin game
Lying sayin he goin get the same thang
If you ain't ridin wood, and leather, your ride ain't hittin
A plane dash for a crush, forever got you itchin
99. 95, 30 day paint jobs
Got niggaz ridin round lookin like a junk yard
You need to pull a check, wheeler check, wheeler check
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet
See most of these new paint jobs they don't do
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true

[Eightball]
Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus
5th wheel on the grill like them playaz do in Texas
My folks gettin sideways in Vallejo
Ballaz in Memphis slammin shut the Cadillac doors
Full of ink so blinked I could fly
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die
Descending, my mind goes back into reality
To some, having candy paint is just a fantasy
Custom leather everywhere you look is woodgrain
Big Ball tellin you its all about the candy mane

You hoes lay it down

Verse One: Thorough

He's got his head tilted back on his face is a frown
Who's that nigga there it's Thorough bitch
So don't you clown, the sound and style, of Swisher after Swisher
Oh how I wish ya would step so I could hit ya
With wicked shit slick and swift
As I slaughter quick, oughta flip with fluents
To show you how we be doin in the Suave House federation; that is cat
You don't know how it's comin cause you don't where it's at
A mack of all trades, low cut, tight fade
We all get paid, so gets sprayed, so buster behave
My flavor's deep, please peep, I ain't soft
I represent at all cost and always got my niner out
So eeease back cause you marks can't hang with me
I got to much game in me, killin ain't no thang to me
Give a nut check, and I see you outta place
And I say that to say you're a bitch, and you ain't got what it takes
To stop the funk mutha from freelance jackin
Brushes up on yo skills, cause fool I ain't lackin
With my hands on my dick, my click is thick so don't clown
Bitches we ain't playin you hoes lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Two: Eightball

It's Sunday morning, I'm stil yawnin from the night before
So much sess in my chest from the Swishers I smoke
Oh no!!!!  Who is this hoe in the bed with me?
I remember the pussy but I don't remember her name G
Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor
I'm a killa on them sticks, aggivated hallucinatin
Tryin to let go of my frustration
But some my luck, nigga gonna be a med patient
I gotta nine uzi ak, but that shit don't really matter
Cause if I gotta I will rat-a-tat-a
To splatter the guts of nigga with no nuts
And if you step to Suave you will have to lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Three: Crime Boss

Here comes the spy, that fry, get high, and get head rushed
The number one gangsta you can't touch or bust
So steppin is the wrong that you gots to come against me
You best to do a driveby and be prayin that you hit me
Cause nigga if you miss me I'ma have to draw my gat
And take yo ass way back, cause way back way back in the days
I used to beat dope fiends down just get paid
Live my life as a hustler, sellin drugs was my only J
My moms was a trick hoe I had nowhere to stay
And nigga that's fucked all my homies are loners
I've been on this for ten years so I'm known on corners
With bitches and prostitutes, pimps and killa thugs
Five-oh harrassin me, so Crime Boss is feelin slugs
A good guy gone bad, devious fuckin kid
Victim of?, shit that my momma did
These dope beats comin up, I'm servin those clucker bitches
My beeper still goin off, I'm thinkin of addin riches
For dollars and sense, see I gotta have it goin on,
Or be trapped in this hole for too motherfuckin long
It's on!!!!

Verse Four: mjg

Thirty buster in yard talkin shit bout a bitch
Claimin to be that bitch's family but they look like dirty tricks
Talkin about why did I meet that hoe, fuck the hoe
Charge the hoe, break the hoe, bust her inside her shit and go
Suckers how the fuck you think that mjg was gonna slip
On the only reason you mad cause you sister couldn't pussy whip
A back breakin, check takin, pimp nigga constantly makin
Money off you and your lady, nigga I ain't tradin
Why don't you niggaz understand I'm the pimp she's the hoe
Now that Itold you now you know, break that chain and let her go
Back on the track shake that ass, make my money
Make it fast, get yo head swoll bringin me checks bitch bring me cash
Drop yo panties, to let you start
To open your mouth, slurp and slob
On this dick you, he's the trick you's a bitch, do ya job
When you through, get up and go, get the cheese, hit the door
Catch a cab, back to the lab, bring my motherfuckin money hoe
Don't you ever front me with a lame lie about my bank

Here's my mission, I'm out to get them, those who be slippin
Creepin, while they be creepin, I be enterin
Into them, silently, violently, that's not me
Quietly, you'll never know I'm in your blood stream
Swimming, I been injected, now you're infected
And when you find me here it will be worse than you expected
Temptation, that's how I get in, that's how I got in
Information, is what you lackin, now I'm attackin
Your mind, and body functions, don't seem to function
Somethin, ain't how it used to be and it's because of me
Killin you, cold-blooded murderer
The bible told the world I would be here and now I'm servin ya
Along with the floods mass destruction and wars

If it was up to me I'd get with you all, but I really don't pick em
How one by one she lures them in, I'm the one who tricks them

And in the midst of the drama mama can I save ya
Now you remember all the hell she went through tryin ta raise ya
But it's too late for that, in this predicament
You shoulda been thinking of this when you was flickin it, stickin it
But who am I? Just another man running his mouth
Giving you something to think about, my time is up, I'm out

If you ain't realized by now, the description of the topic here is aids
Several amounts of times I will appear on the front page
Never be thinking about the filthy hoes in which I've laid
Down deep in the dungeons next to the devil is where I stayed
Never be thinking about the backs I rode and what I weighed
Now everything that's important in your life is just a daze
Being a damn fool trying to prove you wasn't afraid
Wasn't intending to do it but yet and still at times you made
Moves within the game that should never have been played
Whether you old or whether it struck you at an early age
No difference between the two, cause they both in the same stage
Curiosity killed the cat the cat was standin in front of the gauge
It seems the whole subject keeps the world within a daze
Well this is the fact,
That some of these people be thinkin they can't be fazed
Worldwide plague slowly turning into a rage
Up and down side to side heterosex and gays need to

[Chorus:]

""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should've had my jimmy hat strapped on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness, it's more than just a song man
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones

""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should have told him to put a condom on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness, it's more than just a song
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bone"

My so called friends, they had no ends to lend me.
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so damn hard, but the money, it never increased.
I quit my fuckin job, I had no job nigga
Put on the mask, get the gloc, it's time to rob nigga.
I hit the streets, but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous, but my fear wouldn't stop my strollin.
Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets, so I knew I had got bucked.
Reachin for my tech, the bullets hit me in my chest
My eyes closed shut, and I thought I seen death.
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
T-Money walked in and he told me what had happened.
I knew him from the hood, but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag, and I knew that he was bale.
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech.
He offered me a job said he'd front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be..
Mr. Big!

Chorus: Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.

8Ball:  I hit the street slaning ya-yo, then I sold up my block
Sellin 8, sellin deals, sellin $20 rocks.
Sellin dimes, sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack.
Some fool tried to jack me, but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches' life.
Standin on the track, my mobile rung and it was T
""Hello?"" -- ""Yo Eight, be the fuck aroung 3"" --""Aight!""
I met him at the park, he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians, and get my ass in.
Hit for 30 birds, if I live, I'd get five
I smoked them damn Columbians, and then got what was mine.
All the time, my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger, that's when bitches started jockin me.
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5-O.
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope, makin a 100 Gs a week.
I gained respect, I'm the biggest playa of all time
Don't ever fuck with me, cause I'm...
Mr. Big!

Repeat chorus:

8Ball:  Chillin at the club with T-Money and J-B
Lil Adrian and Boo, and my nigga, mjg.
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds.
Drinkin on this Yak, makin my way to the back.
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest.
With a long black weave and a tight red dress.
I started conversatin, but she didn't want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room, now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up, now somethin in the air stank.
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser.
Stood by the door when it opened, niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun, ""Hey nigga!"" *pow pow*
Then, I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas, but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in, I was laying on the bed.
Walked up out the room, did I go to jail?
Hell no!  They can't stop me..
Long live Mr. Big Ho!!!!

Sometimes I go and click and smack my bitch up with the gat
Or blow up niggaz cars, cause I heard they call me fat
No I'm not a wimp, cause the pimp is in my nature
I got too many hoes bein' away, but ain't my flavor
I'ma dope seller, stick 'em up, killer or whatever
Game from slangin' birds, 211 or 187
Smack up my bitches on the street that owe me ends
Learn from the start, in the game ain't no friends
Just a lot of bitches with they hands out

Not a true bitch, but a true bitch nigga
We rollin' thick as hell so how the fuck that nigga figure?
His gun nor his gang is gonna be a threat to us
With 1 fire bomb, 1 got him at the dusk
And the nigga down with me said:(Damn G you been having gank?)
And at that very moment, he was askin' me to shank it
A nigga ain't suppose to smoke a trick and get sad
And that's the first example of a killer goin' bad
I gotta take him out, if he live he'll confess

That's the beginning of this story that I'm telling you
I was in the 9-tre smokin' a spliff on the strip
Seen a little cutie with some bootie.. Stop to shoot the shit
She was on my dick cause in the hood, I had a little rank
She was the kind of ho tryin' to take a nigga for his bank
But what she did not know, a nigga had a plan for that
Take her out to dinner then knock that ass up in my cadillac
All of a sudden, my beeper started buzzin' on the side of me
The code read 33.. I knew it was mjg
Step to the mobile phone.. G was talkin' crazy
This ho heard some niggas say them laws are out to get me
That night, I was dumpin that bitch in the ditch
Did not know that I was doin it in the presence of a snitch
Got dope from the scenery.. Thinkin I was scot-free
And now, I'm duckin and dodgin tryin to keep it low-key
Spliffed-out, ridin in my hooptie on cloud 9
Doin about 50 when a nigga pass 1-Time
Now they got a nigga faced-down on the sidewalk
Talkin all that punk ass rookie pig cop talk
What was in my pocket.. Grabbin all my money and my beeper
Ramblin through my car, the pigs found my 9mm
Now, I'm in the county callin G to come and get me
Wandering who is the snitch callin these laws tryin to sell me out
Oh no!  My mind is getting paranoid
A nigga can't even trust his own homeboys
As a result, I'm always alone
Except for some of the hoes I bone
Most of the time, I watch the news while I get my smoke on
Thousands after thousands on a lawyer who ain't doin shit
Locked up in this house a nigga 'bout to have a fuckin fit
Last night, I seen my face on the news.. G
Some nigga who worked for me.. Slipped and lost an uzi
Now, I'm on the run.. Livin like a fugitive
I thought to myself on the run ain't no way to live
I thought I'd party hard and smoke and drank this century
Now, I'm slowly dyin in this penetentery...

You know it's lame to be, somethin that you know is a lie
Hoes want a nigga to try to be somethin that he ain't,
right before your eyes, livin his life in a fuckin disguise
Follow the pack, and wind up dead last (Go on)
Real dummy with your scared ass
In the future, ain't nobody gonna listen to you

Runnin from temptation, but I'm much to slow to get away
Gang, shootin niggas and bitches fuckin with me everyday
Man if I was lame and couldn't see em from a mile away
Smile on their mug, and in their minds, nothin but jealousy
Why should I get caught up in that bullshit not concernin me

Separate the strong from the cowardly and the weak at this

for the money that I be savin, and the moves that I be makin
Breakin rules, tryin not to be one of them broke fools

Served out, whether sober, playboy, I got heataz for ya
Quick to shoot, because that indo boosts up my paranoia
I rap the blues, cause the blues is what I'm livin nigga
Surrounded my animals - livin and dyin by the trigga
Word to me, and if that shit don't meet your expectations
Fuck you critics, I do this for the underground nation
Slab ridaz, nigga, drug traffickaz and jackaz
Heat packaz, nigga, all my homeboys ain't rappaz
And, I wouldn't say it if it wasn't necessary
All of this is just a test, tryin to prepare me

Forever Eightball, Pimp-Caso, Poetry writer...

MJG:    It's hard to be, something that you didn't start to be
these streets be apart of me, until it's hard to see
till the years when it's hard to walk, gettin old
and, it's hard to talk, I'm on a line of chalk
it seems thinner than a line of thread, but through all this
still instead, I'm real after all
Paper, short or tall - Wife, be big and small
and still down to earth, I'll still be on the scene
Life like a tv screen, but I keep my strength
and I'll keep my hope (Why?) Cause I know they got me under the scope
But, if you're lookin at me, Look close, and your ass will learn
Maybe when you have your turn, and take a stand and shit
You might be a man and shit, make your own plan and shit
Cause I don't make no moves unless G wanna make that move
Fuck he and she wanna make that move, I got a face that blues
when a nigga gotta pay them dues, and they lookin at my face like Ooo
Mane, you broke and shit, but they ain't gonna throw me out a rope
and shit
I'm a drown and choke and shit
And my folkaz get clowdy with that hocus pokus shit,
I'll be the brokest trick...
But, I'm gone be myself, Pimp type nigga for sho'
Once again like I did it befo', up top or below
I'm a keep my feet on the flo', and do it in the heat or the snow
Give me a beat and I go, Off like a champ on your ass
Drop the mic and vamp on your ass, stick a stamp on your ass
Send you off to camp on your ass...when I rain, I'll dampen your
path.

Breathing fast pumpin' hard through the night and then
Watch the sun rise cheefin' on a cigarillo
Urge got your head feeling fluffy like a pillow
You know, what I like ain't no sense in hesitating
S** for breakfast forget the eggs and the bacon
Leave you shakin', wishing I could be your man
In the park holding hands with the kids in the van
On a sunday eating icecream at the zoo
And everything I do, in someway involves you
I be a crazy man to tell you no if you asked
That don't mean I'm gonna be your trick and spend all my cash
On your ass, but we can chill and do it right
But that husband and wife hype baby not tonight

Living a players life, woah I be everywhere
Meeting all kind of women but ooh I'm playin' too hard to get
We can wine and dine till the morning light

Are you prepared for the creep 5 or sleep by
So ain't no need for you to teach I we each lie
Amoungst the sheets, and curiosity now waht you gone do?
Your clothes recieved by my butler that's providing for you
The luxury of my cottage covered up in the cut
Look ou the window baby lakeside, swans and ducks
Way outta touch with that fast lane
Keepin' it slow not here to critize
The last man brother for for sho' it's time
You know baby space ain't hard to find
And eventually you gonna want yours like I'm a need mine
Indeed I'm impressed by your charism and charm
Everytime we do our thang you straight deliver the bomb
You got me sprung, sometimes but not I'm shakin' it off
Let's put some slack up in this thang instead of breakin' it off
The chandalears in the atmosphere doin' me nice
But I told you once don't make me tell you twice
Baby read me lips, not tonight

I got game, but I ain't ever had one like you

But I don't wanna be your man or your confidon
If you don't fake the funk with me baby I won't front
Makin' love to a body in the dark is cool
And it's gone be somebody else if it don't be you

True, laced out in pure silk my mind don't tilt
I got the ac kinda bumpn' cover yourself with this quilt
Now free your mind, time like this is good but understand
I'm a man of plenty thangs and plenty plans
Rather than, your average, sit around do nothing brother
Stuck on having his
Wrong way one way or the other, the vibe was right
Your laid back conversation was tight

The hammer hit the table leaving me with 7 years
My history was shit so I could'nt she'd a tear
My future was a wall, surrounded by a cage
Them laws got me locked down damn at an early age
The only thing I got is a lust for the streets, the shit I gotta learn
And the shit I gotta teach
I'm living for the minute, muthafuck a whole hour
And I aint pickin shit up when It falls in the shower
My lady sends me pictures with her pussy in the air,
But she aint really there
So I don't really care
The only thing I got is a muthafuckin dinner
So fuck what I had, 'cause where I'm at I'm a beginner
I gots to be a winner in this muthafuckin mix up
Get my shit together, scope it out and try to fix up
Some confidence to keep a real nigga going strong,
The system is my house, the system is my home,
The system was designed to keep a brotha on his back
The system crackers caught me that's exactly where I'm at
My lawyer was a snitch, got me framed started buggin
My muthafuckin phone and the judge was his cousin
It's hard thinkin positive with negative around me
So I had to relate to the grounds that surrounded thee
House and The Mound where I chill
With the niggaz who respected a real nigga
'cause mjg respect them too
So I had to survive living my life with the street rule ""stay cool""
Disregard school and make my money fool, check it
It's hard to understand where I'm comin from if you on the outside talkin shit
Lookin in, then again if you was on the inside lookin out, 9 times outta 10
You would probably be my friend
Nigga how you figure, the system's gonna help ya
The ghetto's where they put ya, the ghetto's where they kept ya
See deep down in my heart I had this urge to go astray
And knock out all my problems in one ordinary day
The system got me thinkin 'cause I'm locked down in a tank
They saw a brotha strokin, so they had to make his ship sank
So I can't get mixed up with them devils or no other
With Ani..... Mosity I hate when It's a brother, none other
Than a buck, duck, hoodle up, shootin up thangs in the wind

Since we were two young playas in a one horse town
Then hopped to a muthafuckin grasshopper
Nigga, my life would have been done got cut off...
If my dues weren't paid.

Chorus (Cee-Lo)

It's ah, skinnin lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices, I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right.
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone, I still ain't afraid.
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid.

Mjg

In the middle of doin crime (Uggh), it never stopped me from writin rhymes
It never stopped me from playin music,
God, but it didn't mean I had to use it
It was obvious, I had to give up the streets - for the beats
Not knowin, but havin faith on just how long that it would be
Before I made it, before somebody picked up my tape and played it
With a remark like, ""Hey, played that instrumental, you cat's got potential.""
In the process of doing talent shows, parties, and mix tapes
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates
I can remember in the past closin down at fast foods
Strictly stickin to my dreams, but feelin like I'd be the last dude
Who can make it in this rap, I thought that they ain't go see me in Memphis
It was like a time they looked over Tennesseee,
And didn't know Hip-Hop was in us.
To all my vets in the game, I got love, stay on your toes
Cause back in the days, I use to use your 4-5 instrumental to do my shows
And look, I was 17 - when I signed my first contract
And about 18 1/2 when I signed my worst contract, we hurt from that
And til this day, they still distributin - our first tape
Before Comin Out Hard, now can you feel it?
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose
Cause, to get to where I am right now, I don't paid my dues.

A C-note for a concert, I know that sounds preposterous
Nigga, we didn't have a pot to piss
So we got on stage and we rocked the bitch.
Fuck the chee$e, I love to see... My niggas in the front row
Get buck wild, start a fight, the police make a nigga stop the show
Niggas all in the parkin lot, bustin shots, fuckin with hoes
Box chevy with the spokes and vogues,
Niggas didn't know shit about a 20 inch Mo-Mo
Hard head, young nigga don't believe that shit, til I see that shit
See them heavyweight niggas, one day, I'm gonna be that shit
Ok, everybody know everybody done sold dope, ran with a gang
Pimp some hoes, and.. Snorted a little coke.. But uhh..
I'm space agein.. And we'll forever be
Eightball, the fat mack, and... M-J fuckin G
Turn the page, from then to now, and we still grindin
Small clubs and small towns think they bouncin, and we find them
Put them on the guest list, make them pump their fist and get buck to this
Make one of them weed smokin, gangsta bitches get fucked to this
Expand, give all my true fans what they demand
Do my part again and uhh... Come out hard again and uhh..

You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos
Pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me

My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'

Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches cuz of me
Always wanna s** with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Ok we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya ima get me some

Hit a liquid some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song

Smokin out on the pound
As I'm keepin an eye for tight hoe's, while I creep, through the streets
While you sleep put them D's on my Jeep, peep this
A hundred and ten percent, physical fitness

Prove sumthin, go out there and get it
Bring it back to me

Don't know if you ever rolled with a G like this
Need you to be my other eyes when you in my shit
When you start actin' like a bitch, I'm a scream at...
But it ain't the situation here cause I ain't seen that
My background messed up, I ain't a clean cat
But I fucks with you shorty, I really mean that
Holla at the homie if you ready to change

I meet a bunch of hoes (Ya)
I gotta bunch of friends (Ya)
I gotta bunch of foes (Ya)

Walk and talk real slow
Outside fat black, but the inside glow

The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could It be
The pimps could rule the nation in '93'
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick, out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the ? comin on
See up in the ground, down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what I'm sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggaz be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin ain't dead yet, see pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you ain't shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But it's time to switch it up, unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it, complete and pick it
It's a book with hard covers that's packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system, step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now I'm runnin thangs, my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game, thangs are bound to show
'cause a pimp got a stroke, and a wimp can't flow
And I ain't no muthafuckin fall guy, but Imma try hard
To let you know this pimpin ain't gone never die
M.J.G pimp tight
Young black nigga, no wife
No children, just hoes
Supplying the muthafuckin nation wit a dose
Of what, has been injected and now it's on
The muthafuckin pimp is in the house"
8Ball & Mjg,Reason For Rhyme,/8/8ball+mjg/reason+for+rhyme_20704455.html,"[Verse 1: mjg, Eightball]

I'm mjg, the nigga with the versatile style
Check your calendar realize that I been here for awhile
When I was young I took the soul up out of rhythm and blues
When hip hop originated slowly paid my dues
And take my shoes, and try to walk a mile in my past
Without them salt shaker sheisters tryin to get in that ass
It's been too long, you motherfuckers fittin to feel the south
Shut your mouth, shut your do you little freak ass hoe
I'm bout tired of all this damn east and west coast shit
Especially when other niggaz tryin to work in this bitch
I paid my dues to the fullest, worked to god damn hard
For you too kill the industry and leave me out of a job
You niggaz strain yourself, to maintain yourself
And now you playin with enough rope to actually hang yourself
But you don't care, hell, you constantly fallin deep in the plot
Mesmerized from all the bitches and the money you got
You must of forgot they said that rap would never last ten years
And if your selfish to the fact, I'm tryin to have a career
Now listen here, what do we have, we got probable cause
To keep the pen on the paper and the glock in your drawers, nigga

Remember back when we used to do this shit for fun
Bein the dopest on my block made me ranked number one
No gun, just a pen and notebook paper by the sheet
In the crib, gettin funky off the next nigga beat
No electronics to make the shit that I wrote the chronic
Shit sick enough to bring vomit from your stomach
Quick as a comet, shield your eyes from the uv
Groovey, like a nigga from a Batman movie
Real about the shit that I express over dope beats
You can't say it was fake unless you grew up on my street
Concrete head niggaz, runnin from fed niggaz,
Po' ass scared niggaz, that came out dead niggaz
And all I ever wanted to be was an emcee
Did a little dirt and found it wasn't for me
Poetry flowin through my bloodstream like a drug
I'm addicted to rhyme because I love the buzz, nigga

[Chorus x2:]

My reason for rhyme
Because I'm true to this rap
My reason for rhyme
Because I'm real with this rap
My reason for rhyme
It ain't all about the cheese
Even though fat lp's can make a nigga g's

[Verse 2: mjg:]

My reason for rhymin, while I'm in, a position to be tellin
It's not about the fame and them bitches who be yellin
At my concerts, one verse, dicks up, quick fuck
Lies start spreadin now you tangled in a mix up
I gits up, do sits up, and squeeze my mental mindrame back in order
And use my hand as a tape recorder
Jottin down all the information placed in front of me
The good time, the bad time, the way I think it oughta be
Now follow G, can you comprehend?
If you can then drink a shot of Hen
Hit this hand on your silver end
Friends don't be friends and foes don't be foes
However the way you bring it, that's how you want it, I suppose
I can stay up out the game keep my aim on my paper
And I'll be sure to keep my pimpin real with Tony Draper
And I'll potray the man that I'm known to be
Dim the lights (Hip-tie) for the mjg

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Eightball]

Give me a crowd of wild niggaz who love real hip hop
And watched smoke get soaked up, like water in a mop
Drop presidents among me and my own folk
And let that bullshit walk among the past with ghosts
Ain't no hope of bein takin seriously
When limited avenues are given to me
So, naturally I take shit and make shit mine
Jackin only for position in this thing called rhyme
Freestyle, not great, but if you wait for a second
I could write some shit down that could get a gold record
Thought about not the first thing that I think about
Mjg and Eightball and hard is how we comin out
Runnin out, niggaz who can't hold on like En Vogue
Even though I moved out the mound I'm still ten toed
Down for the shit I do, the Suave House crew
True to this shit, because this shit is so true

Come and go with me, creep off in my Chevy thang
Doin 45, twistin somethin steady mayn
Headed to my low-key, safe-and-sound house
Call up the fellas, hit the spot, and pull a pound out
I used to have a secret spot up in my Range Rover
Where I kept me somethin rolled, I'm a chain smoker
No discrimination my nigga, if you broke
But they still ain't attributed to good smoke
B.Y.O.B, bring ya own bud
Contribute to the pot, or do ya own drugs
But then I looked around and noticed all the folks was gone
I shoulda known that they would leave when all the smoke was gone

Strike my lighter, put it to the tip, then I
Inhale, and let the smoke smoke fill up in my lungs

Hold it for a second, blow it out and get numb

No mid-grade, or no regular, just straight chronic
At least four-hundred, for a zip, if I'm a touch it
See I'm a smoke it if I like it, I ain't got no budget

You got a lot to say and didn't nobody ask you nothin'

Might get yo' jaw broke, might get yo' wig split
Might get yo' car shot up, might get yo' dough kicked
Might get you kidnapped, might get yo' neck snapped
Don't get your feelings hurt thinkin' this is just a rap

To all you little mamas, that wanna get my number
After the show is over, you wanna come on over
You wanna sip Mo', you wanna smoke 'dro
Ask me twenty questions, this ain't no talk show

I'm not ya boyfriend, I'm not ya husband
I'm not ya sugar daddy, I'm not ya best friend
Don't need no best man, don't need no wedding band
Close ya mouth and listen close to what I'm sayin'

Stop playin' games, ho
It's about that money you makin'
You playin' games, ho
Ain't 'bout no talkin' or fakin'

Stop playin' games, ho
It's about the life you livin'
You playin' games, ho
Look at all this money you missin'

Stop playin' games, ho
It's about that money you makin'
You playin' games, ho
Ain't 'bout no talkin' or fakin'

Stop playin' games, ho
It's about the life you livin'
You playin' games, ho
Look at all this money you missin'

Stop playin' games, ho
You playin' games, ho
Stop playin' games, ho

[8 Ball]
Yeah..
What'chu talkin 'bout, what'chu think you doin?
Why you walkin out, where you think you goin?
You actin like you didn't, you knew what I was doin
3 o'clock in the mornin, you knew where I was goin
Straight to my spot, a loft in the city
Stopped and picked up somethin pretty on the freeway suckin titties
You in the bed sleepin, I said that I was workin
You smile when you see me but inside you was hurtin
The cars and the clothes, whatever that you asked me
I was takin care of you, I thought that you was happy
Out of town, fuckin 'round, all-star, Superbowl
A-T-L, Magic City, tippin big dick hoes
Panties on the back seat, I don't know whose shit that is
Condoms and phone numbers, I don't know whose shit that is
F'real, you know when I realized that I was wrong
When I wrote the words to this song

[Chorus: unnamed singer]
Just tell me why baby, did I ever did I ever did I ever let you go baby
Cause I love you cause I love you cause I really love you so baby
Baby, woo - it's the very last time that I'll let you down
I won't make the same mistakes again

[Mjg]
Yeah, since way back I was a mag-a-net for pretty women
And brought up in the city where they exercise their pimpin
I fight temptation daily, I could be in Paris chillin
With somethin young, eager talent, they ready and willin
I get a lot of phone numbers but don't really call 'em
Unless I hit 'em just to let 'em know I'm out here ballin
I know you picture me, laid up with these other women
Most of the time I'm not, occasionally I get 'em
Who was that woman lookin at me up in Wal*Mart
Lock in the sexual fantasy, her drawers hot
But back to the subject, the chemistry I really loved it
Mental, emotional, couldn't put nothin above it
But every unturned stone you had to touch it
Rolled 'em over, look what you found, now you disgusted
But before I leave, look me in my eye
Don't cry, never lie..

[Chorus:]

[8 Ball]
You and me, full of that, sticky weed and cog-nac
You like how I lick it then, put the dick up in your back
There you go, talkin 'bout, what you know, who done said
That they saw me trickin some-where with one of yo' friends
Did you see me do it no, do you know that shit fo' sho'
Who you gon' believe me, or them ol' meddlin hoes
Daaaamn, I think of all the shit I put you through
This a lonely game and, sometimes I be missin you

[Mjg]
I got a tank of gas to burn up, turn up the radio
Baby hit your girls, go tell 'em c'mon get ready to go
We headed fo', somewhere, tucked in and very low key
No interruptions, no cell phones, no tee-vee
Just you and me, sippin up on some Hennessy
Makin sure that we finish the whole, cup to the end it be
Meant to be chemistry between us and even though
You saw the bitches in my Beamer..

[Chorus: to fade]"

[Swizz Beatz]
Comin hard for ya
We doin this right here man
Givin it back
Alotta thugs in the street,
Can't even do this right here man
But you know how we do
Hold it down, get it right, keep it tight
And most of all..
We thank God

[Eightball]
For my three sons, for my mom
For waking me up and breathing air into my lungs
For health and wealth and lots of love for myself
The chances in life to take the right steps
I done popped that thang, and I done been popped at
Stole, cheated, and lied
Survived when I could have died
Or somewhere locked up, my niggas locked up
That's why I pray to you, say what I say to you
Thank you for Swizz Beatz, to him you bring the heat
He brought the heat to us, we burn the streets up
Thank you for family and everyone that stuck with us
Gettin it crunk, and layin it down, and gettin to buck with us
Thank you for not lettin material things make me
Thank you for givin me the talent that my peoples see
Thank you for lettin my niggas live after gunplay
Thanks for forgiving me, cuz I don't do this every day

[Chorus:]
[Sb] I thank God!
[Eb] For lettin me make it out the club
That night all that fightin and shootin jumped off
[Sb] We thank God!
[Eb] For lettin me make my money on the block
And get away when it get hot, uh
[Sb] We thank God!
[Eb] For them babies with them mommas who don't love 'em
And they have to grow up, fast
[Sb] We thank God!
[Eb] For everything, all them little things
For givin me my dreams, know what I mean?

[Mjg]
I thank God for havin a mother and a father
To rely on for guidance when circumstances got harder
I'm a part of a whole race who thank God
For being able to be free and leave the plantation yard
And, I thank God for givin me the understandin to acknowledge him
Notice his footsteps and follow him
I'm walkin today, I'm talkin today
I'm feelin today, but on top of that I'm livin today
And, I thank God because he gave his only child
Would you give your only child? Think about that for awhile
And, I thank God for givin me my baby daughter
A roof over her head, and fresh clean drinkin water
And, I thank God for not being afraid to love
So all the love I give, I get back major love
And, I thank God for givin me all the blessings
To put a little piece of what we all think into this message

[Chorus: with mjg instead of Eightball]

[Mjg]
For all the times I thought I was in the worst situation
That I could be in
God helped me see in, them cloudy times
Them, ""I wanna get rowdy"" times
One of them, ""They tried to bring the devil out of me"" times
I thank God, for keepin my mind solid
And I respect my elders, if or if not they went to college
And, thank you Lord, for makin my bin and I swored
And I'm glad I don't feel like I have to kill to pay the bill

[Eightball]
I was blessed to be a story teller, cd seller
My niggas be them shady fellas, chasin yella
Greedy with they eyes beady, lives easy
Dispise those who rise easy, talkin freely
Thank you for them tricks who be, talkin down
Hatin me and think that I don't, get around
The rumors and the talkin all it do is bore me
Trick I done been through a true Holly-wood story

[Chorus: with Eightball]

[Eightball talking]
Yea, Eightball, mjg
Swizz Beatz
Know wha'm sayin
Just wanna thank God
Simply, with the talents
That he blessed us with
Thank him, for the good things we celebrate
For the bad things that make us strong
Yea"

and grind  keep my mind on cloud twenty nine
my player ways keep me with plenty dimes
see I'ma shine like all six of my gold teeth
when a nigga get through cooking up  this O Z
all night on the block til the sun rise
my only friend is a glock with the 4 5
Four five in the mornin it don't stop,
day dreamin bout flousin tha drop top, (woop)
blue lights snap me back to reality
I hit the alley quick and toss what I got on me
Tricks ain't got shit to do but harass,
search tha nigga and took about a three in cash,
I guess that's better than gettin locked up,
or gettin jammed with that shit I had rocked up, huh!

Chorus:
Now I heard that the South is where yo folks from,
down in the bottoms where they broke some,
whips cross a nigga back, way back,
and now they wonder why we act, how we act,
gold teeth and heavy chevys, and talking slow,
afros & loud ass Italian clothes,
People bar-be-quein in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!

naked women in tha den playing, hop scotch
Thirty bustas in my yard, they be, long gone
So hit me and I'ma keep my, phone on
I be out turning corners, dranking, one fifth
Got some scratches on my rims, cause of one dip
Met a broad yesterday, she hit me, ten times,
if I diss her it'll take a nigga ten lines
MJG standing tall and I, won't fold
You can have all the bitches, cause I, don't hold
on to any woman like a human hand cuff
You got ya hair down baby fuck it, stand up!

Started this shit and I'm gon' finish yes I am dammit
We gonna slam it down like to hit it, here it's shitted
Here it's time for them niggas in Memphis, Tenn to get deep within it
How deep? Shit the devil stay right down the street
And why you mad? The rebels tied a brother by his feet
For what, for what I don't know they tied him to a pickup truck
Then posted up and down like they didn't really give a fuck
I get rid of bigots with bad racial equalities
Bust back at kkk's who try to follow me
These hollowties saving my ass in crucial situations
Any other tactics I need, I use imagination
I'm ten steps ahead of your ass type of nigga
Shit that I already know you try to figure
Give up, put your ship up, don't try to sail
Don't you see we got this shit built up, can't pry a nail
In my foundation my sound making too many bump all out the trunk
Get crunk and blow blunts and buck jump
Ain't no luck chump we come intentional with this dope shit
Using a pen or a pencil back when I wrote this
Space age, feel it perculatin' but all this hurt and hatin'
Still keep on bringing people back to old situations
I change the stations but they playing the same list
We started the shit and we gon' finish the shit

Mental battlescars polluting my cranium
Watered down fake niggas I'm draining 'em and training 'em
Claiming them Suave House niggas to the dirt bitch
Cross the family and you gon' find yourself gettin hurt, bitch
Peices all in a nigga mind it ain't reality
Fuck reconciliation, niggas don't want no unity
Born dyin every minute death is closer to me
Its like I'm in a movie, except I'm feeling everything
Pain when another motherfucker try to touch me
Anger when a petty player faker try to fuck me
8-B-A-double L, fat M-A-C
Nice with a mic and I don't think you wanna fuck with me
Love head doctors and I don't mean a psyciatrist
Bitches with that lip grip tighter than a gorilla fist
Pimp shit, when is everybody gonna learn
Pimps and gangstas make the universe turn
Poverty with the right amount of hustle turns to riches
But wrong situations turn hard niggas to bitches
I was born in the war zone fought for everything I got
Learned about my hustle, nigga worked and made the shit hot
Hoes started jockin niggas, boppin like they bitches too
Other niggas mad cause they only sold a tape or two
Fuck what you heard nigga fuck who you be
Suave got the hookup cause suave got the cheese nigga

Now my soldiers posted up
Hangin' like a coatrack
Gun in the bushes and
Work in the stash spot
Overtime, al night
Try'na make a fat knock
Swell in my pocket
Like I'm carryin' a loaf of bread
Been around the world
But I still love local head
Got the shit to make 'em jump
It's hyper like a pimp rally
Give 'em just a piece it make 'em
Mime me like a skip daddy
Glock, Chevy parked in the yard
With' the double pipes
If I catch ya try'na steal it
I'm a get double life
I ain't wanna do it, I ain't even really hate son
That's a damn shame but tomorrow, I'm a make?
Black Hummer waitin' for me in front of the jail house
Comin' for the boys who thought that I wouldn't bail out
Top notch citizen, on top of his shit again

Grabbin' chickens, buy a ticket

Broads with' them credit cards
Make her listen, let her charge
Flat tvs and some tiles for my momma car
Eighty-thousand dollars, I'mma fuckin' ghetto superstar
Work come soft, never hard, that's a different charge
Tre-8 never jam if I gotta blam blam!
If you not a regular, I'm taxin' you like Uncle Sam
Rubber gloves, blue magic and some Downy sheets
Plenty plastic wrap and a vacuum pack machine
My uncle, ""Old School"" don't need nothin' but a triple-beam
A dollar and a plate, he like to hit it while he mix it
I be rollin' up blunts in the den, countin' bread
30 dollars till my heart stop beatin' and I'm dead

Wrist full of frozen fireworks

It ain't no thang bitch, for you to drive down holl'n for ten
Guaranteed when ya test it you'll come and get 'em again
I heard a nigga say his name was Pimp C on that ""Boss'n Up"" movie
But that nigga ain't me
Too many clones in the streets and on the microphone
Pussy ass niggaz need to leave my legacy alone
'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' king in that Texas
Don't hesitate to put that thang on them plexers
'Cause it ain't no thang to lay yo' lump off in yo' lap boy
Hit his figure with' the trigger, scratch off in the toy

Ain't it funny the things we do to get paid?
The shit we do to show niggas that we ain't afraid.
Yeah, I got my education on the streets,
Doin dirt left a nigga with some muddy feet.
Everyday life brings everyday drama,
Smokin weed only makes a nigga mind wander.
So much I could've done, but I didn't do.
A lot of shit a nigga never should've went through.
Trustin another soul with my fate,
Showed me how easily love can turn to pure hate.
The road, I know, I came to a fork in it,
Good or bad, I'm a still be the nigga winnin, NOW
But tomorrow ain't guaranteed.
Maybe I can see the future through my young seeds.
Plant it, and hope the planet don't damage them.
It's a thin line, but I'ma get mine.

[CHORUS:]

Who can you trust? God only knows.
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe.
Money, that's all a nigga will die for.
So much pain and everybody wants more.
[x2]

[MJG:]

So much pain, drownin my brain, I need a paper towel.
Wrap it 'round, soak up the strain, I feel safer now.
Lookin' down the road I've travelled-it's been a bumpy one.
The walls that I stood on was Humpty Dumpty ones.
I feel like one of them pieces up in a chess game,
On the line, defending yours from mine.
I'm makin moves, attached to strings you can't see.
If the move seems a little bit awkward, it ain't me.
Now fony people ride your nuts for dolla signs,
I bet you drop some cash on the ground, they'd holla ""MINE!""
You far behind, man I'm way too ahead, I might be gone.
Think you had some killers ridin with you, you're home alone.
I'm in the zone, meaning space age pimpin, new millenium.
Holes down deep in the wall, I can't get into them.
I'm friend to them, real ass niggas and family members.
What you say, nigga I owe you something? I don't remember.

[CHORUS x2]

[talking]

The root of all evil they say, but yet, there's so much evil in all our
roots. Born in a world of a nigga, some knowing, some not knowing. Even
so, we've accomplished so much but still we have so far to go. C'mon man,
we're born hustlers, and together we'll be greater later. Used to die for
freedom... respect... Now we're dying for dope, hoes, and paper...

[Eightball:]

I'm guilty of all that shit and more.
Questioning life, asking what am I here for?
To some, that might seem strange but you dig this,
Don't get your feelings hurt, personal and business.
Make 'em average to acheive pimp trick status.
Lame niggas with no nuts end up embarrassed.
Compromise and commercialize, in the eyes of your niggas,
selling out to get the prize.
At the same time, my baby cries,
I'm on a cell phone,
in another state doing sound checks.
Tryin to make my little niggas' lives a little better,
than a bulletproof sweater, nigga love hurts.

[MJG:]

I've been a vet-er-an, in this game,
I ain't trying to be better than,
only as equal, as the better man.
You can only imagine the ghetto,
if you ain't raised in it.
That's where I'm from,
childhood glory days in it.
I wade in it, what? The waters.
Take me on down the stream, I'm going farther.
It's still from coast to coast, shore to shore.
I stand accused of being a pimp, from root to floor.
Doin' work constantly, thinkin' bout your family.
As soon as you think it's time to chill,
God damn it be, time for another project, another dealine.
Man, we're at the end of this rhyme, and I done said mine.

Her hair and her nails did show me love
Ya man say he got good green show me some bud
Give me the real hook up price like I'm ya cuz

A round cinibun head under them clothes

Stay up all night and go eat at the Waffle House
You and me bring your friend that make three

Yea yea sittin looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggaz know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin leave they own folks layin in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids

Chevy super clean, two or three screens
Watch a nigga be to the left I lean
50 karats in the crown, niggaz no more sceam
Just to let you sucker niggaz know I'm the king
This green I smoke we call it drow
Its dead-liest from memphis Tenn
You see my folk we ain't no joke
Don't turn this into a murder scene
I'm paranoid, tone misquoted
Should not since my early teens
But I'm drop that note, grab me under sixteen
You can bring all the niggaz you want to bring
Hey! I thought you were running things
All you did was run the screens
Must be out his mind thinking' the steel won't touch him
See it on the bush let it burn like Usher
Click, click, bang you can end the discussion
Ain't shit sweet cause I seen you unpleasant
I steal would spray broad day ain't nothing
The lilac one ak doing something
I'm immuned to the drama
Act a fool if you wanna
Lean in my pocket, 40 calb by the stomach
He acting' like he want it, I'm show a nigga somethin
Somebody phinna to have put (&#&#*^%)
I don't tolerate suckas who be trying me
Take a special kind of nigga to defies me
Similar to 8ball and mjg been coming that hard since 93
Niggaz know, ain't no out shinning me
I've been the G you're trying' to be
I mob with gorillas, squaders and robbers
And killers true niggaz gonna ride me

[chorus (2x)]

[Twista]
Take a look at my wheels, rolling through the south
Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the chevy
Pimp twist I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game come major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist. Fuck you bitch
I don't really wanna have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggaz out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggaz pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggaz try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker wanna take my style
Cause niggaz out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let y'all niggaz play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball & mjg
Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
While I bump kamikaze shit, while I scream look at my grill hoe

[chorus (2x)]

[8ball]
Old grill smile, wiling out up in the vip
The club close at five 'o'clock, we pulling up around three
Wood grain wheel gripping, Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players is demon like I'm willy beaming
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She sceaming dreaming, wishing she can be my number one
Forever young, mama I just wanna' to have some fun

[Mjg]
Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggaz who be bussin' back to perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now hurt you later
But I ain't worried, I smoke one on you fucking haters
And I'm hidding gators on the refrigerator
Down south memphis Tenn. Pimpin' gotta rep it
The third I did, that nigga rugg, boy that nigga pimpin

Said I got the blues (2X)
Memphis City Blues

8Ball
Yeah, Light up the green, watch me light up the room
Watch me light up the mic, fat boy be the truth
Nigga live and learn, learn the streets or get burned
Niggas take what you earn, they be slick as a perm
Man I try to be slicker, try to be cunning and quicker
Try to be more than just another broke ass nigga
In this game of life, lose your life in the game
Take a life full of pain, make you remember my name
From the home of the blues, thought I paid my dues
It's hard to fill my shoes, imitators abuse
I just love the music, like my heart or my brain
Couldn't live without it, that's impossible man
I'm unstoppable man, from the bottom I came
Niggas scratching for bread, stumbled up on the fame
Humble niggas with game, shut yo mouth up and listen
Recognize it's a blessing thankful just to be living

Chorus
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, street oh man, oh man, oh man

I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, street oh man, oh man, oh man

Mjg
I had the Memphis City jones running through my bones
Way, way back with A+ beepers and gray phones
Even further back when I was just playing around the yard
Riding bikes and shit, falling and getting my legs scarred
In the music city, Memphis, Tenn they turned me into this
My dad and a couple of my friends they played instruments
And when we used to roll to school at 16
We bumped shit like Bobby Womack and Al Green
Hell, I knew most of the old school shit from front to end
I would start to memorize four fives at age 10
I come from a city where are & B run deep
And the blues was the music that paved the whole street
It was only natural that we would take the torch and run wit it
Be serious but still have a little fun wit it
Mjg from a town that runs real deep
Ask B. B. King and Isaac Hayes on Bill Street

Chorus

8Ball
Yeah, On that pimping man, me and G was born and raised
Commodores, O'Jays, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Windows rolled down, no ac cause the gas low
Bread at a minimum but still we found a place to go
North to the South at my nigga house
Chiefing out
Skipping school learning what the Memphis City Blues bout
Me and G and a whole bunch of others
Had a rocky road to travel just to make the world love us

Mjg
Cause it's The Memphis City really to call it itty bitty
Would be an understatement
We got big ass, cash, and titties
Big pimping working and hurt
The pockets of big tippers
Side dippers
And big jails to hide niggas
But we stayed out em
Hard times we prayed bout em
Nigga step up talking that shit and I laid out em
Mjg reppin the Memphis Tennie
You and I could feel it
Pass me some of the Henny"
8Ball & Mjg,Pimps,/8/8ball+mjg/pimps_20530220.html,"[Intro:]
Eightball-
Ah yeah! Eightball & mjg in the mothaf*%kin house,
And we came here today to talk to you about this thang called pimpin.
It has been misunderstood over the years, so now, we come to set the record straight. Niggas don't do this sh*i right it takes a special kinda nigga, knowatimsayn'? Yeah!

Eightball-
It takes a nigga that's hard from the start, you gotta have heart,
To meet a b*ich, mack her then rip her apart.
It's all in the game, a nigga can't change,
If you don't break a b*thc then your game is lame mane.
See I'm from Tennessee, with curls and gold teeth, so everywhere I go b*thces strike up conversations with me.
About the way I talk, about the way I dress,
About how my gold teeth look so fresh.
See how I bait 'em in soon as a nigga speak,
That G's voice just make a bitch knees weak.
I'm in my caddilac, chillin like a fat mac,
Smokin on a fat sac, drinkin on a pint of 'yac.
I pick up my car phone 'cause a freak beeped,
It's my niggas baby mama but some times I creep.
That's just the way it is niggas have to take a chance,
When you ain't around anybody could be in that ass.
But I'm just a young nigga tryin to make a dolla,
And the way I live, to some it's hard to swallow.
See living down south ain't what you think it be,
Nine times outta ten niggas like me, pimps.
(yeah, that's right, tryin to teach all these lames
How to do this shit, 'cause it's really a hard job.
But them lame niggas, they make me get so high)

Course-(Woman/eightball)
And I just can't stand to get my feet off the ground
(i get so high)
And I just can't stand to get my feet off the ground
(i get so high)

Mjg-
Now let me explain a pimp a nigga about the m-o-n-e-y
See a hoe break a hoe, and try to influence the bitch
To turn a trick for the nigga who, presuaded her to sell ass
Like a hoe is supposed to
Now how the fuck you think as pimp is slippin?
Surrounded by all these hoes that's going and giving me money
It's funny how a hoe could make you thinks she's wit 'cha
When all the time she's just another niggas gold digger
Mjg got a bitch for a rich trick, take of your business,
Bring me my money, yeah this shit is thick
Hoe don't violate, b*itch you know I taught you better,
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter.
Train your woman to break a man, man meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game same 'ol same to make your pimpin bigger
Slicker the pimpin gets, freaker gets the bitch,
mjg is rich, I'm coo-coo for these tricks, I'm a pimp.
(yeah that's right baby, I'm pimpin so what you need to do is
Set that ass out and uh, right about now I'm finna fire up one of these spliffs, and get so high)

Course-(Woman/Mjg)

Eightball-
Part two, it's all the same g,
Trying to school fools on this P-I-M-P
Lesson 1- first you should, pull a bitch fuck her good
The next time tell her no, but the next time take her dough.
Oh! You gotta watch your back too mane
'cause there's a lot of bitches in the world with much game
Lesson 2 watch that hoe, don't trust her wit none of yo dough
Never let a bitch know how you make your cash flow
Lesson 3- if you don't tell that how who is boss,
Bitches like to run shit but end up gettin smacked in the mouth
See a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
Push her head into the wall til you hear the crackin sound
Drown in the tub, rub-a-dub dub
Some niggas get pu*sy whipped then fall into a love bug
Buyin hoes this, buyin hoes that, then braggin to your friends
How you fuck her from the back
Never how you  took they cash, never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes, fuck 'em then drop 'em fast
I don't understand your plan at all man
You should be around niggas like me pimps
(yeah man these niggas a trip knowatimsayin?
But niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs to keep my mind off that shit, but when I smoke, I get so high)

Course-(Woman/eightball)

Mjg-
Where ever there's a hoe there's bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can attempt
A sucker will spend all his money 'til he ain't got nothing left
Instead of blaming a bitch he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldn't be a hoe if it wasn't for the trick
But I suggest we keep 'em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It needs to understood, there wouldn't be one without the other
So why in the hell these folks tryin to sweat a mother fucka
Jealous sucka just maaad they can't hang wit the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimps game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin is dead
When nigga you know it's alive pimpin been misunderstood
By those who can't that's why they said it died
Others tried pimpin but was only making chump-change
One track minded niggas never run a m-train
Re-arrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn aint that a bitch (echo)
niggas like me, a pimp
(Mj fuckin G, P-I-M-P, stand down on this pimpin
About these hoes, but some niggas fucks it up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high)

8Ball & Mjg,Shot Off,/8/8ball+mjg/shot+off_20418283.html,"[Intro: Eightball]
He he he, yeeah

[Verse 1: Eightball]
What kind of nigga always run his mouth like a hoe
Like his jaw got a battery, this nigga always know
Who got robbed, got shot, who got put on lock
Nobody invited you and still you got up in the spot
Me, I'm not a witness, keep my distance, mind my business
You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it cause they know it's real
Like ugk, ""we keeps it real"" mobbin' through the field
Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggaz know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill
You try to stop it, get yo' shit broke up in twenty pieces
We roll deep in brand new vehicles wit secret features
Game preachers move yo' pimpin' for you mamasitas
We players on the field, y'all niggaz in them bleachers

[Chorus: Eightball - (Repeat 2X)]
You talkin' down behind my back (uh) you done shot off nigga
Fifty, four or twenty sack, you done shot off nigga
If you fly and got a gun (uh) when the drama come, you run (uh)
You know what you just done, you done shot off nigga

[Verse 2: mjg]
Man, come on now, you done shot off just like Mike Davis lost a knockoff
Or his tight-ass shirt when the button pop off
You standin' it's snowin' you got yo' shoes and socks on
Who holds the key? No fucking bout it, I broke the lock off
I grew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off
I'm gettin' hot and startin' to boil, don't turn the pot off
You just affected wit it, pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe ya snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' beacuse you not boss
M-J-G, pimp tight, I'm movin' yo' spot off
And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off
And livin' on the edge rebellin' I'm never dropped off
Like Aaron Hall, ""Don't Be Afraid"" bitch, call the cops off

[Chorus: Eightball - (Repeat 2X)]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now you can either check yo' ego at the do' (door) or let the drama unfold
And check my Rap Sheet, bitch, I'm almost ten million sold
I'm only rappin' cause I want to, I got enough plaques
Needless to say, my favorite rappers told me to get on this track
And so I did it, quickly wrote my sixteen down and spit it
By the end of the verse you'll say, ""once again, Ludacris SHIT it""
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass
I keeps it, ""gangsta, gangsta!"" shooters and shanksters
Until you shot off motherfuckers, I'm a ""thank ya, thank ya!""
Runnin' yo' mouth behind my back until you run out of time
But at least yo' talkin' let's me know some millions stay on yo' mind
It ain't nothin' wrong wit that
Tell em grabbin' the thang and then I put it to yo' brain
And change everything you ever hope fo' (for) wit the. 44
You'll be fallin' back
And Yacht - is what I'm drinkin' steady thinkin' bout these pinks chasin'
I'm bout to bring home the bacon

Jump up like a old fat lady at church
Jump back like a uncut thang at work

Fire the green up and let me shoot the shit witcha
Talk slick till I make a chick get the picture

Oh Lord, we going to get it jumpin like revival
Survival, Straight from my street bible

Shit, I had hoes way before I was nationally famous
I was in the hood strapped up good
Watchin' my anus
I'm a target splitter
The world strongest man hardest hitter
Even though you hate
I still elevate regardless nigga
Step to us boy, look what you done started
And we don't even care that your arsenal be the largest

[Hook: 8 Ball & mjg, P. Diddy]
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone

[Verse 2: 8 Ball]
Look, you niggaz play too much mayne
You need to pump yo' brakes
Keep a heater nigga need for them restless snakes
Right in my face caught a case tryin' to defend my space
Dodging snitches police niggaz jumping state to state
What kind of nigga run his mouth and snitch out everybody?
The kind of nigga that's gone end up being a dead body
Yo' wife and children gone be searching for their dear ol' daddy
They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggaz will fuck you like a dirty hoe
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor
See you in public fuck who with you let the thang go
A nigga tell you don't let business turn personal
Fuck what they say cause for gram a nigga hurtin' you
Niggaz out here hurtin' fool
Nothing is for free mayne
Fuckin' with the game
That's how that shit be mayne

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: 8 Ball]
I was torn this bitch came from the streets I was born
Pussy like a little kitty back yellow as corn
I don't go around poppin' shit wit' niggaz who talkin'
Them niggaz ain't talkin' no more
Closed coffin
Not often do you see a nigga loyal as I
Like that boy from Best Eye nigga ready to die
For my bread and them niggaz that considered me family
Hold it down mayne I got you til we up there wit' granny

[Verse 4: mjg]
Cause as soon as I start writing
I start going through physical
Deeper into my spiritual
I'm so fuckin' lyrical
Mjg the realest the truth the definition
Just call me the competition
I'm still stomping and pimpin'
I'm still working with Diddy, still fuck wit the hood
I got the key to the city, the streets is all good
My leather is all wood, my gun is still secluded
I'm still hoping and praying to God I don't use it

and walk around inside my head
but you can stay
as long as you want
until you feel pressured to say
whichever this and that's will fail without no play

If you want it
you can have it
pressures there
just go away
I really want you
but I can't have you
straighten your life out
do what you wanna
just go away
Everyday
just go away

Clock strikes 9
but upside down it's 6
and I hate time
cause when it's 6 it's 9 and this wasted trip
down the way
all these months of silence, silence
Can't you stay?

Melting in the flames of fires warmly glowing

When it leaves you feeling numb.

Where did the stars go?

What's the use in lying
When you're not true to yourself
And summer's way to soon
And I can see you cryin'
With your good book on the shelf
Underneath a hazy moon

Why is it we find peace, in looking up at the sky
The clouds, the stars, the moon
Will always try and pass us by
But we have to remember
To not float up there together
When what's important is down below, looking right back up at it...

What's the use in lying
When you're not true to yourself
And summer's way to soon
And I can see you cryin'
With your good book on the shelf
Underneath a hazy moon

Trees will always fall, branches sometimes break
But here is where we'll be safe
Sittin' on the deck we made."

But nothing seemed to do the trick
No juice could beat my Five Alive
Unreal assorted fruit juice mix

The other day I was at school
Sipping my Five Alive, looking cool
Bumped into you and spilled my juice
All over you, felt like a fool
But you just looked at me and smiled,
""Hey baby, I like your style""

You like Five Alive, and I like you
You like Five Alive, and you're cool
I like Five Alive, and you like me
I want to have some after school with you

You drink so fast it makes me sick
You're my Five Alive sidekick
Every day you cheer me up
With Five Alive in a plastic cup
You're my juiced-up sugarbaby
If you asked me now, I might say maybe
I want you to be
My Five Alive lady

Get your Five Alive

Don't be left behind

Do you really wanna live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody, some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young

It's hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fleeing horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever?"

And don’t get mad at me because your girl was on my dick,
You know that we’re rocking the computer – Steven Hawking
And if that bitch hangs up on me again you know I’m walkin…
Like Christopher – never catch me kissin on the mistletoe cause this is missile crisis time to light em up – go

Cold woman – she sucked me in…
No air – and I’ll never see the light again…

I fell into a black hole…

Don’t get angry bird like I just hopped out the pig pen
I’m used to havin hands on me – yeah you can call me Big Ben
It’s time to get stupid – yeah it’s time to get Kardashian
So pour that whiskey deep and hand that motherfucking flask again
You’re a massive black hole – and you say that I’m the asshole
When I saw you at the last show – you were on me like a shadow
Up the creek, no paddle – tell my Mommy and my Dad oh I aint never comin back
She sucked me in a black hole

To get back to a bar attack
To brush up on his battle rap

We wear plaid after labor day and still get ass
We're high-class, low brow, over bomb beats
Cloggin' more ateries than the drive-thru at Arby's.

Gagged with Abercrombie while your girl rides up on me
And I'm callin' up your sister and we're cuddling to Amelie.

Everywhere I go, they seem to scream the same name

The nights of my weekend
Pretending a life
I'd only seen in spinning lights
I went my boys to move form mice to men
If I had the choice to go out
All those night I'd stay

I know I don't have to fight
So slow of an afterbite
That nobody has a clue
That she did what she had to do

And so, rest of you
Let go of that mess you do
Head throw off the chest if you
Think you know what's best for you
Because

Yeah, I'm workin
Yeah, I'm workin
To make butter for my piece of bun

And if you say I'm not ok
Then that's the goal
If you say there ain't no way that I could know
If you say I aim too high from down below
Well, say it now cause when I'm gone
You'll be callin but I won't be at the phone

Ink cards were stacked
Smoking a pack with spirits in the back yard
Of robbie's first parties thinking that I was hard
They probably all saw me and applauded
Cause god is a comedian
And I'm made from a piece of him

I know I don't have to fight

The shade of red for every kind of man that you would call again
The prince is sitting on the castle of mirages (self-shot artists)
In the bathroom that’s where you make your collages

I’m the farthest reaching planet from the star where you were standing
That should be obvious but dammit this ain't how I planned it
The hardest part of breaking up is first put on the granite so Imma try and manage

Shallow nights, shallow days
Teach me how to live with all this poison under my veins
I’ve become the person that I hated the most when I was young

Black zipper pretty in the bed of a pickup truck
With a 40 of whatever like who gives a fuck (Quick duck)
When the lights are flashing and the city is like non-stop
And you’re driving back and forth like it was a pawn shop
I’ll be in the back of the bar taking shots to the head like Og Bach

Put another quarter in the juke cause I don’t wanna let this song stop
This goes out to the young hearts that aren’t right in some spots
That blow up like sun spots and leave you with blood clots
And to the dumb trots who think they can play my heart strings
I’m just gonna open up and let the dark sing

Shallow nights, shallow days
Teach me how to live with all this poison under my veins

Cutting through the conversation like cocaine

Bathed himself in bleach until he was completely soaking.
His hands were sore
Oh yeah, they were so sore.
He scrubbed so hard he wiped the tiles off the floor.
His mop was fancy

You should have seen the way he cleaned it all when he was dancing.

Perfectly clean, he was a well oiled machine.
There was a never a wrench thrown into the gears.

Havocs increased, never know dirt on the barrel.
Increased the burner fire until his body's clean and sterile.
Fingernails trimmed, he is completely primmed and preep.
Wears the rubber gloves, and he is careful of what he eats.
There's plastic on the furniture, by nature he's a skeptic.
Unsure about the air outside, so he seals off all the exits.
Lysol's life long member, he's always been so clean.
His food is specialy packaged, sealed, and quarantined.

Everyday, I stay the same, so you can keep the necklace That I gave to you,
I'll keep the shitty tattoos.

But I give up I can't count that far,

To right below your knees

Then this is all there can be

That leads to you, and me.

Paved the way on empty roads
Into a grave gold headstone
And the path you take might be your own
But tonight, you walk on streets of gold

Walk on streets of gold, you walk on streets of gold

Just walk away
Go on go on
Your choice is made
Go on go on
And disappear
Go on go on
Away from here

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you
Without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside

Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back come back
Come back today
Come back come back
Why can't you see
Come back come back
Come back to me

Mukha na pinahid ng pabalang.

Sa iyo lahat ay paharang dahil ayaw mong magparaya
Habang siyay bigay ng bigay at ipinauubaya lahat ng
Makakabuti kahit na pang huling butil ay iaabot sa iyo.

Parang ikay isang inutil na hindi nagiisip wala kang
Nararamdaman subukan mang pumikit wala kang
Natatandaan lagi mong inaalala ang para lamang sa yo
Walang iba kundi ikaw at kailanmay walang kayo

Mapalad ka kung hihingan mo ng tawad ay nagagalit
Ikay sasaktan at sumisigaw ng salitang pumupunit kaysa
Pilit mong kausapin ay di na sasagot akapin

Galit ko akoy lumayas at di ka binalikan
Nilimot ang lahat ng pangako at ang pagmamahal
Sumpaan natin sa isat isa di rin nagtagal

Ang gabi ay aking umaga umagay aking gabi
Akoy gumigising hindi ko kilala ang katabi
Paulit ulit na ganito ngunit ng aking makita larawan
Mo sa loob ng aking lumang pitaka ay nalaman ko

Hinanap ko ang tunay na sarili ko nakita ko nalaman ko
Ito ay nasa piling mo inipon ang lahat ng aking lakas
Ng loob ngunit bakit parang hindi rin maganda ang
Aking kutob.

Nilapitan ka at pilit na tinitigan sa mata
Akoy nagdarasal na sabihin mo saking pwede pa
Ikay hindi kumikibo at parang lumalayo tila pagibig
Mo sa kin tuluyan na natuyo"

A tod@s l@s fans de el mejor grupo
De todos, 5 (Five).

No tuve tiempo suficiente
Para conocerlos,
Desde un principio me gustó
Su música aunque no sabía
Que les pertenecía.

Ahora ya es tarde,
No valen las lamentaciones
Pero, una cosa sí sé:
Son el más bello recuerdo
Que perdurará en mi mente
Hasta mi muerte.

Nunca me cansaré de escuchar
Sus armoniosas voces,
Nunca me cansaré de mirarlos,
Por lo menos en las pocas
Fotos que conservo de ustedes.

Muere un gran concepto musical,
No los volveremos a ver juntos jamás
Más eso no quiere decir
Que no fueron algo
Importante en nuestras vidas.
Por mi parte, los tendré
Siempre presentes,
Llevaré la sonrisa que me dieron
Con sus canciones.

Espero que siempre conserven
El éxito que lograron con nosotros,
Que el camino que cada uno elija
Lo haga el ser más dichoso,
Que los haga felices.

Five: gracias por todo,
Gracias por ser ustedes
Y por ser parte de nosotros.
Los amaré hasta que me muera
Y más aún.

Y que quede claro que los
""5"" tendrán en mi corazón un
""KINGSIZE"" y que de otros recuerdos
""INVINCIBLE""s serán.

All I wanna do is get with you

Everyday round and round
I think about the times and the love I've found
Oh baby, baby
Everyday round and round
My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down
Oh baby, baby

Everyday I just can't find the time
I just wanna say
A girl like you is hard to find

You got me tripping
Because I want you bad
And you don't know
But if you give me a chance
Oh baby we'd find romance
Come and tell me are you ready to go

You got me tripping
Now baby tell me what I gotta do
Cos when I'm lying in my bed
And you pop into my head
All I wanna do is get with you

Everyday round and round
I think about the times and the love I've found
Oh baby, baby
Everyday round and round
My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down
Oh baby, baby

Well there she goes again
Running circles round my head

Yeah I know just what you're saying
But you know the girl is mine

Well maybe I can get her
If I show her what I got

What you got, I got double
C'mon give it a shot

You trying to take my girl
Trying to mess around with Mrs. Right

No, but how can I be happy
When I dream of her at night
There she is up in my head
Every time I close my eyes
So I think I'm gonna call her
Just to see if she replies

You got me tripping
Because I want you bad
And you don't know
But if you give me a chance
Oh baby we'd find romance
Come and tell me are you ready to go

You got me tripping
Now tell me baby what I gotta do
Coz when I'm laying in my bed
And you pop into my head
All I wanna do is get with you

Everybody round and round
I think about the times and the love I've found
Oh baby, baby

My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down

And I'm gonna keep on calling keep on hitting with my charms,
Until the day you finally take me back into your arms.

To individuals, gotta get it off my chest
It ain't about who's the best
Or Five being better than the next
We're just a little different from the rest
Cos see, we got each other
When things go down
And time is just too important to be messin around
So understand not what I'm trying to say
But appreciate living life day to day

So how does it feel to be the only ones
Left out in the rain cos you're phoney ones
Wake up and realise what you live is a dream
Ain't gonna be there for long even though it may seem
Like a never ending story
You in it for the money or the glory
Open up your ears or ignore me
All I'm tryin' to do is be the man I am and be the best in this world I can

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

You got to open your mind up and kick both your feet up
I'll hit you with a tale of how the five of us were meet up
We're just five guys who wanna rise to the skies
No......... We got a vision in our eyes
Now people wanna step up and try to hold us back
They wanna try to stop us getting freaky on this track
But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing
And this is how I hit you with the funk that I bring
Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect
And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check
Cos everybody knows what goes around comes around
I'll put it down with my sound

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

Reminiscing bout the time we used to share
If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin on
Gotta keep movin on

I'm trying to keep my two feet on the ground.
Constantly surrounded everywhere I turn I'm hounded,
People stop and stare and look me up and down.
Now you shouldn't feel down from what everybody says
And don't let it bother you if anybody stares,
'cause you know that at times people can be cruel,
Try to put you down make you feel like a fool.
But you got one shot now don't you ever stop,
Keep your dreams high keep reachin' for the top,
'cause you know and I know if they had the chance
They'd be climbin' up on the stage trying to dance.

[Chorus:]
C'mon C'mon and get together.
Lets take a chance, it's now or never,
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation.
C'mon C'mon and get together.
Start living your life like it's forever.
Don't wanna stop if you're dreamin',
Let everybody know what you're feeling.

Questions I can't answer got me going round in circles.
Make me feel as though I'm losing self control.
It's feeling like a dream to me. I've lost a touch of reality
Deep inside I've searched with my soul.
Now it's good to keep searching and bettering yourself
But don't push too hard 'cause it's bad for your health.
And running round in circles will always get you dizzy.
And thinking too much that will make your head busy,
So just sit back and relax, you gotta chill.
I promise that all of your dreams will be fulfilled.
One day if you keep on looking you'll find,
You just gotta go with your heart and your mind.

[Chorus x6]"

And girl I think about you all of the time
And even though words are hard to say,
Girl I miss you... Never thought I'd feel this way.

If you keep on taking, my heart you'll be breaking,
So why do you do this to me?
You know how I'm feeling... It's you I believe in,
Baby can't you see that I need you?

Chorus
(You know that it's true...)
Every time I see your face I miss you baby
(You know that it's you...)
I want to let you know you're driving me crazy.
I'd do anything to help you to see, I don't think you understand what you're doing to me.
(You know that it's true...)
Every now and then I want to call you baby.
(You know that it's you...)
I say a prayer that you'll come back to me lady.
(Oh yeah...)
Life ain't anything alone can't you see?
You're an angel in my eyes,
Everyday you're closer to me.

Nobody's there when I call your name, (ah, ah)
And nights are cold girl without your flame.
(Nights are cold girl, without your flame...)
But if I could girl I'd make you see. (I'd make you see, yeah)
That I'm sorry, and that I need you here with me.

Chorus

Every day reminisce with the past,
Of a love that we thought would last.
How we used to be when it was you and me.
How did it all disappear so fast?
There are days that I can't forget
There are things that I now regret.
I was there for you when you were there for me, and I was thinkin' we were set.
Every night when I'm laying in my bed
I hear your voice going round in my head,
Think of all the things I could have done and all those things I could have said.
I really will make it up to you
I know now what I've got to do,
It took time but now I've realised how much I'm missing you."

I can always drive your body crazy,
Cos it's you that I adore,
I don't wanna love just anybody,
I just wanna make you mine,
All I need is just a little baby,
All I need is a little time.

If you really want it in your face,
Then we better make it clear,
Take a good look around you baby,
There's five boys standing here.

Is there any time to talk about it?
Cos darling we're a pair,
It's now or never if you want it baby,
Come take it if you dare!

Is there any time to talk about it?
Cos talking does no good,
Just a little bit of lovin baby,
I'd take it if I could,
Just come a little closer baby,
I wanna sink you deep,
You better call your mother baby,
Cos we won't get no sleep, No, No!

Concentrate while I hit you off straight,
Open up you mind,
Get you hungry,
Make you wait,
Baby boo,
What I gotta do is get it on with you,
Cos the skies the limit anything we wanna do,
Can we kick back now?
Tell me baby can I lay ya?
Upon ya back now it's gonna happen as a way,
We gotta take you to the top and never stop,
And when the cop,

Gimme a shot.

But he likes a little drink so he can't drive far.
He used to have a mini but he's six foot four.
Mr Zuvaloppa don't want it anymore.

Yo you gotta sit back relax while
I hit you with a tale of a guy
Who would try but he's always gonna fail
M I S T E R Z he doesn't realise
That it wasn't really meant to be
Him up at the top he never wanna stop

The fool up in the pool doin' a big
Belly flop
Now even sunbathing he could never get
It right

Of the night.

Make a honey shake her booty so I kick it some more.
You know the score how they rock a freaky move up on the spot
Never wanna stop, temperature is hot.

Make 'em boogy for me when I verbally freak that.

Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand,
Now and forever, Until the time is through

I'll be waiting!

How can I tell you, so that you can see,
You know that, Love has a meaning,
When you are here with me (When you are here with me baby)

Give me a moment before you go,
There's something you ought to know.

[Chorus:]
Baby now and forever,
Until the time is through (Until the time is through),
I'll be standing here,
Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you),
Trying to make it clear,
Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand,
Now and forever, Until the time is through

There is no one to comfort me,
Here in my cold reality,
I'm searching for words,
What can I say to make you see.

Baby now, Until the time is through, I'll be Here. [2X]

Until the time is through (Until the time is through),

They would know that isn't true
If they lost someone like you, oh

Some things can never be replaced
Some things are with me for always
These are the things I will remember
When I remember when
I'd rather love and lose it all
Than never have you to recall
These are the things I will remember

You taught me how to love
I am all I am because of you
Just because of you
Everytime I lost my way
You shined a light
And made my day
You see me through
Yes you see me through

So who's gonna come around
To heal this broken heart
Show me how to laugh and cry
But never how to say goodbye

You carry on, you do
And it's okay (when I remember when)

And I will live to love another day

The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse.
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence.
Ignore the signs.

From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.

[Chorus 2]

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.

From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise."

I'd come to you like a man dogg... It ain't like that between us
See what it is, is...
You talkin' to these niggaz... And these niggaz got you goin'

[Verse 2:]
Them niggaz told you I blew up
And I forgot about us
The same niggaz who was with you and afraid to bust
How could you listen to these niggaz?
When they mean no good
Mothafuckers aint even from our hood
And know you snortin' furl with 'em
Off in that world with 'em
And Father forgive him
He dance to some other rhythm
Ever thought that we could work it out?
We would meet
But as long as you with them niggaz
I'll be with that heat
And that's deep
Cause I made a promise to your mama when we was only 12
I'll deliver you from evil and keep you alive and well
Guess I gotta disappoint her
But you leave me no choice...
Callin' my crib, with this murder-murder tone in your voice
What... I'm a bitch or somethin'?
I used to fight for ya
Used to let you stay at my mama crib
When shit jsut wasn't right for ya
Look what you do me in return...
I guess I played with fire
So eventually it burns

Kinda glad P took me
Off the streets to make duckies

Because I got a pair of Jordans won't be out for at least two months

Come on girl, P. and C...
Sinners doin' the track...
Long as you thuggin'...

Chorus: Tyron (Master P)

Girl (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
You don't even know my name (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
But then why'd you spit my game (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
Maybe we can chill for a lil' while (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
Girl (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
Cuz I like it jazzy style (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
I can make it worth your while (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)
You will never want another (Keep it thuggin' and I got you girl)

Verse 1: (Tyron)
Girl, your so sweet, you make me weak
And there will never be another like me
I'm for real, I'm tellin' you how I feel
Cuz my life is the bomb girl

Verse 2: (Master P)
I wanna be your best friend girl, call me Poppi
Hit me on the celly, you need me you got me
I wanna show ya another side of life
Like mansions, Benz's, Roley's, ice
You could be my best friend, let's thug together
Tattoo my name on your leg, we could ride forever
I went to jail baby, you was the first to visit
We met in the hood so you my ghetto princess
Like Bonnie and Clyde so I got ya back
Matchin' championship rings like Kobe and Shaq
Whatever the kids need then I got you boo
Twin new Benz's, your's red, mine blue

[Chorus]

Verse 3: (Curren$y)
Yeah, yo ma I hatin' or nothin'
But if you waitin' for a dude to do you good then you waitin' for nothin'
You need to get wit' a playa like me
We could sit and talk on the couch in the V.I.P.
And I know how these fools be
In the club, rockin' costumes, jewelry, tryin' to feel on your booty
But that ain't even my style
I know I got a rep on the streets and these girls say I'm wild
Yeah, I was a dog, but that's in my past
This club too loud, we could hop up in my Jag
And we could go wherever you want
Hit the mall in the mornin', you could shop til' you fill up the trunk
Uh, I know this sounds nice
So won't you go and tell your girls that your leavin' wit' Curren$y tonight
Uh, young playa got game, so proper
So relax baby girl, once I got you, I got you

[Chorus]

Verse 4: (Choppa)
Now girl I know ya want me, I can see in your eyes
But ya used to fake playaz who be feedin' ya lies
I don't have no weak mind so I don't fall for the lame
Either I get you or you get me but it's all in the game
I ain't never been a dog but I'm off of the chain
Like deed, I'll make you sweat, unless it's all for my name
See the ladies love Choppa, they say that it's on
And I'ma be a playa playa til' the day that I'm gone

[Chorus]

Outro: (Master P)

Nigga sent me some beats... But I don't want that
In '89 I had a Benz, you ain't had a buck
I bought your only fuckin house, and your first fuckin truck
You pawn your rolley boy?
Oh... You doin' bad?
Stop trickin' to them hoes, and you wouldn't be on your ass
Now when times got hard
You ran your mouth like a bitch
Sold your soul to the devil, when you ran with other cliques
You ain't no soldier boy
Take that tat off your stomach
Nigga talkin' bout he love me
But bitch you love my money
Now if greed come between me and my niggaz
May god bless his soul
And I hope he forgive me

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
These fake niggaz gon' fall off
We gonna be around for a minute
That's why niggaz, shoot shots and run
We stick around and finish
Now... See me dogg?
I'm around to win it
And I don't fuck around with you niggaz
Stop step the fuck away from around my Bentley
I'm bought to blow off these fake niggaz head
Sayin' ""what's wrong with Slim?""
Them niggaz fake P
That's why there's no fuckin' songs with them
We put our money together
Just like we started with crack
We let a couple niggaz shine
We bought to take it back
You know it's mic's now nigga
We started with gats
Let a nigga play me on the streets
So dogg, I ain't gonna start with this rap
Gonna let them fake niggaz go
That's how we gonna settle down
If we hustle we stil be rich bitch... If we never rap

Life is serious out here on these streets
[Erica Foxx]
Got us curious but were just trying to eat

[Krazy]
Why cry now inhale the pain is gone
I know it was your baby daddy I saw you kiss him
Get your life back together it's time to move
Hold up little boy screaming Jesus I miss him
Ain't nobody gonna treat you they way he did
Now you grab him and smile remember your man
He left you with biggest gift he made a kid
With no money for the baby never held a job
Even though the life you want it didn't go as plan
What you blushing I know you love my nigga
When the rent was due he always grab the chopper and ride
You was mad at the funeral seeing his hoes
In the casket at 22 he didn't figure
You chose to love my nigga that you met in the Ville
But he kept it real with you like an thug suppose
You gonna always love my dog even though he got killed

[Chorus 2x's]
Smile know Kendall I know you miss my nigga
[Master P]
Two kids to raise without an father figure
You and Bobby Phills always suppose to be together
And your youngest son screaming my daddy going to heaven
Cause my nigga had G and you know he could rise
And everytime you see ball make you wanna cry
From the ghetto to the palm trees
From the streets to the big league
We pour liquor caused he moved on
And at the funeral made jokes about his birthday
You she'd tears but you stayed strong

His last words was same time but a different place
[Mac]
[Chorus 2x's]
And a time I burn a cross
For the nigga I lost
One slug took the life of my young thug in cold blood
R.I.P. To every daddy on Ken D
I'm missing ya'll till this cold earth send me
Sippin a sprite
Breakin my life
Till I bed wrinkle
When the day turn night and just write
Dippin these hoes till I plant sequel
Running around with that desert eagle
I got a call from my uncle state
Like it was a bit legal
Said it will be a while for they let him out them gates
Drop the phone as the tears hit the tip of my ears
I'm gonna disappear if he gotta serve more years

All the time baby I'm on the grind baby

Put them 20's on my Benz so you know I got so mens
Keep your eyes on your enemies and nigga watch your friends
See in this game you get schisted I get some niggas that don't like me
See the Ghettos trying to kill me, and the feds wanna indict me
On a murder I didn't do, I'm still thuggin with the crew
Because once you snitch then you threw but if u hustle then you true
Would you live for this shit? would you die for the click?
Sell your soul to get rich and run your mouth like a bitch

Chorus(2x)

Nigga we hustle the streets so lets fuck the police
My enemies don't want to see a nigga up on his feet
I got the chrome for the haters and burbs on the table
Give my life for my niggas and we splittin the paper
They say thuggin is the secret that help a nigga fall
OZ's flippin quickly to see we never fall
The grind got us strapped with 9's on our lap
The crime is a trap chop dimes of crack
Hennesy got your mind if you slip you might die
Penitentiaries give us time I'm fighting for mine
If I die in this game send my soul to God
I'm making mine in this game even though it's so hard

I'm a soldier see the tank on my neck?
Mr. Magic is my name y'all better give me respect
You might remember me from seein' me postin' up on the block
With A. 45 Glock
And a mouth full of rocks
Hustlin' like I didn't even care
Wakin' up my neighbors poppin' pistols in the air
Tryin' make a million pullin' all night flights I'm praying 'cause I'm
Knowin that my life ain't right
Forgive 'cause I'm wrong but I'm begging or forgiveness
And now I'm hustlin' in a whole other business
Tryin' to do right for the people that I hurt
In the process of growin up
I've change my ways I guess that's why I'm blowin up
I'm comin' back for all my peeps
Just try to stay alive and keep your ass off the streets
For the ones that gotta hustle just to eat
Lord, I say a prayer for you before I fall asleep

How man heard Sky's the Limit?
Shit I ain't finished this is only the beginning
I'm with no limit
Just think I'm in my prime
If I'm not the best just give me some time and I'll change your mind
Niggas like me hard to find
Genuine I'm the only of my kind young black and full of pride
With a mind to teach the whole world
If you just listen to my words
Y'all can feel my pain
A lot of years wasted, buku friends died a lot of wet faces
The other half caught a bunch of fuckin' cases
So still a lot of tender spaces
Wish I could erase the hate
Who said money makes you happy?
It can never bring back my daddy
So fuck the Navi and Caddie
I'm hopin' y'all could hear me
'cause I'm speakin' this from the heart
Me and my fans never torn apart

And to the haters that be hatin' on my click
Find a spot in line or suck a nigga's dick
I'm gettin a lot of call now
Bunch of fake bustas I couldn't ever trust ya,
Fuckin blood suckers
Want me for the gift that you never thought I had
I saw your other side, but fuck it I'm mad
You say a lot of shit but you never ponit the finger
I'm guessin' that Mr. Magic gon' remember
Surprisin' a lot of so called superstars
Passive comments but really don't want go to war
Not with me my reputation stands for itself
Just pull the disc out can't keep it on the shelf go and get it like
It's the last one left
I work the piss out the people who press 'em
I thank the lord for such a wonderful blessin'
Every word that I speak is a lesson
Hard to believe that this nigga is from the projects

It's them Dogg House niggas wit' them 504 Boyz
We the real McCoys

Cock the muthafucka, No Limit niggas, we can't be stopped
Did you hear me?
Ya heard me
Record breakin'

Can't bake 'em
Real estatin'
Never hatin'
Shakin' up the game
Bringin' the major pain
Yea nigga, we all in the same game
We enlighin'
Ignitin'
Never fightin'
And we got them muthafuckas bitin'
You fuck wit' P, you fuckin' wit' me
You fuck wit Silkk, you fuckin' wit' me
You fuck wit' D, you fuckin' wit' me
Nigga what, that's my whole family

Chorus 2x [Krazy]
What, you bitches goin' to war now (war now)
No Limit got this rap shit on lockdown (lockdown)
Wild out, bitch niggas when we come through (come through)
I hope you wear a vest, souljas touchin' you (touchin' you)
I'm bustin' you


I'm on the run, I head west wit' the dogs
504, that means ball til' u fall
I ain't bout' no playin' nigga, it's on and poppin'
You either workin' wit' those boys, or you out ther shortstoppin'
Now keep you eyes on the prize nigga, don't fuck wit' the hos
'cause you see at night in the bricks nigga, anything goes
Now you can bulletproof you chest, and they'll bust your head
NIgga you scared to pop, then you could get an early grave
'cause, one time don't worry me
I'm a third ward nigga til' they bury me (hahaa)
Two times nigga, shut it down
It's No Limit, we it on lock wit' the pound

Chorus 2X

[Krazy]
Fresh out the courthouse, fuck the world, I'm finally free
Ask them bitch niggas who snitch, is they ready for me
My proverbs to the tank, believe I love it
Since that ""Bout' It Bout' It"" album, I was dreamin' of it
Ride wit' me, through the south, as I cruise through Texas
A young soldier, wit' about a hundred grand in my Lexus
On my way from Houston, after I scored the coke
I rather, step to jail than my family be broke
But I owe five hours, I can barely breathe
Please lord forgive me for my sins, I got kids to feed
Ain't no nigga in the Ivory Ville givin' me shit
They went from trick to a bitch and buy that ho a fit
But my souljas, before it's over off top
Before I'm sayin' to my dogs everytime the dope is chopped
Feel that, my niggas will ride wit' me
Snoop and Master P said that they'll die for me

Or testify on any of my homies
That's the code to the streets, ya heard me
What's up Krazy, we in here
The New No Limit, code to the streets baby

[Chorus:]
Could you tell me where my niggas at
In the pen, or the grave I'd never figure that
Could you tell me Lord what triggered that
I guess these project bricks got a nigga trapped

[Krazy]
As I inhale the weed, tears dropping as I leave the cemetery
My nigga's in the ground now, damn this life is scary
Try to hold in my pain, I drink till I'm buried
This henessey got me gone, my eyes are blurry
Face to face with reality, my dog is gone
For them bitch niggas that did it, I finger fuck my chrome
And my dogs in the penn, doing fifty to life
I'm a soldier till I die, mutherfuck 3 strikes
I remember b-balling with my niggas for fun
If I bust then you bust, I gave you my gun
Telly, dog you know I miss you, I still got love
Just to be the man you was, I'd probably drink your blood

[Chorus - 2x]

Kevin Miller you gone, but you always missed
C and Mac locked up, but we still a click
Received letters from the penn, homies feel my pain
25 caught ten, man it's just a game
When dea and the persecutors know my lawyer
See our skin tone is black, so our time is borrowed
I'm in a cell with three killas, so unleash the beast
And the judge send a word about cop a plea
They say we angry cause we can't breathe, uneducated
Facing life so it's strike three, independent
Slanging records call us coke dealers
C-Murder innocent trapped, and we gon fight it so the world gon feel us

[Chorus - 2x]

[Krazy]
Lord please accept my nigga mail
Did my homie sell his soul to get out of jail
I heard my nigga Mac finally gon make bail
We bouncing hot boy, thugging trying to make mail, the drought is hell
For my dogs still slang for livings
Thank God Black Jesus is forgiven
I try to tell my little homies, ain't no love on the streets
But my niggas don't hear shit, when it's time to eat
And these soldiers, will bust your head if you slipping
I feel like my dog P, nigga I ain't tripping
A dopefiend at 14, look what the game done did him
I can hear his mama scream as the chopper hit him

They say the top ain't acting funny
He ain't holla'd a day
He got the top back, you know his new Z28
Holla at ya (BOY!) with the 8 of us 8
But they like my rims they just non-stop (SPREWELL!)
Look like they runnin away

[Verse 2: Magic]
I'm doing 80 in the lightin
Duece trays on shine

Cus I got 4 models in the back of my truck
18"" Bazooka bumpin my stuff
Waking the BLOCK UP!

[Verse 3: Master P]
Call me Ghetto Bill cus my seats they be Gucci
And when I roll through the hood I got 2 or 3 hoochies
Lou Vaton Airbags 'case I crash bad
Futuristic kidded up like I'm Batman

Gamblin for a car, no
Hope I don't blow that, WHOA!

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
We roll big body Benz it's the navigators
In the hood, servin freaks like I'm a restaurant waiter
Blue lights on the Jag cus I love to shine
Keep it by my shorty so that we be hard to find
I ain't pay the car note, in about 3 months
I'd rather, spend my paper on Henney and blunts
Even when the truck stop those things be constant spinnin
I'm a 504 Boy so I'm constant with it

[Verse 5: Yungsta]
Roll around in tight whips
Catch me on the night shift
I'm just a Yungsta, I roll without a license
My dogs is triflin, homie you can bite when
First one in the hood on the block with the ice rims

Had these blinkin when I passed, try not to wipe out
Dash with the wood grain, still in the hood man
Catch me on lean car clean we doing big things

[Verse 7: Master P]
We leave the tags in the window, whodee

Yokahama tires, whodee, but I only got 3
No Limit Boys we thuggin I get a high for next week!

[Verse 8: Lil' Romeo]
I'm fish tailin my dad, and I'm rollin on drops
Sportin Sprewell to the curb I think I saw the cops
They call me Richie Rich, I got my name in the seats
X-Box in the front and the back DVDs
Got TVs in the head rest with the big wide screen
Got the navigation system with the phone in between
Rollin a coupe with the top down when I go outdoors
We roll on old days around here, that's 24s

[Jamaican flow]

[Verse 9]
I got that whip block paint off, my ride air ding dong

That Whoa! bitch I told ya' dick, 'welling up
We drop it like it's hotter, from the dance floor to the Ramada
Giving up them peso's, I thinks nada, look

Hook

(Master P/Nino Brown)
Now when you shake that ass, I get rocked up
You got a boyfriend boo (Wodie, my man locked up)
Everytime you wobble wobble it gets me horny
So I can ride that ass from the night until in the morning
I could respect your mind, if you could respect the game
Is it cool to fuck, or is this about some change

Hook

(Magic, Silkk/Vito)
I like it when I see 'em at the club, shaking that thang
Girl you really got me thinking 'bout taking that thang, come here
Now when they wobbly, wobbly, ass bouncing everywhere
The way she drop it like that, I can't help but to stare
Got a nigga saying ""Ohhh girl""
Come a little closer, I'm trying to make you out my boo girl
Don't move girl, I'm on my way to the floor baby
Coming for mine, want to see if you can really shake it
Let's bump and grind, girl you did that
The way you bounce it and shake it, you know I'm with that
I'm trying to get that, cause you got me rock hard
Ohh my God, got me hoppidy, hoppidy, hop, hopping like a dog, woof

Hook

(Mystikal/G-Money)
Back your ass, Whoo, the fuck up
I thought I told you, put your meanest face on for me
And them steel-toe boots, gonna stomp your ass
Want it, hunt it, some old niggas ready to jump your ass

(Krazy)
I'll be there for you baby, just beep me
Start paging soldier, when you want a freak male
I like freaking at your man's house, when he leave I toot
What would he say if he knew that I was sexing you

(C-Murder)
Let me see you wobble then shake it, then baby pop it, don't break it
You want love let's make it, I just can't wait 'til you naked
You lick your lips it makes me hard
Daydreamin' of screamin' and fiendin'
You creamin' for sex, that you gonna get this evening
Ya' heard me

And you left with that four-fifth, cocked at your do'
