Queen,'39,/q/queen/39_20112598.html,"Words and music by Brian May

In the year of '39
Assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few.
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny mornin',
The sweetest sight ever seen.
And the night followed day,
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried.

Don't you hear my call
Though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.

In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue,
The volunteers came home that day.
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born,
Though their hearts so heavily weigh.
For the earth is old and grey
To a new home we'll away,
But my love this cannot be,
For so many years have gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.

Don't you hear my call
Though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I'll take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.

Don't you hear my call
Though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand,
For my life
Still ahead.
Pity me."

Words and music by Buddy Holly

You don't like crazy music, you don't like rockin'
You just want to go to a movie show, and sit their holdin' hands
You're so square, baby I don't care

I don't know why my heart blips, I only know it does
I only want to love you baby, I guess its just because
You're so square, baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps, but I do-a-hoo-hoo
I only know why I love you like I do-a-do-a-do-a-do
You don't like crazy music, you don't like rockin'
You just want to go to a movie show, and sit their holdin' hands
You're so square, baby I don't care
Baby I don't care, baby I don't care"

It's a kind of magic

A kind of magic

One dream one soul one prize one goal
One golden glance of what should be

It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time

It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic

It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm here in secret harmonies

It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic

It's a kind of magic
The rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be will soon be
Will soon be done
This is a kind of magic
There can be only one

A cosy fireside chat
A little this, a little that
Sound of merry laughter skippin by
Gentle rain beatin on my face
What an extraordinary place!
And the dreams of the child
Is the hope of the man

Its all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky - yeah -
Mountains are zoomin higher - mm -

My world is spinnin and spinnin and spinnin

Sends me reeling

To haunt my days

A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what shed try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead all dead
And alone Im spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead
And gone
All dead...

All dead all dead
At the rainbows end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friends
All dead
And gone
All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I dont believe
Youre dead
And gone

In the dark I care, I'm holding on, I'm hoping on

Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul

Winning and loosing an inner war
Wondering what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through

No matter where youre going to
Ill be there
I'm holding on, believe it
Well be walking in the light

Coming on strong with all the chit-chat
You're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart

Making such a deal of life
You were wishing and hoping and waiting to really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen? No
You're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down
You'd better slow down

And you really get inside the groove

Then the neighbours start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open saying what's your point

We dance out of the door, dance into the street
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And all the people stare and smile and get down
Then the police man is saying ""stop this noise""
But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys

Across seven seas through the Panama,
Now they're rockin' on beaches
And they're rockin' in bars

And you want more

With your narrow minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs

Kill joy bad guy big talking small fry

Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Do you feel like suicide?
(i think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good feel good?

You talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is
Mister know-all
Was the fin on your back
Part of the deal? (shark)

You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own

It's the mistier mists the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying when you're young
And your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street we'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall
Than we did in the school hall
With the down town chewing gum bums
Watching the night life the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong
It's easier from an arm chair
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess

Went kind of smooth after a while

Oh down beside that red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round

Hey listen here

Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
Oh but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Hey big woman you gonna make a big man of me

Hear the words that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

And the voice is so clear, time after time it leeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep on building on the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Take this letter that I give you,
Take it sonny, hold it high
You wont understand a word that's in it
But youll write it all again before you die

A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you, will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will -
But the air you breathe I live to give you

Father to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried

Don't look back

Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain

Seduce you with this money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big time money, money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine

Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest

Its not easy love but youve got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hands cos friends will be friends right till the
End

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
Youre getting used to life without him in your way

Its so easy love cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hands cos friends will be friends right till the

I think I'm going back
To the things I learnt so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more colouring books
No christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can't play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasnt ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now theres more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be
My magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Then everyone debates
The true reality
Id rather see the world
The way it used to be
A little bit of freedoms all we lack
So catch me if you can
I'm going back"

Wed play all day and sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her wont you
Keep me company

Now marriage is an insinuation sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more all my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But were safe enough behind our door.

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited company

I hardly noticed sall as we
Pated company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me

But no-ones there to see

They take their lives - destroy their goals

Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts
Nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my suprise
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights what do I see
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat out of hell
I get to eat her dust
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh
I'd never known anything that counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steals my heart
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Look at the cities
Look at the streets what do you see
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you know you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Oooee baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
Hijack my heart"

Of rain on the rooftop
Velvet draped across the floor, mmh

Was a time when we measured
But never up to our fathers
The sorrow cuts
And as I stare at the blade
You've reached the dark we fear

Locked
Stitches in time
Nothing can break apart our seams

You were humble and kind
Pondering times
As I sit in a shrine
Never meant to be

Rebuilding a passion that never saw a highway
How many more miles would you bare my friend?
Like a jab to the throat
Surrealism silenced the voice
But what is left to say?

And all I can think is thank you for your time
As I reflect with pain

Locked
Stitches in time
Nothing can break apart our seams

You were humble and kind
Pondering times
As I sit in a shrine
Never meant to be

Spiraling the hourglass…

You have loved
You have seen
Through the darkest nights that steal your dreams
You have gone
Slipped away
Only time will help to ease the pain

Spiraling the hourglass"

To hear my plea
And take care of me

How can I go on
From day to day
Who can make me strong
In every way
Where can I be safe
Where can I belong

How can I forget
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found
How can I go on

But in my eyes
I cannot see
When people fly by me
I hide myself down near the ground

To look for me

Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what weve done
To the world that he created?"

Queen,It's A Hard Life,/q/queen/its+a+hard+life_20112726.html,"I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
And now you say it's over and I'm falling apart

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

How it hurts - deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
And I'm waiting for love

Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love

Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in evry way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love"

Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late - but it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

- I've been so long
- You've been so long
- We've been so long tryin' to work it out
- I ain't got long
- You ain't got long
- We gotta know what this life is all about

Too late much too late
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

It's late - but it's time to set me free
It's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late it's late it's late it's late
It's late it's late it's late it's late
It's all too late"

Lets rock, everybody, lets rock

Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock

No ones lookin', nows our chance to make a break

You bring me sorrow you cause me pain

Wake up screaming in the middle of the night

Get that sunny feeling and youre on your way.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

Do you know how it feels when you dont have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend
Youre a stranger

All you think about is suicide
One of these days youre gonna lose the fight

At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

Chorus:
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, Gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Anytime)

Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minor

But then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

Chorus:
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Anytime)

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
She'll absolutely drive you wild, wild...
She's out to get you

Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of lifes this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like youre alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day"

One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you have to put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Somedays you're feeling good, somedays you're feeeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah

It was the third of September, that day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him, never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said son
Papa was a rollin' stone, wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone, oh
Papa was a rollin' stone, (my son yeah) wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone, well well
Hey mama, is it true what they say that papa never worked a day in his life
And mama, some bad talk goin' around town sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife... And that ain't right
Heard some talk about papa doin' some store front preachin'
Talkin' about savin' souls and all the time leechin', dealin' in dirt
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said
Papa was a rollin' stone, (my son) wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey, papa was a rollin' stone, (dadgummit) wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone, ooh
Hey mama, I heard papa call himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bills
Hey mama, folks say papa never was much on thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said son
Papa was a rollin' stone, (well, well, well, well) wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Papa was a rollin' stone, (uh huh) wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone, I said
Papa was a rollin' stone, (yes he was now) wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone.

A backdrop for the girls and boys

Youve yet to have your finest hour

My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there aint nobody wants to know

I've been
Sleepin on the sidewalk
Rollin down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I've ever seen
Come on sonny wont you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin are you playin
Sure you don't mean me?

Sleepin on the sidewalk
Rollin down the road

I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

(tell you what happened. ..)

They took me to a room without a table
They said blow your trumpet into here
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin to a million fans
Nothin was a-missin
All the people want to listen
Youd have thought I was a happy man

And I was
Sleepin like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(have to have some fun. ..)

Now they tell me that I aint so fashionable
An I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told em where to stick the fancy label
Its just me and the road from here

Back to playin and layin
I'm back on the game

Sleepin on the sidewalk
Rollin down the road
I sure get hungry and I
Sure do wanna go home

Hide away find space to be alone

Every one needs to find peace sublime

The trees in the fields they russle in the wind

A misty castle waits for you and you shall be a queen
Today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey

Together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung

Don't turn around when you hear me tread
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
(John Deacon)

Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the cia or the fbi
You'll never get close
Never take me alive
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
Ha, ha, ha, hello
Who goes there?
Ha, ha, ha, ok
Who goes there?
Ha, ha, ha, hello, hello, hello, hello
Never had a real good friend, not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through, let my flag unfurl
So I'll make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world, from the edge of the world
(Brain May, Brain May)

Now I'm on your track and I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back but don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can see right through me (Watch me now)
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can see right through you
Look at me, look at me

Shake you, shake you, shake you dear"

Her little baby boy just left home today
Shes got to be the loser in the end
Shes got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and youll lose her as a friend
Shes ma on whom you can always depend

She washed and fed, and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is goodbye ma
And the nightimes for her tears
Shes got to be the loser in the end
Shes got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and youll lose her as a friend
Shes ma on whom you can always depend

So listen mothers everywhere
To just one mothers son
Youll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
Its so long since you were young

Youre bound to be the loser in the end
Youre bound to be the loser in the end
Theyll choose their new shoes that's not far to bend
Youre ma on whom they can always depend"

Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you and where do you go

Youve never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it -
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night

Here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
Fie-for the black queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on ever finger nail and toe
Weve only begun - begun
Make this make that, keep making all that noise
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey chile, yes

A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon hell deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, hell bring a little love

I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the black queen
My life is in your hands, Ill for and Ill fie
Ill be a bad boy - Ill be your bad boy
Ill do the march of the black queen

Walking true to style
Shes vulgar buse and vile
Fie-for the black queen tattos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her is

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand in hand
But now its time to be gone - forever"

Take a little love from me,
I want to share it with you

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
Could stay there, forever and ever

Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me, how I long for your love
Come back to me - be happy like
We used to be come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love - wont you come back to me, yeah

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand to the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old mans gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Oh oh people of the earth!
Listen to the warning the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand

Ah ah children of the land
Quicken to the new life take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babes
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mothers love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all round will be your dowry

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

Oh oh oh oh and two by two my human zoo
Theyll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain

Oh flee for your lives who heed me not
Let all your treasures make you fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Ah people can you hear me?
And now I know and now I know
And now I know and now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know and now I know

You wont need a jet plane or a luxury cruise.
Just take a look in my eyes, and realize the love.

I can't live without us,
So I hope that you will
Stay with me forever.
Its all I want from you.
The thought of our disintegration is killing me.

Living blind without you,
don't wanna try to live without your love.
I feel so lonely now with you gone.

But don't take for granted, your condition of me,

Lets get back to living, see what tomorrow brings.

All our dreams will come true

I feel like letting my freak flag fly
And I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car

Well, I'm not giving in an inch to fear
'Cause I've promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears, without the pain
I'm not much without you, can't leave if I wanted to
Maybe that's why you stay around

But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

Waiting by the phone, alone
And it's another rainy night without you

Living lies I knew were wrong inside
I've just begun to see the light

Long ago, there was a dream
Had to make a choice or two
Leaving all I loved behind
For what nobody knew

Stepped out on the stage
A life under lights and judging eyes
Now the applause has died and I can dream again...

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone that sees what's going on?

Read between the lines
Criticize the words they're selling
Think for yourself and feel the walls
Become sand beneath your feet

Feel the breeze?
Time's so near
You can almost taste the freedom

There's a
Warm wind from the south
Hoist the sail
And we'll be gone
By morning, this will all seem like a dream

And if I don't return
To sing the song, maybe just as well
I've seen the news
And there's not much I can do... Alone

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?

What's behind the words
Images they know will please us?
I'll take what's real
Bring up the lights

Free your mind.
Efficiency, control.
To develop the form starts with acceptance,
Then submission to the goal.

It could have been different, Dad

The word brings back
A sweet memory
I'm sitting on a bluff
On a broken tree

By my side
A distinguished man
Giving me encouragement
Telling me I can
And you know...
You're not there

You say
Son, let's forget the past
I want another chance
Gonna make it last

You're begging me
For a brand new start
Trying to mend a bridge
That's been blown apart,
But you know...

You never built it, Dad

And so I sit here through the night
And I write myself to sleep
And time keeps ticking...

(Solo)

Time has made you
Finally realize
Your loneliness
And your guilt inside

You're reaching for something
You never had
Turning around
Now you're looking back
And you know...

I'm not there

You say
Son, let's forget the past
I want another chance
Gonna make it last

You're begging me
For a brand new start
Trying to mend a bridge
That's been blown apart,
But you know...

You never built it, Dad
You never built it, Dad
You never built it, Dad
You never built it, Dad
You never built it, Dad..."

Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain

From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome

You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher

Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
(Slappin' 'em down)
One hundred, two hundred

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street

Up the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan

Outside is America
Outside is America, America

See across the field, see the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howlin' the women and children
Who run into the arms of America"

To the ends of the earth you will fly
Conquering masses in wanton deception
Blood-red your black flag waves high

Send you higher

Look around, is this the end that you have foreseen
The pain, the misery in us all
What was it that you knew? Will we one day learn it too
And together build another way, to the morning
Or will it ever come again
Youve poisoned all our hopes
We have nothing now, and what of the children
What has this done to them? Damn you for the pain
That they must feel

The last hero standing no time to turn back
Hes listening, he waits for your call
The black barren plains reflect the hope of the same
For one only waiting to fall

At that moment
When you're broken
And you struggle and sacrifice
Suddenly you feel it

This feels right
Would you wait here
Would you turn away

You'd be standing here
Standing here

On the path to my darkest day.
Searching for the answers,
All I see is damage through the haze.
Picking up the pieces of my life
With no direction for re-assembly.
The one that lays beside me
Is sharing scars of my broken yesterdays.
Will tomorrow find me hypnotized? Crying?
Mother mary in control,
Domineering stranglehold
Sowing destructive seeds
For the scavengers to feed.
Driving the nail into my head,
Memory flows like a river.
With the one that lays beside me
I'm healing scars from my childhood memories.
Tomorrow finally found me.
I'm hypnotized. I'm trying...
To understand the chapters
Of the path from my darkest day.

Or fade away into eternity?

I'm too weak to ride alone
I've come this far but have so far to go

Down on me
And when it rains it pours
'Til we all fall down

Do the pictures on the wall
Mean anything at all?
Or just your selfish way
To cope with all the pain?
At night I hear the screams
Echo in my dreams
And when I've hit the ground
You kick me when I'm down

Down
Down on me (Down on me)
Drowning me (Drowning me)
No use in pretending like we've done before
Down
Down on me (Down on me)

Nothing lasts forever, just revolving doors

Take me away
Away from all the pain
Take me in his place
So far away
Away from empty streets
The streets I've only known
Only how to roam
Roam to the other side
So take, take me
Why don't you take me instead?
We all fall
We all hurt
We all bleed
We all fall
We all hurt
We all bleed

You saw things before and after you died
Back from beyond to rule again
But this life denies you its fight to the end

Back from the dawn
Deliver us right from wrong
Kings forge the way
For your last day

You search the eyes of those
Who fear the law
Dark and light we all must keep the balance strong
One day a king will rise with the sun
The moon, and the stars
And you are he and you must die, to be
Born again, come again, once more be again the king

Mama watched your every move, but now you're all alone

Shes been gone for awhile
Daddy left some time ago, fading years pass too slow
Hes the only one, could make you smile
Oh, you're still crying

Big city bound
Gona make your mark
Read your name in the lights
All the ads and people say, beauty lets you get you way
Tried your best to prove them right

But living on the streets aint bad, sad people make you glad
Pardon me, could you spare some change
-oh, you're still crying-

Street corner girl
Watch the crowd go by
Fill your tin can with life
Summer days tend to slip away
Like your men you couldn't make them stay
Hard to choose, whiskey or a wife
Sometimes you wonder wheres the end
Where you goin where you been?
Happiness seems so hard to win
Most never care to find

Decline, right on time
What happened to the dream sublime?
Tear it all down, we'll put it up again
Another empire?

I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall
Outside your balcony I have a room with a view
And I'm watching you

I dial your telephone each and every afternoon
I wait by your door till you're asleep at night
And when you're alone I know when you
Turn out the light

I'm gonna get close to you
Oh-oh so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
I'm gonna get close

You fumble for your keys
I'm six or seven steps behind you
I'm so close to you
Are you terrified of me? What do I know about you
How did I find out?
You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic
Say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it
Its as plain as black and white

I'm gonna get close to you
Oh-oh so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
Oh so close

If you knew my infinite charm
Thered be no reason to be so alarmed
Maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm some kind of lunatic
You say I'm wasting all of my time
But I know what to do with it
It is plain as black and white

I'm gonna get close to you
Oh-oh so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
I'm like a hungry criminal
And your protection is minimal
So minimal"

I was waiting for some signal, a sign from angels.
When the tide turns against you
it's a strange sensation, a revelation of imagination.
I could change my course and face the flow,
reap the seeds that I had sewn or follow that old river south.
Here's what I found out.

I was standing on the Great Divide looking out across America.
Trying to find my truth, define it for myself.
I died the day when I saw this place.
I saw what I could lose.

A very simple mechanism separates the fool from wisdom.
The lines between us are not real.
Conditioning is what makes us feel ignorant.
And apathy will feed our hate.
So we can never give in.

There I was standing at the Great Divide, looking for the truth in America.
For all that time I searched, when I closed my eyes,
I found the thing I was looking for.
I had it all the time.

So are we standing at the Great Divide?
Is there hope for America?
Take the flag we wave, the freedoms that we sing.
Without respect for one other,
it doesn't mean a thing"

Aarmed with your razor smile cutting to the bone
My voice fell useless you flashed a quick hello
Feeling the fool, could you tell it showed?
But that was sometime ago
A memory vague and fading slow, of somewhere I'd been

Hand on heart
A promise, a word, and a voice
Hand on heart
A rhythm of hope and choice will keep us together

I don't know if I can reach that high
Its a long way to fall
Hauntingly holding my fate with a gaze
Like a child mesmerized by the candles flame
Oh what lies behind those eyes
I could only guess
That certain way you stood apart frome rest
Now where is sotime ago?
Whene everything moved in slow-mo-tion
Caught by my watering eye

Hand on heart
A promise, a word and a voice
Hand on heart
Promising I'll never go
Hand on heart
For reasons you'll never know, together through thick and thin,
Lose or win, I'll be there for you

Strange how the mind changes time and time again
Thins once important now pale in comparison

Hand on heart
A promise, a word, and a voice
Hand on heart
A rhythm of hope, and a vision of choice
Hand on heart
Promising I'll never go
Hand on heart for reasons you'll never know

At last, all too well I can see
Where we all soon will be

The myth from the man
You will see where we all soon will be

Jesus, You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good You've done
Will soon be swept away
You begun to matter more
Than the things You say

Listen, Jesus I don't like what I see
All I ask is that You listen to me
And remember, I've been Your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt You when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called You a man
And believe me, my admiration for You hasn't died
But every word You say today, is twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt You if they think You've lied

Nazareth's your famous Son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like His father carving wood
He'd have made good, tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm

Listen Jesus, do You care for Your race?
Don't You see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied, have You forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far, if we go too far

Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour

All Your followers are blind, too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful but now it's sour, yes it's all gone sour
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Won't you listen to me?"

I feel so helpless,
So I turn my gaze to another place.

Why try holding back the wave?
Youll only drown in the changes.
Youve got to learn to let go.
Just let go and experience the flight.
Try to see from a different side..
If balance is the key
Maybe well see
A future understanding,

Then we wont feel so helpless,
An turn away and hide from the change.

My global mind searches for something new.
My global mind zeros in on news.

Time and rules are changing.
Attention span is quickening.
Welcome to the information age.

I feel so helpless,
So I turn my gaze to another place.

My global mind searches for something new.
My global mind zeros in on news.
My global mind reaches out for the truth.
My global mind zeros in on you.

Its searching everywhere,
Across the mountains,
Across the oceans,
Across every man made line.
No boundary gonna keep it from you."

Seen from within the only answer to him lies
But as the rays of light begin to fade away

A woman of her kind

And I'm not walking out
Gonna give my heart away
And hope that she will always stay

Whenever you are lonely
Call for me, run to me my lady love
Won't you come and show me that precious smile
And maybe stay for a little while
Close the door, Toss the key
Say you will always be my one and only
Looking back it seems to me
The message in her eyes
Left a lasting spell on me
A feeling I can't hide
Now I'm lost in a lover's daze
And I'm not walking out
Gonna give my heart away

Shouting and cursing at someone who clearly isnt around.

My ring of brass lay rusting on the floor.
Is this all?
Because it's not what I expected.

Somewhere along the way
Friends I once held close fled the fast lane.
I didn't notice, I just had to make it.
Head down, nose in the grindstone;
The kiss of life placed on my brow
Kept sliddin to the ground
And now it's buried six feet under.

Preaching from the floor again
The same old sad song,
Bartender... Bring another drink for their favorite son.

Where did it all go wrong?
What's the use in even holding on?
Heres to love, hate... And promises.

Almost called it today.
Turned to face the void
Numb with the suffering
And the question,
Why am i...?
So many times I've tried and failed to
Gather my courage, reach again for that nail.
Lifes been like
Dragging feet through sand,
And never finding... Promised land.

Preaching from the floor again
The same old sad song,
Bartender... Bring another drink for their favorite song.
Where did it all go wrong?
I feel like I'm dying.

To promises and promised land lies."

Youll never find the answer
To a place where darkened angels
Seemed lost and never found
Scream to see the light of
Forming figures fast behind you
Lay the past in the wind to spin
And your fate will sail beyond the open plains
Sail with angels onward
Live or die for the chosen one said
Saber sights cast a spell behind you
And they lock in all around

Free the scene insider
Never looking back to find why
Ride a course till the end of time
And you'll stand atop the gate
Laying waste in a path recited
Fighting force wont avenge the guided black wing
Oh, electric might poses fright inside me
Seeing light at the end of sight reminds me
I've passed away"

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Remember me to the one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine.
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Without a seem or needlework
She once was a true love of mine.
Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
And gather it all with a basket of flowers
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
Ask her to buy me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,
Between some water and the stand
Then she'll be a true love of mine.
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

Remember me to the one who lives there

The computer word made flesh
We are one you and i
We are versions of the same
When you can see what I feel
Don't turn your back on me
Or you might find that your dreams
Are only program cards

Your mind is open for me
Open for intake of all propaganda
Your eyes see now what to see
My eyes see only the programs you give me

Ill teach you to laugh and to cry
They're really the same you'll see
All of the whys in your life
Are under my control
Feed me more lines
I will try to tell you all I can
Before the light you must know what lies
Behind my screams

I can't tell you all I know
Am I the son that youve always been wanting
There's more to me than what shows
Are you my father
The one that was promised

Hush now, I'll give all you need to know
And pre-live your dreams for you
Youre a good boy

Freedom belongs only to those
Without video screens
For eyes and mouth

You have no voice
To be heard my son
No one can hear when youre
Screaming in digital

Im not your slave
You can't control my emotions
No father, please let me keep learning

Cant you see Im human
Cant you tell

Im not your slave
Oh father no
Please don't keep me from dreaming
Oh can't someone hear"

Looking for the vandals and they're nowhere to be found

Would someone please let me know how we have spun out of control?
Has the captain let go of the wheel?
Or could we please try to find a way to be a bit more kind?
I see the road to tomorrow in the haze!

Wipe away the teardrop from your eye

You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head

Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game
Of life

So here it is, another chance
Wide awake, you face the day
Your dream is over...

Or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night

Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize
And you were scared

It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind

Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you'll hear and see
This magic new dimension

I
Will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I
Will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you

In silent lucidity...

Spoken:
Visualize your dream (Yes)
Record it in the present tense (Don't be scared)
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve a dream control
(Control)
(How're you doing today?) (Better?)

Dream come true
Dream come true
Dream come true

Help me...

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see

The walls you built within
Come tumbling down
And a new world will begin

Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly

A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize?
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...

I
Will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I
Will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you..."

We held the world.
Wrapped round our finger tips
Laughing at what others missed. Someday, yesterday
The magic we felt went away.
Grow up somebody said... Tell me where it's gone
So I can go find it now. I can't live your way.
Go ahead without me.
Ill find my own way

Some people fly... And some of us worry about touching
The sun with wings. I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,
Keeping my eyes on the sky.

The box you live within is strong and it's up to you
To see beyond the comfort zone youve grown to love.
There's more to life than that. The expectations
That you hold will keep you down and make you old
If you can't see what I'm trying to say, maybe you just
Need to wear my shoes for awhile. I can't live your way.
Go ahead without me.
Ill find my own way

Some people fly... And some of us worry
Id risk it all to have wings.
I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,
Keeping my eyes on the sky.

While you sit there and think about it, there's another
Unfolding their wings. I can tell you what it's like, but,
Until you try, you'll never see what I mean.

Ill touch the sky with my wings.

Queensryche,Someone Else?,/q/queensryche/someone+else_10237299.html,"When i fell from grace i never realized
How deep the flood was around me
A man whose life was toil was like a kettle left to boil
And the water left these scars on me

The chains i wore were mine, dragging me towards my fate
Planned for me long ago

I played by all their rules, went to their right schools

Who was i to question?

They used to say i was nowhere man
Heading down was my destiny
But yesterday i swear that was
Someone else not me

Here i stand at the crossroad's edge
Afraid to reach out for eternity
One step when i look down
I see someone else, not me

I know now who i am, if only for awhile
I recognize the changes
I feel like i did, before the magic wore thin
And the baptism of stains began

Sacrifice, the always say... is a sign of nobility
But where does one draw the line in the face of injury?
I'm just trying to understand

Standing here at the crossroad's edge
Looking down at what i used to be
A drowning man, trying to stay afloat
Heavy with the past, but somehow keeping hope
That there's something more that is seen
But it's somewhere out of reach

So i keep looking back
Looking back and i see someone else

All my life they said i was going down
But i'm still standing stronger proud

And today i know, there's so much more i can be
I think i finally understand

From where i stand at the crossroad's edge
There's a path leading out to sea
And from somewhere deep in my mind
Sirens sing out loud, songs of doubt, as only they know how
But one glance back reminds and i see
Someone else, not me.

I keep looking back at someone else... me?"

Selling skin, selling god

Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine

Midnite, she sings praises in the hall
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall
Sister mary, virgin mary, silent with her sin

She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks

Mary, mary just a whore for the underground
They made you pay in guilt for your salvation
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you

My faith is growing, growing tight against the seam
What we need is trust, to keep us both alive
Help us make it through the night

Binds my arm and feed my mind
The only peace I've ever known
Ill close my eyes and you shoot

No mary, listen, youve got to pull your strength from my lips
I pray I feed you well
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long
For what you gave to everyone
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed
From my barrel of death, he turned the holy water red
As he died he said thank you
I just watched him bleed

Sweating hands like fire, and flames
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial rite
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight

Mary, sweet lady of pain
Always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time

No time to rest yet
Weve got to stop his game
Before madness has the final laugh
Too much bloodshed
Were being used and fed
Like rats in experiments
No final outcome here
Only pain and fear
Its followed us both all our lives
There's one thing left to see
Will it be him or me?
There's one more candle left to light

Don't turn your back on my disgrace
The blood of christ can't heal my wounds... So deep
The sins of man are all I taste
Can't spit the memory from my mind
I can't cry anymore

Eternal life was her debt to pay

The lady wore black

The lady wore black
See the years through the tears in her eyes
The lady wore black
Her mystic power calls to me
The lady wore black
Her love can set me free

The wind song whispered a warning
Telling me to beware
Of the quiet shadowed woman
And of the sadness I would share

We sat together for sometime together in silence
Never speaking in words
Of all her thoughts she spoke with her eyes
And I listened remembering all I heard

See the years through the tears in her eyes

Her love can set me free

The words she spoke were of forgotten lives
And of all knowledge gained
Memries I had and didn't know why
With a smile she explained
I should have listened to the winds cold warning
And walked the other way
I touched her soul and now I bear her sentence
But for her love I'll gladly pay

Picked to displace the leaders
Countering objectives

Each one a story but they end the same
Ill hide away in here the law will never find me

And scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete

anchor the canopy of life that's above.
The answer to the mystery of life is _

and drank the potion from the magic man.
Held the starlight inches from my face,
pushed the door open, # 7.
I walked the path way to heaven.
Saw the same face of God.
Seems every where I go
I see the same face, I feel the same flow.
With every one I meet and every hand I shake,
I'm every man, trying my best to get to know
because everything's at stake.
We're the same tribe.
Passing through Morocco for the faithful is a trip.
Hallucinating visions drives my desert ship.
For a thousand miles we could not fail,
can't enjoy if you can't inhale.
Clearly a lifetimes need of some experience and

You talk in circles of rhyme
Seer of places future and past
The warning you gave us is surely our last

Warning!

Behold the child, his pointing hand
Is raised in solemn grace
His eyes once wide with learning wonder
Now leave stains upon his face

Now see the hands of the working man
Hes leaning back against the wall
Once busy hands are idle now
Standing ready for the fall! Our fall!

For those that claim to see
The blind will stay not choosing to die

Life seems strange and hard sometimes, maybe I wont make it this time.
Oh they've taken all I have, but I just need what's left of today, and you can wash it all away.
When it all comes down and I'm feeling tired and afraid,
Youre always there, and seem come when I've nothing left to give away.

Now I wait for your winds to come and give me breath for another day, and your rain to wash me.

I feel the rain coming. I feel it in my heart, take away my pain.
I feel the rain coming. Wash me down, wash me down.

Here comes the rain. Hold me now, just for awhile.

I feel like a candle flame in the wind. The dust of my deeds past, covers me, like a fading lie.

I feel the rain coming. I feel it in my heart, wash away my pain.
Wash me down, wash me down. I feel the rain coming.

Here comes the rain."

Spreading like a new disease, where heroes lay to rest
When we watch our idols fall, a revolution call

Now I'm standing in the crossfire
Now I'm raising up my fist
And you'll pay for this

I'll take you there, where castles built will fall
Where dreams go to die and I promise you this

You thought you'd get away, but Karma made its move
The bad things that you've done, will be coming back for you
It's really sad that we're at the end, but my heart won't let me feel
No sympathy or pain for the outcome you've ensued

Now I'm standing in the crossfire
Now I'm raising up my fist
And you'll pay for this

I'll take you there, where castles built will fall
Where dreams go to die and I promise you this
As God as my witness, that your time will finally meet its end
Your dreams will burn and die and you cannot resist

Adapting model state, symmetry property possessed in varying degrees
(Type face that creates, mirror similarities)
A way to rise above the meaning, not to exist just for yourself

Your dreams will burn and die"

I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I told you way back in Fifty Two 
That I would never go with you
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been"
Quicksilver Messenger Service,I Heard You Singing,/q/quicksilver+messenger+service/i+heard+you+singing_21298509.html,"Words - Robert Hunter
Music - David Freiberg

I heard you singing
What were you singing when the people got right?
Were you singing Stand and Deliver?
Or was it Down by the River?
Were you singing a fine old tune like Gone to Glory?
Laying it down with grace and power
Long about the midnight hour

I heard the people all singing
Like they'd never sung before
All over the country
Who could help but stand beside you?

Hello, hello - is there anybody here?
My knuckles are sore from rapping all day
I said: Give me one more chance
I'd do it for you if I had your way
If I had your way

What do I know? What do I see?
Don't know nothing but the name of the game
It's high-card draw with everything wild
You bet your life like anyone's child
What else would you want to do?

I heard the people all singing
Like they never sung before
Singing in key and strumming
Everything they heard from you
Hello, hello, hello, hello ... goodbye

Looking back across the years
Other matters disappear
In the murmur I can hear
Familiar voices loud and clear
Hello, hello, hello, hello ... goodbye

I heard you singing
Like one last song in the middle of the night
Were you singing in tongues of fire
Or was it knots of anger?

Were you singing a fine old tune like
Love Me, Love Me, Love Me Only?
Were you caught btween the curtains
Thinking this was too uncertain?

Remember ... the people were singing
Like they never sung before
All over the country
Did you love the way they loved you?

Ain't no knocker on the last big door
Just push on the panel and walk on in
Hello, hello, is there anybody here
But a two-bit high and a busted mirror?
Hello, hello - is anybody here?
My tongue is so sore from rapping all day

Sunshine in the dead on night
I know that can't be right
Could it be? I don't know
But it never done that thing before
So close to my own back door
It got me wondering what to do
And the only thing was to come and tell you
Because - I heard you singing - I heard you"

'Cause of her call and the letter I read,
It's been too long since I've been next to my lover, hey hey hey hey,

And the places I have been at times, just trying to be,
These things can only happen once in a lifetime,

Recorded: October 8, 1970 / Released: December, 1970
You poisoned my sweet water.
You cut down my green trees.
The food you fed my children
Was the cause of their disease.
My world is slowly fallin' down
And the air's not good to breathe.
And those of us who care enough,
We have to do something...

[Chorus:]
Oh... Oh What you gonna do about me?
Oh... Oh What you gonna do about me?
Your newspapers,
They just put you on.
They never tell you
The whole story.
They just put your
Young ideas down.
I was wonderin' could this be the end
Of your pride and glory?

[Chorus:]
I work in your factory.
I study in your schools.
I fill your penitentiaries.
And your military too!
And I feel the future trembling,
As the word is passed around.
""If you stand up for what you do believe,
Be prepared to be shot down. ""

[Chorus:]
And I feel like a stranger
In the land where I was born
And I live like an outlaw.
And I'm always on the run...
And I'm always getting busted
And I got to take a stand...
I believe the revolution
Must be mighty close at hand...

[Chorus:]
I smoke marijuana
But I can't get behind your wars.
And most of what I do believe
Is against most of your laws
I'm a fugitive from injustice
But I'm goin' to be free.
'Cause your rules and regulations
They don't do the thing for me

[Chorus:]
And I feel like a stranger
In the land where I was born
And I live just like an outlaw.
And I'm always on the run.
And though you may be stronger now, my time will come around.
You keep adding to my numbers, and you shoot my people down.

[Chorus:] (3 times)"

I wear a cobra snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house by the road side
Made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a big chimney way on top made from a human skull
Come on take a little walk with me
Ah, who do you love, who do you love
Who do you love, who do you love, yeah who do you love?

Come on Eileen, take me by my hand
And let me know that you'd understand
That who do you love, who do you love
Who do you love, who do you love?

Ninety-nine times on the midnight train
Through the fire and cold of rain
Who do you love, who do you love

Just twenty-two and I, I don't mind dying

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

Why do lies make my love stronger

A young player, bred in South Central
L. A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - ak spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street

The evenin' breeze will start the trees to cryin' and the moon will hide its light when you get the blues in the night
And take my word, that mockingbird’ll sing the saddest kind of song, he knows things are wrong, and he's so right

From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe, wherever the four winds blow

And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone, alone

Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day

Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will"

Below us from our pink cloud

As we go exploring hand in hand
In dreamy Dreamsville
Far away and here we love
Here we stay

Why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

And the world discovers

Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you

To get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you take my love
And just walk away

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Are the games that we're playing
Simply our way of entertaining

Since the start you don't seem to
Realize what I've been through
Since the start I have tried to
Make you see that I need you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you take my love
And just walk away

And at times when we drift to
Our knees but forgot to
Leave behind all the past fun
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort
Wonder why we're not one

Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing

That old blue eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with this big band, jumping behind me
Swinging hard, jack, I now I can't lose

As he walked away
Color them grey

This is the heart that thought
He would always be true
Color it blue

These are the arms that held him
And touched him
Then lost him, somehow
Color them empty, now

These are the beads I wore
Until she came between
Color them green

This is the room I sleep in and walk in
And weep in, and hide in
That nobody sees
Color it lonely, please

This is the man
The one I depended upon
Color him gone"

So magnificent or elegant

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who took me up to the skies

Were only imitations of
My old flame

Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay

You'll just blow your chance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear

Go all the way

He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude

He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.

You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.

Now, Big Jim the chief
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
Now, from his bulldog mouth,
As he led the posse south,
Came the cry, ""We got to ride
To clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters!""

You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
No, no, no, no, no.

The account of the capture
Wasn't in the papers,
But you know, they hanged ol' Smack right then
Instead of later.
You know, the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker.

You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.

What makes you feel like doin stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that?

Before my eyes
Was the promise of paradise
Is she real, can she feel
Is she a dream? If ya know what I mean
Cause she was built out of
Stuff like that

Stuff... Like That 4 xs

I knew I was captured
By the rhythm of the magic flute
Pulling and urging me
To taste the forbidden fruit
Tho I felt naive
I did not want to leave
Fever was in the air
All of a sudden, I didn't care
No reason why, I just had to testify

Do it - do it"

It shines forever in my heart
For it was underneath that amber glow
You whispered low
""We'll never part""
The midnight sun will never set
So now could our romance be through?
For in the ever-shining daylight of our summer love
The midnight sun was shining too
No more is night a wild delight
With all the world on fire
And yet I can't escape
The lips I still desire
I see two silent silhouettes
Against a flaming sky and sea
And then I know, though I'm a fool to care
Again, somewhere
The midnight sun will shine for me"

I knew that you were someone
I would not forget
Everybody's searching, hungry for the glamour
You know too many hearts are in a rush

No matter how you try to
You can't explain
The places you find love
I can't explain it, but I can feel it

All around me
The need to find the place
Where feeling can be safe
It's not money that buys happiness

No, it's not the shine of silver that puts the heart to rest
Everybody's pushing
The clock is always running and
No one ever seems to have enough

And when you least expect it
You come upon the places you find love-love-love
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you

Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart, yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars, oh yeah

It's a river never stopping
Winding in and out
But you should never doubt
It will lead you

To the ocean someday
There's no way to fight it
Let it carry you away
Everybody's dreaming waiting for the feeling

That moment when they finally rise above
But it's always in the giving
That gets you to the places you find love-love
Remember in the poorest part of town

Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
The feeling stays alive-yeah, yeah
Little children laughing and playing

'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up-no
'Cause they still believe in love, sweet love
Love, love, love, love, love

Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you."

And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say"

[45 King]
Let's start the show off  sisters ago look alive
The Queen Latifah  the King of 45
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor
I make beats  she rock rhymes  so I gave a
A sample sound  the she added a compound
Word  this is for those who haven't heard
A King and Queen combine minds and trample
Thos who oppose us  here's an example

[Queen Latifah]
It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set
The competition is petty and ready to step
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken
Queen Latifah's outspoken
Use your imagination, picture this
Any male or female rapper trying to diss
Here for excitement and enticement
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment
Teach the youth, feed the needy
Confident decendent of Queen Nefertiti
The mother of civilization will rise
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation
Secondary but necessary to reproduce
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation

[45 King]
Technician, musical musician
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most
Creativity, you get a double dose
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em
I rock, never hyperventilate
Others get tired, could use a commercial break
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias
It takes a ton of MC's to prevail against me
Just listen, I'm unstoppable
You want a mission? This one's impossible
Beats rock all night with no curfew
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it
If the style fits, I wear it
Many attempts were made, none was recognized
45 King said sample soundified
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet
Studio mixer, I got the formula
And said the man from self, I'm warning you
It's my domain, just ask my chauffer
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa
On top, it's a usual act
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing"
Queen Latifah,As Time Goes By,/q/queen+latifah/as+time+goes+by_20607839.html,"This day and age we're living in
Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like third dimension

Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's theory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss,
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

(Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?
(Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah

Oh, I'm singing it to you right now
Cause we're talking about
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date

Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory

Keep cool papa, you got to corne across

You know when I'm ready

Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl
Standin round waitin for my queendom to fall
Well I think not, styles are pipin hot
Blazin, amazin, I give it all I got

I'm tellin you straight up, all sleepin beauties better wake up
Ill tear your state up, so set the date up
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it
Who did it, who does it
From private to public
Anywhere I'm in there and been there
So recognize this, who the nicest
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes
Whatever you want I got
Whether you ready or not
Its about to get hot when I drop
So notes, pause another spot
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you
Don't try to be me, do you
Be coo to you and do you
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane
I am the queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames
Leave em all with shit stains
Split frames, hopin you hopin that I'm jokin
Don't know but still blink off like for-fos
But so-so, slow mos comin in like the po-pos
Don't want rocks comin at me the wrong way
Packin much rocks, it's gonna be a long day
And for real, spittin on imbessiles and spinnin wheels
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted
Ill take it to your stomach, run it, give me all
Mic for mic, steppin to me you gonna fall, we brawl
Throwin a two-piece so loose leafs
Its the q-you-double-e-n
You know how I'm mcin

Chorus x2

See physically you not ready
Lyrically you not ready
Mentally maybe
Who talks tough, time to get the baby
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on
From dusk til dawn from night til mourn
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks
Til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk
So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker
Thinkin I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor
Are you out of your mind, doubtin mines, out of line
Talkin out your behind, shoutin rhymes out of time
Its all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now
Now you hush, hush now, aint sayin too much now
Thought so, haunt yo sleepin ass, creepin fast
Like you was doin somethin, now I gotta ruin somethin
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin in the air
Like a chandilier, poppin off like a can of beer, understand is it clear
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty
Even though I'm low-key, you know me
You be singin over my tracks like it's kareoke
If you don't know the half you gon feel the wrath
Represent the rugged path, the flavor unit staff
Droppin mathmatics, layin you out like craftmatic

Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl

I offer big love with no apology
How can I deny the world the most of me
I am not afraid to throw my weight around
Pound by pound by pound

Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
Face the fact, the simply irrefutable
No one wants a meal that only offers the least
When girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast

Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese
Then take a look inside my book of recipes
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light
We need a man who brings a man-size appetite

I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice
We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot

Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable
Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid
When Edna, you look like the whole parade

They say that white has might and thin is in
Well, that's just bull
'Cause ladies, big is back and as for black
It's beautiful

All shapes and sizes, follow me

But they shame, they scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy

I've been for a walk on a winter's day.
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L. A.;
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.
Stopped in to a church I passed along the way.
Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray.
You know the preacher liked the cold;
He knows I'm gonna stay.
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray.
I've been for a walk on a winter's day.
If I didn't tell her I could leave today;
California dreamin' on such a winter's day.

If you'd a been there, if you'd a seen it
I think that you would have done the same

I mean imagine, why was he hittin' his woman?
Why was she takin' that?
Now picture her fightin' back, picture the ass kickin'
Think of his ass flippin' down the stairs
And me at the top smilin', he shoulda stopped wildin'
Now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off?
See why I pictured me on this side of the law
High heels leave holes, you'd a thought I was gunnin'
Now the cops comin', I ain't runnin'

Girl you shoulda seen it, shoulda bobbed and weaved
Before the cops came, got a coupla clean hits
In word the?couldn't take the abuse
But I couldn't explain that to the state troops

My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin'
I'm not guilty, just tryin' to protect mine
It ain't my fault he ran into my knife 20 times (He had it comin')
Just my luck the bastard ain't die
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked ya eye?
Broke ya nose 'til it started bleedin'
Kicked you in ya ribs, chocked you 'til you stopped breathing
(Fuck) that, I'm sick of bobbing and weaving
Threatenin' to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I do a bid, 'cause ain't no way

This is for the constantly accused, mentally abused
How many of you been in my shoes before, aiight
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin' up wit his tired ass in the first place
Why am I flippin'? I just bought them condoms
I ain't used not one but there was two missin'
Get a new mission, how to catch a cheater
If he only use coach, you shouldn't smell?
If you know he don't smoke, you shouldn't smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin' you shouldn't yell either
Run up on him quietly, took him out silently
It might sound cruel, but you gotta love the irony
So explain that, just came back off a trip
And I come home to this, please

So get with the flow, lets go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?

The pool is over, come into my house

Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (that was cool) I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum, give me some

]from the queen, the queen of royal badness
Remember me from wrath of my madness?
Its my rap that rocks this party
I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The asiatic black woman, hardcore beat drumming
Its hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
Its an open invitation, come into my house

On the crazy clothes we wore
Ain't it fun to look back
And to see it's all been done before

All those nights together
Are a special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you're dancing next to me

'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger
What's gone is gone, the past is the past
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause

I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

So most days we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow
I know we've come so far
But baby, baby we've got so far to go

Hey old friend together
Side by side and year by year
The road was filled with twists and turns
Oh, but that's the road that got us here

Let's move past the bad times
But before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget
And learn from the mistakes we made

'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger
So don't give up and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

So most days we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow

But baby, baby we've got so far to go

Hey old friend come along for this ride
There's plenty of room so jump inside
The highway's rocky every now and then
But it's so much better then where I've been

Just keep movin' at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone
We got so far to go

Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger
So shine that light, take my hand
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause

I know we've come so far
But we've got so far to go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

So most days we'll take it fast
And some nights we'll take it slow

So I put my rhyme to a dj mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 king, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
Hes a dj, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me bring while I bring
Queen latifah to the 45 king, creating
A new style in the name of the flavor unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

Dance to the music (repeat 2x)

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the flavor unit to make you say ho
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the dj booth
And lets start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot em
When I take control, you know I got em
Stop the music? That's not a question
The flavor unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, heres your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

Dance to the music (repeat 6x)"

Queen Latifah,Evil That Men Do,/q/queen+latifah/evil+that+men+do_20112735.html,"[queen latifah]
You asked, I came, so behold the queen
Lets add a little sense to the scene
I'm living positive, not out here knocked up
But the lines are so dangerous, I ought to be locked up
This rhyme doesnt't't require prime time
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine
Back again cause I knew you wanted it
]from the latifah with the queen in front of it
Dropping bombs, you're up in arms, you're puzzled
The lines will flow like fluid while you're guzzling
The sip I drop you on a bdp-produced track
]from krs to be exact
Its a flavor unit quest that today has me speaking
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you
About the evil that men do

Situations, reality, what a concept!
Nothing ever seems to stay in step
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers
Here are some things I want to cover
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?
Because she's living on welfare
I government can't come up with a decent housing plan
So she's in no mans land
Its a sucker who tells you you're equal

[krs-one]
You don't need him, johannasburgs crying for freedom!

[queen latifah]
We the people hold these truths to be self-evident

[krs-one]
But there's no response from the president

[queen latifah]
Someones living the good life, tax-free
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free
And that's just part of the message
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do

Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?
When someone can put a quarter in a video game
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street
You can't treat him the same
Its time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds
You to a doom, a fate worse than death
But there's still time left
Stop putting your conscience on cease
And bring about some type of peace
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind
It will benefit all mandkind
Then there will be one thing that will never stop
And it's the evil that men do"

And i'm in the mood for a party
So i'm gonna go out to a club
And give the dancefloor body
So i jump in the car and go to the venue
Walk in the door and now i'm on the menu
Guys in the house, they're wacthing me
They're clocking me, there's no stopping me

(refrain)
(desire) i know you want me
(you're fine) thank you
But i'm not the type of girl that you think i am
I don't jump into the arms of every man
(but i'm paid) i don't need your money
(i love you) you must be mad
Easy lover is something that i ain't
Besides, i don't know you from a can of paint

Tell me why is it when i walk past the guys
I always hear, yo, baby?
I mean like what's the big idea?
I'm a queen, nuff respect
Treat me like a lady
And, no, my name ain't yo and i ain't got your baby
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere
One with class and savoir faire
I'm looking for someone who has to be
Perfect for the queen latifah me

(and i want you to be mine)

(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man?)

All my friends are in relationships
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get
I want a friend not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know i'll find him some day
And when i find him
He sure won't say

(repeat refrain)

(fly girl, fly girl
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)
(and i want you to be mine)
(fly girl, fly girl, have no fear)
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man?)

Lounging, sitting in the house
And i'm cooling, first day of the week
So there's nothing to do
And i'm in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said there'll be days like this
So i called her and we talked  for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile

It's cool, cuz 91 is my year
And this time i know i'm gonna hear

(fly girl, fly girl, come here)
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)

Fantasy is ours to mold

Have your way with me.

But I can't reach you
I seek you
Come to me
But then you""re all around me
You just surround me
And you astound me
And I recieve you
'fore I complete you
It pleases me
To have you touch me there
I think you know it gets to me
Stop
Don't stop

Queen Latifah,I Don't Know,/q/queen+latifah/i+dont+know_20815130.html,"Oh, I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same

I'm taking this time to write you this letter
'Cause what we got is good but want to make it better, yo boo
I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment

I'm not trying to rush things not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, 'cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon

I want make this official man, I miss you
I feel for your touch and your kiss too
Listen I hope I'm not being to blunt
Don't wanna scare you away, it's a game I want to play but

Oh, I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same

Oh, I don't know

And it makes me scared
(So scared)
Because I'm falling in love
(Falling in love)
And I don't know if you feel the same
(Falling in love, hey)

I know you love it when I call you big poppa  my thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last 'cause she was insecure
I'm not trying to compare myself but I got health and wealth
And now you dealing with the top shelf

My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught while I stare at the gifts you bought
The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun check me now

Like the time we went to six flags boosting, tearing off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover your my best friend

Do you remember the first time I letcha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask God to make you feel the same

Oh, I don't know
(Don't know)
And it makes me scared

Because I'm falling in love

Because I'm falling in love

And I don't know if you feel the same
(Oh yeah)

Is there a place to ease my mind
(Place to ease my mind)
Think about you all the time, yeah
Show me a sign and wish that you would
Offer me a sign, relax my mind

Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight don't beat around the bush

I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo Dana

Oh P. S. Guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long

Oh, I don't know

And it makes me scared

Because I'm falling in love

Because I'm falling in love

And candle light, I like the scene
But baby, if you know what I mean
'Cause I love being here with you

I like a dance by Fred Astaire
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair
But I think to tell you's only fair
That I love being here with you

And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day
His utter charm takes me away
But don't get me wrong, how do you say
I love being here with you

Oh, Basie's band's a-swingin', I like Ella singin'
'Cause there's something else, you know
They know how to say it, they know how to play it
They wind it up and let it go

I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the gray skies to blue
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life anew
If I had you
I could climb a snow-capped mountain
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I couldn't do
If I had you

The spreaker. Hit it mark, 45 king

I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when
Its time to I'll I get I'll and time to chill
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D. A. I. S. Y. Age
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it
The name is latifah, the scene, it is mine
The 45 king keeps the beat and the time while I
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out
So don't try to turn me inside out

Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

Its so so simply done
When I find that I have to run
Lyrics to music by the king of swing, the 45 king
The words we bring I write, and sing
Cause I am latifah, the queen of course
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them
Wont you chill? I don't need another victim
To add to the list of aggrivation
Subtracting suckers like a math computation
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples
This is a king and queen creation
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying
When I put up the wall of words aint no way into my queendom
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the ruler lord ramsey
The ruler lord, to him there is no equal
He grabs it and starts bombing people
Don't listen to me to figure me out
Because you can't turn my mind inside out

Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

Rhymings not a question of one superiority
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me
But I came here just to party
If it's a show you want, the show it live
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived
When mark requests my approval, I nod
And after each and every single rhyme I thank god
Altough a taste of my body would soothe you
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it
And lord have mercy on those that try to steal it
Latifah is a name meaning delicate and sensitive
But I have no problem formulating sentences
To break you down to the ground
I wont use violence, the color of this is brown
And I am down, but never ever down and out
So don't try to turn me inside out

Latifah is the name you love
Flying through rhymes like a dove
Slapping suckers with a glove
Challenge me and you will burn
Yes in the fire you will burn

Jah know? Cause ah...

Music, 45 king, music latifah the queen
Music, domination to bring the world

Don't let know one get close to you except the chosen
Stick with the ones who meant the most to you

That's how you stay true around these snakes

I used to take the path to Latin Quarters across the waters

Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so simple like that there's nothin to it
So, we meet in Irvington and after school I run
To the Willobrook Mall, there was Solamon
I had a talent for getting up for gear
A petty thief, small time crook of the year
But I chilled cause I had bigger dreams than to steal
And Ramsey came for me and Patchy to put our voices on a reel
And I could hear myself on the radio

Cause that's what life was all about to me
All E-E flavor you did it, represent Jersey

Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes

To the new generation of prophets because it's ladies first

Queen Latifah,Latifah's Law,/q/queen+latifah/latifahs+law_20112739.html,"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?
Queen latifahs here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown
The 45 king is arising, suprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par
So I hope youve prepared yourself for what you're in for
This is latifahs law

Bmws and gold rope chains don't impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the african way
Cause there's a sucker born every day
Crimes the way for you to see what the queen saw
And this is latifahs law

Now dj mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The flavor unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed
Whip out A. 45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to africa, can't forget my other land
Wont fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense
In case you forgot, just check your conscience
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine
Your showtimes, you behind, the queen latifah divine
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call
Its time for me to go, but I'll be back, yall"
Queen Latifah,Lush Life,/q/queen+latifah/lush+life_20235530.html,"[Written in 1949 by Billy Strayhorn, the noted Duke Ellington collaborator]
I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.
Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.
Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.
Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.
I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too.."

Excuse me mommy, pos wins
Cause I'm the a to the plug w-o-n

Now lets ride down the highway of vibes
Pushing that we start cause the soul says please
Cutting back with the raps and we don't get cheese

That the soul is moving on up like the jeffersons

Go mommy! (repeat 16x)

Its a family affair and then were out of here
There is no doubt here, cause this is our year
So flex to a queen latifah/de la soul sound

Its inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedistal
But the rhyme is so good it's practically edible (say what?)

And if you're wondering why I got kids so big
They werent born from the body, they were born from the soul

But she's got something,
Johnny, much greater than gold
Well, now what's that?
I'm crazy 'bout that girl,
She's got so much soul
She's got the kind of loving, kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
Can you dig it?
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do - ow!
Tell 'em bout it, Watson
My baby now, when she walks by
All the fellows go '~~~', and I know why
Have mercy, just look at her walk
It's simply because that girl, she walks so fine
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind
Because she's got the kind of lovin',
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
Have mercy on me!
'Cause she knocks me off my feet
I'd better tell 'em one more thing
There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Ow, tell 'em bout it, Mr. Williams
Now everybody in my neighborhood
An' that's what's grooving me
Will testify that my girl, she looks so good
Well, let me tell you something else right here
She looks so fine, she give eyesight to the blind
Help 'em to make 'em see
And if she ever leave me, I will lose my mind
Because she's got the kind of lovin',
Kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow

Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky
How I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again so baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, oh baby please
Pull yourself together, got to do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling
Oh, pretty baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand

In that new promised land

Onto a higher plateau, to the peak and I'm taking it slow
Enough for you to see the knowledge and to know
I'm the q-you-e-e-n, l-a-t-i-f-a-h
Queen of the army posse, the dla which is
Get live alright, you standing there chewing on your fingernails
Nervous, watching me doing the live thing
Singing like a bird sing, ringing like the phone ring
I'm the queen and you're the underling
I'm never following, I follow nothing
The princess of the posse is a cool one

The princess of the posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
The princess of the posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme brooklyn, the bronx, usa, the world

I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land
Its a concoction, for my ability
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility
Cause they don't know I'm the one to fly one or two
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm latifah and I want to
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
I'm kicking gold, so grab a hoe and get a good grip
Stop the lying, the trying
The time buying, youve been denying
Youre dependent on me, the princess of the posse
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow
Youre taking no crowns, put that on cease
My djs name is mark the 45 king to the posse
Peace, got to let you know where I come from
The princess of the posse is a cool one

The princess of the posse, me say she a cool one
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
The princess of the posse, me say she a cool girl
She rhyme brooklyn, the bronx, usa, the world

Now take run the family
Me say me have to do it for the are. E. Posse
You try to be down, you can't take the crown
Maybe from someone else but not me (repeat 2x)"
Queen Latifah,Queen Of Royal Badness,/q/queen+latifah/queen+of+royal+badness_20112742.html,"Let me remind you on how to unwind your body
So dance and shake and just keep in step
Understand, draw a clear picture
What I'm gonna hit you with is truly def
These are the words of a queen of a queendom
All competitors, I simply cream them
One by one, I dust a rush them all
If you have any more, bring them
To the front so they can sho me what they got
What they got, it better be hot
Cause if it's not, I'll simply knock them out the box
And they'll be put in a spot
The style I use will surely amuse
The party people to a state of gladness
What I mean is I'm on the scene
I'm the queen of royal badness

Well it's the lah, t-i-f-a-h
While I say my rhyme, mark creates
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking
Or freaking, this is a queen speaking
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred
When you address me, address me as your highness
One of hip-hops finest
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo
It makes me no difference
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic
And draw attractions
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them
The result with a pen and a pad
Gets mean, see I'm the queen of royal badness

I can't wait until the party is jam-packed
When I start to drop it, the people say damn, black
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, b
Composures kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell
Guard as well as you can or step
Off the premisis, in one minute its
Going to explode in a style that's limitless
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss
Its no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust
Literature that flows like liquid
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it
So don't say nothing
Just listen up, follow instructions
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like lat said
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery
Its nothing special, just a queen to me
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this
You know what I mean, it's the queen of royal badness"

Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Although I may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
But to her heart
I carry the key

Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh how I need

I only want to find out who you are
And we gotta be no Superman

My girlies caught me on a good day
I was (something) to move a job
So we took it to a club
Nigga we would make out a little
And plus at the time I was single, a little
So I said ""Fine, we could meet up about nine""
So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin
Some people in the joint is yellin ""Hurt me, Hurt me""
I'm working my way over to the bar cus I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he sikes me
I smile cus he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me
Well then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cus he's scared to get dissed
I don't walk baby
I don't bite neither
You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper
The worst thing I'da said was ""No""
So maybe next time you better push a (something)

Lookin at the videos
At the same time I'ma tryna put on my clothes

Was he fly?
Yes he was
Word up, the type you have on a plate
Cus I only met him last night
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand
Now what was in your plan?
I really didn't understand
We're only going to the movies
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony
Listen baby, I don't want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from my man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant
(Chorus twice)
Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
We can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride listening to music and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
Cus you ain't gotta be no superstar honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money ain't gone make me love ya
And even with your car
So cease with that attitude
With that attitude you won't be getting far
And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction

I stepped into a basement party in brooklyn
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in
A female walked up to me and said latifah bust a line
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time
I said if you really want to do this, we can do this, fine
Take six paces and begin to rhyme
As soon as attempted to make a sound
I ate her up with the verb, broke her down with the noun
Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings

[daddy-o]
Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them
Rhyme fiends, biters, and bums
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight
I kinda got uptight (you didn't do what I think you did?) yeah, right!
Bash! Went the first, smash! Went the next one
He started, he started to run
But to his suprise, his feet must have slipped
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step

You see you may speculate, but everybody knows
Not one amatuer can deal with the pros
These are the pros, coming now from queen latifah and daddy-o
And if you want to hear more then just follow
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say bo bo bo!

[daddy-o]
There was a time that a man could go
Anyplace, anywhere without a rambo
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line
So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it
I'm daddy-o and I don't quit
So feel the flow, yall, because you're under attack
]from my rhymes, cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks
And four words to the wack, just stay the hell back
Cause it's a fact if you're wack you aint saying jack
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me
Youll be the next ingredient in my recipe
Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide
How you wanna be eaten, boy, baked or fried?

These are the pros, coming now from queen latifah and daddy-o

Its latifah the queen, pioneer of the mainstream
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound
So button your lips and stop trying to be down
I caught you out there (how many times?) a lot of times
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme
Stepping to the right, to the left
To the best place, well I have to face
A sucker like a pooh-butt, weak and soft
Riding my brastrap trying to get off
Understand and know, if you want to go
Youd better be ready to floaw cause I'm a pro

Your love is like a a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, and hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone, and it hurts so much
Well and why...
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry?
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live
Well and why...
Must the same love that made me laugh:
Why you wanna make me cry? [5x]
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow
Just cryin' like a weeping willow
Why you wanna make me cry? [4x]

The pain to go away,
But it wouldn't go away,
Just subsided through the haze

Just drifted off into deeper thought
So I broke my mind and searched my heart
Finally whats blindin' me was just as clear as day.
I figured out whats stressin' me, depressin' me
Mummy that man was lancing me
No..

Was only 5 years old I couldn't seem to tell a soul
I didn't know how to let you and daddy know
And I can't go on, like this
That's the kinda thing that make ya slash your wrists
But now that I realise this
What happened to me I gotta fight this

He asked what would make a 14 year old boy wanna take his life?
It'd be the fact, that he got a dad, who uses him, as a punchin' bag
Beats him till he's blue and black and wont stop will he makes him cry.

You kept it to your self and made excuses for the bruises,
Took painkiller to kill the pain from a daddy who's abusive,
He was telling you, you were useless
Never heard the words ""I love you""
Made you feel like you were worthless
He's tryin' to save the trouble and

He can't go on, like this
That's the type thing that made you slash you wrists
Somebody shoulda told you that you're priceless
Put your faith in god and we can fight this.

Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame

That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Yeah me, bitch"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work, give you an attitude then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again, I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All that I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad

But I don't want to see my kids see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me

I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya

Now you a wannabe hard
You barely know your abc's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet, young lady

Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have

Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
Or stop us from holding hands

'Cause I love you
(I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart

And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

It would be easier to take the cold from snow
Or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take my love from you, baby
'Cause you're my heart's desire

I really love you
(I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart

And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

Even if they separate us
A thousand miles apart
We will still be together
In each other's hearts

It would be easier to change
All the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change
The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear

I really love you

Oh, baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart

And now, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The keeper of the keys,
The countess of the clink
The mistress of murderers row,
Matron Mama Morton!
(Queen Latifah)
Ask any of the chickies in my pen
They'll tell you I'm the biggest mother hen.
I love them all and all of them love me
Because the system works,
The system called reciprocity.
Got a little motto,
Always sees me through:
""When you're good to Mama, Mama's good to you.""
There's a lot of favours I'm prepared to do,
You do one for Mama, she'll do one for you.
They say that life is tit for tat,
And that's the way I live.
So I deserve a lot of tat
For what I've got to give.
Don't you know that this hand
Washes that one too.
When you're good to Mama, Mama's good to you
If you want my gravy
Pepper my Ragu
Spice it up for mama
She'll get hot for you
When they pass that basket
Folks contribute too,
You put in for Mama,
She'll put out for you
The folks at top the ladder
Are the ones the world adores
So boost me up my ladder, kid
And I'll boost you up yours
Lets all stroke together
Like the princeton crew
When your stroking Mama, Mama's stroking you
So what's the one conclusion
I could bring this number to -
When you're good to Mama, Mamas good to you"
Queen Latifah,Winki's Theme,/q/queen+latifah/winkis+theme_20345237.html,"[Talk:]
This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me from
Heaven Watching my every move as usual....
[Chorus:]
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme
But it's bustin from the seems
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
I'm moving all around
Oh yes,I'm making leaps an bounds
There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that
I've overflowed my cup.
I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up
Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand
There're things about all of ya'll have got to understand
Latifah- never was a teacher
Never was a preacher
Never was a saint
Never was conceited
Never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint.
But I never shut up when things piss me off
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across
That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be
I've got an angel watching over me
[Chorus 2x]
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
Yes he did, yes he did
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
You don't hear me
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world,world,world
The light of my world, my world- AHHHHH yes he did..............."
Queen Latifah,Wrath Of My Madness,/q/queen+latifah/wrath+of+my+madness_10237180.html,"My mellow Latee was kicking flavor
The are. E. Posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave to me
I'm cooling, tacher knows me in school and
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm ruling
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

(Latifah does a rasta chorus)

Some mc's have gold and African vein
And useing each other to compete with
These subjects I pity because their minds are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not a fortune your thoughts are shrinking
While mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me
Brothers catch my eye with little hijinks, like I wish
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

(Latifah does a rasta chorus)

Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging
Of the beats that dj Mark is loving
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness

(More rasta singing)

I scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness

But I just cannot stand still
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums
Then I found my way

She could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it

Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat!

You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be!
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed, I've got the N double A.C.P.

But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay

You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas Ham!
So, if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn!

You can't stop today (No!)
As it comes speeding 'round the track (oooh, child yes!)
Yesterday is history (be gone!)
And it's never comin' back! (look ahead, 'cause)
'Cause tomorrow is a brand new day, and it don't know white from black (yeah!)

Where's your revolution now?

Shrunken heads parade through town
Tears of gold, drink then drown
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down"

Dancing on a string

Make a mess of things
Get that look everywhere

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

From a crumbling tower I see everything
London, Tokyo, New York City
There's no love any place

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

All we creatures helplessly attacking repetition
Over, over left with who we are
Did you tell anyone?
Did you tell any place?

Everybody else wanna fall in love

Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you will do then?
But that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road

Drink the Kool-Aid and swallow the pill

Could it be the end of man and time
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
find another world where freedom waits.
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
where the sons of freedom make their home

Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
leave them to their future in the grave
Make a home where love is there to stay"

Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing god

Copy cats in cheap suits
All playing it safe
While cannibals with their noose
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?

The land of nightmares
Gone forever more

And I love you more
Than I can control
I don't even try
Why would I?

We'll choke chain them all

Fates favour the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they run

Disregarding every myth we write
Eagerly alive
Rag doll churning
Over & over, gasping in horror

Simmering, pick and pluck
Tenderize, bone to dust

When I was a little boy,
I looked under the stairs,
The King and the Pawns
Were caught unawares,
Standing in the shadows
A whisperer to be,
Just fishing in the darkness
Of possibilities.

Just look at you now
Yeah
Look at you now
Yeah
Oh
Look at you now

Among such style and grace
Our highest hopes,
None standing
Still the running joke,
Where goes the warm embrace
It fades without return
It lives to slip through fingertips and burn.

Just look at you now
Oh
Look at you now
Ohh
look at you now
Ohh
Look at you now"

Shout, erase, and undo
Days are unreleased, if there's no release

Make something, make someone
Beg on a knee, baby baby please
Pout your bottom lip

You know what we want,
It's candy to cum to

Forced to crawl down this line, just to touch

I can get in

Twisted secret lives, the way you bat your eyes
Givin' head, givin' head, givin' head

And no one can find you

Everybody echoes in my head
Broken reflection outta luck
Nobody ever needed it

I got what was
I want to take what's left
I'm ready now

Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singing

Sweet soft and low
I will poison you all
Come closer racing to your tongue

I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure, what's lost or save
What's left, for the deaf

The blind can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
This halo round my neck
Has torn out every stitch

Who are you hidin'?
Is it safe for the deaf?
Beautiful, cancer
Infiltrate, and forget

Then I saw you comin'
Then I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you'd been?

I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure, what's lost or save
What's left, for the deaf

Tried to fake it, I just can't take it.
I don't care if it hurts,
Just so long as it's real.
I won't waste it, turned to face it,
I'd sharpened a knife, then used it,
Until bone made it dull.
Tried explaining, done explaining,
I got caught in the plaid,
All of this talking at once.
I've been giving my love away,
To the things that tear it apart,
I'm gonna suture up my future.

This life is a trip when you're psycho in love

Followed your friends, you were not there

You gonna do something killer?

Yeah, I got enemies, but they don't know

I Gotta hold on

Standing on the edge of madness

Full of hope, low on faith, I feel compelled to pray
Overwhelmed with emotion, the tea has been brewed

Break down, shakedown

Pummeled from the moment you wake a void of confusion 24 hours a day
Twisted reality eternal debate the clouds are flowing something?s going to break.
Deliver me it will deliver you, faceless masses of grey and blue
The sky is falling a rain of blood
The soul?s are empty above

[Chorus:]
Strange Daze- it?s hard to accept
Strange ways- you never expect
Strange daze-Nothing makes sense
Strange Daze trying to make sense of it all

[Verse 2:]
Loss of balance with an axe to grind
People talking with nothing really on their minds
No provocation, no sparks to the flame
Investigations with nothing left say
Remember me, I won?t remember you
Dogs are howling over what you do
Skin is crawling you embrace your self I?m not feeling too well"

Kick me out and let me come back whenever my love was gran me

Give me a place to stay on times that was no great to do that
And no disrespect, I project her to the sun and she was like
Throw all the stress she still find another way to do that

They rise with every single one that been throw my way
Recorder for hours was never bother when I would stay
When sure drop the power in ninety six

Quest,Saludo,/q/quest/saludo_21073215.html,"Ito ang alay ko, ito ang istorya mo
Alamat na kailangan makilala ng buong mundo
Isang pagpupugay, kailangan ipagdiwang
Pasasalamat at ika'y isinilang

Di pangkaraniwang para siyang superhero
Hinarap lahat ng pagsubok yung iba hindi biro
Meron siyang misyon kaya walang takot sumabak
Mga buhay na nakasalalay sa kanyang pangarap

Parang pelikula, action, adventure, drama
May konting comedy, love story na pang masa
Galing sa wala akala mo talo na tapos,
Yun pala sya yung bida kaya lahat sila paos

Kasisigaw, kahihiyaw selebrasyon
Buong mundo magtataka, kakaibang okasyon
Itaas ang kamay sumigaw ng hoy (hoy)
Ito ang araw mo, bayaning pinoy

[Chorus:]
Saludo
Sa mga bida na tunay na nagpakita ng husay dito sa liga ng buhay
Saludo
Mga kampeon, mga dakilang hindi sumuko, di nagpaalila
Saludo

Sa inspirasyon, karagdagang lakas
Salamat dumaan kayo sa tamang landas
Saludo
Kami sa inyo ay saludo, saludo

Walang balak sumuko, walang planong gumuho
Tagumpay lang, walang iba binigay nya buong puso
Hinarap lahat ng tuso, pati mga abuso
Nanatiling tapat sa pangarap hanggang naging uso

Ang buhay positibo, agresibo mismo
Kaya pinarangalan syang Bayaning Pilipino
Taas noo kahit pango di na bigo di nalito di huminto
Inabot nya ang ginto

Ngayon tahimik na lahat ng kritiko
Bukang bibig na rin nila ang mga hirit mo
Hanggan nag-trending, ang daming likes, di na makalimutan
Front page, headlines, hanggang sa kanto laman ng kwentuhan

Pagasa'y pinagsaluhan, pero di naubusan,
Binigay ng lubusan, hanggang sa huling hantungan
Buhay na buhay, walang humpay
Tagumpay,

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Sabi daw walang pagasa pero tinapos
Sabi daw imposible pero di pa rin natakot
Sabi nila mahirap pero nag pursige
Kaya ngayon lahat sila sige lang sige

Nung lahat umurong, siya sumugod
Nung lahat lumubog, siya ‘di nalunod
Natutong maglakad sa tubig pananampalataya
Diyos ang kanyang agimat kaya walang hindi kaya

Saludo
Paglaki ko gusto ko maging katulad mo
Saludo
Maipagmamalaki sa buong mundo

Saludo
Ikaw ang dahilan kung bat hindi ako susuko

Quest,You Don't Know What Love Is,/q/quest/you+dont+know+what+love+is_21298951.html,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is."
Qwan,I Put One Penny Away,/q/qwan/i+put+one+penny+away_20758969.html,"[Intro:]
Yo, Shigeto. This song wasn't supposed to be on this album. You supposed to be right here man. I see you shine. I know you here. I know you right here. Right next to me.

[Chorus:]
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
I try my best to make it when heaven calls from above
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
You make me come with all my money I can't say goodbye

[Verse:]
I'm bringing the pain it's spreading through my veins
These shoulders is getting heavy I feel desperately restrained
My knuckles is bloody punching on the concrete with my fists
Death wish on the verge of a good guy gone shit
Oh lord, give me the power the strength I need
Oh lord, show me the way and I'll follow your leads
Together hand in hand we walk as we follow the streams
Crazy family falling off like leaves off trees
Oh no I can't seem to take it no more
Shigeto, I look up to you cause you extraordinary yo
I feel that we the same besides we both capitals yo
My idol see child and then I couldn't say goodbye, oh why?
It feels like I can't breathe right
What the hell does this world want from me? Is this a fight?
Alright, I'm standing right here I aint going nowhere, anytime, anywhere
Oh, you gonna feel my wrath
Well I explode in a blast
You gone chose the wrong guy to trash
My angers worse than a fatal car crash
Beware my comeback will indeed be fast
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
I got to do it for my family cause this is my blood
Hear me now, it's my destiny to follow your steps
Till death, Shigeto. I love you, you'll always be the best

[Chorus:]
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
I try my best to make it when heaven calls from above
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
You make me come with all my money I can't say goodbye

Why? Why did you take it? Take it away. It's not fair. She was supposed to be like this.
Why is this world about money? I hate this shit!

[Verse 2:]
I don't know where to start yo this is the same
Why lives got to be so hard just to maintain
Why people got to die god tell me why?
I don't understand why life's so short
Every minute, every second they're the ones that I love
They're the ones that I lost in the heavens above
You always in my heart nothing keeps us apart
This is just a start so follow me
You my enemy, you feel this end of me?
You know I'm coming in the rain there no way you stopping me
You put this anger and this hate inside of me
I turned it around and use it productively
Beware of the dog who's crying keeps you calm
And when you get close he rips off your freaking arms
Get along get your arms as you panic a storm
Realize it's too late, it's bait, check mate
You're been pawned
Bomb locked it's Qwan
The one and only Qpid and Wanton
Behold the powers rain over you so strong
Feel the energy when I spit it to the song
So family's first fuck the rest it's all just a test
Your money aint shit so follow your dreams
You know, follow it to the end of the world yo

[Chorus:]
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
I try my best to make it when heaven calls from above
I put one penny away for the ones that I love
You make me come with all my money I can? Say goodbye

So Scared now, beware now
You probably pissing in your pants and you scared now
So scared now, beware now
You probably sipping and you pissing in your pants now
Oh shit now, they coming now
Be scared mother fucker we coming now
So where you going now
Are you running now

""What's on your mind?""
Whee, ha, lookatiaa, lookatiaa, 
Sun shining all the time (sun shining all the time)
She picked up the fan and let the trailer go
She only likes it when it's hot. 
Doesn't like it when it's cold

The undeniable, of course, that makes it magnetic
And you can't explain it, you do what you do
Can't nobody play the fool like (something something something?)

Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you

On the wall amongst them all from Warhol to Jean-Michel

Before the scheme it seems real it reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours
You ain't commanding no tours
You seeing fee and per diem
We seeing that and the doors
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
Thou while its wittiest
On the low we the grittiest
Taking the task, these barbaric insurgents
Who nursery rhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures

There's examples all around of careers being brief

Ring tone rappers rockin shades are forgettable
Phantom of the rap world boo
Yo you puss in boots
Energy's electric who's looking for a love recruit
High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around
Comin with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MC's
We combat the disease
With the good and hardy measurement
A real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host
You need to open up wide while we give you the douse

For the lovin' it was all one
Cause girl you know it takes one to know one but
Do, Do you, dig you?
Do, Do you, dig you?

Did you drink the drink?
Talkin' up the sun?
Fightin' off the dragon when it's lookin' in the mirror
At you
Workin' all day
Playin' all night
All I wanna do it just get a little hit up
To you
It's you

Do you dig you?"

Couldn't leave her if I tried, I see her light is on inside.

Let's build.

She's in the back room, greasing up, Friday night is heating up
Young cats tricking up, dancing so they give it up.
The best girl working there and you know for what it's worth
She's working towards a better life, regardless if she's working nights

I be questioning alot of y'all who made it in
Just move with the joint that we chartering
Make you disappear quick, like you're part of wind
Then laugh, ah-ha ha, and laugh again
Shorty, move a lil bit, I'm looking at your friend
Let's get in there and shake for the beat, girl
Do a lil eye wink, throw a tongue twirl

When you listen and you feel a thud
When you hear my voice, understand the love
When the dj spins it back, it's a friendly rub

Or like a old hip-hop joint, you Nice & Smooth (Come on, girl)

Hasty decisions we may still prevail
Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail
Walking thru the corridors of my mind
The hideaways, the nooks, there filled with good times
Memories certainly yes they still bind
Still a common man and yeah that's for sure
Still a bankroll and yeah still can tour
The madness, the thing we had was much more
Come back home, don't be out in the world
It's a rat race and always for a girl
And most scavengers have found the pretty pearl
It's for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough, buckle em up, we call em duds
And we, and we and we ahhh

We gettin up
We gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said gettin up
Said we gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up

Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's
You and I advance, certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end
And you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man
No other could contend
Or we could be like Doves exposed 2 history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go thru they shape our identity
Yes pretty let's do this all nite
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up and promise that it's right

We gettin up
We gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said gettin up
Said gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up
Said gettin up
Said gettin up

I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
Your magnetic presences make them come thru
The same way you got them you got me too
Now look at our lives so colorful
A wonderful spectrum, not 1 tone dull
Full of excitement and not 1 lull
See we had an understanding, oh yes we did
I'm bringing it back, I'm puttin in my bid
Have a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs
We like Louie D and Marcie? Like martin and corretta
Doin it to death, no one can do it better
When we leave our physical our spirits still together
Come on now, here's a placement for your hand
You rockin with the #1 mc man
The #1 controller of right with the plan

We gettin up
We gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up

Q-Tip,Johnny Is Dead,/q/q+tip/johnny+is+dead_21331695.html,"Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen
And I think about my chance for me to intervene
And it's up to me to bring back the hope
Put feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it, cause here I kinda dig it
But what good is a ear if a Q-Tip isn't in it?
So to stick it in, to inform your friend
Your boy from the hood, is on that shit again
He has upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries
To splash on the mass from low to upper class
And when the records spins and sometimes blows a wind
A fickleness of friends, they sometimes hate again
They always bring up Tribe on me, could not survive on me
Cause this is my man's on me, this is my fams
And here's somethin' new, it's front row for you
So don't misconstrue, it's Tribal and true
My dudes who hustle hard, don't stop your repertoire
As long as you could see, it's you who's stayin' we
Cause life is filled with (?) pills and little pearls and shit
I'm fuckin' up, I mean, I'm trippin' up
But still, there is a void, and people get annoyed
Let's focus is on the feel, before we get a deal
Come on

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same

With the vibe we came, to put back on the street
Let's take care of ours, and ensure we eat
And Oprah an 'em, they criticize the boys
Without in between, they lose all their boys
They can't keep us down, we're dominate and brown
And those other shades, they join our parade
But wait there's rain ahead, like Brit and Kevin Fed
And magazine debris, is shit she gotta see it
I'm no different to you, I goes through it too
I thumbs through the page, I don't come of age
I'm not a deity, I'm far from perfect, see
I roll the tumble weed, it's just a humble scene
That I present to you, is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony, and soon a melody
That speaks to where we are, the door, I hope's ajar
And soon we're walkin' in, a blip, it's just to say, ""Come on""

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same"

Puttin shit in the game
Citizens, of the world, we runnin out
Precious time is a grain of sand
Ignored by the hand

Work hard man everyday (for who?)
For another man's plan
Man orders woman when he come home
Getcha ass in the air!
(My woman wants it just as much as I do)
Woman wants it just as much as he does
But makes as if she don't care
Man and woman in the same where I'm from
We havin things on the mind
Minimum wage and the internet page (she cry)
Protect themselves from crime
The bluest collar on the brownest of skin
White, yellow, red too
They don't care, who it is
They watchin you
Conspiracies, so you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu
Man and woman, yo you might as well dance

Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man

One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand

Check it out
Red man was the first on the continent
This you gotta understand
Woman not behind, she's right beside him there
And they both toil land
White man fightin for independance from, an old empire
Woman makes a flag for a new nation and
Lets the flag waves high
Black woman is stripped of her kingdom and
Bought the breastfeeding new
Black man, mentally, he broke it too
But the cream always rise to the top
That's what men and women do
Man/woman always doin the dance
One wops, one pops
We'd be lucky if we both find a groove
That we both can lock
Can man be stronger if a woman was there?
I would have to say yes
Can woman make it without men being there?
She would have to be blessed
Woman and man are the spiritual forces
Brought together to live
Good thing there's many of us here in the world today
Find a good one to give, let's go, come on

And by the end hopefully I be the balance-man
A simple dude who can exude the talents and
I am the captain of the hot blooded caravan
Spread in a different look to charred and battered lands
It's outta function I see girls that can top it off

I treats her so kind sweetening her at nighttime

Gather around, the Renissance man has finally appeared
And I'm astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt, we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the opposition's Abstract, bless your soul
They are the reason MCs but none on the level
Other you're the vocalist, precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing inpure emcees, plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance

Rap, Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance

So here we go, now
It is the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, niggas would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big, Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher, I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit, Renaissance won't quit
We gon' baptize y'all for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr. Strange
Making cultures move, if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin, it won't bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we don't see it as one
We don't quit, bullshit, and we never lost, son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearing's impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it, it's like dynamite
And it's the Renaissance, rap

Uh, uh, it's the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uh, cause it's the Renaissance
It's the Renaissance, rap
It is the Renaissance rap

Now lookin at ya clock, you know that it's time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the T-O-P
That be G-O-D, and I be T-I-P
The promoter of the flyness, witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came, but I'm the royal highness
Don't'cha ever forget, who put the pep in ya step
We made it cool to wear medallions and say hotep
And this beat is suh'thin that you can't recover up from
You better a-joinin the force because we can't be done
Listen, we on this mission and it's a go
So welcome to the Renaissance in stereo
It's the Renaissance"

Around you'll be hemps meat inside of a meal sack
Puny little bucks better hit the jake
But that doesn't mean nothin' to the heart within
You cramped up you and your team, I'm amped up
And you can't dib me bead

My shine, what the is on your mind?
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind
Other brothers ain't motivated, they can't do it
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it
My music comes on and we march at the dance
Inside of your mind or inside of my pants?
Musical intention that we have is vast
You sick, drink a Nyquil, well, I'm dead on your

Oh well, then here comes the gelatin
Tips on some sugars but you yap on your sellin' friends
Now your party is completely blown
Real name is Kamal, I'm in completely zone
It's rap time for you, that means nap time
Preachin' from my joint, what the I'ma clap mine
Singin songs of 6 pence it's intense
Surpise your at the end like the sixth sense

Heavy hitters knockin' shit out the park
You couldn't even really play tell me why did you start
Spittin' sharp blades laced with bleach
You wanna play around kid, I'm not a walk at the beach
A stroll in the park or your playground
Put on your headphones, tell me how grenades sound
Put on your walkmase and go underneath the town
Q-Tip abstract how I gets down

All my bitches, dance if you know that you dam sure
Let your drip on the dance floor if you wanna
Get down
That, that bust gats
Better let 'em in 'fore they rush that 'cuz they wanna
Get down

Blick, piano sick
Get down
Chill you can get off my and
Get down
While I'm on the hook get on your good foot
And blow up the spot for all of you 'cuz that's how we
Get down

Comin' with the brand new quickly we pan to
The young black man with intentions to ban you
Seems that people need an aid today
So many fade away, so many fiend to stay
I really rhyme 'cuz I feel I should say things
While the fraudulent act raps just so they cop rings
Or maybe because when they was young
They was fronted on and left alone to have they own fun
Now they've all grown up to be
I'm giving you the rope will you tie up the lassos

You swing dangling from peach trees
While I sip my Daqaris in the south west breeze
Writing so exciting the pen it keeps
Drippin' out gems that's converted to hems and then
People be hummin' it from now to they next to kin
My family is starvin', you know they want me to win
Me forfeit, please get off it
Send a check in my name to my office
Mutombo in the lane, yo I toss it

Same thing as other, no need for cookie cutter
The bar gets raised, not your average old gutter
For that I hit a chin up, b, ya time been up
Would've came sooner but I overslept my get, up

My brother Shaka would have wanted me to do it like this
So raise your glasses for the lost ones in your life

Dilla Dawg and Master Wel would have wanted me, as well
To propel with the spirit of the mic

Even if you had one person with you and it's hard
They make it easy, celebrate them, let them just who they are

Because of these experiences I have some control
On the microphone, I'm bold elevating to the stars

Here's a demonstration, with the excellence
Reverse the pandemic that's filled with pestilence
Who has his finger on the pulse of the b-boy?
Serving fiends with the stream of a d-boy
Who's well connected, you must respect it
I'm driven with the spirits mentioned in this record
Hopefully this serves as motivation
The never sayin ?doc? kind of sensation
Put my stamp on it, the mic clamps on it
Mama I know, let me put lil' thamp on it
Blade runnin through the day with agility
Stay gunnin, make way for possibilities
It's the capital Q, rap it'll do
What I want it to, it's like tamin a shrew, uh
Livin life, the Shakespearean proportions
Knowin better, I've experienced distortions
And through the in and outs, of life's revolvin doors
I'mma see that, I'm still gettin more
Yeah I'm comin in, I'm gon' see my friends
To the top floor, it seems it never ends
Heaven never ends, yeah it never ends
It be goin on, it's phenomenon
Like a new born, or a Stevie song
It be going on, do ya feel it?
(Do ya feel it? Do ya feel it?)
The snare drum go

My brother Shaka would've wanted me to say this to y'all
Don't lose sight y'all without giving a fight

I'm channeling Weldon Irvine Mr. Clean
He would've wanted me to say what I mean, and mean give it right

Dilla, havin you in my past has been a blast
You've inspired so many and forever will you last

And to my father, yo your spirit is drapin me
Never escapin me, I'm happy that I had you in my past

They probably swarm in without a warning pointin glocks at us
Get down...but this is gettin us paid
So at a very tender age we learned the tricks of the trade
Copping coke to cooking it to chipping it with the blade
To baggin and pitchin to gettin rid of it in a raid
Most of us would never get to stage, when its lawyers and bail
Hell we're happy to get stiffed in the cage
And it's crazy we be out here days upon days
Makin just enough to get some licks, some kicks, and some haze
It's a damn shame we're placed in a no win situation

She gettin some strippin paper but saved enough for a tummy tuck
Little man hungry as fuck he only one-years-old
But knows he's unlcuky and such
As he grows he gets bitter now he acts up in class
He curses his teachers out tellin them they can kiss his ass
Soon as he didn't pass his mama whoppin his ass
His pops is not around the boy is blocked down
(Blocked down) Not even 12 months later
He suckin on 40oz and pissin in elevators
Idolizin the guys with big rides that gettin quick paper
And now he despises the shit-taker
He 13 goin on 26 and a half
His only dream is to have bricks and a stash
Poppin the clutch and hittin the gas, so he start dabblin
In the coke game pitchin for halves
Now he sittin in a cell with an unpeculiar bail
He happened to make a sale to an unfamiliar male
Who was an undercover cop his photo is at the station

Hurstville, Bunker Hill you don't stop

That's where all the focus is makin sure all the blacks

How can they lie with such compulsiveness we just sit around
Acting like this is how we supposed to live
Fuck outta here, I can swear in bout a year

This gettin treated like shit still gettin beat
With nightsticks, still attractin heat in my six
That's why we ride still drink Barcardi and the Gin

Verse 1:
And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break
And thinks how many cigarettes does it take
He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye
He squints, he thinks he starts to sigh
Sometimes he cry
When he think about his girlfriend on his side
She held him down, she made him better
Fought the love, through the f'd up weather
And she thinkin about her life
With no more work just being a wife
But instead her love, she gave it to a man
Who fought against her lovely plans
So when she go to work, plus go to school
Plus fight for love, she must feel like a fool
She want the ease that come after pain
She fights for love, that's her campaign
We fight, we love

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
We fight and love so much sometimes
I get confused of who we are
Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit
Will find out who we are

He left his friends, he ain't home no more
He's in a place, that's far away
Where he can't understand what they say
They say salaam, they carry bombs
In crowded places, and cause alarm
You're the infidel who's uninvited
But really an American boy who's slighted
It ain't your fault, you want identity
So you join this big fraternity
You get to travel the world, it's cheaper than college
And you get guns and you get knowledge
Lookin for your soul, and wmd's
You can't find nothing, cause it's empty
You got your gun, and he's your friend
And he's your man, until the end

Laugh, tricks that he gassed your ass
Siphon and not your cash
Seeing the door in a flash
While I stay enclosed
Walkin' out my clothes she said,

I won't trade him for nothing

You're mother fucking right
Walking this shit every night
Fin this shit? Hold it tight
Rina filma on my sleeve?
Even when I have to leave
Cooler than even in the breeze
Do you believe
I was waiting for nothin'

In the rebound new group of shorties
Off the post, goin' coast to coast
She on the hard ones, sub him out the game she sayin'
""naw, he good, I mean""

For no amount of dough

Give him all the things you can
Think long term plans

Front page magazine, listen to this lady scream
I won't trade him for nothing

Cause she know what's better her top and
Now a beckon on the flu
Like a runnin' with the nicest nigger
Kinda sorta?
When he's singing just to slaughter no matter the quarter

I won't trade him for nothing

The club house king
Batting practice Slugger swing,
Game time same thing
When I'm in about a minute
Holdin' the bat, as good as fat
She's out the park and comin back she's saying

I won't trade him for nothing

And for ray you say you get it good
If you were the ball player at all
And the famous fall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from you walls
This is why you can't trade me

I won't trade him for nothing
Now that I know what is boy

You can bet your money on a sure thing
Certain profit's what it brings
Ceremonies of the ringer in the white house wing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring, do you wanna trade?

I won't trade him for nothing

'Cause in the air? There's a teammate you're lookin' for
Back-shoot and aughter ball?
Leaves it all on the floor
Always lookin' to score
Pep talks in the locker room
This is why you sing this tune

I won't trade him for nothing

And then you reach Can't make me sit out
I go 'til you get out
Her ball no get out
An all night get-down
I train for the pressure
And come out fresher
Equipped for the game
You know my name, it makes me better
I cheer for the whole team
Let's go for the whole thing
The ballots that you're holding
Mvp voting
And I represent the sentiment you're emoting
And you say

I won't trade him for nothing

The physical ability with mental capability
Legitimately faces me outside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me
Vacating this community I'm staying in

I won't trade him for nothing

I'm glad that you feel this way,
Here is where I like to play
Need to hear it everyday
They cheer for me, say ""Olay!""

I couldn't, even swallow
Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so I'd be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in
That's when the snoopin and shit it would begin
Where you at?
Where you going?
That's what I get when I pick up the phone

These things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
It's never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doin so much to try to pin me
Goin through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seekin
Well it seem I'm gettin close
That I'm reachin
And I was thinkin I had no reason
Callin you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?
We'll make a mends if you admit it
We can ascend if your commited
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes for many days
Sweet love can decay from you

It's you

Movin through life at will he ill

But he still no joke wit his wisdom and smile
Givin pounds all around no need to act foolish
Enjoy the time no need to get toolish
I spit it out wit the general feelin that
Once u vibe wit it then you keep on comin back
The north south and east and the west
Wanna see which crew can do it the best
Is it the north, where people drink juice and smirnoff?
Girls go hard but they lips stay soft
The west where cats throw jets to play
Smokin green all day keep a loked out sway
East..side..the hustle get real
Pretty young things with their mass appeal
Or the south where thugs keep gold in their mouth
Big ol girls with their thang hangin out
Whatever it is I hope you evolve
We gon push it to my level let the g evolve come on

Go through walls with sounds and speakers with real drives
You can't fuck this nigga from tribe a yo

And I do that well if I do suggest yo
Put your hands on your system and feel me out
Or put your hand on your money and hold your cloud

She get touched once and shell never divorce me
Hey clear your brain as I implimate raw thoughts
You shouldn't be aware that I don't get off course
Stayin steady on it niggas aint ready for it
Flourin it hard with a.j. pettite on it

It's a great day fuck it
Ya probably hear the bundles overflowin' out of Ruckers
The name is Abstract don't confuse without description
Cause you lil' gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin' weak shit
Ride off in the night, V8 lost power
From a soundbomb killin' the lone ranger drillin'
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive
Ya actin' with ya heart then start preachin' with ya fatness
The clear voyage psychic mc is a minion
You cornered and you bagged in so where you gon' run to
Used to get my mother's switches now I grant her wishes
Never superstitious breakin' mirrors with the pitches
Ya man is insane with that do-do on his chain
Funkin' up the joint he pain, that ainc1"

Da wurden sie freinander zur Medizin.

Them playas with the Benz's when they let the top down
Cruisin' slow and low, one time for the 64

Pumpin' the Summer Jam because it's summer time

You was that nerd fake cat who went to school at Lamda Lamda

Niggas riot up, and then blame it on the blaze they've fired up
So I'm bringing back something that was never lost

Many die from e-bola

Many from AIDS
Mexicans, Whities, Japanese, and Spades
Indian, Iranian, and all them others
Bout to find out for self

We got the phantom
See which side of the game is over there

Well is this it, the end of civilization
Are we prepared? Well I hope so
Here's the official stolen government training film
of the secret plan to deal with an alien uprising

Today you have to stay on your toes
When you're walkin' the streets and stalkin' the sheets stay on the low
Go to the wrong territory and get blown, blown
Some brother's ain't even knowing, knowing

Revelations are is on it's way like ya next spliffs
So get your mental uplift while we shootin' the gift

Mass eat per cold clams

Kick brands after man so our whole crew can expand

Make a movie with the red, and dog her out like Gucci said
Me and money newlywed, that's why that toolie in my pants
Pull up with them uzi's and some goonies in a minivan

I'mma dawg just like Gucci said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
I'm still a dawg, still dawg just like Gucci said

My word is law, is money my flaw
I gotta have it if I'm broke, I go through withdrawal
Round of applause, shout out her jaws
Could suck a laffy taffy, right straight through a straw
Faded like a Boosie cut, off Janet Juice like Juicy cup
Pull up in that Dooley truck, like Gucci smokin' fruity blunt
Blowin' smoke like hookah out the roof
Like we brought Snoop with us
You a dog and I'm a dog, then nigga that make two of us

I'mma dawg just like Gucci said
Married to the money, I'm a newlywed
And I'm faded just like Boosie' head
Eyes bloodshot, them bitches ruby red
I'm a dawg, I'm a dawg just like Gucci said
Shut the fuck up ho just like Juicy said

Ayy, us niggas from the north, we like to rob and shit (fuck shit up)
Splittin' licks, pots 'till my whole squad was rich (woah)
Never fuckin' with these flawed ass crews and cliques
Keep the tool case I gotta unscrew your shit
Cut these niggas and these hoes on some groupie shit
They talk behind your back but in your face be on your dick
That's why I stay close with my dawgs
These white collar crime ass niggas be frauds
I'm quick to stiff arm all my niggas and ball on a bitch
I'm driving fast, bending corners sipping slow on my whip
I keep my hoes segregated, on my Jim Crow shit
And my patience is short but I keep a extended clip

You ain't fighting, you ain't hard, nigga
You be lieing, you be fucking different broads, nigga
You ain't rich, you don't ball, nigga
You ain't tryna take a bitch to the mall, nigga

I got a bitch named Lula, she a real dick chewer
Got a neck just like a rooster, seen her deepthroat a chalupa
And Lula keep her head by my waist like Medusa
Let her blow me like a hooker, then I call her ass a Uber
Bet she ain't like the red, Lord when I fuck her breasts
Love playing catch when I shoot it on a cheque
Got a Asian that sucky-sucky even though, she got a hubby, she ain't really luvy-duby
And that's why I chose her
Que killing bitches like he James ""Whitey"" Bulger
Diggin', I be in a bitch stomach like a ulcer (keep going)

I could give a fuck about your Benz or your couple of friends, you just a
Trick nigga that ain't my cup of tea
On your best day, nigga, you couldn't fuck with me
I'm a pimp, true, but you can still get punched to sleep
You could never be a better dawg than me
I fuck your baby mama mouth until her jaws squeak
Then tell her don't let the door hit you with the good Lord split you
Keep a bitch's coochie wet like the Chattahoochee river
Do it like Future in my white Gucci slippers
You take the bitch to Ruth Chris, I take the bitch to Krystal
On first string, shootin' three, I'm in the league
I taker her money from her, you take her to Tiffany's, nigga (Que)

Oh sometimes a wanna die feels like no one cares for me and it's evident

But to have ma daddy touching me that's just not fair
Stop him from destroying ma future
Believe me he's behaving like a creature

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you
Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet
Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God
[Eric]
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you
You're at the top of my list
Cuz I'm always thinking of you
(Take it to the bridge)
All my love
(Cuz all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't wanna stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)
[Queen Pen]
Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning,
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit
Talked about that s** like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels
Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work
Dead wrong, but head strong, you had me sprung
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you
My God
[Eric]
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy

A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Baby Daddy
I shouldn't wanted him
I shouldn't trust him
No I shouldn't fucked him
Now here I am carryin his seed
That makes two for him and a fourth for me

[Verse:]
Sometimes I'm wreckin my brain, tryna to figure out
How we can come to this, how we even came about
We never took the time to measure the proper amounts
Or beef we would cause of sneakin around
If my brother even knew shit he'd proably flip out
And up until tonight we never had doubts
Remeber the first time that you slept over my house?
We made love to Donnell Jones, damn we so foul
But now it's been a year from that day today
We still meet in the cut I can't live this way
Can't be no more us, fuck you feelin lame
What about me feelin loved, is s** all that it's worth?
When it comes to us, I know that you love me
It's deeper then a nut, I know that you care for me
It's deeper then a nut

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 2:]
You keep blamin it on him clamin him as a friend
Talkin about you and that nigga is tight like brothers
Fuck him, and I can put that on my life
So what he my baby daddy he don't do his child right
Tryna to explain I got tears in my eyes
This lump in my throat tryna hold back my cries
You talkin about me and ya booze ain't wise
Me and you has a cup Queen it just ain't right
You said it could never be yo niggas B. D. A wife
Tell me how would it look to the rest of my crew
You fuckin wit me Queen that's just bad news
I'm breakin rules but we just can't stop
I said we in too deep I'm not killin ya seed
I say we in too deep nigga I'm keepin my seed

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 3:]
It really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
When you couldn't even cop a new coat for yo kid
It really broke my heart when you cocked backed on me
When I was six months pregnant still beatin on me
It really fucked me up how you put me in debt
Fuckin up qps dollars and sense
To think I catch your doughs and your whiz in my crib
Jeporadize a lively hood on me and my kids
And which one of those seeds belong to you
God would've been better of makin a cat or a baboon instead of you
Nigga I mean you ain't worth shit
A man that don't take care of his kids ain't worth lint
Now here I am I'm in love wit yo friend
And the only thing standin in the way is you bitch!
I cursed the day I ever even accepted your dick

Wanted me to notice the rythm of her thighs
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me

Which brings me to realise that the tough life that I had only made me
Stronger, ...TRUE

A ha ha ha ha
I know this much is true
Verse One:
Growin' up didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you
Wanna play you close and jump in the pool wit' you
I don't know what to do but this much is true
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career
And turn right around when you hot a gear
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear
That the man upstairs, he control this here
And it's funny how, soon as the money piles
Everybody wanna play with that brother now
Run me down, but when the doe gets low, only a few friends roll, you know
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife

Reminiscing to back in our beginning
Sweet politicing in the heart of the village
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'
As you slid out the door
I remember clearly makein' moves up the steps we made eye contact
It was his gleam that brought me back, ligit
How we met on some real ghetto star shit
Mad chicks on my melody's dick
See he got this kinda grace about himself
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my lovin
He's got personality for days
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always
Appreciates gettin' laid
My melody...

Just the way. I wanna be loved

Verse 2
True, we been together from the very beginning
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour
His s** is respected behind closed doors
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different
It's a fact how he mistify me like Kaiser Sosack

Still moving this flavor

It's them lame chicks that fuck it up for us
Runnin around the club bein a bag of darts
A bonafide child not like years in diss
Holdin down fort real Brooklyn shit
Weed rolled in fry talon dreads swa rich
Ain't nothin changed since '86
We stopped transportin' start makin hits
Ghetto from the start Queen represent

Hook:

For all the honeys in the ghetto that's holdin their own (rock the body)

For all my puffed out dogs in the club thugged out (rock the body)

Niggas talk shit on the regular
And those be the ones that sweatin ya'll
Wether east or west D servin ya'll
Tray Lee and the Queen Pen murderer
If it's not real boo, why bother
Tell me why window shop with bags of copper
Jack yo ass up like my baby father
Jack yo ass up like my baby father

[Tracey Lee]
When Tray Lee come through it's party time
But a party ain't a party till you spark a dime
Ya'll can hate but I'm still gonna make ass shake
Still got the steel by the waist runnin through ya'll
Me and Queen Pen find us at the bar schemin
I still owe dough
So who I gotta get to break even
Rnf niggas who live for the weekend
Stil drinkin, hey! Stil leavin the club with hoes
They seen us on Keenan
You dealin with pros, Goddamn
Future of the game turnin cats into ""what happen to's""
Like Brains, Tray ain't change
Still spit on, still ride everything that I get on
Still be in the club with Tims on
Raw dog forever

because the world's so busy,
so busy, cleaning a clean slate.

Oh.
Ahh, hoping to find what's mine,
so I can lead a full life,
use a knife,
and dig in like a cannibal.
Out for,

Do best to crane your neck. Drink it in with no respect.
Drink it in and sing back: La la la la la.
Let's never nod or shake or ever hestitate to throw back
Our heads and say:

I can see it in your eyes, you haven't been happy in a long time
Hey, you know, I know you too well for you to try to hide it
You deserve it, baby you deserve the best
It's a shame you that settle for less,
So it's about time for me to get something above my chest

Baby, oh, I've been holding this back, back, for too damn long
And you've been holding on to a man that loves you not
Whoa, girl let me show you what real love's about
Give me that chance
And I'ma show you how, how
How you supposed to be loved
Show you how,

Men put you off guard, but you know that every single word I'm saying is true
Same way that you know ain't nothing that your boy won't do for you
Deep down you know I'm right, but you're scared
I know it, just too afraid to show it

It barely even runs and it stinks inside
But I really don't care cuz it's gettin me where I'm goin
I'm just drivin along I hear this horn start blowin
I'm lookin all up in the rearview like who the fuck is behind me
The high beams in my face and know they startin to blind me
This fool is gettin pissed cuz I ain't goin fast enough
But I can't go any faster still he wants to pass and stuff
He passes on the right and then he flips me off
He's like fuck you pal as he lays on the horn
And that shit be pissin me off cuz he thinks that he's safe
Just because he's in his car but I'll still break his face
Now my heart is startin to race adrenalyne is flowin
He treat me like shit drivin away where the fuck he think he's goin
I'll show him who he's messin with now I'm gonna make him pay
So I follow him home because he caught me on a bad day
I can't believe that guy has some nerve
So I followed his ass all the way home to the suburbs
He pulls into the driveway he's goin into the house
Tonites the night I think Ima take the whole family out
So I wait a while but now I got a closer look
So I go up to the window and I'm hidin up in a bush
And I look inside oh no what do I see?
Its the classic all american family
The asshole is sittin on the couch with his wife
Hes got 2 kids a dope crib what a life
He has no idea that they all about to die
Cuz today the stupid bitch fucked with the wrong guy
I walk up to the house and I kick open the door
The guy jumps up he trys to his me in the jaw
But I look at him and smile now the families gettin scared
They all run and hide but this guy is still there
So I'm still smilin at him cuz I'm a lunatick
Then I took out my knife and I stabbed him in the dick
He fell to the floor as he begged for his life
He asked if I was gonna hurt the kiddies and his wife
So I said fuck you the whole family's dead
Then I stomped on his head till the carpet turned red
I hear some cryin wheres it comin from now I got it
I go up to the next room it's comin from the closet
So I'm walkin over and I rip off the door
His wife is in the fetal position laying on the floor
I tell her to get out but she doesnt't't wanna listen
She just layin on the floor and she keeps winmperin
She said please don't hurt me and I said bitch you ain't that lucky
She said take whatever you want I said I don't want your money
So I stepped into the closet and I grabbed a wire hanger
Wrap it around her neck and strangle....
Walkin down the hall oh no I'm hearin some more cryin
I walk into the bedroom under the bed the girl is lyin
So I reach under the bed and I'm grabbin her by the hair
I drag her out from under as she looks at me in tears
So I grabbed a barbie doll and jammed the legs through her neck
What I bloody mess so I dragged her with the rest
Of the dead family but there's still the little boy
I'm walkin around the house and I start to hear this little noise
So I walk into the bathroom think it's comin from the tub
So I'm rippin down the shower curtain this is the shit that I love
So I ripped him out of the tub and shoved his head in the toilet bowl
Makin him drown in his own piss stealin his innocent soul
So I guess my work is done
The stupid mother fuck will never fuck with anyone
So watch who youo fuck with be careful what you say
Cuz you might catch a skitzo on a bad day"

And I need help

Just look at me)

Godamn, look at me, I'm a mess
I mean, what the hell is happening these days
I don't want to hurt people it's just my mind
Ii can't control myself
Argh

Sitting by a dumpster on a dark and rainy night
I'm killing in a alie ain't a soul in site
There's rain pouring down on my blood stained clothes
Trembling and shaking cause I just don't know
What's going on with the feeling right inside me
Body parts are rotting in the dumpster right beside me
I don't know who I killed or even why I did it
The last thing I remember I was sitting in my kitchen
Now I'm more covered in blood and I'm fucking soaking wet
I got a human heart on a chain around my neck
My mind is rotting and my thoughts are decayed
A sick imagination in a blood stained brain
So I stand up rain beats off my face
So I get my hatchet and I put it on my waist
Take off my mask and I put it on to place
There ain't no time to waist it's blood I wanna taste
I walk into a diner that's open all night
There ain't nobody in there but the cook and his wife
Walked to the place and they're scared as hell
I jump over the counter and they start to yell
I tell the bitch to shut her mouth
And stay the fuck still
Grab the cook's head
Plant his face on the grill
And as I press harder I can smell flesh burnin
Took a hatchet to his neck the blood starts squirtin
Bbody hits the floor, his heads still fryin
His wife lays on the headless body and she's cryin
Grabbed her by the hair bit out her throat
She gasps for air and the bitch starts to choke
I leave her to die while I grab the cooks head
I slice off his cheek and I put it in some bread
Cut off their fingers put em in the deep fryer
I ate em' on the counter while I light the place on fire
Leave the burning building
In search of more victims
If anybody steps into my path I'm gonna kill em
Got a pocket full of bibles in my trench coat
A bloody lunchbox filled with noses and throats
Hacked up fragments of brain stuck in my hair
A mayonnais jar filled with bit off ears
Man I'm in tears

(Chorus - repeat 4X)
My mind is rotting and my thoughts are decayed
A sick imagination in a blood stained brain"
Q-Strange,Drifter,/q/q+strange/drifter_20187396.html,"I can't explain why I'm filled with hate
But one hot summer day on the interstate
I was hitchhiking looking for this killing mate
I'm feelin great
I wanna singlehandily increase the murder rate
And terminate
Anybody that I see I'm gonna stab em
Here comes a car pullin over  a station wagon
Its got a mom and 2 kids inside
? Hey you need a ride you look like a nice guy??
? Thank god you stopped I'm just goin to town
Because a couple miles back my car broke down
But you really shouldn't pick up people that you don't know
Cause one of these days you might pick up a psycho!?
Right then and there I put the blade to her neck
? Ill fuckin kill you all if don't stop this wreck.?
She said: Take the car but leave me and the kids?
? Keep beggin bitch like I really give a shit.?
So the kids started screamin as I took her outside
They watched in horror as their mom got tied
To the back bumper
They watched they mother
Getting beat down by this sick mother fucka
Got back in the car they was petrified (let's go)
Put the car on drive now it's time for ride
Pedal to the floor hit 75
As the kiddies watch momma getting dragged behind
Bloody limbs they fly all over the road
Till it's just a mangled a torso tied to a rope
Got back in the car
They thought they was in danger
Let this be a lesson to don't ever talk to strangers

Takin lives like a burglary
Watch on the news and ya heard of me
There aint no stoppin my murder spree
I'm on a murder spree I'm on a murder spree (Chorus X 3)

So I calmly walked away towards the train tracks
In blood stained slacks
Cause my brains tapped
I hop a fraught car no idea where I'm headed
I ran just in time to get in I don't see an endin
Get off the train headed to the first house
It works out perfectly -a murder spree
Got the urge for a murder
Gotta take another life
Today I think I'll take a little house wife
So I'm quite as a mouse in the house I sneak in
Wifeys makin lunch while the kids are sleepin
I creep in the kitchen wrap my arms around her waist
? Ooo honey your home early??
? Wrong bitch look at my face
Now stop that fuckin screamin bitch that shit wont make me stop
All your doing is brewin the urge I already got!?
She tried to call for help in a desperate attempt
A bloody hand print on the phone is as far as she gets
So I took out my knife and I severed her spinal cord
Now she's layin in a pool of blood on the floor
? I aint leavin till I know your dead?
I unplugged the microwave and I bashed her in the head
? Thanks Hon' it was fun but now I gotta run?
Left the 2 babies crawlin in there mothers own blood
See a police car in the distance
And they ask If I need some assistance
Walked over to the cruiser leaned inside
? Thank god you stopped cause I need a ride.?
? Well obviously you do there's a killer on the loose
You shouldn't be out son aint you dun see the news (Ah?)
Come on inside I'll take you home
But before he knew what happened I just grabbed his throat
He tried to grab is gun out the holster
What the hell
I just grabbed it out his hand then I shot him in the shoulder
Choked him to death then I dragged him out the car
Then I carried his fat ass to a barn
Dropped him on the ground then I hollowed out his rib cage
Driving off his pain cause I gotta sick brain
I can't control it when the urges are occurrin
Took a bite out of his bladder like the sour taste of urine
In my mouth spit it out now I'm off to the next
I wanna see death but it's more complex

Yea that's right pig
Its nothing personal
Its just it's just I got a urge to kill
And you can't stop me
Aint nobody gonna stop me
Your just another statistic
Now I'm off to the next

Q-Strange,Eternal Bliss,/q/q+strange/eternal+bliss_20327008.html,"This is for all the lost souls, there is hope

Happiness is all I want but I am caught by misery
And no one understands or even cares if I just live or die
There is only one way out and I am not afraid to take it
It's the only way I say is Su-i-cide {*repeat 3X*

This kids mom died when he was just fifteen
Left with his house his pops was a dope fiend
Who didn't give a fuck about him
He even thinks that he'd be better off without him
He goes to school with no friends and he's mad for
He misses his mom even though she was a crack whore
Comes through the backdoor so dad wont see
Cuz after school at 3' he gets greeted with a beat
He has to go around with smelly clothes and no socks
While other kids rocked new Nike's and Reeboks
He's not happy with his miserable existence
Sometimes he has the urge to just say 'Good Riddance'
Grew up around drugs but never thought about trying it
Tried to not become a product of his environment
He tried even to talk to his pillow like a psychiatrist
Screaming in to it 'Why did she have to die'
Mom was in a program to get off the stuff
I guess she wasn't ready, or strong enough
But if she was alive it wouldn't be good either
Cuz dad used to beat her every day and mistreat her
He hates his father but it's all he has left
He doesn't want to live because he's afraid of death
But maybe he think that he'd be better off dead
He grabbed a paper and a pen, wrote a note and it said:

(Chorus X 3)

He feels a little nervous because he doesn't know what left it
What be the best to end it  He's starting to cry now.
Time now  he wants to just think it through
Life stinks it's true but there's got to be a better way
A better day may come but it ain't likely
'It's a constant battle in this life, It fights me'
He thinks that he's a coward but in fact he's real brave
Never gave in to temptations that put his mother in the grave
He wants to be saved, but no one hears his cries for help
Except for god in heaven, still he wants to kill himself
He wasn't brought up to know about god and the bible
He own short life was spent nothing but survival
Suicidal thoughts evading his young mind
Sunshine is something he ain't seen in a long time
He can't take the loneliness and the sadness
Goes in the other room and gives his dad a kiss
Even though he's passed out from the drugs
He still only has - and in a way still loves him
He wants to join his mom in eternal bliss
Got in the bathtub and sliced his wrist
As he watched his blood pour out the veins and down the drain
He said goodbye to the pain

(Crying)

(Chorus) - repeat 4X

There is hope, you can get help
There's somebody you can talk to
There is hope

Q-Strange,Heroin,/q/q+strange/heroin_20219129.html,"You'll never leave me
You need me in this life
You can't live without me
I own you
You belong to me
That's right, don't ever try to leave me
Because you can't
You can't do it
You know who I am

(Who are you? Tell em' your name*)

My name is Heroin I'm better than your medicine
I'll take your life and your soul if you let me in
There ain't a problem in this world that I can't fix
There ain't a pain that you have I can't help you deal with (X 2)

You need me you can't live without me inside you
Don't believe in negative press you've been lied to
I'm all you need in life you can't breathe without me
I'm your best friend, your lover and your family
I make you feel like you have supernatural power
I'm all you need and I'm just a brown powder
You'd steal from your own mother just to have me
Walk through the worst neighborhoods just to grab me
Sitting in a corner putting me in a spoon
Anticipating the feeling you're gonna have soon
Burning me, turning me into liquid form
It's a great habit what you wanna kick it for
You look at you, you're trembling putting me in that syringe
You're pocking your skin you're trying to get me in
Youll shoot me through your eyelids just to get me to your brain
The faster I can go there and ease your pain
In your vein I just slither like a venoms snake and it's great
I can't wait to end your heartache
I slowly cross the blood brain barrier
Give birth to morpheme finds to open your receptors
You have a sensation; you're calling it a rush
The intensity because you had all my drug
And the faster that I find to open your receptors
The more intense the rush is, it feels even better
You might have a warm blushing in your skin
Have a dry mouth or happiness in your limbs
You might be nauseous, vomit, have severe itching
But it's worth it nothing beats this here feeling

(Chorus X 3)

You got problems in your life I can help you through it
You tried to dump me once before but you couldn't do it
You had insomnia, muscle and bone pain
Worse than when you tried to leave my cousin named Cocaine
You were vomiting, restless, had cold flashes
It's just you and me no one knows you're an addict
You're psychically dependent on me now. Don't you see that?
You would die without me in your life, believe that
I've infected your heart and collapsed you veins
I've done sever damage to your brain
Because of me youve had bacterial infections
A small price to pay that's the cost of my affection
The high is wearing of you're drowsy for a couple of hours
My affects have got your mental function all clouded
You heart rate drops you respiratory system slows
You're slowly fading as a victim of my overdose
You needed me but don't you see I don't need you
There's a lot of people in this world that need me too
I just used you like the stupid bitch you are
I left you dead in your own vomit on the kitchen floor
I didn't care about you; you're just a bitch to me
I know you cheated on me with my brother Ecstasy
We got more people to infect, you can't stop me
These rehabs and clinics people still can't drop me
I've been on a killing spree for decades now
There ain't nothing in this world gonna slow me down

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
Yeah that's right
You can't stop me
I'm just gonna keep going
I'ma keep ending more lives, infecting more people
This ain't never gonna stop
Cause once you've had me, you can't live without me in your life
I will rule your whole world
You live for me
I own you"
Q-Strange,Illusion,/q/q+strange/illusion_20238090.html,"Hi I'm just a regular guy
It's just an illusion I made from the outside
Inside I got a sick mind
When the mask goes on just prepare to die (2x)

Strange thoughts my mind begins to scatter
Recover from depression I don't know what's the matter
Well I'm mad like a hatter and I'm clearly insane
But my life is an illusion so I'm hiding the pain
Its strange to be normal but I'm trickin em all
Cuz what goes on in my mind is like off the wall
Lasting as I tick tick tick I be a lunatick I need help
And I wanna kill myself
But I wanna kill everyone else
But I know I'm a nice guy you can't even tell
That I'm a psycho Michael find someone to rain on
Stalk her for months just to scare her
Walk in your house I creep
Sit there all night just to watch you sleep
And I'll sneak out the door just before you wake
The puppy tried to bark but I chewed up his face
I tried to escape from the realm of insanities
Sick of people sayin they're understandin me
You can't understand cuz I don't't even know myself
I have a disease I need psychiatric help
But I'm in denile you see me happy and smilin
But inside my mind already died
Maybe I'm depressed from feelings ive repressed
Never expressed but oh I'm obsessed with death I guess
Something went wrong down the line
I can't control the I'll thoughts in my mind
I look like a nice guy wouldn't hurt a fly
But it's just an illusion I created on the outside

Nobody can know, nobody'll know till the mask goes on they'll see

(Chorus)

The voices in my head forever taunting me
Demonic laughter from hell haunting me
I tried to shut them up I bash my head against the wall
And I'll be laughing hard after I bruise and blood my skull
The voices the voices they make my brain numb
Tellin me to do sick shit in voodoo tongues
I'm doin what they tell me just to shut them up
You think you're my friend but I'll stilll fuck you up
You thought I cared about you that was an illusion
You don't understand it's my mind that I'm losin
The man that you thought you knew was a mirage
I'm clean cuttin body parts up in my garage
Im the cryo clone you never thought woudl run into you
But I'ma slash you hide you out put you in a tub of tub of vinegar
You want me to kill ya cuz you don't like the torcha
But I sorta like to see you in pain
Insane what I am but I always wasn't like this
Back in the day I wouldn't even write this
Used to make songs to party and have fun
But now my I'll joints make insane clowns run
The law was changed wheh I was on the brink of insanity
So I saw a shrink he said he's gonna help me reach to my inner self
Instead I reach for his throat and strangle to death
I left his office with blood on my hands
Peoiple in the waiting room all screamed and ran
But I didn't sweat it I tried to forget it
And nobody knows that I'm a crazy from it
Its hectic to create the illusion of a sane man
Cuz I'm insane man
Hahahahaheheheheh

Prepare to die
Haha you thought you knew me
It's all an illusion"

Just kill your mother, that ain't cause your woman clean
'Shut the fuck up bitch' and you stab her with a spleen
Kill your father that drunk and fucking waste a life
Wait till he's sleeping and give his fucking troath a slice
Just kill your teacher right in the fucking classroom
Drag his bloody body inside the school bathroom
Right between the classes when the halls are packed
So all the nerds who go to school that are like 'What the fuck was that? '
Kill your best friend when he's hanging at your house chilling
'Nah man that's my homey' 'Man fuck it - just kill him'
Take a sinder arc and smash it over his head
And beat his bloody open skull till you know he's fucking dead
Hide the body in the closet till it starts to stink
Chop him up with a paster and dispose him in a sink
Cause I know the way you think and it's just like you
You wanna kill everybody see I'm just like you
So in the middle of the night, sneak out your crib
Break into the neighbours and don't the wake the kids
And pour gasoline all over the house
Light a match throw that shit in and burn the whole joint down
Just kill people, old people, young people, black people white people
Don't discriminate  We're all equal
I know nobody understands you and they think you're strange
So take it from me  that's my last name

(Chorus X 2)

Go ahead and stab him, get a gun and blast him
Break a pipe and crack him, randomly attack him
Get creative with em' torture when you kill em'
Make them scream your name within in vein make him a victim
Split him wide open and take them organs and guts
Throw them at people in the street like  what
fuck  So many people to kill  So little time
Murder, kill, rape, rob, steal, commit crime
Go to school tomorrow try to top columbine
In a trench coat with an Uzi killing kids without a time
Kill the whole world till it's just you left
And stab your head with a pen till you kill your fucking self
I'm ill, I'm Q and I'm Prozac and Peckville
Take Jones wand it might as well be sugarpills
Cause it does nothing for me man I still wanna kill
I'm not gonna sop till my heart gets spilled
So what the fuck you waiting for, just go ahead and do it
Don't stop till your covered in blood and body fluids
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
do it you chickenshit.. Fuck

(Chorus X 2)

Kill
Yeah what the fuck your waiting for
What are you a little bitch?
Just do it
(Take a deep breeath, grab your knife and just do it)
Don't talk the shit, do the shit
Little bitch

Cause if you was shit you don't just fucking kill somebody man
He's right  Just fucking do it

Sweet dreams close your eyes
Listin to these morbid lullabies
Waken up in cold sweats in the middle of the night
Nightmares nightmares got you all a-fright

[repeat Chorus]

Hope of sweet dreams I go to bed and close my eye lids
Instead I'm having visions images of gothic violence
I'm in a realm of darkness
Scared but can't stop this
Tossing and turning
On a blood stained carpet
can't sleep
I close my eyes I hear screams
Morbid lullabies give my mind bad dreams
I'm seein blood splattered
Body parts scattered
Clinging to picture she no torn and tattered
And yo I'm mad and I've had it
And now myself should be pattered
And no I'm dreaming of a victim all beaten and battered
And as these faces of death they haunt my nightmares
My worst fears invading my brains sphere
Pains severe
As my heart pounds right through my chest
Years sense I've had a good rest
Depressed
Visions of death are now rotting like flesh
Voices in my head put my mind to the test
Time to reflect on the shit I did wrong
By this time tomorrow I'll be gone
I still don't give a fuck
And I have no remorse
I'm dreaming of my body being turned into a corpse
Envisioning my soul rotting in the flames of hell
I don't wonna die or stay in this cell
But I don't got a choice
I gotta pay the price
Seein hellish bodies all sliced
Faces with no eyeballs in the sockets
Chasing me down as I flee into the darkness
The unknown
My minds in a zone and I'm froze
To just sit and let these sick thoughts roam

[Chorus:] - repeat 2X

Angels and demons play tug of war with my soul
I've lost control
Eternal bliss is my goal
I fold under pressure cause this life that I treasure
Is in a parallel dimension that's beyond human measure
Purgatory unsure where else in eternity
Embracing life but still flames are burning me
I'm turning the page to the next chapter of life
Cause after your life on earth ain't even half of your life
Its like passin the mic in infinite eternal cipher
Each emcee representing a new life
I deal with jealousy hate guilt and anger
Wanna make to higher ground but I'm in danger
Of negativity consuming my whole being
Corroding my soul with all the misery I'm seeing
I'm fleeing this rotting human shell forever
Demons chewing on my mind trying to sever
I touch with reality in my rationality
Now I'm battling multiple personalities - personalities
I can't sleep

Q-Strange,That Dream,/q/q+strange/that+dream_20316649.html,"[Verse:]
Back in '88 the little neighborhood terror
Started writin' rhymes back in hip hops golden era
Middle school hallways was bustin' a flow
I used to go by the name of emcee Snow
The music was a way to escape my pain
In the box was Rah Kim or maybe Big Daddy Kane
As the years progressed I kept ownin' my craft
Bus stop kids would laugh white kids can't rap
My voice soundin' funny I was end the midst of puberty
And this whole hip hoppin' rap shit was new to me
1990 made a demo age of 15
It was my dream to just bust on the scene
Flat top fade, with the lines and designs
Rockin' hammer pants was the style at the time
Kickin' my rhymes to anybody that would listen
My moms had my back and gave supportive criticism
1992 I started rollin' wit a crew
My name was Mist Jinx and my partner Doc Seuss
1993 bumpin' Tribe Called Quest
Playin' hooky downtown fuck a history test
I had the cross colors gear with the hair up in dreads
And my friends, knuckleheads we was all good kids
Rappin' over instrumental records on a cassette
We ain't had no equipment if we did we'd be set
'94 was the year moms passed on
Bouncin' place to place just tryin' to find a home
I Hooked up with Jayd and Mo Duce and Nine 5
3rd floor productions man we dropped comin' live
[Chorus:]
No matter what as the years went on
I couldn't stop just writing these songs
When nothin' went right and everything went wrong
Used the music to just keep on
Never gonna stop no I must succeed
Never gonna happen if I don't believe
I got goals that I gotta achieve
And until I do I'll never lose that dream
[Verse 2:]
3rd Floor Productions and the group illriginals"
Q-Strange,Torcha Chamba,/q/q+strange/torcha+chamba_20324665.html,"[Chorus:]
Welcome to my torcha chamba
Welcome to my blood stained room
Gonna see your worst danger
Gonna meet your final doom

[repeat Chorus]

Lock me in with strange put me in a rubber room
It won't help a bit with when I'll thoughts consume
My mind losing all rational thoughts in reality
Multiple personalities battle me
And I snapped cause I can't control the things that I do
I wanna hurt people when the fantasy's through
I walk in the dark and I look for my victim
Like a Pit bull I see them and I sick them
I get so much joy out of seeing people bleeding
They took my cat scan showed the vision of a demon
I fiend in blood like a crack fiend wants drugs
I love dead bodies with maggots and bugs
Yes I wanna stab, slice, stomp and beat
Freddy has nightmares about me on elm street
Where did I get all this aggression and anger?
I take it out on people when I'm bring em in to the chamber

[Chorus:] - 3X

You walk through the hall you can hear the muffled screams
It aint a bad dream but it's worse than it seems
Blood is splattered everywhere it don't matter
You afraid, piss in your pants can't hold your bladder?
What's the matter did you see my cruel experiments?
I do all of this sick shit for my own merriment
People getting stabbed, people getting hurt
People getting shocked, people getting burnt
Nothing compares to the pain that I inflict
So close your eyes bitch I'm just too sick
No one ever made it out except this one nigga
But he left here permanently disfigured
Cause I pealed off his skin, took the skin off other men
And then I sewed it on him
Hispanics, Asians, whites and blacks
He looked like a quilt he had different coloured patches
Then I took all the skin that was left
I made a dope outfit and I sported it myself
No one knows the pain that you're feeling
Blood dripping down the walls and vital organs hanging from the ceiling
Come on down to the chamber underground
Ropes and chains leave you tied up and bound
No one gets out when you're here you're mine
Q Strange can't stop committing crimes

[Chorus:] - 3X"
Q5,Cold Heart,/q/q5/cold+heart_20902647.html,"Where are you going now?
Why do you make me always wonder
What are you feeling now? '
Do you dream like other people?

I know you sit and talk about us
And laugh out loud
Why don't you stop and think about it
Or let me out
Of your cold, cold heart

Let me out
Of your cold, cold heart
Cold heart

Why do you walk away
When I ask you what you need and
I want to feel alive
What do you want I'll be there somehow

You always say there's no problem
And then you're gone
Why don't you stop and think about it
Or let me out
Of your cold, cold heart

We can stick around wasting each other's time
Playing these games twisting each other's minds
Or we can make a stand to be together
I hope that you will stay

Let me out
Of your cold, cold heart"

Soft reflections in your eyes

Will you see me?
Will you touch me?
In the rain.

Restless feelings as I watch you
Try to hold them deep inside

Will you love me?
Will you hold me?
Why can't you tell me if you want me
In the rain.

Touching softly in the darkness
Your lips tasting passions rise

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
In the rain.

Secret shadows, still reflections
Drawing me into your eyes

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
Why can't you tell me if you want me
In the rain, in the rain.

Breathless waiting, as I wonder
Tasting passions, kiss goodbye

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
In the rain, in the rain.

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
Why can't you tell me if you want me
In the rain, in the rain."

I can see what you do to me
I was so empty in love with you

I only know the way you treated me

Livin' on the borderline
Livin' on the borderline with you
Livin' on the borderline
Livin' on the borderline with you

You got yourself a new image
And parade it so gallently
I really tried bit didn't understand
Now it seems much better
If I just turn and walk away
There's no reason to go on and on

Livin' on the borderline
Livin' on the borderline with you
Livin' on the borderline

There always was something
Always was something that got in my way
When I felt your love I never knew
If it was night or was day

There always was something
Always was something that got in my way
I looked in the mirror, I didn't know
If it was night or was day

You never had any reason
For the way you led me to believe
You would always be in love with me
Now it seems much better
If I just turn and walk away
I'll always know just what you meant to me

Q5,Lonely Lady,/q/q5/lonely+lady_20540450.html,"This is the challenge of a lifetime - lifetime
I saw her standing in the cold - twilight

She's never been in love
She always gave it all away
Lonely lady, lonely lady,
Lady on my mind

This is no ordinary love affair - love affair
Her memories she tries to hide - inside of her

She's never been in love
She always gave it all away
Lonely lady, lonely lady,
Lady on my mind

I give her everything and all my love - all my love
This is a perfect chance to show - all of them

She's never been in love

Q5,Missing In Action,/q/q5/missing+in+action_20758514.html,"Well he lost his mind behind enemy lines,
Always running, always under fire
Taken prisoner in a land of dreams
That was a nightmare in disguise
Never been so scared, so filled with pain,
His life passed before his eyes
No one thought that he would be the one
To surrender to all their lies

That's why you're

Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go
(You're) Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you be
Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go, no
Missing in action
Don't you know that I will never let you go

He was taken by surprise, he was paralyzed,
Losing all his will to live
He told them all everything he knew,
Till there was nothing more left to give
Locked alone in an empty room,
His plans are finally made
In the glaring light of a single flame,
Reality begins to fade

That's why you're

Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go
(You're) Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you be
Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go, no
Missing in action
Don't you know that I will never let you go

The kiss of death lingers on his lips,
He's headed for an early grave
Cause the end of a needle and a rusty spoon
Are the only life he has to crave
I can see he's a casualty
Of a freedom that's never free
He's a missing person in a sea of dreams,
Dreams not meant to be

That's why you're

Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go
(You're) Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you be
Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go, no
Missing in action
Don't you know that I will never let you go"

I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

Isn't there a proverb

I can't see the sky
Isn't there somebody
Someone who still cries

Why do I feel so helpless?
What is there left for me?

She walked like she knew where she's been
She set my blood on fire, I said are you for hire?
That's when she turned on me and screamed

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

She had a southern smile and a New York style
I couldn't let her get away
She was the girl of my dreams because I was mean
I had to listen to her say

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

I had to have her bad, but she'd left me mad
That ain't the way it should be
I'm gonna find that girl, take her around the world
I'm gonna love her till she she screams

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

Don't tell me what to do! 

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

To treat a lady, to treat a lady, to treat a lady"

For the good looks and the charms of a woman
A woman dressed in red
My body hurts, my heart it aches
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake
If she's feeling nasty I've got good news
She's not alone just stand in my shoes

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

When I needed money, they told me go find a job
So I gave it a try, worked all day like a dog
My body hurts, my heart it aches
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake
When I walk out, I never go back
If that makes you sorry, just stop in your tracks

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

I had a friend, his head always in the sky
One day he said to me, c'mon and give this stuff a try
My body hurts, my heart it aches
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake
That stuff hit me so bad, I'll never be the same
But what does it matter cause I'm always game

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained"

Q5,Steel The Light,/q/q5/steel+the+light_20758515.html,"Fallen angels and fallen dreams
Pay the price of mystery
The gods declared that man lived by night
And never shall they see the light

But in the heart of one deemed pure
Came the challenge of the fight
To return the days of gold
He must try to steal the light

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

The gods have hidden well the golden sun
Inside the lands of the evil one
He walked the maze of the endless blight
Passed empty rooms where sirens cried

Close at hand his destiny
He feels the power of the light
And as the shadow falls on him
Draws his blade to face the night

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

The clash of steel was heard across the seas
Like no time in history
The dark one blinded by the sword of light
The final blow did take his life

Walked in silence to the golden door
Threw it open to the night
There in his hands our hopes and dreams
That this day would steel the light

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

Turning darkness into light
Take the darkness from our lives
Turn the darkness into light"

And you can't bear the thought of never having fame

Someday you may be a teenage runaway

In your dreams you've got it made
All you worked for finally paid
But wait a minute, you're not dreaming
Ten thousand people as one screaming
Every day you bought those magazines
That told you all about the Rock' n' Roll scene
You had to imagine your face on every page
You can't help thinking about all the times you've paid

Someday you may be a teenage runaway
Someday you may be a teenage runaway"
