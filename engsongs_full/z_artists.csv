ZAYN,A Whole New World (End Title),/z/zayn+malik/a+whole+new+world+end+title_1631281.html,"(feat. Zhavia Ward)

(Aladdin Soundtrack)

[Verse 1: ZAYN]
I can show you the world: shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride

[Chorus: ZAYN & Zhavia Ward]
A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us ""no,"" or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world, a dazzling place I never knew
But when I’m way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I’m in a whole new world with you

[Verse 2: Zhavia Ward]
Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us ""no,"" or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment, red-letter)
I’ll chase them anywhere, there’s time to spare
Anywhere, ooh, ooh (There's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Outro: Zhavia Ward, ZAYN, & Both]
A whole new world (A whole new world)
That’s where we'll be (That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (A wondrous place)
For you and me"
ZAYN,All That,/z/zayn+malik/all+that_21580003.html,"[Verse 1]
When I woke up this morning
The sun had just dawned in
My bed, or your bed
Was the first or the last time
I don't care, it feels right
I'm not, not stopping all night
Things fall apart and in a part you feel distant
Reaction are instant if emotions are constant
Let's say for instance that you had an conscious
Would you take the time then to weigh out the options

[Chorus]
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
All that, all that
You can give me all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
All back, all back
Baby, if you want to you can give me
All that, all that

[Verse 2]
Never cross my mind
Have I crossed the line
Or more defined, more defined
I think inside immortalized
Mortalized, moral life
Coming from both sides
An attack of the mind
Like Optimus prime in his prime
Kick it don't skip it, to the finish line
This minute's mine

[Chorus]
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that (you can give me all that)
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
If you want to you can give me
All that, all that"
ZAYN,BLUE,/z/zayn+malik/blue_21107634.html,"[Verse 1]
In the clouds where the angels sing
In her eyes, where I wanna be and her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gives thoughts and a notion
I need her body, it needs me too

[Chorus]
I need somebody to
Love me blue

[Bridge]
I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long

[Verse 2]
In the clouds where the angels sing
It's her smile, yeah it's all I see, in her eyes, where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body, she needs me too

I need somebody to love
Love me blue

Love me blue

ZAYN,BRIGHT,/z/zayn+malik/bright_21107635.html,"[Verse 1]
I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again, yeah
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm loving the colour white
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright

[Chorus]
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you

[Verse 2]
For the love in my mind, love for the bass
She likes getting high just for the day
She's different in night, she knows what I say
Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes, I don't know you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm loving the colour white
Surrounding your coloured eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright

[Chorus]
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright

What if I changed my mind
What if I said it's over
I been flying so long
Can't remember what it was like to be sober
What if I lost my lives
What if its taking over
What if I forget my lies
And I lose all my composure

[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight

[Chorus]
I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life

What if we never met
What if I never saw her
Cause I've been burning up for so long
In a world that just keeps getting colder

Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life

[Bridge]
Nobody does this like you
I've been around the world
I seen a lot of girls
I been a lot of places
I seen a lot of faces
Nobody does this like you

Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe

I've done this before
Not like this

[Verse 1]
I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's something I want
I'll take all the right wrongs
Now, I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of picking that bone
And I can't be bothered
To fight it no more, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Numb on a roof
Set it on fire
Just to give me proof
I'm living on a wire
Numb on a roof
Set it on fire
Just to give me proof
I'm living on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face

[Post-Chorus]
I've done this before
Not like this, not like this

[Verse 2]
Time for me to move on
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords
Into your songs, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Numb on a roof
Set it on fire
Just to give me proof
I'm living on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now (So say what you wanna say)
So say what you wanna say, what you want

ZAYN,Better,/z/zayn+malik/better_1766323.html,"[Verse 1]
Hope I only leave good vibes on your living room floor
It hurts so bad that I didn't when you asked for more
Your dad probably loves me more than he ever did now
'Cause I finally got out
Yeah, we finally knocked down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it's better that way
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break
'Cause I love you
Yeah, baby, I love you
Just this one time, hear what I'm tryna say
Know you might not feel quite the same way
But I love you
I tell you, I love you

[Chorus]
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm making you cry
Why wait to hate, can we save love?

[Verse 2]
I fell in, I'm falling, I'm for you
I can't let you fall through the floor too
It's a gamble to take any more of you
(It's a gamble to take-take more you)
Still in my mind sometimes, I must admit it
Like it's a crime on trial, I got acquitted
Me and you wasn't meant, we wasn't fitted
Like it's a glove, I hated to admit it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause obviously, we go back
So why would we ruin that?
In too deep, we're rearranged
Now you wanna ask for names
We can't let this fruit go bad
Sayin' things we can't take back
In too deep, we're rearranged
Say you feel the same

[Chorus]
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm watching you cry
Why wait to hate, can we save love?"

She is the life of the party
Don't stick that knife in my body
It's something she always wanted
It's for a good cause you're doing a good job
And we're off where the wind blows
And I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean
You change what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me

[Chorus]
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't fall on me
Don't lean on me

Beautiful insanity
You're like a movie, change the scene
Taste your sweet profanity
It's is all for a good cause think you're doing a good job

Give me all of this, give me all of you
No falling in, don't need no proof
Give me all of this, give me all of you
No falling in, don't need no proof

So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all

Don't fall on me
Don't lean on me

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
For I can't help falling

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
I've been falling for you, baby
I, I can' help falling
I just can't help falling in love
I, I can' help falling
I just can't help falling in love
I just can't help falling in love"

Always lookin' out behind my fences
Always felt isolated, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I was so defensive
I'll find a way to let you in

I will die if I don't try
Damned if I ask why
This is somethin' real
This is somethin' right
Never been in love
Never found it at all until now

[Chorus]
As I lay here in your bed
I need you on my chest
To warm me all the time
To tickle with your breath
Sweetin' on your lips
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
In this ordinary world
Where nothin' is enough
Everything is grey
Mistake your love for lust
When I hold you in my arms
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us

But that's what makes me love you more, oh-oh-oh

Don't you know you're fuckin' beautiful

Let's dance for a while, 
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies, 
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst, 
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever, 
We don't have the power but we never say never, 
Sitting in a sandpit, 
Life is a short trip, 
The music's for the sad man.

I wanna be, 
Forever young, 
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever,

Some are like water, some are like the heat, 
Some are like the melody of some other beat, 
But sooner or later they all will be gone, 
Why don't they stay young?

It's hard to get old without a cause, 
I don't want to perish like a fading horse, 
Youth is like diamonds in the sun, 
And diamonds are forever.

Forever young, 
I wanna be,

So many songs we forgot to play, 
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue, 
We'll let'em come true.

Forever young, 
I wanna be, 
Forever young, 
Do you really want to live forever,

We fell through the flashbacks
Only my mind couldn't sidetrack
Found out and now I feel bad
And now I can't say goodbye (goodbye)
No there is nothing I can't take

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
Must be paying attention
I wanted it all, couldn't stand in the fault
Must be paying attention
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now its stressing me out like that
You're stressing me out like that
Must be paying attention
There's nothing I can't take

[Chorus: ZAYN]
I guess I want you back
I just want you to love me love
You just can't love me back
This is why I'm in need of touch
This is why I need a touch
This is why I need a touch
This is why I need a touch

Chest on your chest
Tangled in bed
But I'm feeling you less
You know my love ain't free
Why do you make believe?
Why do you sell me dreams?

We gotta, we gotta, we gotta face it
The fire, the fire ain't no longer blazin'

Staring at the perfect view

She likes when I’m messy
And I like when she’s undressing

I'm seeing in the blacks and grays
I'm hoping that the basket sways
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night
Does that make it right for smoke
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear

You don't even wanna know about the things I hear
Quick fix, headlights shine bright, you're the fuckin' deer
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position
You'll be fishing for far too long
You're the bad guy in this movie
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution
And the only solution is making shit confusing

Ain't about who's winning or losing
It's bout the path you're choosing
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing
When the scars are gone, you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings
I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me

Bullseye, you the dot to me
Emotions splattered, same pattern, can't even begin to spot 'em
I'm sad about shit that never happened
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out

She's older, I told her we ain't meant to be
It takes two not three, but I'm here anyway, I hope he's leaving soon
Started not to see the elephant in this room, disguise is your perfume
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
You can search the world but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me, be there, you run to me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina
If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya
Kept runnin', outwit, cause you cunnin'
That outfit cause you stunnin', begging cause I'm losing mage
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain

Without falling to your feet

All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
‘Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you're here forever

They still say ""I love you"", on that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory, a case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by"

While I'm tryin' to roll the bones
I don't care I'll just float a check
Cause I'm feelin' my gamblin' Jones
Here come seven, gimme eleven come again
Love to hideout where I am my own best friend

There's crazy little Linda Lou
With the long and lanky legs
Nobody do it like Linda do
At these backwoods lone star dregs
Like I told you, head out fm 92
Roll in slowly, you'll be safer if you do

If you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Let me ease your worried mind
It's the place to go without a doubt
But it's a little bit hard to find
Back in the timber, once you're there
You'll wanna stay
Get loose and limber anytime night or day
Just remember, ask for the Avalon hideaway"

Iv. ""Long Distance Boogie""

Is everybody feelin' good? You makin' us feel good, too!
Now, early this morning I got on that long distance telephone
And I called my mama.
I said, ""Mama, this is your boy, and I'm way down here in
New Orleans, Louisiana. ""
And she said, ""That's all right, boy.""
And she turned to my papa and she said,
""Papa, our boy's way down there in New Orleans.
We cannot let him stay out all night long. ""
She did!
Long about that time, I heard my papa lean toward my mama.
I heard papa tell mama, ""Let that boy boogie-woogie.""
He said, ""It's in him and it's got to come out.""

So I went downtown.
There's a lot of people there.
They was-a really havin' a ball.
And I felt so good.
Yes, I felt so good.

Wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance
With a rag wrapped around her head.

That happened not long ago
'bout the man with a tan:
El diablo de Mexico?
And this man played his hand
And he lived by the luck of the draw;
Now and then and again,
Found him steppin' outside of the law
Hey, hey!

And his fortune he had made
Let him live high on the hog
Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog.
He was out on the run,
Knowing he could get by,
'Cause the men killed in sin
Were not there to testify.
Hey, hey!

He was caught, he was bound
In La Casa de Calaboose.
He was tried; he was found
And readied for the noose.
But the break he would make,
It didn't turn out so well.
And the hombre called ""Diablo""
Bid his last farewell."

That was cuttin' through the air.

Anywhere, y'all,

I heard it, I heard it,

We can all thank Doctor B
Who stepped across the line.
With lots of watts he took control,
The first one of it's kind.
So listen to your radio
Most each and every night
'cause if you don't I'm sure you won't
Get to feeling right.

When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night,
Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right.

Got me a pocket full of change.

Talkin' way underground

And waitin' for a three-point landin'
On my sticky tongue

When she threw her wrench at my monkey.

Shoulda been a cool scene,
Like honey on a ripped queen.
I thought it was a day-dream,
But it must have been a lovething.

I smiled at the way that she told me,
""I just can't turn you a-loose.""
She was a force majeure in her haute couture,
I was howlin' at the moon.

Before my monkey could cook her goose.

Ridin' with some friends of mine.
They invited me just to come and see
Just what was on their minds
And then I took my first long look
At the Master of Sparks on high.

In the back of Jimmy's Mack
Stood a round steel cage
Welded into shape by Slim,
Made out of seven gauge.
""How fine"", they cried, ""now with you inside.
Strapped in there safe and sound. ""
I thought, my-o-my, how the sparks would fly
If that thing ever hit the ground.

Slim was so pleased when I had eased
Into his trap of death.
He had slammed the door but he said no more
And I thought I'd breathed my last breath.
We was out in the sticks down Highway Six
And the crowd was just about right.
The speed was too, so out I flew
Like a stick of rollin' dynamite.

When I hit the ground you could hear the sound
And see the sparks a country mile.
End over end I began to spin
But the ball started runnin' wild.
But it was too late as I met my fate
And the ball started gettin' hot.
But through the sparks and the flame I knew that the claim
Of the Master of Sparks was got."

Stealin' the heart of every guy in town
Includin' the one I own
But this sweet young thing of seventeen
Would sting you with the lovesick blues
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin
Lookin' for someone to use

She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs

Well I heard she got down in Beaumont
And she wound up in El Paso
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail
And she could step to the cotton eyed Joe
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy
Slip in and get her while you can
Cause before too long she'll be good as gone
And runnin' with another man

She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker

And sample a burrito.

Under the oaks I was telling some jokes
And thinkin' I had it made-
Gettin' on with the folks, havin' some Coke
And coolin' off in the shade.

My tempature had risen again,
And it must have been a hundred and ten.

I took a boat that couldn't float
To Rio de Janeiro.
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba
But I'll be gone tomorrow.

We could secretly freak out
If you gimme a shot
And secretly meet tomorrow (secret me
If I tell you what time
Tell me what your name is

Or you can take mine
Its totally shine or totally blind
But one or the other's gonna' work out fine

Lying near a pile of wood.

Playing with it some
When I, I woke up with wood.

I was lying there thinking 'bout basketball
Trying not to lose my mind
My baby came to help and I let out a yell,
She grabbed me from behind.
Laying on it some,
Playing with it some
When I, I woke up with wood.

Beauty queens fall in trances,
Debutantes lose their furs.
But it felt so good from where they stood,
They were working on a pile of wood.
Laying on it some,
Playing with it some

Paint the sky in shades of green
And I’ve seen the daisy’s dress of white
Laying on those mountain peaks

And my heart knows a way back home
When the wind sings that old familiar song

‘Cause I’ve been all around the world
Seen things that no one would believe
Thought I was lookin’ at a picture
In some fancy magazine
And out of everywhere I’ve been
Oh it kills me every time
If I could only find how to be 2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time

I’ve seen the sun spin weeds of gold
On those Oklahoma plains
I’ve seen the moon a million times
On those Santa Rosa waves

And my heart knows a way back home
When the wind sings that old familiar song

‘Cause I’ve been all around the world
Done things that no one would believe
Thought I was livin’ in a movie on that giant silver screen
And out of everywhere I’ve been
Oh it kills me every time
If a man could just divide, I could be 2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time

How can I keep what I got when I don’t know what I’m missin’
Meeting islands when I home
Miss my family when I’m gone
I’m gone, gone, gone

‘Cause I’ve been all around this world
Lived things that no one would believe
Never thought I’d move so many people
They gave this life to me
And out of everywhere I’ve been
Oh it kills me every time
Maybe I’d be satisfied if I could just divide
And be 2 places at 1 time
2 places at 1 time

Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet

Doctor said there’s nothing we can do
Took my hand said take me home
To the only place half a chance to take the pain away
Let me feel alive before I go

You said life is only borrowed
So let’s wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won’t be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets and don’t forget how much I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet

I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don’t ever have to leave
And when I poured you across the southern sky, I couldn’t help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings

Bitter-bittersweet
Bittersweet

The wind whistling across my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won’t forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me
It’s bittersweet"
Zac Brown Band,Castaway,/z/zac+brown+band/castaway_21326707.html,"Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight

I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight

I’m in an island state of mind
Don’t think I’m ever gonna leave
I’d rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight

Castaway
Ride the waves like we’re young
‘Cause time flies by and soon we’ll be older
It’s better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by

Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight"

A cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

And it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
And the ones that give their lives, so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

You talked so sweet, and your smell it made me weak,
And I fell so fast that I never thought to ask
If you were
Cold hearted

An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
I want someone to hurt you, make you die the way I do
I don't think that I could be so
Cold hearted

Pretty little words covered your dark and crooked heart
With a forked tongue I fell in love,
Then I fell apart
You are so
Cold hearted

When the morning comes
And we have done the things we do
We got to bed together
We wake up together alone

But you never do

Say what you will
Slander my good name
Go say anything
But please don't curse me

So the blame is fair
I don't know if it's something we just lost along the way

I see the lights from beneath the ground
I was lost but now it’s found, the ghost wants something
To take their turn, to dance around the stone
Work the fingers to the bone, hold on to nothing

Day for the dead
To dance among the living
Day for the dead
To dance among the living

We find forgiveness, for the wrong we’ve done
Watch to die another day, another setting sun
We find redemption in the love that we’ve won
Just a little company until our work is done

Day for the dead
To dance among the living
Day for the dead
To dance among the living

Who says you can’t go back? Back to where you started from
Who says you can’t go back?
Who says you can’t go back? Back to where you started from

The man who’ll meet you there
Caron’s may on your eyes just to pay his fare

Sunshine trying to creep on through.
Lost sleep but I found a tune,
Stuck inside my head.
Cigarettes and tank of gas,
Headed off to nowhere fast,
Gotta find a way to make this feeling last.

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just kept on chasing that melody.
And as time goes by,
Oh it's funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna say that I,
Was a man who really lived and never compromised.
And when I've lived out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands.
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

A part of dawn to be ashamed of,
Good people are supposed to be up.
But I found peace with the path I took,
As I lay down my head.
Crossroads you gotta choose,
Which way do we win or lose.
Every bone in my soul say I sing on through.

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just keep on singing these melodies.
And as time goes by,
It's funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna say that I,
Was a man who really lived and never compromised.
And when I've lived out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

Woo A Wooo
Woo A Wooo

We all go, we all go
It's all over... 'fore you know

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just keep on singing these melodies.

It's funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

I wanna. Say that I,
Was a man who really loved and never compromised.

Make it stop on a dime
Make you wonder which way to go to
Make a man change his mind.

In a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Cadillacs and caviar, well that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks, she sure don't need those
She's a cool drink of water when the summers mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long.

Tan and lean like a long neck bottle
In the passengers seat got her hand on the throttle
She'll get you there right on time

Make you wanna slap your momma
Gotcha all tore up
Made you spill your dip cup

I can't see anything from mine
Flags on the side of the highway
And scripture on grocery store signs
Maybe eighteen was too early
Maybe thirty or forty is too
Did you get your chance to make peace with the man
Before he sent down his angels for you?

Mamas and grandmamas love you
'Cause that's all they know how to do
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

Your wife said this all would be funny
When you came back home in a week
You'd turn twenty-two and we'd celebrate you
In a bar or a tent by the creek
Your baby would just about be here
Your very last tour would be up
But you won't be back. They're all dressing in black
Drinking sweet tea in styrofoam cups

Mamas and grandmamas love you
American boys hate to lose
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

Now the high school gymnasium's ready
Full of flowers and old legionnaires
Nobody showed up to protest
They just sniffle and stare
But there's red, white, and blue in the rafters
And there's silent old men from the corps
What did they say when they shipped you away
To give all in some God awful war?

Nobody here could forget you
You showed us what we had to lose
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

No, no you never planned on the bombs in the sand

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it

It was an emptiness in her voice

She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off his make-up
All she wanted it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
But like tide her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Now she sees right through me
Should I hold on to what we've got
Is is just a waste of time
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes

I saw goodbye in her eyes

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He's gonna love the way you shine
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you need

I'm sure the pain will go away

Heather, I think we had a strong love
Under the garbage we can't rise above
And I heard a knock
Oh it was you
Since you've been gone you have no idea what I've been through

So don't walk away
Just stay, give me one more day

I'm frozen
My eyes on the ceiling
I can't breathe when I've this feeling
So goodbye, this dance is over.
I'm so sad I won't be the one to hold her

Yeah don't, don't walk away
Just stay. Give me one more day
Just give me one more day
And I heard a knock
Oh, it was you"

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Black dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
Like the king, finds no peace, his work is never done
Night falls, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
Cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

[Chorus 2: Zac Brown]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

Crying out ""Go and wake the king""
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Mad man, blood on the altar, The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble high upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many, he bears that weight alone

Second guessing your decisions

A day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along

So I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, that I'll slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

A day might come you'll realize that if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all

And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, that I'll slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride..."

Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

Every signal is a beacon
And the wind, it carries me
And it eases up my load.
Everyday I drag the turns
Every candle still burns
And every lesson I have learned
Brings us closer to the crowd.

Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

It brings us to the people
And they will be there waiting,
Dancing young and old
And every one of us gets tired,
But every one remains inspired
And every one of us require
To keep picking through our souls

I play the road,
And the highway is our song,
And every city's like the same three chords

When you leave me all these nights
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand?
Kissing me and my mom goodbye with a tear and a smile,
Where do you go,
Daddy where do you go? ""

And it was his thing and I wouldn't understand
And he had done all that he can, okay.

I guess his body was as good as mine
And just like me he was wasting time
Turning over every stone to see what he could find, okay.
He was filling tank and he asked for money
I lied and said I didn't have any
Then my conscious took over and I gave him a hand full of change.

Don't do a thing.
Stay right there.
You'll lie there.
You don't seem to care

I know it's hard to survive in the city
When the beautiful days don't look so pretty
And you don't have windows to keep the night away, okay.
He was dirty and stink and just a bit crude
But I didn't say that because that's kind of rude
And he didn't care what I had to say in the first place, okay.

I wanted to say you're a big disgrace to the world,
Yourself, and the human race
And reach back and pop him one good time in the face, okay.
No it's not okay and I didn't do that
But I gave him a smile and tipped my hat and told him to have a very nice rest
Of the day

Don't do a thing. Don't do a thing.
Stay right there.
You'll lie there. You'll lie there.
You don't seem to care.

Guess he bought some booze with it

And sure that bothers me a little bit but it's his life and I can't tell him
How to live it

As he turned and started to go his way I tried to think of something wise to
Say like...

Don't do a thing.
Stay right here.

And in need of a hand.""

Dirty and hard, with a breast plate made of metal
She drives all day in her rusty Buick
And her feet don't reach the pedals
Got a jar of flies, father's disguise
Where his heart should be
Her mouth is sewn together
She screams with those eyes (Screams with those eyes)

And in need of my hand."" (Yeah he uses his hands)

On the end of your bed

I could read your mind
Just so I could know the things that you were knowing

Will be a gift in time

Those words came down like stones
I admit for so long after
It was hard to feel at home
We would hear the highway’s song
Shifting down in the night
I was grateful that the echoes broke the quiet

And I missed my shot at dying young a long time ago
It’s just a lesson learned in love
It’s not angry it’s not sad
Some time you have to lose something
To know what you have

[Chorus]
I believe, yes I do
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
I believe, yes I do
That everything we lose
Will be a gift in time
But the hardest part is leaving love behind"
Zac Brown Band,Let It Go,/z/zac+brown+band/let+it+go_20772098.html,"Spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey
We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed 'em
And it didn't take too long to find the truth inside that bottle
Cast a-sea so long ago was a message from my father.

You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go

Looking back now on my life I can't say I regret it
And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it
But you only get once chance at life to leave your mark upon it
And when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it

You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go

Like a sweet sunset in Georgia let it go
And like the fear that grabs ahold ya let it go
Let it go
Let it go

You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let 'em go"

Maybe I’m wounded
The pain it is passing
Can you hold back the show for a while?
Beneath the hat that I’m wearing
The storms are all brewing and maybe its time to go on
Structure is quoting and the wood it is cracking and the thoughts are all starting to fall
And it’s more to say than what’s been said and people are climbing the wall

[Chorus]
Let it rain, let it pour
Let these skeletons darken my door
Lay the past in the graveyard with things they can't hold me no more
Breathe in deep, let it out
Wash the bitterness out of your mouth
There's no room left for darkness when you’re filled with the light it comes out

[Verse 2]
The truth hurts the worse, so you might as well face it
So the slate can again be wiped clean
Standing on the shore of tomorrow’s horizon
Let music set you free

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It’s a call to all fighters, to all sinners and thieves
Fill the years with the music that set their hearts free
I smash these stings until my fingers bleed
Lay down all your burdens (to sing back to me)

Thinking that it don't get no better than this

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candlelight
Gonna slow this down and make it last

He's hollow in the middle, from the shape that he's in
He's either filled up with music, or locked in his shell again
And it takes some fine tuning, to make him come around
But he's a huge piece of me, and I'll never put him down

And you get what you give, sometimes it's just noise
But if you treat him well, he will last your life along
If your honest and open, he will write you a song

Never did what daddy taught her
And the rebel in her soul
Brought her to me

She flowed from the mountain
Straight across the great divide
And her heart ran cold
But her love runs deep
She's fire on the mountain
Wrecking everyone she meets

But there's sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be storm clouds in sight
Oh but don't you worry friend
She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands

Lord please know
It's that time for me to go
The river has me heart
She's the keeper of my soul
On one side of the water
Sweet everlasting grace
The other side could end your life
Or steal your breath away

She'll tear the land in two

A river running wild
A hurricane blowing
She's the calm after the storm
Under an Appalachian sunset sky

You're not busy listenin'

That makes my heart sing
Been looking for a melody
That makes the church bells ring
Not looking for the fame
Or the fortune it might bring
In love, in music, in life

Jesus preached the golden rule
Buddha taught it too
Gandhi said eye for an eye
Makes the whole world go blind
With a little understanding
We can break these chains
That we’ve been handed
I’ve got the medication
Love is the remedy

Pray to be stronger and wiser
Know you get what you give
Love one another
Amen (amen), amen

I’ve been thinking about the mark
That I’ll be leaving
Been looking for a truth
I can believe in
I got everything I need
Let this heart be my guide
In love, in music, in life

I’m not saying I’m a wise man
Heaven knows there’s much that I’m still finding
Making my way down this winding road
Holding on to what I love
Yeah, and leaving the rest behind
For love, for music, for life

Pray to be stronger and wiser
Know you get what you give
Love one another

(Love is the remedy)
We’re all in this world together
Life’s a gift that we have to treasure
Happiness, now that is the measure
Love is the remedy
(Love is the remedy)

Everyone can be forgiven
One love and one religion
Open up your heart and listen
Love is the remedy

Pray to be stronger and wiser
And know you get what you give

Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots

Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playing with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots

We'd get 'em singing ""Don't Stop Believing""
Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreaming one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

Flying high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

And roots, always keep me grounded

He wasn't safe to keep around the home
And he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son
And I was in the kitchen making fig preserves
And I heard that youngin get kicked in the face
And I knew that was the day that chicken was going to get what he deserved

Hoped that it would last

Or at least they thought so,
And it was plain to see
That children are cruel
And I didn't have a fighting chance

Why no one would take a poor boy to the dance

Stump and Said ""boy, lemme tell you what;

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too.
And if you care to take a dare well,
I'll make a bet with you. And you play pretty good

If you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you loose the devil gets your soul.

And fire flew from his fingertips as he reisened up his bow.
And he pulled that bow across his strings and it made
An evil hissn then a band of demons joined in and it
Sounded Somethin' like this.

When the devil finished, Johnny said; ""well you're
Pretty good ol' son. Sit down in that chair right there
Lemme show you how it's done""

He played: Fire on the mountain run boys run,
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun.
Chickens in the bread pen pickin' out dough.
Granny, does your dog bite?
No, child, no.

The devil bowed his head now,
'Cause he knew that he'd been beat,
And he laid that golden fiddle down on the ground at Johnny's feet.

Try again, I told you once you son of a bitch,

For a sweet good timing lady
To make you smile the way I always wanted to.

Where the wind blows babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holdin' on for my dear life just like I always did.
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

So I'll fly all night
Our memory's my lullaby
That love won't lie
If it's love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide
If love don't lie
Lie
We can fly

Where the wind blows babe, you can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holdin' on for my dear life just like I always did.
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere, my love will find you anywhere
Anywhere, my love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love"

Na-na, oh, na-na
Oh, na-na-na-na-na

One man's trash is another man's treasure
One stays gone, one of 'em tryna stay home
One man's walls might feel like a prison
Some live dying but I'm dying to live it
Some folks are stayin' out of the woods, and I'm gettin' in 'em

[Verse 1]
Don't judge a book by its cover 'cause people look different
Don't shut 'em down, you never know what you're missin'
Some people find love, some love fightin'
Some lay with the lambs and some roar with the lions

[Pre-Chorus]
What floats your boat might sink mine
And what makes me smile might make you cry
You might get low, I might stay high
To each their own, ain't that right?

One man's trash is another man's treasure
One stays gone, one of 'em tryna stay home (Tryna stay home)
One man's walls might feel like a prison

Some people ballroom dancin', some people twerkin'
Some work on trash like a Kardas-trophe surgeon
Some mountain don't, some mountain do
Some love their monkeys, some have 'em removed

Zac Brown Band,These Days,/z/zac+brown+band/these+days_1680315.html,"The buildings are burning
In American homes
And people are running
From clouds of stone
And houses are churning
With people on the phone
Oh no!

These days to live
These days to love
Many, many people are going to learn
That war is promising
But it leaves before we can learn
There are no days to burn

Oh oh snapper I got the gun clapper
Trying to call my papa cause times are getting fatter
Flying bombs. I pour my heart out to the people
What's one? But nine-one-one, nine-eleven
What's the shock, war crafts crash blew up the whole block
Breaking news, this shit gotta stop
And these times people dying in flocks
Oh my god! The life we live, broken-hearted and shattered in tears

Children run from Gomorrah
Or be turned to salt
Pictures of justice
Hung in empty halls
And you know you got to go
When duty calls
And our children will read their names
In a cold marble wall

War is poverty but then hate is more
They say these days bring pain but there's a art to war
Acts of hate left so many shattered dreams
9/11 shocked the world with a terrible scene
Breakin' News Channel 5 I can't believe my eyes
Disaster strikes and it came outta the skies
They say envy lead to terror, and terror went too far
And to the people who passed, we remember who you are
And these days ...

These days to love
These days to love
Many, many people are going to learn
That war is promising
But it leaves before we can learn
There are no days to burn

I've see fire, and I've seen rain
I've seen them sunny days I thought would never end
And I've seen whole a lot of things I could not comprehend
But I always thought I'd see you again!

I seen what I feel
I feel what is real
I believe in the Lord
As I reach for light
I howl in the moonlight
Sometimes I feel like I am surrounded by bad men
Better yet an al qaeda fighter, suicider, do-or-die-er
Open fire for the higher power in the hour of destruction
These chapters are wrote
In a 747 the story is told
A father holds a daughter who will never be grown
Never move on, say so long to the prom
A poor man sits with his wife in his arm
Thinking if he had the chance, ""I'd buy whatever she wants!""
And a daughter looks at her father, ""When are we going home?""
Who knows where the mind goes when fuel is running low?
I suppose they look from the window and scream
When they see the sunbeams gleam from the wings of a bad dream

These days to love
These days to love
Many, many people are going to learn
That war is promising
But it leaves before we can learn
There are no days to burn

There are no days to burn
No days to burn
No days to burn"
Zac Brown Band,This Song's For You,/z/zac+brown+band/this+songs+for+you_21051018.html,"If you got up this morning
And you went to work today, this song's for you
And if you put eight honest hours in
For eight hours worth of pay, this song's for you

And if it's taking all you got these days
Just to make ends meet
You'd like to give a piece of your mind
To those fat cats on Wall Street, this song's for you

If you go to church on Sunday
And you try to do what's right, this song's for you
If you've been known to drink a beer
And raise hell on a Friday night, this song's for you

If you wish we didn't have to go
And send our boys to war
But you still think this country of ours
Is sure worth dying for

This song's for you, you know who you are
We're up on this stage but you're the star
You're why we do what we do
We want you to know, this song's for you

Now if you love country music
As real as it comes, this song's for you
And if you came here tonight
Hoping you might hear you some, this song's for you

If you paid your hard earned money
To that bouncer at the door
To hear the kind of songs
That you don't get to hear much anymore

This song's for you, you know who you are
We're up on this stage but you're the star
You're why we do what we do
We want you to know, this song's for you

You might've lost a friend, a job
Or someone broke your heart
But just like you might need it to
The healing's in the tune

This song's for you, you know who you are
We're up on this stage but you're the star
You're why we do what we do
We want you to know, this song's for you

You deserve so much more, it's true
We want you to know, this song's for you"

Life is good today. Life is good today.
Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther.
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today.

Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night as the summer drew to an
End
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar and I don't know if it's her or
The rum

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today.

Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from LA
Yeah, I swear the muchachas they call me ""big poppa"" when I throw
Pesos their way
Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from LA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jager
I'll grab my guitar and play

Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay

I'm just gunna prop up by the lake
I've got my ass in a lawn chair
Toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today. Life is good today."

Searching for answers that I'll never find
Losing my breath as I fall
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
Learning to fly, letting go of it all

Take it all in as the world passes by
Getting lost in the twists and the turn
Finding these questions inside me still burn
Finding these questions inside me still burn

Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes

Trying to hold on in this race against time
I can't say where the next bend might be
That is the beauty in life's mystery
That is the beauty in life's mystery

And I'm trying to pull through
Do you know what it's like to have a valentine
That doesn't have you?
And I'll try, I'll try to keep my chin up high
There's just something about the color of your blue eyes
And I'll lie to my pride to keep my chin up high
Morning blue says I'm your fool
And it's killing me
Cutting me through
Mr. Darkness it's been awhile since I've seen you
You just come around right when my hurting seems through
Everyone gets someone and darkness I got you

There's just something about the color of your blue eyes
And I'll lie to my pride to keep my chin up high
Morning blue says I'm your fool
And it's killing me
Cutting me through
Ate a whole bag of candy hearts I had for you
I took in the colors, I remained blue
None of the damn little words on 'em would be true
Do you know what it's like to have a Valentine
That doesn't have you?
And I'll try, I'll try to keep my chin up high

He will miss the quiet pride
Of his men at his side as he leads them into victory

The drinks they're cold and the reggae is hot

Put me down
Down on the sand where it's cool
Put me down
When I fall off my stool
Put me down
I'll just sleep there til morning comes around

With sunshine and ladies and pina coladas
And Bob Marley songs that are playing
There's a song in my ear that I want you to hear
Soft tropical lips that are saying

Get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean

Maybe the storm will cover my dreams
Maybe the sun will shine no more

Who knows, which way the wind is blowing
And that we will look back on these things
And we won't cry no more
Whoa Who Knows

Wandering blindly, searching for the truth
And anchored to a solid rock, that we could hold onto
But there's no tomorrow, not for everyone
Who will hear your last harsh words when your time on earth is done

That sun goes down
Forty days, forty nights
Who knows, what the thunder and lightning will bring
Maybe the storm will cover my dreams
Maybe the sun will shine no more

Who knows, which way the wind is blowing
And that we will look back on these things
And we won't cry no more
Hold your lamp down, don't let the wind blow it out
Hold that light child and one day it's gonna shine

And fogging up the windows

And always together
When I look back I just smile

I lay there silent in the sand
And listen while you whisper
To another lonely setting sun
Whose heart is always distant
Memories won’t be the death of me

The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease

Do you know how much I’ve missed you since I’ve been away
Bringin' all my love from Georgia, and I'm gonna lay
Under endless skies of emerald light, we can drift away

I sit back and I close my eyes
Lookin back at all the lows and all the highs
Through the black and white and in between
All the miles ive walked
The wars ive fought
And all ive seen

It all seems like yesterday
Like a bird, time does fly
No sooner than you said hello
Its time, it's time, it's time to say goodbye

Consumed by worry, stress and fear,
Never leanring to live
Weighed down by wondering why we're here
Collected memories
All that's in the end
I guess a sense of peace wasn't meant for some, my friend

It all seems like yesterday
Like a bird, time does fly
No sooner than you said hello
Its time, it's time, it's time to say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

It all seems like yesterday
Like a bird, time does fly
No sooner than you said hello
Its time, it's time, it's time to say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"

He needs another carnal fix
To take him higher and higher

Repent ye wretched sinner
Self righteous clown

A psycho star dream
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem

You're preaching revolution
Don't you mean genocide?
Behind this resolution

Waiting to die for the every first time
All right, that's right
Waiting to die for the every first time
I don't give a damn, cause I think it's my time, my time

Of murder and lies

Confirms your self illusion
And after all this could be you

Roller coaster of the madness and there's only me to blame
The ever faithful hand of doom will take the pain away
I'll never know the answer to it all 'til my dying day

Can't stop the deathwatch ticking

Subverts your every hour

Even though I kick it with a lot of - females
I can honestly tell you that I ain't gotta - female
But since I'm fresh out of jail you probably thank that I just wanna bone
Hit it, quit it, then delete your # from my mobile phone
Can't you see the tattoo reads one deep
So I need only one lil' momma, one cup of codeine and one Swisher sweet
Weight of the world is on my shoulders because I'm thuggin
But sometimes even the hardest of us need some lovin
And the first time with you is like my first time again
Like rediscoverin rap music, writin my first rhyme again
You say you feel like you're floatin, well I'm floatin too
Everybody's leavin, now you know it's time for you and Z-Ro to do

Z-Ro,3 Way Relationship,/z/z+ro/3+way+relationship_21281657.html,"Say 'cause like this here, I'ma stay strapped nigga
I'ma keep me bitch nigga, ya understand me believe that
She loves a nigga, real talk nigga
Make way for a motherfucking gangsta, loc'd up G'd up
At all motherfucking times homeboy, real talk
Get it how you live jack, (it's a Big E beat)

I got a gangsta chick, and a classy lady
I can't decide which one I wanna be with, it's driving me crazy
The one that's good, want me out of the hood
But the other one be bugging, giving me reasons to keep on thugging
One of my women got big ass breast-s, and wide hips
The other one is a forty, with a thirty round clip
She the reason I'm still breathing, y'all know what it is
Yeah I love her, but she can't give me kids
And she can't run my bath water for me, or roll me a cigarillo
Ain't no sex either, she just gon' lay under the pillow
But it's still a threesome, cause my other lil' mama be in the bed too
Doing everythang, sexy black gon' do
But black ain't able, to catch an attitude with me
Over nonsense, baby argue and act a fool with me
I need to make a decision, but when
'Cause all I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend

(You know I'm down with you, through all the up's and downs with you
I feel like, we can make this work)
I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose
Either way I win, but I still lose hey
(baby you know I ride for you, whenever you want me to
I'm the one that makes sure, you don't get hurt)
I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose
Walking in a regular man's, or a gangsta's shoes hey

She can't do it to you like this, she can't give it to you like that
She can't even let you, hit it from the back
I'm the reason you can breath easy, I'm the reason everybody fear you
The bitch that won't let trouble come near you
I'm the one you can lean on, when times get hard
The one that's trying to bring you closer to God
Yeah but when it get gangsta, all she gon' do is run and hide
I'ma hold you down baby, just think of me while tomorrow die

Stuck between affection, and protection
My woman and my weapon, this situation's got me stressing
Yeah I'm a Hoover gangsta Crip, but I'm a man first
Even still I find myself fingering sexy black, until my hand hurts
Dumping on my enemies, to save my life
With intentions, on getting laid tonight
So I guess in the end, all I need in this life of sin
Is me, and both of my girlfriends

Sexy black listen, if the police get you and me then I'll end up in prison
Five years minimum, what they giving
That's the reason why I chuck you out the window, when they pull up on my rear
Come back and scoop you later, when the coast is clear
And baby girl, you already know how I feel about you
Can't picture myself, living without you
But in this bidness I'm in, it's do or die that's why
I keep my gangsta bitch at my side, when I ride is you feeling me
Would you rather picture someone killing me
Three shots to the dome, have you wondering why I ain't came home
For me sexy black is necessary, like commissary when I'm in jail
Cause murderers and jackers, be giving me hell
So fuck it, let's have a menizzle twizzle
One of y'all on my left one of y'all on my right, and me in the middle
Something beautiful is about to begin, cause all I need in this life of sin
Is me, and both of my girlfriends

(You know I'm down with you, through all the up's and downs with you
I feel like, we can make this work)
I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose
Either way I win, but I still lose hey
(Baby you know I ride for you, whenever you want me to
I'm the one that makes sure, you don't get hurt)
I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose
Walking in a regular man's, or a gangsta's shoes hey
Me and both of my girlfriends"

I ain't having none of that riff-raff, so act like you know that I ain't friendly
Treat everybody I come across, like they wanna put something in me
Like some lead, or if I'm moving weight they might set me up with the FEDs
But to a boy done shed, I'm one deep trying to get bread
And I'm one deep when I bust heads, cause I'm not gonna tell on me
When a snitch be rolling with you, you headed to felony
I ain't ready to do 85 percent, of nobody's time
So I keep's it gangsta when I'm boss hogging, and solo when I grind
A-R 1-5, AK-56 plus one
It's multiple homicide, if I happen to touch one
You niggaz gon learn, or you niggaz are gon burn
It get hotter than lava, when it come down to the dolla
And I gotta have it, by any means necessary
Guaranteed to see a million, before the cemetery
So I keep on watching, and my 4-4 keep on cocking
If my folks keep on droppin, B-O double P-E-R's keep on boppin I ain't stoppin

We ain't, having none of that bullshit

In my life I keep it gangsta, all day
In my life, I could peep a wanksta a mile away
In my life, I trust me and nobody else
That's why I walk around with a nine, tucked in my belt
Don't let the small size fool you, try to play me for weak
Cause I pull this four pound bar, and blaze at your beat
You got niggaz I got niggaz, but my niggaz the best
See my niggaz all my niggaz, is guerillas with techs
Lil Head the 4""3' giant, respect my name
In order to live a longer life, you gotta respect the game
Now listen mayn, I'm trying to tell you some' for your own good
See I'm the type of nigga, have you bailing out your own hood
I'm a General a Sergeant, no need to start this
Rumble in the field with a lion, cause I'm raw bitch
I'm raw regardless, whether it's four to one
Cause the pop from the glock, I know it's gonna go through one

I'm not your kin folk, so I suggest you get out of dodge
1-25 road raging, ready to get out and squab
Too many problems in my life, I just can't handle the stress
Niggaz be trying to kill me, damn near dismantling my vest
But I can take it, cause I dish it out, you got your gun
I got my gun and I'm busting, before you get a chance to whoop it out
A soldier, folding up a motherfucker what he need for me
Either with a gun or with a fist, anyway it go I'm still gon fold him
What you thought I was, a fraud a hoe a punk
Don't make me make you say oh Lord, shut the fuck up
I handle my bidness, and then I move around in the night
So much codeine, it feel like I got a pound of the Sprite
So keep my temper calm, collective and cool
Cause I might ignite and go off, and leave nothing but your shoes

Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer
Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer
See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return
Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn
Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark
Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks
Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence
But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent
I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me
But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me
I represented for the both of us, how could you love me
And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus
Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead
Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head

This is where they all fall down
Putting burners to they brain, till it bang
There's no way for the real, to maintain
This is where they all fall down
Pay your dues, cause you owe
When it's your time, God'll give you the go

Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life
All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail
Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail
Cut your tail, while you fall down homie
Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me
Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on
I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on
Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block
Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops
Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone
95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong
Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife
Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life
Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain
Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain

[Chorus - 2x]

I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of
Robbery
Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain
Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life
If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life
My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong
And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone
See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block
My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block
I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live
Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive
Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round
But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down
Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now
I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now
So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep
The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot

Taking trips overseas, France, England, and my way
I'm the Don Datta, but you can't be my baby mama
Let me save you the drama, roll on like a Yokohama
We can, go half on the room, and half on a sack
And while you breaking the buzz down, I'ma be hitting it from the back
Bend over baby, I got something to show you baby
Turn around on your back toes up on the shoulders baby
Steady deep stroking don't mind me, just keep smoking
Bust a lot to break the serve and the soda water open
But you ain't my may thang, just a little something to the side
So don't talk when I'm talking on the phone, you keep quiet
Just open your mouth wide and let me put it inside
Smoke a sweet and to finish my cup and then it's time to slide
Don't worry about nothing cause it's confidential
Open up your runway for my? Con? To dent you

All night long, all night
We be smoked all night
All night long, all night
As we flip and sip pink sprite

Put a six in a Cris we gone sip on that
It's harder than a roll of quarters put your hips on that
Removing your thong, penetrate the pick and it's on
Still sipping and smoking stroking steady making you moan
I'm number 0 City Don, got a cottage by the barn
Automatic gauges vicious dogs roaming the lawn
You got to worry about nothing except for keeping me happy
And if it's with you than a bitch steady tapping and nappy

[Dp]
Steady tapping and nappy, getting the headboards clapping
Hell shot, pussy with your man asking what happened
And no excuses out your mouth cause you've been riding with me
Arrange my soldiers, T-H-you-G
See you can tell from the smile and the way that you strip
Something ain't right, though nigga been all up in the guts
Better soak on some alcohol, and leave me alone
Bitch ask for the cash I get it

(Chorus - 2x)

I need a thug bitch, a shop lift and sell drug bitch
But don't be tripping when I'm pimping in the club bitch
We can hit the telly and get under the sheets
Knocking you down till I move around back on the streets
And keep rolling, got to keep my benjamins folding
Then I'm coming back to beat it up until it's swollen
Baby it's non stopping fix a nigga a plate
So don't worry I be coming to your house real late
Meanwhile I'm a soldier in the battlefield
I'm on a mission trying to get it, I'ma make a mill
With or without you, but if you down
Then we can do it together, drank rubbers and automatic rounds
But don't be tripping when I say I need space
I ain't cheating but it's some reason it's a knee case
I'm a block bleeder, you got to share me with the drugs and shit
But when I'm fucking you it's beautiful I love the shit

And all that's going through my mind
Is he dead or alive, when I'm pacing the flo'
And looking around 4-5
Thinking of the worst, but nobody would tell me the drama
But the silence is killing me, checking on his family
Saying a prayer for him and his mama
Come through sit at his bedside, and ease his pain
Relieve my tension, I'm flinching when they mention name
Big D, come G, I don't want you to die
Remember when we use to dip
In your day-day Coupe and get high
Remember, when you use to think I was crazy and wouldn't chill with me
You come to get me up the flip, and smoke some kill with me
I really appreciate the love that was shown
I'ma keep the faith and never leave you alone
You can depend on me, got down on my knees
And I prayed, until you recovered
Then jumped your big ass, right back off in the game
Because there's money to be made, and I won't knock you
Just watch yourself when you in them streets
And keep your heater, under your seat when you creep

[Hook - 4x]
And to my G's
Don't worry bout a damn thang

You use to call me G. I., but to me you was s soldier indeed
Even though you dodged the cops daily, you would hit my crib up with weed
Freestyling to beats, and smoking on fire sweet and parlay
You should of got a purple heart, for living in a war everyday
If he's really a friend, you would turn him in
That's what the laws would tell us
And fellas would talk about turning you in
How could your hood be so jealous
And ready to give out the location, of a G on the move
Somebody tell me, is your partna's freedom worth some money to you
But I know he's in the county jail stressed, fuck stabbing you in your back
Cause they smile up in your face, and stab you in your chest
And its kinda hard, to receive the swishas they pass me
When I feel I got to watch the people, they call his still family
Must a song be coming, cause it happened the way you said it would unfold
My name is Grady, and they watch me like the Super Bowl
Now that your not around, I'ma still put it down the way you told me to do
And when I go gold its dedicated to you, and to my G's

[Hook - 4x]

I'm still trying to figure out what happened
One minute you here, then the next you was gone
Just think quick, I lost my nigga
Victimized to the game, and we still mourn
But nigga hold on, cause I know its living life
Trapped in this cell, trying to ease the pain
But it still remains, every time I put you in jail
And its hard to accept the fact, that you a cellmate my nigga
Po' out some liquor, and sho' wish was here to light, up this swisha
And I'll never forget the advice you gave me bout life, cause you were right
Don't shake them dikes, cause the rules apply, ain't always precise
I'm paying a price, my freedom been taken away
And they threw away the key, trapped in misery
Cause suffering forced me to run these streets so desperately
And to my G's watch your back, cause it ain't no love in these streets
It seems like each day, there's a different way, to fall victim to defeat
Cause if you real with your boy, it don't hurt to see him fall off
When a forty get low point to the curb, just letting you know you thought of
No matter what when you get out, thangs'll still be the same
But until then hold on nigga, and don't worry bout a damn thang

aight you rollin?
I'd just like to take a minute to apolgize to my listeners
I just wanna say I'm sorry for not havin any songs about happiness
or bein in peace and shit like that
see I can only display my personal feelings and experinces
and so far I ain't felt what happiness feels like
and experinced anything but hard times and heartache
so I apoligize for not makin you dance
I apologize for not havin any sarcastical songs
you know that good feeling with e'm
that put a smile on your face
I ain't had nothin to offer accept for frown
so for that I'm sorry I promise if I can sing another song

I wish I could tell you my life was good but it's not
I wish misery, city runners were cold, but they're hot
so many situations to deal with, I can't concentrate
a hundred homies and everyone is fake
how can I make it out the ghetto it want let me go
seems like everytime I do a good deed, good deeds never return to 'Ro
I gave up my last so somebody could have a start
then somebody got me locked behind bars
what a way to show ya love back-homie you a friend for life
for your crime I'm doin time in the Penn tonight
it's bad enough I lost a family my luck ain't live
mama died when I was 6 and Daddy ain't have enough time
to kick it with me-like I wanted him to kick it with me
now that I'm incarcarated you wanna come and visit with me
but I ain't holdin no grudges Daddy I love you that's my word

but maybe Z-Ro living lavish just ain't meant to be
cause I'm the type of fella that'll give a bum a hundred dollars
I'd rather help out my people instead of poppin my collar
I wish that I could get a million copies sold
if I'm broke I'd rather die I don't want no more poverty-'Ro and oh
sometimes I wish that I was somebody else
cause I can't even pay bills even though my CD's want stay on the shelf
strugglin and I'm strivin and just barely strivin
bobbin and weavin-my last breathe time after time
and it seems that I want ever get no rest I'm exhausted
tryna make it-compare the price and pain is what the cost is
maybe if I was evil I'd be rolling in bread
until somebody with a pistol come and opened my head
but my mission is keepin ambition
I'm trying so hard even though my soul is scarred-oh Lord...
I wish I had another song

I wish that I could sing another song
but my rhythm is too much pain
sunshine is the level that I think I'm own so tell me why it's so much rain
day to day it's a struggle in my lifetime
to keep from creepin I be stayin in the G
no crimes commited so tell me why I'm doin time
and want nobody come and sit with me for free
sometimes at night I smoke a cig and sit back
and wonder why the whole world hate me
so much ambition I just gotta pull my wig back
wishing murder would come on and take me
I wish that I could sing another song
I'm tired of sleeping in rivers of tears all night long
no point in wonderin why my people use to do me wrong
stuck in this reality until my life is over and gone

Got a nigga, fiending for his last breath
Too many of my partnas beneath me, because a bitch made nigga blasted
Too many features in songs, tell me why I ain't got no home
Penitentiary grown, cause I roam with a pocket full of stones
I wanna live my life, but my life ain't worth the living
Cause while I'm dreaming about a Benz, even a houpe ain't driven
Headed for prison, but mama I'm alright with that
Strapped down with a shank in my tank, hit niggaz all night with that
And it ain't no love left, fuck all of my foes and friends
Motherfuckers don't fuck with Ro, unless that nigga be rolling in ends
I need to wake up, instead of day dreaming about holding a slab
Like being in love with a woman, that you could never have
Witness the feeling punished by pain, looking for shelter from the rain
People like W double O-D, I'm going against the grain
Hey to my niggaz in Ridgemont 4, y'all can kiss my ass
Anybody who ever said they was down with me, can kiss my ass
I done dumped on motherfuckers, what they gon do for me
Out of town on stage, nobody from the hood in the crowd to root for me
Suppose to be my people, but I think my people is the devil
Fuck my peers, cause I'm on another level
On my knees, screaming Jesus can you save me
My shit's so fucked up, I wonder if you thought about me lately
And it hurt so deep a nigga can't sleep, making me late night creep
Suicidal thoughts I think I'm ready, plus it's fucking with me
Would I be missed by these bitch niggaz, these fakes and frauds
Fiending for baby, cause she know she got my heart
Even though it's torn apart, it's pumping out nothing but love for you
And to my niggaz keep your disses, I got slugs for you
I she'd blood for you, but I'm not appreciated
The only nigga, that never hesitated
And it ain't more, hollering out my roll dog's name on tape
Unless it's fuck you, and in front of it followed up by a K
No more, hollering out my roll dog's name on tape
Unless it's fuck you, and in front of it followed up by a K bitch

Million dollar hook nigga, come see me
On a muddy cup, man hol' up
And if your bitch choose, then you shit out of luck
I'ma send her ass home, broke and well fucked
And she kinda walk funny, cause the bitch was well stuck
When I ain't have shit, y'all boys talk down
Like you didn't know T, everytime I came around
Now when you hear me, I'ma put you on stall
And don't say nothing, when you see me in the mall

Overseas facing death everyday, missing they family
Knowing that everybody that's going, ain't coming back
My roll dog, took his last stand in Iraq
Watching his mama collapse, cause she can't take the news
And it's sad to say, but a lot of mothers gon walk in Mrs. Johnson's shoes
So my condolences, goes out to the grieving
Lord give me the strength, so I can make it through this evening
What is this world coming to, locking up brothers is a sport
Beat us till we bleed because we breathe, still we lose in court
Mad at me because I'm black, take it up with my maker
You can't question creativity of the life, giver and taker
I guess, you gon have to deal with me
Why you wondering if I wanna rob you, why not find a way to come and chill with me
I ain't nothing but people, I'm just like you
Nothing greater or nothing less, I'm just like you

Sunday morning ain't no youngsters in the church house, we running the streets acting a fool
Need to get some Jesus, in our life
That's the main reason, why we be dealing with so much shife
Straight up kicking it with the devil, and we don't even know it
Crooked cops hate our guts, and everytime they get a chance they gon show it
My life is a battlefield, cause I strive to survive
Daily busting, trying to lay me in my grave before my time
I can take it, cause I dish it out
I love my people but I'm paranoid, walk up on me my pistol I'ma whip it out
Can't trust nobody, from my friends to my kins
If I can get up and go get mine, you can get up and get your ends
It ain't hard, just man plot and strategize
If you focused on your goal, you just might reach it 'fore you die
So I'm focusing just like you, cause I'm just like you
Nothing greater or nothing less, I'm just like you

Better watch your partna's partnas, and some of they partnas mayn

[Lyrical 187]
I got a letter from the President yesterday, guess what he had to say
It seem like somebody, been talking a lot
Trying to pull the big guns out put em in they mouth, show em that we don't play boy
Round here we bleed the block syrup and pop rocks, hoes in the club jump around and bunny hop
Presidential boys 187 it don't stop, we can turn the lights out turn this bitch out
I'm what you mo'fuckers been waiting for, like the messiah coming back for more
But this time I got the tools with, and my starters off the bench
And you know, we plan to run the score
Fuck y'all niggaz that hate my niggaz, you can get the dick and the nuts and the trigga
Say it again, you can get a dick and a nuts and the trigga and a shank to the liver
Dirty Southside Houston Texas, Hiram-Clarke and Ivas baby
Via 3rd Ward, 5th Ward, South Park, Trinity Gardens, Greenspoint and Poke Island
Look at all these playas around me, thug niggaz hustlers ballers and G's
My niggaz in the hood with wood grain, stable Cadillacs make you fall to your knees
My bitches in the club with love for young thugs, that love for young girls
That be fucking em in the club, will make twenties take em and make em aware
Introduce em, to the best of both worlds
Ain't nothing wrong with going home with, two or three lil' mamas at three in the morning
Waking up cooking eggs and yawning, dipping in the stash spots and do-do calling

[Chorus: Tonka] [2x]
Better watch your feddy mayn, better watch your back mayn
Better wear your vest to protect your chest, so protect your brain mayn
Better watch your slab mayn, better watch your gal mayn
Better watch your partna's partnas, and some of they partnas mayn

Slow motion is how we tip, when we feeling the groove
Bust bout nine nuts last night, and still in the mood
Young ignant dude, never hesitating to make more than I already got
Don't trip you already shot, might stand on the cutters when I flip in the drop
No probation'll ever stop me, cause by God I'm blessed
Got mo' jacksons than Pesci, mo' grass than the Fertile Crescent
Stay on note, and stay receiving mo' Wayans than Keenan
The lyrical semen, born in the morning die in the evening
Already colder than colder, still a damn thang holder
Might uh come and clear out your block, like a wet up Iraqi soldier
Jay freed it and ery'thang, bling-bling on e'ry ring
Piece and chain hang down, to my god damn shoe strings
I'm with that Lyrical 1-8-siete, and the awesome vete
Deuce shooter cocking a nueve, and myself alvete
I'm el soldado, no problem when I pop collars all about dollars
Mo' violence in Impalas we be top notch scholars, leaning with rotweilers breeded ballers
I think I'm losing my mind sometimes, laws hating rent pass due
And I can't find no pine, right now I don't mind dying
So I'm the worst cat to be around, get to tripping my hands twitching
Everytime I see a gun, [see a gun]
So ya better watch your feddy mayn, better watch your back mayn
Better be on note, cause these young folks is always strapped mayn
Better watch your feddy mayn, better watch your back mayn
Better be on note, cause these young folks pack K's in Lacs mayn

[Chorus: Tonka] [2x]
Better watch your feddy mayn, better watch your back mayn
Better wear your vest to protect your chest, so protect your brain mayn
Better watch your slab mayn, better watch your gal mayn
Better watch your partna's partnas, and some of they partnas mayn

[Lyrical 187]
Strapped and ready for drama, lil' mama think she got a fool for the dollar
I tell her bitch please, scream I could make you holla
If I pull up a semicon, and toss up a bottle of gin
Straight out the bar, and invite a few friends
Niggaz that don't mind dying, niggaz don't bar
Taking your life away, drinking the night away
Put the weed down, give the laws the right-away
Fuck you bitch niggaz, did I say it the right way
Just might see me, rolling down the highway
Real country niggaz, might call it a by-way
Sitting sideways, in a big-big body
Rolling solo, but I got my shotty
I don't really, wanna hurt nobody
I'm lying, if it goes down I'm killing everybody
Then back to the H-Town, rolling up blunts
Puffing on the highway, bang in the trunk
Blazing the skunk, drank in the cup
Southside niggaz, on purple stuff
I already know, you done heard enough
1-8-7, quick to call your bluff
Them Presidential boys, banging it rough
Y'all know, y'all can't fuck with us
Like banging a neon, into a bus
You ain't know, that's fucked up
You better make sure, your vest strapped up
You better make sure, that safety work
You better make sure, when the laws come
You don't know that was, that put your nuts in the dirt
In the meanwhile, keep your head down
When I come around, keep your mouth closed till I'm gone
Better yet, move around bitch niggaz
Cause I'm tried of talking bout y'all, in this song

[Chorus: Tonka] [2x]
Better watch your feddy mayn, better watch your back mayn
Better wear your vest to protect your chest, so protect your brain mayn
Better watch your slab mayn, better watch your gal mayn
Better watch your partna's partnas, and some of they partnas mayn"
Z-Ro,Blessing In Disguise,/z/z+ro/blessing+in+disguise_21282161.html,"I live just enough for the city so I get by
Money never changed how I felt, would I risk my
Life for a dollar, homie? Nah, I don't think so
Greed breeds jealousy, nigga, out here when getting fo's
Catch a nigga slipping, put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk, call it what I'm living like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothing but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop running
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunning
Down the innocent, and then the beginning ends
You was doing 50 in the 35, the ending is
You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'
Damn, a blessin in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last key
Could it be that maybe God is intervenes
With my life like he did so many times in between
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowing Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now it was back then, nothing stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yelling
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas getting caught go and tell it

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's why the fuck we roll, I need that

Can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sitting in the parking lot talking about getting money

Cracks in the wall, standing in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on, my nigga, as they walking back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's something for his mother
It never is enough, trying to show her that I love him
We were fishing buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas getting robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bending corners
Always keep in mind, you fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the ages
When you parking all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals dripping on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross, big boys
Big boys, Scarface, Rozay, we big boys

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's why the fuck we roll, I need that

I need that, I need that, I need that bad"

I'm talking to the niggas that gon survive
The motherfucking nine, nickels and dimes
Stracks, fifty pack, feel that, nigga get your paper

[Den Den]
Got me pissed off frustrated, you know you outta line
Plus I'm trying to count you getting high, off this Alabama tie
Falling short of my plans, so my anger is rising
Let me take out I-10, while my pressure is climbing
I can't mind on drank, so I'm in another mode
Moving way too fast, down this one way road
Let me catch my snap, before I roll another crap
And regret what I done, I been really shaft
Its a fact that my block, be hotter than the sun
You can sco' anything there, from drank to marijuana
And the corner, is for the stronger heart
Separate the men from the boys, and the weak from the smart
And apart, from all these hoe ass laws
Its a 24 no tolerance, for those that crawl
Through my block, you might get your busted
Dick in the dust, for fucking with us on my block

[Chorus:]
Block bleeder, surviving in the game
I wanna live righteous, but I need to stack change
I know I'm going through it, but I gotta maintain
Block bleeder, surviving in the game
My block is on fire, and I'm addicted to the flame
Stain after stain, know what I'm talking mayn

[Z-Ro]
Judge me not, on what you see, nigga
Don't you realize, this life of mine is killing me
Straight from a Christian, to a heartless killa
Innocent child raised by the guerillas
Military minded, plus I'm starving for scrilla
Affiliated with killas, that shermed out and tooted
But we don't know no better, paper's got our mind polluted
I repent for my sins, cause I know my number's coming up
I'm paranoid my nigga, don't be running up
Whether friends or foe, I really don't know
That's why I'm warning you Ro, you need to just
Back up a ski taste, or I'll be tagging your toe
Since these punk ass individuals, drag my name through the mud
I ain't got nothing to say to niggas, unless they after the bud
Pumping pack after pack, barley missing a platinum plack
Hpd be on a nigga with no slack, I want executive money
The cea, Chief Executive Artist, instead of 36 ounces
Pistol grip and a cartridge, a block bleeder

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
The block is hot as a clinic, but its profession to me
And like Juve I'm posted up, so I can watch for the sweet
I've been less fortunate, and had to hustle all my life
Listening to people say, its gon be alright all my life
I even got a lady that's been faithful, all my life
She's still my gavel, cause I can't afford to call her my wife
I should be thankful that Dennison Dre, done gave me some help
But I'm depending on grown men, and I'm a grown man myself
Feeling lesser than nothing, and barely fucking with zones
Its like an obstacle course of dynamite, under every corner
I bob and weave through the hard time, my life is pain
From struggle where niggas fired, the reason that I record mine
Infrared, nigga you better protect your head
On my block when we kill eachother, no tears get shed
You take a front from a nigga, you better be quick to pay up
Bring his feddy back on time, or he'll be quick to spray ya
Twenty Fo' seven packing a Mac 11, on my turf
Running away from the police, chunking evidence like a Nurf
I'd rather sell my own records, Chief Executive Artist
Instead of 36 ounces pistol grip and a cartridge, a block bleeder

Everytime I was in jail and the judge didn't let me make bail
The prosecutor gave me my time and laughed in my face
Cuz he knows I'm goin from first to last place

So I'm making out another commissary list
Stamped envelopes, and soups, oatmeal, and tuna fish
Soda, candy, kool offs, coffee as close to codine as I can get it
Hoping this weekend I get another visit

But I aint stressin, I'm just countin down weeks
Poppin muscle relaxers so I'm always sleep
The warden wants the co's to catch me slippin
But they aint trippin, so they bringin me burgers and barbeque chicken

Some of them love me, some of them they can't stand me
Probably cuz I'm rich and in the world I ride kandy
They think they put me through hell, But I can't tell
It don't matter what they do as long as they bring my mail

[Chorus:]
Bring my maaaaaaaaillllll
Bring my mail
My mail (my mail)
You can bring my maaaaaaillllll
Bring my mail (my mail, my mail, my mail...)

Aint nothing on the tv but jerry springer, And a s*** guard in the picket
But the windows are tinted so you can't barely see her
I really hope they call reck in a sec
Otherwise workout a little bit and try to get a channel check

Certain officers try to give me a hard time
And the G. I. 's watching trying to catch me throwing up gang signs
For no reason at all they constantly harass me
Trying to get me to lose my temper so they can gas me

It's funny, cuz I got so much pride they can't take none of it from me
They just mad cuz they aint makin enough money
And still gotta work on holidays all day and night
Taking is out on me cuz I'm in all white

But it's alright I just lay back
When I get out I love to see their faces when I peel out in my may back
Meanwhile I can't even tell I'm in jail
Cuz I'm doing swell
Yall can kiss my ass on the way to bring my mail

[Chorus:]

I'm usually out eating for the holidays, But instead
I'll be sharing meat packs and noodles with my cellys and we spread
The tattoo guns runnin, And homies getting hit up
Drinking hooch till we fall off and it's hard to get up

But there's always one that wanna ruin it
You know the one that's always pointing fingers, He the one that be doin it
Running off at the mouth but aint man enough to repeat it to the rank
So they taking both the tv's out the tank

No necessities either but we can wash our own clothes
But somebody gonna get shit if we don't get to watch the superbowl
I don't even look at television in the world
So I'm good, I'll write a rap or write a couple of girls

Or read me a book and put some fat on my brain
Before I come back to prison they have to murder me mayne
My in and out the jail house has to stop
But in the meantime I need to see how many new pictures I got
Bring my mail

Big ass momentary kush, and a codeine cup with no ice
Flow nice with the pen and pad, and dangerous with that op top
I'm also known to paint stains, that bang and make your house rock
Make a mouth drop, whenever I'm seen bending a corner
Put my shit in park and hop out, and just might take someone to the corner
What's cracking that six cracking, that's what that do
My body got tattoos, mainly cause my track blue
Get a millnuver or ruger, from a Hoover as he maneuvers
I run to ya as I do ya, your boxing game is straight manure
Been the King of the Ghetto, since 1999
I remain groove in my kingdom, with my nine right by my side
I lay and wreck, your motherfucking chest at
Get ready for this right here, I'm about to leave you breathless bang

They say my attitude is grass, but that shit just make me laugh
Now shut up before I pull out my piece, and plug you in your calve
And if you ain't by yourself, I'll wipe out your whole staff
And even a nickname for me, I'm still gon have the last laugh
So fuck with me if you want, I'ma put you to bed
And pretend I'm a pilgrim on Thanksgiving, and butcher your head
This is a freestyle, cause it come from the top of my head
Meanwhile there's a light shining, on top of my led
You ask why, cause I'm trying to see with it
And it don't matter where I'm at, whether private or public I'ma be with it
So I hold down the hammer, and I let myself go
Since my fingerprints ain't on the bullets, they'll never know it was Z-Ro
That's right I sneak around, like a thief in the night
Knuckle up with me, if you want you'll lose your teeth in a fight

Even though I can call a whole heep a burdans, I know there's a bunch of blessings as well
I remember when I had to sleep on benches, straight rob motherfuckers and leap over fences
In a single bound, I wish my mama could see me now
Ain't no detectives trying to see me now, with no rival gangs trying to beat me down

Aren't no such thing as a happy home unless I'm leaving alone

Just be respectful when your speaking to me

Dodging your call on the phone, not because I'm cheating
But I'm drinking and chafing, comtraplaing(s) if I'm staying or leaving.
It aren't no question if I love you girl, it just your attitude makes me wanna hurl
I know I give it to you
How you want it when I'm in you
You just say the word I just slow down change position
And then continue
Then you be acting like you don't know me when your aren't sexing
I in jail stressing, and your mad at me for not showing affection
Pardon me for being human
If I'm not pleasing you then you got a problem with what I'm doing.

But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you,
Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you
Bitch
[Chorus:]
Thank for making it hard to make it better for us.
I was just trying to make some chitter for us.
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping.
I went out to get it and I came back with it
I never complain I just handle my business
God is my witness
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping.

[Verse 3:]

Our relationship faded
I wish we would have made it I sha hate it
But I got my sanity back and I wouldn't trade it
For a meal ticket, aren't no maybe we'll kick it
I don't want that
Like getting out of prison I'll do anything not to go back
Could it be meant for me to be one deep by myself while I'm awake and sleep
Thank to you I don't spend no more time try to please somebody else
Now all my time and effect is put into pleasing me
Straight up
I'm gone and your going to miss Joy'Mack(s)
Aren't no use in calling my phone
Because there aren't no getting wrote back
I don't want to go to the movie or out to eat
Only way your going to see me
Is if you see me out in the street
I thought you was my future wife girl
But maybe my experience with you was
Peroration for me to find the right girl
[Bridge:]
Me?
I'm going to miss you,
But the size 12 can kick you where the good lord spilt you,
Not trying to diss just telling you why I love you

[Chorus:]
Thank for making it hard to make it better for us.
I was just trying to make some chitter for us.
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping.
I went out to get it and I came back with it
I never complain I just handle my business
God is my witness
I'm a one woman man
But
When my one woman starts tripping
You can find where the strippers be striping."

Before I brush my teeth I'm pourin up
Lil momma you a dime piece
But I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup
Cuz it aint cheap as it used to be
And this one cost 350 bucks

I don't know why my life ain't stable, so many up's and down's
It make a nigga dizzy, trying to keep his feet on the ground
Feeling this pain daily, too many times a day
Just wanna live, not necessarily shine today
Losing my mind today, I can't keep the tears from dripping
Thankful for Eugene my nigga, for residency flipping
Ran a car into my own shit, shouldn't I be glad
To be like Joe, but have to lose everything 'fore I get it back
I get free game, I stacks my cars my clothes
But my mama will never scratch my back, before I go to sleep no more
I'm feeling crazy, just can't find the slack, but fuck
I can't move I know I'm not sleeping, I'm woke the devil's riding my back
I try to shake him, but he on me
Therefor my attitude is rude, fuck friends leaving me for lonely
Sometimes I feel like the high, is my only companion
So I stay running the drugs, looking for understanding

[Hook - 2x]
I don't really wanna die, just need a change of scenery
It don't matter where I go, long as I'm blazing greenery
Blowing my wig back, trying to deal with stress
So I don't go crazy, and bandon me from people to rest

[Cl'Che]
I don't really wanna go, that's why I ask Lord bless my soul
Had to stop hanging with hoes, even some my kin folk
It's bad for my brain, bad for my blood, bad for my people
That I wanted to show love, see cause love's been lost
That's why I blaze up greenery, and charge it to the cost
Baby I feel your pain, like when the tears come down like rain drops
And it don't stop, motherfuckers keep pulling the same spot
Trying to make you let loose, until you drop
Them off the scenery, doing something crazy
Wouldn't have to go through this shit, ain't that was another place to be
That's why I ride behind you a hundred percent, my nigga it's Cl'Che
I smoke with you ride with you, make sure you make it through the day
Too much hate make a chick wanna vacate, off the scene
Get a lil stash live out your dream ha, feel what I mean
Relieves the stress, remember you blessed smoke on
Live on and move on my nigga, I'm in your zone

Seems like I was looking for love, in the wrong place
Attempting to put a smile, on a long face
I couldn't beat it, the D. A. Had a strong case
So I might ready to burst this, for a long stay
Back at the block after 2 and a half, thinking my partnas got shit to show me
But they bout they paper capping, acting like they don't know me
Thangs done changed, I see I'm out here on my own
Got fronted a couple of packs, and glad I'm all night long
But fellas started to get jealous, cause I grinded so much
I wouldn't of knew he had a beam, if he didn't shine it so much
So when he came walking up on me, I just capped and let it go
See I'm nervous by nature, that means I'm dumping on you hoes
There was people looking for me, plus I'm ducking the vice
On top of that, my people treat me like a thief in the night
Sometimes I feel like my high, is my only companion
So I stay running the drugs, looking for understanding

King of the Ghetto, Z-Ro the Crooked that's me
King of the Ghetto Entertainment, Rap-A-Lot
Dean's List know I'm saying, that's what I ride to
When I'm rolling, through these mo'fucking city streets
Corner to corner, block to block
Witnessing nothing but bullshit, first hand
Niggaz killing niggaz, know I'm saying
Everybody killing niggaz, you know I'm saying
But we the main mo'fuckers, killing us
Tripping out here, for these god damn streets
To look good in these streets, to have thangs
In these motherfucking streets, man fuck these streets

[Z-Ro:]
Damn these city streets, are deadly to a brother
Cause they're full of crooked cops, and killers and undercovers
Everyday is the same thang, another fatal shooting
Somebody daddy done died, so they mama prostituting
Just to make ends meet, and get the bills paid
Wonder why we bleed the corner dry, until the laws raid
Trying to make a dollar, out of nickel and a dime
Kfc and Mcdonalds don't wanna hire me, because my teeth shine
In constant danger, keep one in the chamber
Cause I could become a victim, of some starving stranger
Thinking he can go through my pockets, and come up with some bread
When he found out I'm broke, he still gon leave a nigga for dead
So I hustle to breathe freely, and see another day
For the sake of my unborn babies, I keep a K
Trying to make sure the Mcvey name, repeat and repeat
Before somebody knock me off my feet, damn these city streets

[Hook x2:]
Damn these city streets, are hard to live in
Eighty percent of my partnas are dead, the rest in prison
All I see is the struggle, my tears drown my vision
I never forget to mention, god damn these city streets

[Z-Ro:]
Damn, these city streets'll eat you alive
It's beginning to be a full time job, just to survive
Tell me why I get pulled over, when I'm standing still
Why my homies wanna rob me, for my big face bills
It ain't no love in our lifestyle, it's all about greed
Can't trust nobody, cause everybody got a trick up they sleeve
I believe in struggling, cause that's all I've ever seen
Besides the county jail, and the light of an infrared beam
I use to keep a pistol, by my side
But it don't matter if I'm strapped, I'm still gonna die
Whether I'm evil or good, in the suburbs or the hood death is coming
Better be like Forest Gump, and just keep on running
Cause he'll be coming, like a thief in the night
Might be in the form of a jacker, trying to get you at the light
Houston Texas is restless, better keep your heat under your seat
'Fore somebody have your brains up under your feet, damn these city streets

[Hook x2]

[Z-Ro:]
I'm 27, but I'm feeling 71
I pray so much, I feel like I'm kin to the heavenly son
I dodge bullets on the daily, if I don't duck I'm stuck
Then I'll be another murder case, in back of that black truck
Damn these city streets, are full of yellow tape
I wish I could move around, but I feel I can't escape
Tell me where to go, tell me where to run to get away from drama
Seem like everywhere I go, they wanna put me with my mama
Does equality follow me, ain't nothing shaking
Justice and liberty for niggaz, is a house that's vacant
Therefor I'm stranded, where crimes are committed to bread
Forced to watch my people fall off track, like a bad wig
I dropped a lot of records, but I'm still broke
Can't afford to stay in the Four Seasons, but there's still hope
Lucifer is powerful, he ain't got no mercy on the weak
He got us suffering for nothing, Motherfuck these city streets

Living in the city, living in the city [x2]

Damn these city streets, are hard to live in
Eighty percent of my partnas are dead, the rest in prison
All I see is the struggle, my tears drown my vision

Block to block corner to corner, looking at the devil
Making my brothers think, they got nine lives
They was so gangsta, until Lucifer got 'em caught up in a drive by
Lil' kids, witness father and uncles pass on
Then they grow up, to get they blast on
Everybody saying, that the black community is out control
Even in the suburbs, brains get blown
They blame rap, for the murder rate
But people go to the movies, and see murder for seven dollars then they imitate
What they done seen, on Terminator 1 through 3
Swarchengger's the Governor, we get L-I-F-E
Innocent victims, get a free ride to the grave
People that work hard get robbed, for every penny they save
It's like it ain't gon ever change, this world we live in cold
I hit my Hypnotic, then I continue to roll

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, as we con-tinue to roll

Can't even ride, through the hood no mo'
Without police pulling us over, looking for ounces of do'
Just cause I'm black, and got diamonds on my gold teeth
Ain't enough evidence, to say I sold a quarter ki
But even still, that's the way it is
And the main reason homes are broken, and baby mamas shed tears
And have to raise, they kids one deep
In and out of relationships, looking for a man so people pardon creeps
But what I see, is just a soul trying to survive
The main reason why d-boys, hustle with twenties and dimes
Lil' mama I feel your pain, trying to get ahead
Don't let that be the reason, with 24 hour open legs
I know life, is hard nosed
Will we ever get our forty acres and our mule, only God knows
Ain't no love seem like it ain't gon ever change, this world we live in is cold
Hit my gin and juice, and then I continue to roll

Ain't no love in the s** no mo', I see Bloods killing Bloods
And cuz killing cuz, I remember when it was
La familia, when we threw the sign
But brothers don't keep it gangsta, when brothers be doing time I ain't lying
That's why everybody, be on they own
Talking to they partna baby mama, on they mobile phone
Hood ain't hood, it don't matter where you living
Somebody from your hood, will try to make you take their place in prison
Ask my partna Griffin, why they be snitching and telling
Watching your pocket getting jealous, cause they mail ain't swelling
Before you know it you a felon, waiting on a release
Thinking revenge, cause a friend got you took off the streets
And then they wonder, why I roll solo
When I'm in the hood, don't consider Z-Ro as your homie no mo'
Let Ro go loc seem like it ain't gon ever change, this world we live in is cold

To kill your family for some shit they ain't know nothing about

If you smart, you'll take cover cause we come in your route
Cause when we ride you could best believe there's guns in sight
How many times mama cried cause her sons done died

So the bullets that I bust the feds don't find out

Do you see, what I see
All I do, is wanna be
Somebody, can you feel what I feel
I try my best, to keep it real
And pay dues

Extra extra read all about it, I'm going crazy
Ro raging with motherfuckers smoking, going eighty
Miles per hour, pass up the city gel on my collar
Trying to locate and half of it, that will give a nigga some power
Not saying that I'm weak, bullets gon hang when I speak
I bust a brain if I reach, and get that thang off my seat
I'm in love with selling, that's why I ain't winning that much
Gas money looking funny, wheels ain't spinning that much
But I'ma make it the way of the other, cause I can't stop
People trying to trick me of my mission, but I can't drop
Cause I can't fall, run up I'ma keep bumping my lead
Before the game over I know, I'ma be dumping my lead
Because I'm nervous by nature, the slightest move will get you shot
I've been known to help niggas make it, to they burial plot
Not my lifestyle, I love the way the feddy stack
Record labels stealing Z-Ro, to ceo gon get it back

[Chorus:]
Do you see, what I see
All I do, is wanna be
Somebody, can you feel what I feel
I try my best, to keep it real
And pay dues

Sometimes, I feel like doing myself
Sixty percent of my body is drank, I ruin myself
But I'm addicted, eyes fucked leaning and look inflicted
With my facing revelations, tripping on what it predicted
Cause it's happening, when the trumpet blow
Ain't gon be no mo' laughing and, it's to the left or the right
I hope I get to go to heaven, I hear heaven is tight
Plus they tell me that hell is hot, and they won't give you no ice
I need a cool wrist, most of these bitches be the devil trying to fool me
Taking my kindness for weakness, and trying to use me
Bitch fuck your hair and your nails, you bout to lose me
I sleep with my uzi, cause she ain't gon steal from me if I nod off
The only place I don't let her go, is in God house
I'm a gangsta fa sho, you better believe me
I bet I'll be on that doja, every time you see me

[Chorus:]
Do you see, what I see
All I do, is wanna be
Somebody, can you feel what I feel
I try my best, to keep it real
And pay dues

I done made up my mind
Hustle all alone, I'm trying to get up some mo' shine
Every time I turn around, someone bringing me down
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds
And now they thinking I'm a crazy
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby, I want my mama
Cause I'm having bad dreams, and I die in em all
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all
I live the thug life, heartless and hopeless
Laying low ducking the law, with long you lusting and acting douches
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10
Until my out of town connect, put out your chest and took my ends
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I take
Fears get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but it's all gravy baby
I get tipped for knocking bustas off daily

[Chorus:] [2x]
Do you see, what I see
All I do, is wanna be
Somebody, can you feel what I feel
I try my best, to keep it real
And pay dues"

It ain't all good but shit it ain't all bad no mo' either doe
Y'knahmsayin?  I'm tryin to keep it civilized
But motherfuckers keep fuckin with me doe mayne

In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name
Z-Ro the Crooked, ""King of Da Ghetto,"" all about my change
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain
There's some niggaz mad at me cause I got cash mayne
I'm the future of Rap-A-Lot, quit livin in the past mayne
Remember flippin with a brick, in the dash mayne
Now everytime I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain
Probably be somebody baby momma, I ain't ask mayne
Baby daddy got a problem we can hit the grass mayne
An asshole By Nature, livin in the fast lane
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne
Honor Roll student, but I dropped out of class mayne
Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne
To you haters I'm a waiter waitin to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around and bust ya brai-ainn

I guess they never seen a Guerilla when he stompin and pissed
But they bout to see a young Guerilla whoop they ass with his fist
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin and shit
My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin me bitch
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it cause I had it By Nature
And that's the result, of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya
And I ain't trippin, I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet

I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it
Servin suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin like a [?]
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment
I'd rather keep ca-ca-cash, cause I'm alreaady wanted
I'm an asshole By Nature, my flag's on the left side
Gave him a pass before I stepped [?] side

Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black'n'mild
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin to make money stackin piles
Some niggaz trie to rob me befo', try to jack me now
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the _Lethal Weapon_ with maxi 9
Cain't a nigga lavish any mo'?
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?
And 9 times out of 10 it'll be one of my friends
That'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me
Ain't gon' be no bad actin with me, homie

But I can't focuse cause so many niggaz in the street owe me some bread
And if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed?
If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby
My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht
Might take alittle time for me to see bigger living (??) or not
But I want stop until I'm touchin my figures, you better move(bitch)
Cause I be bustin my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through
Been so broke and embarrased couldn't afford a tooth brush fool
If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'o
Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low
Runnin up and down Houston slangin dimes and nickles
Performing for my hood niggaz spittin rhymes and riddles
Forever stayin on our grind because of the shine it give us
And fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us

[Chorus: Trae - repeat 2X]
Everyday it's like I can't maintain
But still I feel I'm in it for the same thing
All I ever wanted is just to get my change
Living strength is my only type of mind frame

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
It's in my blood, it's in my body, it's in my soul
Gettin' paper been so important since I've been on my own
Don't nobody love me in this cold world
Fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl
Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna hear it, I ain't tryna know ya
Unless you be a hustler tryna come up on some mo' bucks
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond
Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march
Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin on this cross
Witness the J. Prince runnin the south
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide recievers cause we all be runnin our route
I'm goin long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong
Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin on try to maintain
Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne
Win it just to stay in the game (mayne)

Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness
Kickin it with the jealous got me beggin for forgiveness
This record label presidental think they live like me
Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me
They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name
But they can't sell records without me that's a godamn shame
Hoe nigga get ya roll up, everytime I flex you cats in check
Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch!
Everytime I speak bitch niggaz steadily be plottin
On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin prison
But it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out
But me you've seen I'm havin things in my dreams I can't get it out
God blessed the child that can double his fetti
Duckin and dodgin trouble cops and trouble times come get me
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone
And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home

When the fetti be rollin' setty, won't nobody be home
When the money start lookin' funny, all my friends get gone
Concerts and studio times, they love to come and kick it
But without gas money Z-ro gone miss it
I thought to myself, this feels like nobody hear me
Even though I screamin' I must be a demon cuz won't nobody come near me
People laugh at me because I ain' got respect like faith
Fuck respect I do this to keep a ride and a place
Will I survive cuz God is watchin'
Satan takin' my sanity please God stop it
I'm feelin' like Snoop cuz murder is the case that they gave me
They knew I ain' do it, but just to they permission they wanna hang me
I'm feelin' like Jesus when he was about to be crucified
Please everyone if you don't help me then you could die
Suicide is safety, but it's definite hell
Somebody dead and I'm stressin' in jail
I'm sangin' the blues

All I ever wanted was to be in the rap game
Cuz my people step on me like I'ma flow mad fame

I'm used to mother organizations, and locs of my own
Evaporate like brillo, when fiends smokin' that stones
That's the way we live in the ghetto, if we could we'd change
But don't nobody love us but trouble, so that's why we bang
Many funerals to go to, I don't go to none
Never look in a pinebox, until I see Z-ro in one
Ain' no future in front, and I'm scared to be decease
But it seems like the only way a guerilla-mobb gangsta gone see peace
Cuz mama waitin' on me, her grandma Bezzy
Tellin' me ain' no hatas in heaven, or detectives to sweat me
And a mansion a home in the ground, that'll be mine
Hand ready singin' praises to God that'll be fine
Plus they tell me the streets made of gold
Here people murder peole, the webbin' in heaven is under your toes
It ain' hard doin' right, it's just hard to succeed
I wanna live but it's hard to breathe
It got me singin' blues

I came along way, but it's still alot of road up ahead
To be honest I'm feelin' like I'm suppose to be dead
People feelin' like I suppose be happy cuz I'm makin' some ends
But I'm lonely cuz I cannot communicate with my friends
Niggas I grew up with, be actin' like we ain' grow up together
Fuck hoes, and po' up together
Nigga you cried on my shoulders and I cried on yours
Yeah you rode on my enemies, so I ride on yours
But it's a different day and time
And we don't even kick it
Ain' nobody got to holla no mo' it's strictly buisiness
But I tell you this, I will always have love for ya
The same nigga bitch I still shed blood for ya
The same nigga blood bitch I love ya
I went to school to fight niggas for you,
Even though we wasn't blood brothers
Fuck that, we was brothers
What we is now
I can't do nothin' but continue my years out
But it's all gravy, ain' nobody gotta chill with
Only thing I ask nigga keep it real with me

[Verse 1 - Trae]
Feel like I'm goin on 40 but I ain't hit the age of 24
Hard times killing my smile but I'm a make it though
If I can remember the last time I got to laugh without fakin
On top of niggaz hatin plus I feel I'm runnin by Satan
But I'm a solider and feel like it be hard for me to cry
So I laugh away the pain and roll the time by
This life I'm livin everyday is reality at it's best
All my doggs dead or gone and I'm struggles keeping me stressed
Deep inside I know it ain't right to fake what I'm feelin
But I'm confused cause my pride got me fighting the feelin
They locked my dogg up right when we was reachin the top
I made a promise to myself that I'm a maab till I drop
I know one day it's gon' get better when the sun get to shine
Cause in the rain we forever duckin one time
And to my brother J and Boss I got ya back till I'm dead
Sk for life my nigga hold up ya head

Every once in awhile I get a call from my friends
One of my homies from the block done went back to the penn
Niggaz can't stay out of shit for shit cause shit gon'call they name
I done been stranded before my nigga Boss done felt the pain
Hustlin in the rain not knowin where my meal finna come from
Out on the corner with soft and hard - stackin tryna get funds
Duece 4 - 7, three hundred and sixty five
I keep my head to the sky, hopin God's gonna let me ride

[Verse 3 - Jay'Ton]
Reminicin bout the better days
Stuck in a daze got me feelin like I'm trapped in a maze
I'm at a early age, stressin like a grown man
And all my pain got me beggin for a helping hand
I miss my brother even though we barely know each other
Cause in my life he been gone away and it make me tougher
Everytime I turn around it's the same thing
Same pain still trapped in the same game

[Verse 4 - Lil'b]
Everytime I turn around I feel I'm losin composure
Lord knows that hard modes turned me into a solider
I got a brother living sick thinkin life is a bitch
On lock down and this the type of shit I live with
Family be needin cash ends barely meetin
Lord knows my pockets starvin while these niggaz eatin
Plus I'm threw fuckin with playas that's finna turn to foes
I just wanna leave my life in peace and chase dough because...

[Chorus:]

[Verse 5 - Z-Ro]
Give me the strength cause I grow weaker by the second
My squab game good but I feel the need to keep a weapon
Close to me when I'm out in public or when I'm at the house
Sometimes I feel like I'm the most hated person in the south
I see death around the corner and he callin my name
I know I gotta go but first let me make me some change
Cause I ain't never had nothin in my life time
So why the world wanna disconnect my life line
I kept it real with homies who kept the realness back
Now that I need 'em they can't see me man how real is that
Matter of fact I think they wanna see me dead and gone
And me strugglin they don't wanna Z-Ro happy because his friend is 'lone'
Just cause they dead broke, they want me to be broke with 'em
Could it be that they mad at me because I can afford to smoke with 'em
Jealousy and envy made me sharper then a blade
I broke bread why my homies wanna put me in my grave everytime I turn around...

Nothing but the platinum placks, gold placks and all of that
Fatter stack, cause we don't know how to act

Once it bark, everybody gon listen

Popping trunk on 4's, and look fly on niggas

That's the Trae, the nigga from the Maab
And I don't give a damn, you see me strutting in my dob
I'm looking so playa in a throwback, with a black Lac
Grab a gat where the haters at, time to push back

One more time for the shine, when I put it on I'm blind
Have they ever seen a G, like Trae
Coming through sideways, flip the Few Quay
Repping for the blue and the gray, all day

From hitting stangs on pages, to I-10 skating blazing
This game like a razor, hell I ain't no fazing
Sitting on leather creation, left on the wheel ride on the steel
Thet Government will kill us here, glossing and flossing all day in Devilles
God forgive us influence the kids, to hop on the blocks and do what we did
But now in reverse, this how the ghetto world spins
Sitting back in foreign cars, with the screens falling

On swangas and robbers, straight leathers

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggaz'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'ma get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

[Hook - 4x]

[Paul Wall]
I got diamonds all in my mouth, in my grill and in my jaws
Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone Star State
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey Tape

[Hook - 4x]

[Lil' Flip]
Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

[Hook - 4x]

[Z-Ro]
Blucka-blucka-blucka, that's how my gun go
If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm vs-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggaz, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth

Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
It ain't no love involved, no motherfucking love at all
If I had a price on my head, I bet my partnas would give up they dog
Wish my mama was living, cause I'd be giving her my time
Shit, I'd probably never would of started to rhyme
My lifetime it ain't no sunshine, cause it be raining
I be trying my best to smile, but I can't cause I be paining
I'm paranoid all day, I keep my steel with me, bitch ass jackers
Try to get me, so now my people be scared to come and chill with me
Fuck y'all, I'm one deep till I D-I-E
Displaying off some boxing game, when H-O-E's try me
An S.U.C. Guerilla Maab veteran, constantly head busting
Leaving em in need, of an exceteran, I'm going
Do' knocking with a glock, paying a visit to some of my foes and friends
Z-Ro Jones Jr., swelling em up around the nose and chin

[Hook: x2]
Fuck all of y'all, y'all done pissed a nigga off
I'm a touch all of y'all, round each and every corner
Someone follow y'all, they just trying to give you a present
Something holla dog, and that's for all of y'all

[Z-Ro:]
I done made up my mind
I hustle all alone, I'm trying to get a solo shine
Everytime I turn around, someone bringing me down
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds
Now they thinking, I'm a crazy
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby
I want my mama, cause I'm having bad dreams and I die in em all
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all
Live the thug life, heartless and hopeless
Laying low ducking the law went North, to Lufkin and Nacogdoches
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10
Till my out of town connect, pulled out two techs and took my ends
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I taste
His get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but I'm not trying to find out where it went to
It might be for the best, cause I'm not trying to remember the shit I been
Thru

[Hook x2]

[D-Reck:]
It's automatic gun fire, till they all expire
Of course they said they loved me, but they all was lies
Told me just give em a deal, now I tote a pill
But when it was forth and ten, only a few was real
Instead of making you an employee, nigga I made you a friend
Now look what you lose, your Q's and handle fections stealing your ends
I've been behind the scenes, but in front of the schemes
Organized the team, for you to realize your dream
That's how you pay me back, you funny fake fraud and flipper
Over pennies and nickels, they turned sour like milk
It's no wonder why, so many'll never see fortune and fame
Fuck what you claim motherfucker, you never endue it no pain
What you bumping for lil daddy, my address the same
Ain't no pain without no gain, you got the heart to sustain
Now I'm solo for the do'-low, ain't fucking with you no mo'
For one thing you do, and I'll have you knocked off for the low-low

There goes Z-Ro the crooked better put some pep in ya step
You ain't got enough insurance to get ya self in a wreck

Better hope God come for you cause you gon'need a blessing
Somebody save 'em it's gon'take all of his people to Heaven
If he runnin it ain't gon'take but 3 of these to catch him
I'm dedicated to the delivery of a Smith & Wesson
While keepin it under cover the keep the laws from guessin
Who did it and what had cause gangsta's don't make a scene
Bitch niggaz public sizin and end up with ten or fifteen

I'm back in the hood my dogg but these niggaz be hatin
I feel it's me against the world plus that nigga name Satan
I tryed to get the fuck away but still I keep comin back
The hood'll never be the same since we lost screw and Pat
Snitches don't know how to act and plus they talkin to the feds
Only see me conversating with real G's and my bread
And it ain't too many down to ride so I ride alone
I'm a asshole by nature plus my twin touchin home
What the fuck is goin on? Niggaz need to get a grip
Some of the realest down south gangstafied with a clip
Fully equipped and grindin to get out of the hood
But I don't wanna leave my doggs so it's back to the hood

With the Boss in the seven duece with the top back

I'm a asshole by nature plus I'm chasin paper
Late night tinted up with a glock that'll spray ya
So move back a sec before you get wet
By the niggaz on the West with them vest on they chest
It's the Jay'Ton creepin up the block with the shot
Niggaz hatin tryna keep us from reachin the top
So I'm a mash for the cash like the S. You. C
And the G - A - N - G is the S - L - A - B

It's the Boss flippin in glass house while tryna stack moss

You can see it in my ways as I walk, and I talk
Stay flippin in the seven duece drop as I stomp
Bang ya'll outlinin these niggaz in chalk

Gangsta shit, fin to put you hoes in your place

A pair of fresh pressed Khakis, and Chucks will do me fine

But don't waste it on my new shoestrings, bitch I bang
My bold laces, match the same color of my flag that hangs (damn)
I stay G to the T, E to the B
H to the C, the streets raised me properly
Block monopoly, always some shit in the block
Cali building got naughty, knocked off Big Glock
Had to call up Reese's, got guns to dock
He done called his connect, and picked up a new stock
These broke ass niggas, ain't nothing but peasants
Wrap a nigga ass up, like Christmas presents
These niggas ain't G's, these niggas is wussies
Get your lips off my dick, and go eat you some pussy
I ain't worried bout a bitch, she can kiss my ass
The only time I come to fuck, is when I can't get cash
Keep your mind off mines, and build up your stash
All blunts rolled up, endo in hash
Out of a bitch ass nigga, I'll make a believer
Have these niggas catching bullets, like wide receivers
Bitch I hit a lick, bought a Lac hit a switch
You can ask these niggas trick, S. L. A. B. The shit
Just because playas get chose, you wan' grab your bitch
I bet nine out of ten, we can have the bitch

I never been a thug, till I graduated to one
And never shot a slug, till I got my hands on a gun
These niggas be fraud and fake, and ain't never been worthy
Got me feeling like Jordan, dumping 23 in they jersey
I'm sick and I'm slick, I run with gang bangers and jackers
Frame plackers and bad actors, being watched by them crackers
I'm running through plex with plex, like I'm Randy Moss
You run in my house, your head I'm fin to be knocking it off
And fucking your spouse, with nuts running all in her mouth
That bitch'll get tossed, like a drop top slab in the South
God damn cause here I go again, cooking and flipping dope again
Ten bricks in the do' again, ready to hit the road again
Trae done just wrecked the flow again, lyrically I'm a ass
I'm sick of these roaching niggas, trying to get inside of my stash
Bitch it ain't gon happen, fuck rapping cause I'ma get you
And have your mama in church, word for word reading scriptures
Don't let me grab the chrome, and break up a happy home
Long as I'm getting my hustle on, ain't nothing wrong
Now all my music, ain't just good wordplay
Listen real close, niggas feel ery'thing I say
Play it smart, you can get your days dark
Them K's spark and break you apart, nigga so don't start
You don't wanna end your life, on a bad note
Get lost in gun smoke, niggas better take notes
From neopacknol, you ain't getting nothing back
Plus the new Cadillac, 22's under that
7-1-3, niggas better move out
Walk a straight line, Yung Redd keep his tool out

You Donny Brasco, me my nigga I'm Al Kapone
We take private flights, you niggas never leave home
Fifteen hundred, plus I gotta get some thoed dome

Moving these tapes, with the B. You. Dizzy

I'ma throw my shit in park, and straight up hopping out
Sound like applause in the streets, all these Uzi shells dropping out
Fuck with Mr. Mcvey, and diiiie
Repping it like Southsive for live, fo' liiife
I pistol grip, with motherfuckers at all times
Navy blue up in the Regal, leaning to the left side
2-wheeling down South Mcgregor, bending corners in the Tre

But on the low, 5-0 ain't gon witness it
I'm in the alley with them quarters and halfs up in my hand
Thinking of a master plan, I can
Hustle all night, to the early morn', I can
Flip and serving rappers, serve his dome
And if a nigga plotting on me, I disturb his home
And then straight up fore' they even, as I swerve his dome

Get your paper hustling up in these city streets
Don't forget to spending 10 thousand dollas on C. D. S

Don't forget to spending 10 thousand dollas on C. D. S
And if you rapping ain't no handouts in this industry
Don't let it take over your mind

I use to set up shop bout six o'clock
In the morning on my grind
Powder packs and crack and nerve sacks
Out of the ghetto was on my mind
Needed to relocate with the thought of location, keeping it on the low
Cause when niggas beep you all the time
It seems they act friends, just to get your dough
But it ain't no raw to me
I ride with the armory, the ar 1-5
Collecting my digits and spinning my tires
No time for conversation, I gotta ride
Back to my safe place, stash spot for the waste plate
Cause I'm a go getter, if the game escapes
Balling was the picture, cause there was no hitter
Niggas is sinning major
Nothing but home runs when I swing my bat
But some of these niggas be playing crooked
So I can't forget to bring my gat
And when it's all said and done
I'ma redo my walls with platinum placks
At the Source Awards, with a granddaddy
Couple of drinks, straight like that

Fuck the boomerang affect, making motherfuckers hate me
From a distance, hopping fences in an instant
Trying to get away from the long arm of the law
Jepordize my benjamins, I will be forced to put some harm on your jaw
My attitude be raising it's amazing, I'm not locked for man slaughter
Because I love my plastic princess, and I can't keep my hands off her
She be right next to my nuts, everytime I deal with hoes and crews
Send my bitch to fucking suck it bitch, before I know they move

Bending corners, in a tinted out four do' Volvo, blowing dro hoe

And we stay draped in vvs diamonds, vs1's
And we don't tolerate jackers, we take jackers to Vietnam
Sunday night is well connected, with Big Steve and Captain Jack
Tuesday night we at the rocks, with ten cars deep and all them Lacs
Jumping stacks dump a gat, steel jabs and quarterbacks
Yeah we rapping but it ain't just rap, money we need all of that
Bulgari glasses on my face, hand cannon on my waist

Been at it since 14, you can't control me
So quit the baloni, 'fore I go where your folks sleep
Hit your block and it's on G, the strap sits cozy
It claps but don't speak, leave flats no slowly
So don't provoke me, I was raised in the struggle

Kept his finger on the trigger everytime he rode frank took all the drug dealers and kept his hood sowed

Wouldnt let his partners make no money let alone sell stones flippin in the finest of cars gator shoes and boots chinchila furs even hers double breasted blue suits for him and his broad but where was god not around his riches cause he quickly fell in a 6 foot ditch to deep him and his misses

Straight up and down and rap flawn, these jackers ain't on
That's why I skip the slab, and I move straight to foreign
Everybody has collided with The Screwed Up Click
And when I pick up the mic and I go off, they say how he do that shit
I'm a mic wrecker, about to checkmate like checkers
A pine breasher, with 25 bags of light green on my dresser

[Hook]
Gripping grain, my screen is gonna fall like rain
Cause I get my-my grind and my-my shine on, I'm balling
Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning mayn
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we hauling

[Den Den]
Gripping grain on the feeter, switching lanes with Aaliyah
Top down low to the ground, car looking completed
Balling hard like Kobe, put two inches on tobe
Pack a seventeen shot, hope a nigga don't provoke me
Cars they smoking, with herbal incent
Mashing horses flipping tortoise, candy up like sip
Beat the toll for a dolla, as I smash right under
On the passenger of me, riding underground under
I ponder in the game, passing laws gripping grain
Screens fall like rain, leaving puddles and stains
For my grind be major, hit me on two way pager
All my tools there's a later, for a safe place hater
So when you see me in them streets, you best bow down
I'm gripping grain causing pain, hold it down H-Town
Like a king or a chief, I'm blowing endo sweets
Saving my change pushing my Range, starched up looking sweet

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Twelve inches of dope, candy coat gon float
Got a beach house in Galveston, with woofers on bump
And we gon choke on smoke, and swallow drank as we sail
Atlantic Ocean the Pacific, man I'm making my mail
From selling yale to record sales, to fatten our pocket
Murdering motherfuckers on wax, can't nobody can stop it
With the checks and a black X, and a rolex make niggas check
Got my nose wide open, smelling nothing but plex
I get deep like a dimple, complicated but simple
From rags to riches on these bitches, Screwed Up medallion with a symbol
Ain't no mo' chains and pieces, for my nephews and nieces
When the record stores get empty, my ass get money increases
You can't walk on my lawn, better leave my Vipor alone
Got a house in Sweet Water Texas, Lexus and a pond with a swan
They call me a swanga not a diss, I broke up on and made her bitch
Now affiliated on a candy coated yacht, eating on shrimp fish

[Hook]
Straight Profit, taking over and you can't stop it
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we balling
Crawling in the turning lane, we tipping and we earning mayn
Cause we get our-our grind and our-our shine on, we hauling

Gripping grain, grind on and my-my shine on

No longer sitting low, changed my 4's to twenty three's

I'm out that H-Town Tex, where they don't barre plex
Invisible set around my neck, I look good and reflect
The Slim Thugger, on 23's burning rubber
Sometimes I wanna shine, sometimes I roll undercover
I'm from the City of Syrup, where young G's slang birds
Looking good by the herds, full of that endo herb
Nothing less, Down South we puff on the best
When I blow I just say no, to that stress oh yes
See I'ma clown top down, pop trunk and surround
If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown
We hold it down, Boss Hogg Outlaws ain't po'
When I'm in town I can be found, checked in the top flo'

Branded up down to ride, for G. I. Niggaz

Ay yo let's cash some checks, while them other niggaz plex

People screaming my name, doing sold out shows
Ain't got time for rap wars, we gon shine like stars
People see me at the bar, with E. S. G. In a car
Fuck em all I'ma ball, with my niggaz that stack
And just love to smoke sacks, with they mind on mack

I passed that Harm Clark, and Buffalo and Few Quay
Woke up on the North, at Antoine and Golf Back
While I'm out here, I need to go and get that Swisha House tape
With them freestyles, the one that 5000 Watts made
In H-Town we put it down, from the North to the South
Gold grills and platinum pieces, ballas holding down shop
Seems full of chickens, clocking in the parking lots
Be careful with that drank, cause the laws stay hot
Mlk to Homestead, playa choose your spot
You know it's warm around this 3rd Coast, so drop your tops
G. I. N. And Presidential, with that boy from Wreckshop
And Mr. Slim Thug, we feel we can't be stopped
It's been a long time coming, the sleeping down had to wait
Now it's too late, them Texas boys got too much weight
So stop hating, you know you know the way we put it down
For the Dirty Dirty South, representing H-Town

Z-Ro,Happy Feelingz,/z/z+ro/happy+feelingz_20703843.html,"[Verse:]
Lately, my luck has taken a turn for the worse
I used to ride in luxury, now I'm heading for a hearse
At least it feels that way, my day-to-day is full of suffering
My headaches can't be relieved by Aspirin or Bufferin
Am I tougher than my problems? I'd like to think so
But every time I try to rise all I do is sink slow
Like I'm out in the Pacific and my vessel capsized
Seems like I been going through it since I got baptized
(Mr. Jesus, I can feel him all up in my bones)
Cause he be giving me game on how to live my life long
Can't forget about the angels in the psychiatric center
Helping me to feel like I'm a winner
Got me taking Lexapro, just so I can improve my mood
It got me feeling like I'm giant, all obstacles better move
Or get flattened in the process of me reaching to the top
Ya'll know that I'm the cream of the crop
And all my people say

[Chorus:]
Get your ass up out my way, Satan
I got a mansion, robe, and a crown waiting
Never again will you catch me living in sin
Cause when the pearly gates open I wanna be stepping in

Get your ass up out my way, Satan
I got a mansion, robe, and a crown waiting
I do away with you devils so I can make it to the top
And remain sane, even when a nigga dealing with a lot

[Verse 2:]
I'm all alone, but guess what (that's all right)
Facing my fears and producing tears (that's all night)
Yeah, I'm a grown man but I still cry sometimes
Cause I'm a sponge soaking up pain
Trying to come out the rain
I been doing right all my life
And still suffering by murderers and crooks out here bubbling, I need a break
So many decisions to make, I can't concentrate
Cause everybody in my life is so fake
All the years that I wasted loving and trying to build
With somebody who was never even feeling me for real
I thought I had a family, but out the window it went
With all my legal problems and all these beefing with 30 cents
I'm a loner
Pill on the post, solo on the corner
Bitch don't know nothing bout Joseph
She just want Z-Ro to bone her
But I'm old school, till I'm in my burial plot
I just need a lady to dig me when I'm dealing with a lot

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Ain't no happy feelings in the air
So lately I been searching for happiness through my prayers
Holy Father, can you hear me when I'm down on my knees?
I need a bridge over troubled water, save me please
I'm just a lost soul, trying to find it's way back home
Everything I love has been taken away from me, now I'm alone
But it's all good, tell me when the sun gon shine
On this nothing ass motherfucking life of mine
Momma, it been twenty years since I seen your face
Do me a favor - ask God if I'm included in his grace
Cause I'm feeling abandoned, like the last man standing
So much poverty and pain, this ain't the way that I planned it
All I wanted was to make a little money and split
Take care of my people and grow old with grandchildren and shit
I'm still happy, even if my cases don't get dropped
And remain sane, even when a nigga dealing with a lot

Z-Ro,Hard Times,/z/z+ro/hard+times_20720636.html,"[Chorus]
Hard times, look over your peoples cause everybody dying
Osama Bin Loden is dropping bombs man, in a situation like this
How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do
Make a million and pull a stunt or two, a stunt or two

[Trae]
Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride
And I'm sick of this shit, I ain't fin to be hiding out, lately
Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherfucker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex
Nigga but not me though, I'm trying to focus
On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police
Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a AK and a HK and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been 18 lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

[Chorus]

[Trae]
Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

[Z-Ro]
Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind
Smoking wesson, my head I'm pressing, hard times

Hey why they hate me like I stole something, that make a nigga wanna roll something
But I'm they closest partna, if I let em hold something
Good for nothing, but making me hate my peers
So let the whole world, taste my tears
When they roll they represent anger, paranoid with one in the chamber
Deliver heads shots to my foes, and make them do a gainer
And when they splash it's a blood bath
And I trust no one ain't no more chunking up the deuce, when my thugs pass
Live my life in silentary confinement, away from y'all
If I needed artillery, could I even get the K from y'all
I'm all alone in the ways of the wicked, since I can't stand you hoes
Forever lonely when I kick it, in the lumino
With straps and shells, my life is murder and mail
See opposition see me coming, and they blast they self
This for my homies they don't know me, when I'm broke
Swear to God I hope you motherfuckers choke, when my gun smoke hate

And the T, is for the tommy gun that's bout to blast

I be feeling like Pac, because I wonder if they still down
Facing homicide from haters, but my homies didn't even spill rounds
Fuck y'all, I hate you motherfuckers to death
Remember times, when I stopped niggaz from touching your chest
I live in bulletproof vests, but it seems
The only time I got family, is when a nigga dream
So fuck sleep, I'm on a 24 hour grind
Look at your darling son, now mama I'm out of my mind
I don't know how to be happy, and I can't smile
And fuck a bitch cause she be plotting on how to get you, when y'all walking down the isle
The same motherfuckers, that you care for
Look how they do you, they don't love you pick up your pistol and therefor
Represent yourself, with the plastic
Cause me myself, wanna put all of you motherfuckers in caskets
Fuck love, 'less it's coming from the heaven up above
My hatred being written in blood, hate

It ain't no telling if a nigga make it, I might be stuck in the slums
A walking target, steady ducking the gun
Believe in me and you, can keep your wife
There'll be no hostages, just give me what I'm looking for and keep your life
I'm military minded, you can ask Klondike Kat
Even if they bomb first, Z-Ro about to bomb right back
I give a fuck about your life now, slugs hitting your windpipe now
Guess you could say, I'm living shife now
All about my fetty, till I bubble like some champagne
Z-Ro the Crooked, the most valuable player up in this rap game
So back back-back back, be sure to give me more than fifty
Automatic rounds, bound to pass that
Murder my foes, then I murder my friends
Because they turned on a nigga, when I ain't have no ends hate
Murder my foes, then I murder my friends
Because they turned on a nigga, when a nigga wasn't chopping a Benz hate

Wetter than syrup slide, riding on the way
Can't nobody talk about pain like me, and that's about a god damn shame
Nigga been pen pimpin ever since '91, and I'm still in pursuit of my change
I done been through a group, and a solo tape
Trying to stay out the kitchen, and cook no mo' cakes
Can't stay on no crack, but I'll sell you a track
And then a nigga, headed to another photo tape
Trying to walk, on the straight and narrow
But the straight and narrow, just to gets so thin
Gotta fall off sometimes, but he know I'm trying
Not trying to sin, trying to earn the dividends
Wonder why a nigga like me, bleed the fair
Ever heard about rent, gotta pay that there
Everybody everywhere I go, need somewhere
So we living our life, like we don't care
When I'm posted up, I sting like a wasp
Z-Ro paid the cost, to be the boss
Me and my niggaz, use to be thicker than sauce
Now, they don't even come to the house
I'm drowning in pain feeling the pain, and I really do miss my kin
But a motherfucker like me, gotta feed my family
One deep, I bring the bread in

Trying to get me a mill ticket, fuck getting sold
Spitting the flow hitting the optimo, and I think you better let it go

Why everybody, wanna be yelling my name
Don't they know my stress, will make a nigga do thangs
All the time, cause I be living thoed in the game
24/7, I be wrecking the microphone
And leaving everybody stuck, cause I'm wrecking on every song
And tell them hating ass cats, who wanna hate me
I'm fin to bust on sight, when cocked with a beam
It's a dirty game, but I gotta mash for mine
Ain't no more waiting, I'm fin to take what's mine
I'm a Guerilla Maab nigga, in the midst of plex
Knocking niggaz on rest, to collect my checks
Now what a wonderful world, we living in
The way of life, got a nigga living in sin
All that I wanted, was to make dividends
Maybe get my T. A new house, with a Benz to get in
And my kin folks, a platinum plack

I'm so sick of the struggling, I wanna be bubbling
But they setting up, road blocks

Why you be hating me
Day and night, baby
Mad at me, cause I don't buy
The dreams that you selling lately

[Z-Ro]
I needed to get up off my rump, and stack something
I was tired of walking around, ready to plack something
Big heads, screwdrivers, spark plugs to break the glass
Hold my bases of selling dope, anything to get that cash
I was getting grown faster, than average niggas
Bills and mouths to feed, I needed cabbage nigga
Did a little rapping on the side, but I was full time grind
Till they ran up and 50 one eleven, and shut it down
When I got out, I wanted to get some work and do it over
Instead I picked up a pen, and got to jotting in a folder
Niggas was bobbing they head, bitches was bobbing they head
The first time in my life, I didn't worry bout no feds
But I wasn't out the woods yet, round shife too
Niggas be killing eachother over lime light fool
Ain't with it fuck a million, I just want what I earn
But they don't like it when I holler kmj because it burn

If you wanna jam, you can grab a hold of my funk
But if you plan to take me off of my game, like I'm a chump
I won't punk about it, I'ma do my thang
Dumping on niggas from the turning lane
But it's burning man, cause that's how it go down
Niggas be trying to get you, when you live in H-Town
And you throwed, in the game
Wanna get you for your mouthpiece or your name
Have you giving up hits, having no change
Having more overdue bills, no strings
Not me, no more, it's a new day
I'm in a new ride, and it's looking too gray
Remember if you sew it, it'll read right back
So when you treat a nigga wrong, the heavens'll handle that

Got a name for myself now, selling them tapes
I still be traveling I-10, but I ain't selling no weight
No more, blue over gray four do', in and out the lanes

But I need my money, cause ain't no working for free
If it ain't twenty-five hundred, no appearances from the Z
Man, got to get my feet man, got to be treated fair
Trying to put me on a back burner, I'm out of there
A veteran to the game, you can't do me like no hoe
When my crib got flooded, you didn't help me you let me float
Now you wanna exercise your contractual right
But if you fuck me the first time, there ain't gon be a twice
Recognize ain't no hate in my heart, cause I'm a guard

On an everyday mission tryin to collect 5's and 10's
So many worries I promise my bones show right through my skin
Fancy cars and a mansion? That ain't never been my goal
A hooptie would be fine, plus somewhere warm when it's cold
I know what it feel like, not to be able to call the shots
Have a pen but no time to connect, all the dots
Therefore I do what I can do and then get down on my knees
Cause I can't make it by my lonely, Jesus help a nigga please

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
Yeah, much love to everybody doin time
Up in [?] state jail, you dig
Seem like soon as I'm findin happiness the joy's gone
Kickin it with Steve Francis, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones
I waited my whole life to be somebody
But now I've gotta get a visit just to see somebody
I'm in this all white, reminscin all night, 'bout my cousin Trans
Wreakin havoc in this rap game, so it's alright
Grandmother and my Auntie gettin everything they need
Trae your name's all in my eyesight, a true friend in need
While I'm waitin for heaven, I see hell and smell the flames
God send Abraham to quickly snatch me from this pain
I don't really wanna die, just need a, change of scenery
I done see too many killings just like my vision is mean to me
And my eyes don't like me, and my soul wanna leave
I'm persecuted daily by my friends it ain't easy
I do what I can do and then get down on my knees
I have so many enemies, Lord would you help me please

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
Nigga fuck Precinct 5, nigga and fuck Officer Thornton Berry
Punk-ass bitches, uhh
Tryin to survive for me, is like chasin the wind
You know you ain't never gon' catch it so why bother lettin yo' knees bend
I try to stay around some realness, brothers and sisters holla if you feel this
If hurt and misery is who you chill with
Mo City my hood it forever be my block
Never thought I'd see the day it'd hand me over to the cops
Where the love from my homeboys, I love y'all too
I was the tugboat to ya problems cause I drug y'all through
Just one question dawg, how could you do me like that? I took your family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
But now it's like you never knew me
Wouldn't take the fall for y'all so now y'all wanna do me
I made it up out the hood and I ain't comin back
Unless I'm brangin Lil' Boss to get a hundred sack
Nigga I'm gon' do what I'm gon' do and then get down on my knees
And make a couple of G's, but in God name, help a nigga to succeed"

You wanna be the queen, let me holla at ya

You want a nigga to touch you where it counts, you can call me up I'm on my way
Since you serious conversation, I listen to what you have to say
This ain't gotta be, about a wam-bam thank you ma'am
I'm not like these other fellas, although I know you think I am
Even though I kick it, with a lot of females
I can honestly tell you, that I ain't got a female
Because I'm fresh out of jail, you prolly think that I just wanna bone
Hit it quit it, then delete your number from my mobile phone
Every man, needs a lady
But I'm not trying to be your husband, only suggesting communication on the daily
I'm usually rude, with a bad attitude
But I'm thinking, you can brighten up my mood
While you roll up my cigarillos, I bring you breakfast in bed
I'm even down to ease your scalp, and calm your head
Just tell me when the laws coming, I ain't trying to end up in the Penn
Cause I'm digging you, and really feeling you should be my homie lover friend

[Hook: x2]
I'd really, like to get to know you better
Been one deep for a minute, but feel like it been forever
I can be your friend, when you need me
Your lover when you feeling freaky, plus your homie cause I'm down with you for sheezy

[Z-Ro:]
Whenever you need to shed tears, let em fall on me
Don't ever be afraid, to call on me
This the way your man leave you hanging, he ain't ready for you
But I ain't ever too busy, to miss some feddy for you
I know what it be feeling like, to be neglected
So when you with Ro you running the show, and please know that you're protected
I'd be lying, if I said I wasn't trying to bump and grind
But that ain't all that's on my mind, it would be fine
To hit the Cinema Six, and catch a flick
Papa Deauxxx for swamp thangs, fettucini and fish
Not a trick, but I love shopping for my lady friend
You could be my one and only, right before the day begin
I could drop you off at home, or you coming with me
The early morning sun, is something to see
Especially aboard a Carnival Cruise ship, you with it then let's get in the wind
Now this is how it is, to be my only homie lover friend

[Hook x2]

[Z-Ro:]
Just to lay it on the line, I done cheated befo'
I feel like there's some information, that you needed to know
It wasn't about a man, being a man
But how I'm gon try to give somebody the world, and they shit in my hand
We can kick it, but I really don't know what's on your agenda
Are you serious about me, or just another pretender
If I get the feeling fraud, I'ma stop it 'fore it starts
Sense from you, and I felt the full effect of a broken heart
Garunteed, I get you in the bed and it's over with
I crucify the crucial, with that legs on my shoulder shit
Hypnotic, is my afrodesiac
Make me keep on going and going, something like a duracel six pack
Pardon my pornographics, but please pay attention
I been behind the gate for eight, I need a mate
But I'll never disrespect, your legitament to the end
Even if I never ever get the chance, to be your homie lover friend

As I got no love my 17 shot glock with extra clips
That's it, I'm going all out and if I die then remember me
Cause in these last days I'm feeling like I'ma hit the penitentiary
For real, trying to deal with this every day struggle
You got to get up, up off your rump baby and hustle
I tussle, work my muscle, and boss hog
Take what's mine, and still screaming fuck y'all
If I can't ball, they better lock me up
Shackled down, hand cuffed, on sight I'ma bust
What's up, where your nuts, I get rushed to the head
Thug for life, motherfucker till I'm dead
Mr. 3-2, boss of all bosses
And I ain't, tolerating no losses
And no excuses, cause this world is so shife
Street game forever, and it's like that for life, nigga

Will I ever see the stage again
Radio D. J. S gone respect my rhythm
Feeling like I'm fin to hit the pen again
What will I do for food
Living in the ghetto turning boys to men
Crooked cops and killers interrupt my mission
Tell me will I ever pimp my penn again
Hustling is all I can do

[Verse 2:]
I was born on a fucked up day, had to be, holidays
With nothing but frowns on my face, the sadness brought madness
To a family that was built, unconsciencely I love em
But some consciencely, running these streets, living constantly
It's costing me, way too much, but the slums got me
Jacking niggas work something, exclude before I hurt something
Inhale, exhale, ok, I promise things
Gone get better, just give me one more day
So I can work my jealous friends to have around
So I can tote my shit and hurt my belly for trying to stay down
Stay focused on what I'm trying to accomplish, and not be accomplice
Stay real, stay true, pay dues, and don't become a victim of some mob shit
I never let this misery, push me to do something I regret
But just notice you in danger, I want you to feel my anger
And if I ever feel like I'm danger, I'ma empty the chamber, oh-oh

[Chorus:]

These motherfuckers want me dead, at least that's how it seems to be
An army of motherfuckers against me Dean and E
Who you gone call, when my commratery come down rain
Nothing but revenge to keep me sane, it ain't nothing like pain
Cause when I squeeze it then you bleed, satisfaction is guaranteed
Black hearted ever since the first murder, off precious is my breed
Enemies, fuck all my foes, fuck all my friends
Unless I'm in the penn, I've got nobody to call my kin
Cause all the real niggas are dead or in jail, but I've been
Left in struggle for success trying to get a check from Southwest Wholesale
Look at all the 16's that I've wrecked, and I'm practically poor
On top of that I'm homeless my niggas don't want me no more
Fuck being ten to get in, these motherfuckers act like they don't know my face
Better remember I'm quick to click and hit don't act like you don't know my pace
Well fuck rapping, I need some right now money, it's getting crucial
If I pimp my pen, I got to wait 3 months for trade me scratch for lunch money
Monday night the sirens seemed so loud
I hope that I can lose this crowd
Lately, it go down that way
That's why a nigga quick to get the K and spray
We could of been so throwed together
But because I was short it's on my cheddar
I haaaad to get up and bleed the block, and it don't stop

I spit it like I live it homie and the way I live is dangerous
Fuck Officer Thornton Berry and Precinct 5 for playin games with us
Mad cause we in a big house, driveway look like a car lot
Since we young and black that's enough to make them President bitches fall out
But I got the game from J. Prince bitch and I'm still learnin
Able to flip with a suspended license, a sweet tooth, and still burnin
On top of 22 inches of chrome and they still turnin
Tryin to reach a bigger market I don't have a plaque but I'm still earnin
Mo' than a motherfucker, my kinfolk Trae doin his thang too

Remember when I was dirt broke and love nobody showed none
That's the reason I ain't smilin when you see me in person
I'm tryin to peep out my surroundings cause them jackers be lurkin
Ain't none of that takin my car or my chain, bitch you must be smokin
Ain't nuttin smoother than to [?] his ass and I'll leave yo' head open
I'ma roll the way I wanna roll in the 3 or the glass house
Rov' Rangin with motherfuckers displayin my glass mouth
Hit my licks and get off the game 'fore they get me I cash out

Don't make these bullets melt in your mouth from this heat in my hand

And if any lil' momma start to get posessive I'll dismiss that
Not a jiggalo or nothin like that, but I like to beat it up

Lil' momma get on top of me and put a hump in your back
But if you upset a bitch I promise yo I'm dumpin the gat

Hit everybody that was involved and put 'em under the map

I took a fall for 9 and a 1/2 months but I had to come back
And at my arrival there was some bitch niggaz with some yakkity yak

And I'm scared to eat, the last of the bread and the butter
Because after that, all the god damn bud gone

Mama said that, it would it be days like this
But not a life like this, so I take a knife like this and slice like this
Take life like this, fuck around and I take my own life like this

I’m that nigga, ad nigga, like what the fuck is backing down
I come down this block and I know this uzzi be loaded
Bitch I’m gonna be back around

[Hook]
I’m alive, I’m alive
The way they try to murder me is like a 9 to 5
But I’m alive, I’m alive
The reverend is a gangster, we got weapons in them choir
I’m alive, I’m alive
If we ever go to war you better hope you on my side
Run up if you want to, I’m gonna hit you with that iron
No weapon by, can see what you have on your mind

Listen, these rappers said they got love for me
But I’m knowing they really hate me though
They be like I’ma get rollin through the hood
But if I let them do a verse, he gonna take the show
And that’s a no no, he ain’t stealing my shine
But how the fuck he 35 and he still in his prime
I ain’t never been a yg, I started off as a og in this motherfucker
And I never heard what’s your name
Cause everybody know me in this motherfucker
It ain’t just no rap, I really be where the coke be
In this motherfucker
Try to rob me, bitch I’ma shoot your lights out
I’m kobe in this motherfucker
I murder this microphone and put your pro tools in the trunk holes
Styrofoam at the styrophone, and I’m smokin like a …
Go hard on the mike’s not hard, I accidentally give me a broke nose
I’m a vicodin cold cane …your favorite rapper is a no goes

[Hook]
I’m alive, I’m alive
The way they try to murder me is like a 9 to 5
But I’m alive, I’m alive

When will it ever stop all this hatin and droppin salt
All I'm tryna do is live lavish with millions in my vault
Now from selling crack on the corner I'm tryna do it legal
But I guess it ain't no pleasin my people cause everything I do
Feel like somebody tellin me I want suceed
But I'm a millionaire and I owe it all to the hatred I recieved
Motherfuckers that use to be down, ain't down no mo'
My true partners just can't be found no mo'
There fore my motto is 'fuck Friends'-my only dogg is Benjamin Franklin
Tryna take him away from me you gon' wind up stankin'
I gotta family to feed so currencies what I need
But the people I break bread with would rather see me bleed
Tryna take all of my fortune but my fame is forever
And S. You. C I'm a claim it forever and I'm still down with the yella
So fuck all of these bitches and bitch ass fella's
And fuck a 4, it's a pt, glock 50, foes is jealous nigga

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
2 many niggas tryna take me off of my game (take me off of my game)
A nigga from the hood didn't live so good
Now they all wanna jock my fame (all wanna jock my fame)
When I'm comin down in my foreign
And I'm rollin one-deep that should tell ya about me (S. You. C.)
I don't give a damn about none of you hoes
I blast on site cause I ain't trippin no more

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
As soon as them eyes close it's over and that's that
'cause when they murdered my partner he didn't get to blast back
Is that the price to pay just to have nice things?
And it's my life in danger because I have ice mayne
It's ashame can't even sport our jewerly like we wanna
Cause everytime we shine them jackers tryna creep up on us
Catchin pistol case, after pistol case, ridin dirty
Mr. Officer I'm not a killer just wanna see thirty
Cause boys be against me when I roll alone
I get full of demon repplings when I'm holdin on
I'm tryna make it, with this gangsta shit I ain't gon' fake it
Anything a nigga earned, I'll be damned if a nigga take it
Now days the ghetto version of Spundalay
A nigga will run up in ya residents with the undelay, cold hearted
Just to get they fetti, bustin brains for a living
Disrespecting God's children bitch you made for a prison

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Too many motherfuckers so I'm a hate everybody I can hate
And I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Fuck-a-nigga, fuck-a-bitch let me get that straight
Ain't no love I'm not ya blood or ya cuz nigga, bitch I'm a loner
I'm a asshole by nature you can get with that, or leave it at this bitch
The only company I need is weed
And since I'm nervous by nature I'm a make you bleed indeed
I trust nothing-if I get a funny feeling I'm gon' be bustin'
Plus if my blood rushing it'll be more then a concussion
From my hitch I see these red dots gonna cover you're brain
Nigga I got problems I can't cope-with murder scene to keep me sane
One love, to my nigga Moe, and one love to my nigga Redd
And one love, to my mothafuckin bread I'm a get that!

You'll get this beam, cause I ain't trying to look in the rearview
Cause if I done passed it, it's forward march tired of living in the past

Wearing pain like it's cologne, y'all niggaz tell me to be strong
But y'all niggaz don't even know, what the fuck is really going's on
After done-datta, searching for my throne I reign someday
Heartless motherfucker, celebrate Black Sunday
I blow dro, as the dirt covers the coffin up
Life is so fucking hard, Jesus will it ever soften up
I'm tired of crying tears in my eyes, when I roll through
And I don't trust nobody, that's why I act like I don't know you fools
Y'all niggaz might fuck around, and jack your dog

Quickly pass on get my ass on, and keep my head right

With four 12's in my trunk, that'll bump like a beetle
Under the seat is the desert eagle, for you and your people
Think you seen it the first time, this ain't nothing but a sequel
Niggaz is hating my G's, keep skating my plates stay scraping
I get most of my product, from Eses to Jamaicans
Bandanas on my left antenna, and they can't standing
The scene is abandoned, when the first shot is fired and landed
Two deep sliding my mask on, really get my blast on
Creeping on cowards cocked up in a Coupe, getting my sag on
Lift the front end up, let the ass end just drag on
Me and a couple of loc niggaz, up in a rag rome
Five deuce and six zones, six treys and six fo's
Bmg B's down moves, tree tops and windows
Penitentiary poems on fo' do's, dipping in low low's
Finger fucking my 4-4, on a bitch made nigga fo' do'

Slow mo', when on the block 4's glide so gangsta
Trunk banging and screens raining, let my top down tailored
Nothing but money to make, sliding through the West
Niggaz left me for dead, so now I be equipped with a vest
I got my mug on mind frame, on leave me alone
I ain't gotta explain shit, you niggaz better get the fuck on
I done beat the game, just like my brother would say
If you keep them niggaz away, you live to see another day
I had a hater watching me, (what happened to that boy)
I caught him slipping, and committsed a clapping through that boy
I'm in hella-fied zone, trying to get my rhyme on
If I can't fuck it, I'ma still be breaking down zones
From the bottom to the top, from the top back to the bottom
Whatever they want whatever they need, believe I got em
It ain't no slowing down my hustle, with the block dried out

Had enough of struggling, now I'm destined for dolla signs
In my prime, know you hate on all my rhymes
Trying to be a living legend, in my lifetime

[Z-Ro]
In my prime, I'm professing my reason for rhyme
From the slum trying to shine, stacking nickels and dimes
And pursueded the bigger picture, with the states and lace
Jesse James of the rap game, nothing but yellow tape
Homicide when I ride, watch me glide like glide
Killer we still fried and died, and laid to the side
When from cracks to dats man, that's why the ride sprayed
Chunking hundreds off the stage, cause my bills is paid
Pimping the pen up in a ga-gangsta, a-stacking change
Respect the So-a-Southside, ru-a-running thangs
Ain't no beefing with the No-a-North, ain't no pl-a-plex
Just collided and provided you, with music for your deck
'78 Impala Cheve, sitting on top of Yokohama
Moving like I'm the Daytona, transporting marijuana
I sing to a song-a, paid for it you a loner
I ball if I wanna, while turning heads on every corner

In my prime, to see the hustling nickels and dimes
Got a smile on my face, but everything ain't fine
Stay on my grind, I had to keep a cool mind frame
Day dreaming and fantasizing, FED's calling my name
Am I insane, just think that I would wanna be rich
Though I'm living in a dream, and still loving this shit
The shoes fit, the game bout to get bent for chedda
Pull up on a box of chedda, with this black baretta
Trend setter, while FED's be all up in your name
Got a slug to fit your brain, for this kilo of caine
What's my name, Trey D's the nigga that's tatted and all
I live to do you harm, with this mic in my palm
Am I the one, to shoot off in they face like cum
Three times bright as the sun, and your girl time to bond
So forward run, but the K is gonna track you down
For these heros trying Z-Ro, bout to mash and climb

In my prime, cause everyday I shine like the sun
Rap game phenomenon, lyrically I drop bombs
Remember me like Vietnam, with a pistol in my palm
Bout to move my killa swarm, you should of remained calm
We some wig splitters, dumping bullets up in your liver
You shake and you shiver, nothing but casualties I deliver
Ain't no time for plex, me and that Young collect checks
Fellas be bumping and better respect, and running a check all Mo City bets
Z-Ro the po', coming through the do', with a loaded four-four
From the 44 to Ridgemont 4, taking trips to Akapoko
See my ends they done met with blood, tears and sweat
26 letters the alphabet, all rap I make bets
Pimping a pen and straight collecting my feddy, its so lovely
My bath water stay bubbly, when I had some of ugly
You can't touch me, I think I got it under control
I'm feeling my riches ain't too big, its just my pockets on swoll

Off my chest, while these hoe niggas be doing what
They be doing, I don't know though, shit fuck it
We gon stay two deep in a fo' do'

Slow Loud And Bangin', all in my trunk
Trunk full of funk, I ain't never been a punk
I blow on skunk, I blow on doja
Military minded, I'm a motherfucking soldier
Out the streets, of the Ridgemont 4
Not no bitch, and say I still ain't a hoe
Letting niggas know, everyday of the year
I pimp my pen, and I get my point clear
Why niggas wanna talk down, I don't know
Gotta take a trip to Akapoko, from the 4
With my 4-4 on my side, when I ride
Ready to do another homicide, in a pine box
And I'm gone, nigga old glory
I'm H-Town to Cali, just like Robert Horry
If I do a murder, flee the murder scene
No missing shortage on the drank, I can't find no lean
>From Southwest to Southeast, bitch it's about war not bout peace
Nigga like me, I'm bout knocking out teeth
Know I'm saying, I'll loose your grill
A nigga coming down, in the Coupe Deville
Looking gravy, looking real throwed
I'ma be the nigga, pulling over at the fucking cross road
With my K on my side, I'm ready to ride
And if I gotta go, it'll be a homicide
Me and another nigga, on the way to the Golden Gate
A nigga like me, can't wait
Just to make it, to another day
Gotta get the big pay off, so get the fuck out my way
When i come around your corner, so slow
It'll be the nigga, in the damn Polo
thats  the ralph lauren, jackers ain't barring
Why I skipped the slab, when I went straight to foreign
Said it like I said it, in the old school
Some niggas they be red, but Z-Ro blue
I come around your corner, but I ain't set tripping
But I will, wet niggas and wet women
With the calico, I had to let a motherfucker know
That I come around your corner, in a Lincoln four do'
A fox photo, cause I do it in a flash
Nigga watch out, cause that could be your ass
I rhyme so long, rhyme so strong
I flex my biscep  then I swoll on

Get on, the motherfucking bench
And when the laws hit the corner, I hit the fence
They wonder where I went, they keep looking
I don't give a fuck, like Tyson I keep hooking
Or maybe like Lenox, I'm strong to the finish
I'm like the ghetto Popeye, but I don't eat spinach
I'ma keep going, I keep on flowing just like the Nile
Million dolla mouthpiece, everytime I smile
Lookin throwda , nigga ask Trae
Everytime he smile, he can turn the night to day
You can open up the pop, and let the smoke come out
We don't give a damn, bout a crooked ass cop
Crooked officer, crooked officer
Make a nigga wanna blow the badge, off of ya
Me and Dougie, my motherfucking brother
R.I.P., to my motherfucking mother
That's the Dorothy Marie McVay Matthew
There's ten toes planted, in my motherfucking shoe
I gotta be a man, hope you understand
There's nothing but the work, and the calico in my hand
On a corner on the Ridgevan, and I'm serving a fiend
A real live B-Boy, and you know what I mean
I be stacking up chips, like Lego
Dunk on a punk just like Calvin Kato
Houston  to the rocket, a four-peat like Comets
I don't give a fuck, good punch a bitch nigga make him vomit
On the grind, I'ma take a trip on Greyhound
I be flying on a plane, but the dope is on the ground
Headed to Lake Charles, or headed to Lafayette
Maybe off in Alexandria, but I ain't finished yet
I gotta make a hoe I-10, I sin
Then I, do it again
I get my ends, I'm in my motherfucking Benz-e
Got these hoes running round, in a friendse
I be busting full clips, till they empty
A piece of potent pussy, might tempt me
Rain is trying to send me, to the Penitentiary
The main reason why, I ain't friendly
I'm wired up, but I ain't on no damn slaughter
Dejaun in the back, and he got the camcorder
Recording everything, the 4's gon swang
Still pulling up, on Fondren and the Main
Looking lovely, got to look good
I throw up Ridgemont 4, cause that's my hood
Never been a hoe, I'm letting hoes know
I gotta get a fucking P-L-A-T, but first a G-O
L-D, a motherfucking plack
I keep it straight and simple like that, hit a bitch from the back
And I use my, motherfucking tool

I'm still King of the Ghetto, ain't a damn thang changed
Still sip out the prescription bottle, with hydro on my brain
It help a nigga make it through the drama, swear to God
I be feeling like busting heads, and relocate to the Bahamas
But I don't wanna be a runaway, I love my block
But I can't seem to put my gun away, friends be killing friends
So I don't make no ends, with nobody I know
Cause if nobody gets nervous, then nobody's gotta go
That's the G-Code, and I will busting simply, then I will reload
Sick of all of this gun bumping, from you people
Turning a Christian into someone who is evil, Z-Ro
Motherfuckers all up in my business, broadcasting my life
Presidential Records suing Z-Ro, and his pockets ain't right
Why they wanna spread rumors, bout Ro Dog
Turn me to a menace to society like O-Dog

It's a shaa-aa-ame, the way they fuck around with my mind

Raised on game, a soldier that's showing no mercy

When I wake up, I be wishing to find another way to make a living
Baking a cake, back in the kitchen got my palms itching
Scratch that with a fat stack, of Benjamin Franklin, y'all better
Back back trying to get my stack, I got a black mack in a black backpack
I know you jealous niggas, hate me cause I shine
They know I be rolling one deep, trying to follow behind
I gotta handle my business, by myself cause I'm alone
Really nothing to live fo', no more wife no more kids at home
Ain't that a shame, I'm losing everything I love
When they fuck up its okay, but when it's me they hold a grudge
You think I ain't know, you was fucking over Z-Ro
With Lil' Shannon around the time, your vehicle was repoed
My love for you was that of a mother, one I never had
I know we could never be again, I'm forever sad
But a hustler, gotta keep hustling
Until then, I-10 drug smuggling

[Z-Ro]
Sometimes I be wondering, if I'm ever gon make it
Ducking and dodging poverty, am I ever gon shake it
Every nigga I deal with, keeps saying they down
Why my money be funny, everytime it be coming round
I told him tell em 25 hundred, he told em three thousand
Making me miss out on money, Sam gon witness me clowning
When you give a nigga a inch, they try to take the whole ruler
After my inches, nothing but the forty-four ruger
Who am I, Z-Ro the Crooked I'm not a hoe
But instead of busting your head, I'ma go on and let you go
I'ma receive my blessing, better believe my weapon
Is a first, from the basic instructions before leaving earth
The bible, and if we follow it properly its survival
We gotta listen sometimes, even though we wanna all shine
And glisten sometimes, remember we on a heavenly mission sometimes

And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches
Better murder they own people before they come up
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old

Totally clean and blessed without???, drugs, and weapons
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face

I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'

I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve
All I wanna do is live until I'm D. E. A. D.
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off

And relocate blocks, and set up my shop away from the cops
Cause I'm a hustler, slash all that
With plenty Christian in the background, for fall backs
That mean I got a plan, B-C and D-E-F-G excetera
Z-Ro running game, two thousand two steps ahead of you

[Hook:]
Keep running
Keep on running

[Mr. Drastic]
I'm on a whole nother level, now I'm running for the devil
When I finally get the shovel, I'ma bury him mayn
Bringing true to the game, so I'm putting God first
No burden I can't handle, I done been through the worst
Now it's time for the better, me and Ro getting setter
Drop the top in rainy weather, and I'm loving it mayn
From the cradle to the grave, no more being a slave
When you see me best believe me, I be off of the chain
Gripping the grain doing the thang, with Gene and Day
Screaming my name, before I go on I make em pay
Business first, making sure my money is straight
I'm loving the hate, because it's keeping food on the plate
It's later and Ro, yeah you know we running the show
Getting the do', rapper slash ceo
Wherever I go, I always be the number one stunning
So you better keep on running

[Hook - 2x]

[O-N-E]
Everyday is a struggle, so I gotta get up and get it
I'm dodging the federalies, trying to stack my mill ticket
It's wicked up in these streets, if you don't work you don't eat
That's why my eyes are wide open, never falling asleep
I roll O-N-E deep, cause I don't need no niggas
They hold you down everytime, when you trying to stack figgas
I'm clutching chrome plated triggas, that's keeping these bitches running
Faster than Forest Gump, that twist and turn when they coming
I been a hustler for a hustler, was even thinking of hustling
And sold every kinda drug, and that's the end of discussion
I'm not trusting nan nigga, nan bitch or friend
Because they all turn fraud, in the god damn end
I'm dropping rhymes and wreckes, and my sixteens is cold
No baking soda it's over, I'm mixing O-N-E do'
When it's finally wrapped in plastic, then shipped to the stores
We'll be them seven figga niggas, O-N-E and Z-Ro

My life is like a mercy game, ducking and dodging crooked cops
On a mission fishing for feddy, ready to make a knot
I'm use to having less, and I just can't deal with the stress
And it seems like everywhere I go, another nigga wanna test
Brother don't disrespect yourself and get yourself up in a, vine
Cause I'm a maniac with a mac, and a black back-pack
Smoking up on the urban fat sack, I'm trying to keep from going off
But niggas be trying to make me starve, when I need groceries in my house
Wicked niggas say they be friends, but end up trying to kill your friends
Always turn to foes, that's saying it's over millions
Dealing with dirty niggas on a daily basis
Don't really wanna fuck with em, but see they baby faces
I gotta survive

[Chorus - 2x]
Let me live my life, nigga don't fuck with me
To deal out these deeds, then you die
And when it's my time hope I don't, cry

[Z-Ro]
Living in the ghetto, day by day
I'm bumping trying to make a profit, cause I gotta get my pay
You better, keep watching me and
Pretty soon, you'll see man
That I'm a real rich nigga from the Houston streets
Fried out licking, looking for something to eat
I'm on a mission, whipping birds like they stole something
Pain, it make me wanna roll something
I'm a soldier, and I'm outta my mind
Voice mail beeping for days, cause I'm out on the grind
Guess my daddy didn't love me, cause he turned his back
Therefor the streets is my people, a nigga learned like that
And I haaaad to get up, and bleed the block
And it don't stop

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
My nigga Herman Fisher doing fed time
I remember like it was yesterday, it made the headlines, damn
I had to start all over, but it didn't matter cause I was a soldier
Walking around with a king size chip on my shoulder
Missing my mama while I Iay down, on benches to sleep
Snatching purses and hopping fences just to eat
Still I maintain, I'm still in the same game chasing paper
Bitch niggas be up in my business, like oops I'm erasing haters
I'm S.U.C. for life, KMJ until I'm finished
Like Popeye from the ghetto, but a nigga don't need no spinach
All I need is my Nina when I be flipping birds
Cause all I have in this world, is my balls and my word

It ain't no brighter dayyyyyys, 
'cause when it all unfooolds, 
A nigga gon' just pass awayeeeee.
These haters tryinna stop my griiiind,
But I bet them hoes can't block my shiiiiine,
So tired of taking losses, Not this time,
I can't save the whole world, I'm just tryinna look out for mine...

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Aye
I've been gettin a lot of exposure
Lately on niggaz' songs, and in they videos.
'cause they know I'm an O.G.
Not an Original Gangster but an Orginized General
They see pullin' up in my 300 bangin
Gators on my feet and jewelry danglin
Everybody love they way I look on the ouside
But inside I be painin, Is it every gonna stop rainin?
Nuthin but thunderstorm clouds over above me
Shit I used to break my back to make sure my niggaz was straight
Let The Truth Be Told Lyrics
But they still don't love me. 
That's why it's 'No More Pain' on my lower arm
And '1 Deep' tatted on my other arm
If you see me lookin in ya'll direction
I'm not about to speak, finna do you mutha fuckas harm.
Got 17 albums and they all sellin
So tell me why the fuck my pockets ain't swellin
And I ain't neva did nothing to nobody, that didn't have it comin to them
Bitch, I'm a fellon, Felt like I was failin, 
God tell me when I'm gon' win, 
You know when I'm blessed,
You know when I'm gon sin,
You were there at the begginin of my days,
I'm just hopin I see you after all my days end.
And I don't give a damn what these people say,
Half the people in the church got evil ways,
I was just lookin to make a lil' scrilla, 
But it turned a lil' christian into a lil' killa
From ablel to label, and gun to rifle.
It's a forward march, ain't no time to retreat.
If you able to save a nation, go head,
But I'm strugglin to get myself somethin to eat.

[Chorus: Z- Ro]
Time to let the truth be tooooold, 
It ain't no brighter dayyyyyys, 
'cause when it all unfooolds, 
A nigga gon' just pass awayeeeee.

But I bet them hoes can't block my shiiiiine,
So tired of taking losses, Not this time,
I can't save the whole world, I'm just tryinna look out for mine...

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
Yup, Yup
No more strugglin backwards, Hustlin this is my year
I've been in the game since '95 
Bitch! I'm still here
I hear the background that side talk and cheap bumpin
If you don't like who I signed, Swisha House nigga! 
Just 6 months ago they said 'Da Don' was all over
But, I just tight my flow and built the buzz and came colder
I toucht them street G's, Them go gettas, And crack stars
You 6 feet deep or some where sleep behind them iron bars
'cause I done knocked off plenty cars and..
Off plenty hoes
Done pulled up plenty shows
Candy paint and glass vogues.
Look at 'em whisperin..
Like some hoes on the sideline
They 2nd streamin and cheerleadin while I'm gettin mine
I know I've been down, can't wait ti'll the next round
Tommorows', tomorrow
But today nigga it's right now
It's Ke' and 'Ro and fa' sho that's a gangsta hit
Get up out our life, hoe
Get up off our dick, Trick!

Time to let the truth be tooooold, 
It ain't no brighter dayyyyyys,

Z-Ro,Lets Chill,/z/z+ro/lets+chill_20725516.html,"(Mexican D)
What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill
Come through, blow something, smoke something
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side
Letting y'all broads know, we too real

[Z-Ro]
What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like you don't know me
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a little bit lonely
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of your butt
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up all your time
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on you
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke marijuana
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers through your hair
Go to the Residance Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of underwear
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so don't leave no scars
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have
do a little wine and take a little bath
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you down
All you got to do is put me in the penn
got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something
Keep it on the low and we could do this today

[Chorus]
Let's chill, so I could knock you down
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do

[Enjoli]
Ok, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump in my ride
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside
With our minds, you got something that I cut for
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust you
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls
Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the curb
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could receive
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight up and real
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on your mind
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to chill baby

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been captured
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away together
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on the lever
Get aquatinted with eachother as we feel the Mo City
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never show pity
But if you scared, I mean you not alone
it might be the ghetto but I call it home
90 percent of the killers are cool with me
so it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I was lying
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in between the thighs
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and then slow dance
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon
The stereo bumping our slow jam song
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it on
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in your life
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your life

Sunny days 'fore the rain, G-O-D please
Help me to maintain, because I don't
Wanna die, if I'm living in vein

[Cl'Che]
Sometimes I just wanna scream
But I know, G-O-D will make it right for me
When I feel like I can't take no more, of these rugged streets
I let him take over, now my mind is free from worries
So many negatives, I can't fall
Got my cheese, and Pac's are posted on my wall
If I make any more mistakes, I can now learn from em all
Cause I'm grown now I found him, so you know I'm strong now
I write my songs, with plenty of pride
For my people, that done burned for years and died
Don't you wanna grow over your child, so you can know who you are
Instead of putting the world on pause, just to drive that fancy car
Hey boy, I want you to feel me now
Cl'Che know you got it pain, won't love you anyhow
Need you to help that little sister you know, build some esteem
You wanna know what's on her mind, and not in her jeans
Let's make this world a better place, for the living
Let's make our minds a better place, for thinking and listening
My people, let's try to make a change
Cause I don't wanna die, if I'm living in vein

Even with God in my life, it's still hard in my life
Motherfuckers call it so close, to be fraud in my life
And I can't understand, Z-Ro ain't doing no wrong
That's probably why they be fucking with me, thinking I'm all song
But it's all gravy you wanna hate me, then go on hate me
Cause I've been looking for reasons, to take it off safety
And a motherfucker don't make me for me, lay me feeling on me
Like nobody don't really want me, the pressure creeping up on me
I wonder what happy is, cause I've never known it
People I meet ain't partnas, they potential opponents
Cloudy days, and the place I come from running from cops
Put it down in the alley way, when they pass I'm busting some shots
Sorry God, I know I ain't got no business selling dope and tripping God
Show me some inspiration, when you see me slipping God
Cause when I die, I don't want it to be in vein
I'd rather serve in heaven, won't be in the Penn in the flame

[Hook - 2x]

[Cl'Che]
Know you can go anywhere you wanna go
You can be, anything you wanna be
You can see, anything you wanna see
If you keep G-O-D, first everyday
And it hurts, the daily living while you flipping
Through your hood, with your partnas kicking
Click tripping, don't know why he had a short living
You don't know, yeah you know
He ain't the first, oh how the truth hurts

[Z-Ro]
So I'ma go, where I wanna go
And if I'm pressing for a fo', that's what I'm gonna blow
Long as my bills paid and my rent paid, it's all gravy
Cause when I was on this, ain't nan one of my people saved me
Life is a struggle and a pain, but I'm maintaining
I pray I won't get found naked, with my brains hanging
Too many niggaz, trying to get me for my paper stack
So I'ma be bout a playa, now where the haters at

If I could be like Jesus, I'd have a reason to live
The way I dodge bullets, it's like it ain't the season to live
If I could be like the Lord, then my problems wouldn't matter
No mo' head busting my guns, they brains wouldn't splatter
When they run up on me, cause I be turning the other cheek
But I be thinking like a devil, and packing my heat
If I could be like Jesus, I wouldn't running from death
Taking precaution with a vest, fuck getting one in my chest
If I could be like Jesus, I wouldn't hate my foes
Since I'm not a 3-49, plus eight my foes
If I could be like Jesus, I wouldn't cry so hard
I can't seem to please anybody, yet I try so hard
If I could be like Jesus, then I would teach, they tell me
That I'm learning to be like him, cause they can feel him when I speak

If I could avoid the sleepless nights, and be like Christ
I'd write the book what Mike is like, the wrong and the right
The day and the night, the weak that are dying the strong that fight
The difference in the black and the white, the crack and the pipe
The fiends on the block, that dream of the rock
And it ain't seeming to stop, because the beaming is hot
And it's not what I expected, the glock keeps me protected
The best, cause the bullets be hot when they injected
I can't avoid satan hardest, it seems I try
I can't sleep it hurts, even in my dreams I cry
It gets deep, when you hearing your name spoken in vein
Press ships get torn apart, the windows broken is pain
I know it's a shame, the way I'm steady smoking this Jane
It's getting hard for me to focus my brain, hoping it change
I'm going deranged, something's always trying to deceive us
And if I could change, I would wanna be like Jesus

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
If I could be like Jesus, then I'd stay off of the drugs
But I be tripping on how my body, bounce off of the slugs
Forgive me for my sins, cause I'm just trying to stay alive
Can't trust nobody but weed smoke, my only friend is a dime
If I could be like the savior, then I would save something
Blast something up, in somebody something who made something
G-O-D, that's God Over Disrespecting
And God Over the Devil, from all that holy chin checking
I'm trying to be down with you, I hope you can feel me
I don't love head busting, but niggaz be trying to kill me
And I don't wanna die, that's why I try to stay strapped
Cause ain't no telling where I'm going, if I get put on my back
If I could be like anybody, it's you my Lord
Cause in any situation, you know what to do my Lord
My attitude is rude, but I ain't meaning no harm
Just trying to keep murderers off me, when they come get you they swarm

Chasing paper so me and Fred, steady stacking our bread

Now Walter D is my nigga, the rest of em be hating Ro
What do you know, why these niggas all up in my face
Back back I'm about two seconds, from catching a case

Slow Loud And Bangin in they face, and niggas acting like hoes
I think it's cause we never went, when we be spitting out flows
Got cash I'm sick with it, I spit it cause I'm a G
It's the Jay'Ton, repping S.L.A.B
With Ro Dog and Trae, my flag be doing great
Undisputed like weight, when I'm upper cutting in your face
Body blows and jabs, for niggas hating on S.L.A.B
You come with that bullshit, guaranteed I'm beating your ass
It been a long time, and we finally made it
Hopped the slab off the AVE., and I finally sprayed it
No more slanging on the block, cause the block got raided
Like the point on the dice, I can never be faded

(*talking*)
Yeah, we ain't gon blow it though
You know we got this hoe ass devil on our back
On our motherfucking ass, that nigga can't face up
With a real nigga though, know I'm saying
Nigga know he talk shit, so I be spitting
All motherfucking day long, but it's still God first though
This whole ass world got me this way, you know I'm saying

This 4-5, 4-4, shit it goes on and on and on
Talking down on us nigga, you getting 17 hundred to the dome

And let's roll, I'ma continue to blow dro, and we out this bitch"

I keep a heater in case I run across my beef (look at me)
And I'm so full it hurt my mouth when I speak (look at me)
I'm rapping but I'm still working the corner (look at me)
Hustling everyday selling work and marijuana (look at me)
I keep a vest on, I keep my chest on (look at me)
With a real groupie when pull out a press on (look at me)
I might dress prepped up but I still do crime (look at me)
I'm a geurilla can't you tell it when I rhyme (look at me)
I don't need no soda, straight out the paint bottle
And I don't care if you don't like it cause I ain't your role model

[Chorus - 2x]
Tell me where your hood and I'ma tell you where mine
But don't be beefing when you come around a g on his grind
Smoking nothing but pine, need no drama on my mind
Pump your breaks, bet not disrespect the stop sign

I must confess that I be looking for trouble (look at me)
When I make a million I'll be looking to double (look at me)
Nothing but pen pimping and smoking that pine (look at me)

Hear what you gonna sing for this one, come on

[Z-Ro]
Three liter big red, got diluted nines fed
Able to make a bitch, wanna suck my naked head
I get fly when I wanna, graduated from corners
I know it tingle, cause your pussy marinated my sauna
If you capping I ain't tripping, cause I really don't need you
Prolly say your pussy gon be beat up, and having a seizure
Overseas vacation, Prime Co. communication
And radio stations, got us in regular rotation
Cause the guns unloaded, lot of heads got exploded
Destined to be the throwdesf, if I'm properly promoted
Sewed it up like a sweater, financial back or go-getter
Then through your vest chest, with the talons in my baretta
Stay one step ahead of, my competition they better
Fly down from overseas sign down, and get to chumping for cheddar
26 letters than Ro, if you ain't know now you know
From Ridgemont 4 to Akapoko, I'm gripping grain in my flame

Sunday morning pulling out my bitch, I'm looking good
Nothing but diamonds around neck and around my wrist, I'm looking good
Doubles breasted tailor made, I'm 'Sacci'd down to the flo'
And it don't matter, if you step on my wing tipped shoe
Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

[Papa Reu]
Rolly on me wrist, Sansun me wrist band
20 inch rims, on me suspension
Foreign replay, and not forge my stun-a
Dressed everyday, in the latest fashion look
Boys the enemy, best respect the man
Listen to me, know it's rule number one
No buster ain't right, we told the game plan
You do, you better and change the wrist band
The way me flow, my retaliation
So listen to me boy understand, understand
It's a bezeled out wrist, and that I wear everyday
On the right hand-a, the Presidential Rolly
And it's crossed off, like a ton of ice on the tray
And the price start-a, my choice to lose security
If you don't believe me, ask your old lady
I know she saw it, from 'Poko miles away

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Pull up to my bump, as I let it recline
13's easy five screens, it ain't no fucking with mine
They think I'm fucking with nine, but I multiplied it by fo'
It took some time, but I decided to throw my bitch on the 4's
The bubble-eyed Mazaratti, on a mission to meet Scotty
With bullets for your body, cause I'm living like Gotti
Pistol grip and a beam, plus a murdering team
Cash rule everything me, that there ain't nothing but green
Jumping in and out of line, moving slow as I wanna
Smoking reefer bending corners, on 20 inch Yokohama
Cause these niggaz be hating me, when I be crawling down
So I'm like Paul Bugsy with a infrared, cause these niggaz be falling down
Steady yelling out timber, from the first dance January down to the last dance
December better remember, put a big shell casing up in you
Make you weak like SWV, when I shine and grind like E.S.G
But I gotta get love like the Big Steve, throwed in the game like that P-A-T

I really hate it that we lost another soldier
Time and time, it seems this world be getting colder
You never really know when your time gon be over
It feel like it's forever riding on our shoulders

[Trae]
Why did I have to say goodbye, this life the best here, kneel down and I cry
I can't lie heavenly father, why all of my real niggas gotta fight
It was just like yesterday we lost DJ Screw, now B-I-G M-E double L-O
Somebody feel my pain before I be alone, and I'm about this sure
I can't take no more we'll mask together, wrecking the stage together
We shine together, we ride forever, pull back in the shop together
Step on the block together damn, it'll be okay
I got a certified plack that's on the way
Trae, Dougie D and Z-Ro gotta ride for the dog
Gotta grind for the dog, put it down for the dog
I love my dog, and I don't wanna lose no more
Big Mello I got you, and I'm fin to tell everybody all about you
This life we live is hard, you was another gift to my life
You and Screw and I'm missing you, and now that I think about it

[Tony Montana]
Heavenly father I ain't the one to question your will, or what is it to be
done
But these cemeteries get you acquainted to all of my homies
And this time it's Mello, and I just don't understand why that he gone
And the only thing that keeping me from crying, is blowing up on this do-do
Like ones in the ghetto, we learn to shock and rock cash that rip flows
And you ain't give a fuck if, you want to click shit you live on
You said, my heart in the light motherfucker, we gon represent my nigga
Put the deuce up by the roof, yelling out what it do for you my nigga
Wrecking the microphone till ten and, keeping it crunk for you already
And the plan to get the lab, before praying with grandma on that Thursday
Know we gon ride until then, whenever the last your ass gon be missed
And we gon hold it down up on the ground, till we meet up in heaven

[Chorus - 2x]

[Dougie D]
I'm gon ride till I'm with you, damn I really miss you
I just don't understand, why he had to come and get you
You always kept it positive, painting perfect pictures
A soldier with the heart of a lion, a bold heart nigga
Much respect dog, never will you ever be forgotten
Salvation's in your corner now, down here you got non-stopping
Realizing that you're gone, it's really hard to swallow
Tomorrow ain't promised, we living time that's borrowed
I wish there was another way, that death could be defeated
You left us all in shock, our souls have been depleted
Till we join you we gon mourn you, keep the mic on for you
16 shots of loot, to the K and Day soldier

[Z-Ro]
We living in war times on time by the hard times, will it ever get better
My niggas be losing they life, over some of that punk ass cheddar
Everybody gotta have that, so we gotta get up and get that there
The best way we can, everyday is a struggle
And every morning, six fellas with a casket in they hand
And it just don't stop, seem like every time a brother fin to reach the top
Shut the fuck up, heaven always has a road block, another real nigga drop
And it's always close to home, paranoid of my people I tote my chrome
Packing that plastic in the middle of the night, I gotta protect my dome
Looking for the reason, why, my nigga ain't breathing
God damn I'm hurting this evening, why the fuck Big Curtis leave
And I wanna go with him cause I can't stay breathing
Everyday it's a different thang, broke loose of the drama, loose of the pain
Feel like I'm going insane, the rap game will never be the same

[Chorus - 2x]

[Cl'Che]
You never know, you never know, when it's your time to go
To the top of the rope, till you can't climb no more
We miss your energy and your spirit around the studio Big Mello, Big Mello
My partner, my friend, my labelmate to the end
I'll always remember how you brought the light in
Telling the world what it do, through all of your songs
Heard I just can't imagine life here, since you gone
This is my cry for you, this is Cl'Che's cry for you
Another Southside soldier gone

Z-Ro the Crooked, aka King of Da Ghetto
Representing Assholes By Nature

[Z-Ro:]
I always been a soldier, but I never did look for no wars
I walk with God, but I still receive bruises and scars
Everybody was shitting on me, for no reason
Couldn't wait to get my money right, and finally get even
Remember when I pushed the canary colors, with a pocket full of lint
Booster cables was necessary, for everywhere I went
Sold dope for a minute, till my nigga start snitching
Guess they didn't wanna see a nigga, get money out the kitchen
'Fore my mama died (mama said), people gonna hate ya
Cause they can't do what you doing, cause they women wanna date ya
Be ready for it, it's gon happen all day long
If everybody got love for ya, you doing some'ing wrong
That's why I strive to please Z-Ro, keep my money on the low
Cause if my friends try to get me, they gotta go
You can hate me all you want, cause I'ma use it for my good
Thanks for helping me, to make it out the hood

[Hook: x2]
This one is to my real niggaz, that hate me every single day
Because of you, I make the world pay
Ain't got no love for nothing that got love for me, cause love ain't live
They don't love me, they love my nickels and dimes

[Z-Ro:]
Everytime I pray to God, I ask him to forgive me for all my flaws
But I'm paranoid, I can't keep my pistol out my drawas
Seem like everytime I move, somebody watching me
But still I continue to pay my dues, it ain't no stopping me
Till I'm satisfied, until then I'm left to ride till it's over
But I travel with no passengers, you can't ride if you ain't doja
I don't even trust myself, so where you think you stand with me
Fuck everybody, I feel like everybody out to get me
If it ain't so, tell me why I live like this
Po' than a motherfuckers, but I still give like I'm rich
I promise trying to make it to heaven, is hard as hell
Especially now, when all I receive is pictures and mail
Motherfuckers was plotting on me, just to get me out the way
You them ride or die niggaz, I use to fuck with everyday
I appreciate y'all, for turning your backs
Once I was alone, all my poverty turned into stacks

[Hook x2]

[Z-Ro:]
If you look me in my eyes, you will find no emotion
The reason why I pass my homies up, and keep on coasting
Cause life has been hard, and they ain't make it no better
Making a mockery out of Joseph Mcvey, for lack of cheddar
But now I make the world, pay me jewels and riches
Remember when I gave a fuck, about you niggaz and bitches
But when I was doing bad, I couldn't get up out the pit's hand
Couldn't even spend the night, when I didn't have a spot to live in
I barely had enough scratch, for a dime sack and a cigar
To the world, I was just another nothing ass nigga
But I made it out the ghetto, in the nick of time
Right before I let my Z-Ro haters, see me lose my mind
It's a different ball game, now I'm in the major leagues
No longer have to be dreaming, just to see me play with G's
I know my haters, can't stand me
Cause everyday they homeboys and homegirls jam me, I'm loving it

Yeah Ro, I think today a lovely day
No vest, but my glock 40 tucked away
I use to hustle yay, and watch for the one time
Now I'm caked up, cause I spit punch lines
My grandpa, had to show me how to be a man
I use to watch him hustle hard, just to get a grand
I got a plan to come up, and get mo' cheddar
I know you mad, cause my Benz got a lil' leather
I'm a go-getter, stacking my paper high
I told Z-Ro when I met him, nigga I'ma ride
We fuck them niggaz heads up, when this shit drop
Cause y'all other niggaz, fucking up hip-hop
I can't stop I won't stop, till I'm gone
To all my niggaz locked up, I hope y'all come home

I look around, God blessed me with great stuff

Cause I can't find nothing to bitch about, even though I'm low on bread
And my partna Duke called me, and said he was coming over
You know what that mean, them boys out the Clover ain't never sober
Ding-dong Lil' Flip, Big Shasta and Den Den
This look like a gangsta party to me, come on come in then
We know we got a lot of haters, but we ain't tripping
Cause we living how we wanna, live daily smoking and sipping
When you see us out in public, we got dime pieces with us
And we look like we chilling, but it's four or five pieces with us
So chill homie, for real homie
Cause you don't wanna die, and I don't wanna kill homie
But I will homie I ride for Clover Geez, just like I ride for A. B. N.
By sneaking up on the opposition, at any event any place they in
Except for right now, cause all I wanna do is lay back
In a 300 on 22's, or the living room inside a Maybach

It was too many cheats, ain't nobody wanna follow

I'm one of the few, Houston rappers with a home man
Fifteen thousand square feet, bitch nigga
Now that's the real definition, of a rich nigga
Crocodile Air Force Ones, blue and gold
I'm chilling, but if I got a problem you'll know

[Z-Ro:]
I'm living better now, the Gucci sweater now
And that '71 Cadillac on swangas, hold a baretta down
Laws already hate us, cause we young black men
Especially cause we rappers, with tons of stacks to spend
Haters do what they can, kings of the South do what they wanna do
The drank is purple the pistol is chrome, and the marijuana blue
In the county we wear orange, and state jail is white
We don't rack up we act up, all motherfucking night

And will murder anyone of you snitches, run up on me
But my grandmother didn't raise a killer, she raised up a Christian
But the fact that I was already down, and people kept kicking
Made me crazy, that's why I got no love for nobody lately
And I told y'all once before, none of my weapons have a safety

I greet the Father, on my knees
With a bowed head and a humbled heart, my conversation is have mercy on me please
I just wanna be happy, will it come to bad
Fresh out of my mind been 27 years, and every day I've seen is sad
Even though I've tried till I've cried, I can't even stand
Feels like I've died a thousand times, but just can't make it man
Ain't nothing different about me, doing dirt
Except I've never crept up on a come up, maybe that's why the hustling hurts
I remember just like it was yesterday, I'm 16
Can't find no love can't find no peace, I wonder what it means
Could it be because, I didn't choose the devil all the time
I became an outcast to the hood, restricted to my rhyme
Why couldn't I just live my life, without my talent making danger
Jealousy is now state jail, from friends that turned to strangers
They hate me, I don't understand why
I swear I never seen a man cry, till it was my own eye

[Z-Ro:]
I'm 21, and think I finally got a grip on life
And all bills paid apartment, a step-son and a step-wife
But without a vehicle, it's kinda hard to get around
If I got weed I ride for free, if not my partners let me down
So now I'm loving to be one deep so much, I'm hating people
Lookin at everybody, even babies like they Satan people
Nobody understand me, everybody's tripping with me
Wonder why when I gotta ride, were none of my people flipping with me
Too many haters, trying to take a player off his game
Not trying to be ballerific, I'm just trying to have some thangs
They're just like crabs in a bucket, these people pull me down
If I didn't have so many obstacles, think where I could be now
On mtv or bet, or in some magazine
Instead I'm stressing, hooked on codeine headed to tragedy
Sometimes I think, it's better just to die
Because I never seen a man cry, till it was my own eye

12 albums strong looking for do', but yet I'm still po'
Now I done had and I done lost, and I done had again
On the verge of suicide, I deeply wish I had a friend
But even still a good samaritan, is Z-Ro's way
And with that Christian attitude, I caught a homeboy case
I done took too many blows, a punching bag is how I feel
The deep depression starts to set, sanity's outta here
I start my mission, trying to find my faith
Cdc number four in name, I'm feeling oh so helpless in this place
I want revenge, it's heavy on my mind
But Aunt Sandra say don't fight evil with evil, try to relax and do your time
I heard a voice, and felt there wasn't no need in acting up
Realized I wasn't at peace with God, and had to patch it up
Hopin that blessings, fall out of the sky

I reside on cuts cause having money is a must
Give me the issue or get touched the scuffling up
Fuck with the raw like a cut, cause I hit too hard
Radio stations don't play cause I spit too hard
I know they hate me everyday, and I ain't quit so far
But if you cross the line, ak is gone hit your car

[Chorus]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the throwdest of them all
Cause you know my name it's Z-Ro the crooked
Z-Ro the Mo City don it ain't over it just begun
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the throwdest of them all
Cause you know my name it's Z-Ro represent the third coast
Let my coedine settle and have a toast

[Z-Ro]
I'm a geurilla that's after the scrilla, I cop glocks
I'm the top knotch, body armored like Shaq done blocked shots
Dropping cops cause they crooked, I'm the loud now
Posted on the corner selling raw now
Looking for them people keep an open eye

And if I see the jackers never hesitate I got to open fire
Act just like a live wire, retalliation is a must
Rock and buy these bezzels and then bust
Geniva watch telling me it's time to ball
Get in the line until I make it to the front and then it's time to fall
But if I ever fall off, just fall back behind the scene
To accept it, catch me up and sit calm and big screens

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro}
When I roll I roll one deep, I never stop wrecking these H-Town streets
And ain't nobody holding me down I'm a roll, I'm rolling
If you didn't know Southside still holding, folding
Big lemon faces, got real money cause I catch cases
Sipping on ski tastes, and I'ma lean in private or public places
Milicated refreshness, keep my mind at ease
Trying to reach another level keep me climbing trees
Coming smoke out my nose, bald faded minus before
Keep it gangsta, got groupie hoes striking a pose
But see they ain't getting chose, or catch me tipping my dogs
I need a independent thug chick, launder money and drug shit
I'm the boss hog, ain't nobody hogging me over harder
Soft then I'm off in the funk in my roller

And you know, I really miss my nigga screw-you

If you haters guaranteed, that we gon do you
Cause I really miss my dog, I really miss my dog
I really miss my dog, I really miss my dog

[Z-Ro]
You use to come, and scoop me
In the sharp, from the trailer park in Hiram-Clarke
Rolling blue over blades, daily many sherms we sparked
A lil' old playa steady fucking, with yellow to dark women
And we caught the munchies, had to hit that Horse Chicken
And when everybody said fuck me, you stood next to me
Gave me some game, then he told me I was S. You. C.
My nigga never had a hateful bone, in his body
And all he said was yes, he never said no to anybody
I ain't never, had a friend like him
I'm feeling vacated by destiny, wish I was in the wind like him
He took me to the Kappa for the first time, plus the car show
Late night ripping up the mic, and sipping bar slow
If I was doing bad, he would chunk me some ends
And if I was depressed, my dog'd get me laughing again
Telling me that I would make it, and he'd be behind me
Now every November 16th, niggas can't find me

[Hook:]

What would I be without screw, the only who ever showed me the way
To get paid, for spitting rhymes and wrecking mics on the stage
At the same time, the one who kept me keeping composure
Now I'm losing it tripping quick, with a chip on my shoulder
I remember living when we and you, would come and scoop us
Telling us one day we would get big, when nobody knew us
It was destined for you to shine, now the world Screwed up
We gon rep it to the full, everyday we blued up
Everything been feeling different, it'll never be the same
Screw I promise it be hard, but I'm still holding  down the name
We the team and now the Click, is number one in the Dirty South
We them street, them other niggas faking and selling out
That ain't right, but God knows we keeping your name alive
Niggas fly, they seen the opportunity when you died
Really though, these niggas blinding people with the fog
I ain't changed and I'ma rep you, and I really miss you dog

It's the G-M, and S. L. A. B.
And your boy Billy Cook, repping that bmg

Even when you pulled up, in the candy blue
On chops, even made hating ass niggas have to give you props
Because you gave back, to the streets
You gave back to the hood, and now we miss you my nigga

Feel me, we really miss you my dog

A lot of niggaz, wanna see me in my grave (more or less

Go to war, in the midst of gun play (more or less)
Only taking head shots, (it ain't no need to have a vest)

When I roll I roll solo, with my 4-4 on the side of me for company
Wishing a nigga and his click, would think about jumping me
Six enexchangable clips, seventeen bullets in each
That's a hundred and twelve reasons, a whole street could be deceased
Right when I was trying to change, fellas start playing games
Brought me back to reality, my sanity's now insane
I be busting for nothing homie, I'm addicted to shots
Blame my hood, cause that's just the way it is on my block
I got a bad attitude, cause I'm use to beefing
They'll never take me alive, the reason for no sleeping
So when a nigga come after me, I'ma hit him where it hurt
I'll let him make it, but his mama and daddy gon see a hearse
Fuck a driveby, I want him to look me in my eyes
Let him call Junior on his mobile, just to say goodbye
So call my name out, and watch how everybody run for cover
Cause they know I'm a heartless motherfucker, until I die

So when them niggaz, try to get me on the creep no
They getting merked, in they fresh white T oooh

Get that white from Poppy, and that green from Poncho

Much love to my nigga Trae, good looking out

See me with the Mac-11, sending fifty through your glass
Am I losing my mind, I don't know and I don't really give a damn
But these motherfuckers, gon know who I am
Plus Dinkie shot a kite, and told me watch out for you hating ass niggaz
Run up on me, I'll be putting you in a grave ass niggaz
Now I'm riding, with my super entourage of hot shells
And if they catch up wit ya, garunteed they bringing hell
Let me take you to, another level of mind
To get a closer look at death, before I flatten your line
You done it this time, and ain't no way you getting away
I put this on me and my son, it won't be safe where you stay

That nigga don't wanna see me, with my black mask
But that's alright, cause I got a scheme for his black ass
See I believe, in creeping with reacons
I know where your girlfriend stay bitch, you be there every weekend
Riding up in a Regal, D-Eagle under the seat
I'm about to put six of them thangs, up under your meat
You got a hole in your neck, you need IV's to eat
I gotta show you the real way, of greeting niggaz with heat
I pull a black Mac up out the pack, walking from that Cadillac
Sipping on a low O-E, fired up like a battlecat
Niggaz don't wanna take it there, with Lil' Boss
I be fucking with B.D.'s, bitch I can get ya lost

[Lil' B]
I'm sick and tired of you niggaz underestimating, and thinking I'm fake
You'll be the first example, of catching a slug to the chest plate
Break niggaz for fun, when they try to use guns
I can throw hands, but you niggaz so quick to try to run
To the trunk and wanna dump, old chump ass nigga
You'll get found, floating off in a swamp ass nigga
My click killas, and I'm the young guerilla of the pack
The true definition, of making niggaz back-back
Fuck a size, I'll demolish 'em all small or tall
It don't matter, bet your bitch ass fall
More or less so go on plex, if you think you're ready
Buck shots'll stretch your flesh, like spaghetti

[Jay'Ton]
I guess you thought that it was over, when you pulled the 12 gauge
And I won't get no rest, until I see you in your grave
Last time to start checking when I hit the block, looking for cats
And since we playing dirty, you just might catch four in your back
Nonstop, I bet you niggaz finna know about me
I'm only 18, but still I'm classified as a G
I run with the best, them niggaz that'll leave you wrapped up
In a black truck, you don't want the heat clapped up
Better back up, nigga I'm a asshole
Everything in this camp, surrounded by the cash flow

It's a trip, to see how all these people scream my name
Cause I could remember whole lot of em, that said I'd never make it in the rap game
Look at me now though, I got cars and cash
And since I'm able to say fuck regular weed, I get hydro by the bag
I'm the same nigga white tennis shoes, blue jeans and a white t-shirt
24/7 all day and night, around the clock that's how we work
I could give a fuck, about these niggaz wanting beef
They been muted by my paper chase, interrupt me you might come up deceased
Bitch I'm a product, of the streets

And even though you had a nigga, you said I could spend the night

Hell yeah I was attracted to ya baby, and you know that
I still feel like we look good, together on a Kodak
But a lot of bullshit, been floating round in the air
I 'sposed to said some disrespectful shit, now you hate a playa
And to that skinny bitch with the rigid gold, you need to shut the hell up
Tal'n bout I made you suck my dick for a ride, yeah I made your throat swell up

And tend to your cousin, even though you had problems of your own
I appreciate you my nigga, it's deeper than rap
Somebody else, would of wanted to see me fall off track
See I remember, when I couldn't afford to get a wing dinner
Put my two dollars with yours, and we split a wing dinner
Doing bad, even though we had our albums selling
The distribution company was stacking, but they wasn't telling
Us steady robbing us blind, with no money flowing
Then we got independent, and we could see our money growing
So maybe now, we could afford to give our people change
Witnessing nothing but better days, and

Now when I say no more pain, let me explain
Cause God will certainly, fence to happy that can't be changed
I use to cry when my friends died, but then I realized
I'm the one, who's still facing hard times
I recall, fiending for my last breath
Cause I was struggling, and still ain't got what I'm suppose to have yet
As far as these women, I've been through so many make-up's just to break up
I'd rather be all alone, when I wake up
No more pain, I'm not insane I'm just hurting
But I been looking for feel good's, 27 years and still searching
If it ain't one thang, it's another
I'm living on memories, when I use to get along with my brother
Since I never been, too much of a man to cry
I shed tears, like it's a nine to five
So to relieve, pressure from my brain
I try not to give a damn about anything, so I can feel

Damn, I hope this state of mind'll never leave again
I wanna see my nigga screw get to breathe again
And wanna see Dinky and my nigga Donny break free again
On the block, never thinkin 'bout Plix
Twenty-fo' years of mine I've been blitzed
Dawg, don't you get it twisted
Cause 19 years of those have been stress
Never thought that I'd see this time
And it ain't no way that I'ma let it get by
Ain't no lie, deep down inside
Just to hold it close it wanna make me cry
No mo' drama, likin no laws
No mo' jail, no more collect calls
No mo' hate from these roach-ass niggaz
And my dawgs on the block'll ball 'til we fall
Plus Peewee woulda never got locked
Plus Greedo woulda never got shot
Plus Mello woulda still been here
With a white Kangol about to body rock the pen
Misty, then the rest of the click like
Full speed then runnin without a red light
Whole life I'll be one of a kind
Go deep in the wind I promise I got my head right
And I hate it's gon' be like this
I wonder why everything come to me like this
And if only fo' one night I finally get my smile
Lord, I don't wanna leave like this

It'll be nice to have Emo and Jody and ll back
My nigga Best and his big brother E. Roy Love
Dem people ain't never comin back
But if only for one night
My nigga could make a decision he shoulda made
Make it where the situation turned out another way
And ain't a day go by
I don't wish I didn't have to miss my momma
This ain't livin my nigga this just drama
If only for the night when the storm'll live calmer
Cause seem like they wanna give a lifetime sentence
To a nigga with a pistol and a pound of marijuana
Wish it was legal to be in public wit'cha eyes red
I've seen a lot of B. I. Cases go fed
Got pulled over, no seatbelt on the shoulder
Let to a 70 year stand and coda
If only for the dead nigga
Didn't have to wait to make a safe walk to the sto'
Just to get his niggaz and a six-pack [?]
But there never been a cakewalk to the sto'
Fuck around and see the head concussion
If the hood decide you gotta fake walk to the sto'
They fully fronted to everybody with animosity
Bitches'll take 'em 'fore they walk to the sto'
A nigga from the Southside, and a nigga from the Northside
And a nigga from the Eastside
Could all get along with each other, like we knew each other mother
No reason to wanna take our own lives
By losin a son, losin a daughter, losin a child
I'm battered by life, too rude to smile
I liked it better when I used to smile
If only fo' one mo' night

I haven't smoked a sherm in 27 days
When I'm under pressure, I feel it's necessary to blaze
Looking at my life as if I wasn't here, why the fuck that picture be so clear
Since my nigga died, I done slowed down on drank
But I'm right back heavy on beer
Stained finger tips and lips, cause smoking come with murders
Fiending for heaven but I wonder, if I'm worthy
Please God forgive your servant, and your man child
But the fact that he got Jordans, and a nigga like me
Grow po' wings was bullshit, so I ran wild
Wasn't I good enough, to get some shit like that
It was only a grade, you know I didn't deserve to get hit like that
My life my life, falls under the wicked and shife
I gotta pay my rent, therefor my partnas might be targets tonight
Even though I'm grown fucked up childhood, keep fucking my dome
Fuck around and front, like I'm gon
Buy your work, and straight leave on your song
If a nigga take me out it's all good, cause I've been fiending to leave
My life is fucked up, and I'm tired of having to drink to a G

Woke up with a dead body, in a bed befo'
Don't ask me why, only talk to Z-Ro

They front like they your homies, but they bury motherfuckers
Dog I'm going through it daily, fiending for a killa to take me out
What am I living for, nothing but a record label huh break me out
I'm so sick and tired Lord knows, I'm sick and tired of this pain
But steady keeping the world, I'm no preaching through the rap game
The most evilest niggas nightmares, of my fondest dream
Cause death rules everything around me and the cream, is a cup of lean
Having a case of flashbacks, of the good time
But then I remember, it wasn't no good time
Just poverty stricken, and kicking it in the hood time
24 and I still can't think, from Guerilla Maab to Point Blank
To Big Moe to Z-Ro, and still no bank
I gotta be paying dues, for my niggas that lost they life in the game
Cause the more I struggle for happiness, nothing but pain

Dorothy Marie or mama, I've been stressed, learning to live
A life of misfortune, my feet have been so swollen from my quest
I'd like to find the meaning of sick and tired

Even my friends are fake, that's why I'm quick to ride
I'm the shit bitch, I know you smell the odor
Them other two niggas ain't bitches, and it's had a chip on my shoulder
I love my cousin and my brother mayn, but see it ain't nothing but drama
When you live in a slum, across the street from the gutter mayn
I'm 'pose to be a rap star, dig these blues a nigga ain't
Seen the states in two months, I'm in the kitchen as a crack star
What a wonderful way, to spend my fucking album release
A promotional show, and I must get do' nigga I got ounces to cheese
Ounces of green, I got mouths to feed so I need G's
Plus my own shit the T. V. In the living room, is Mexican D's
Gotta be paying dues, for my niggas that lost they life in the game

Do that thang with your mouth, and I'll be hard all over
Look how they jock me, when I'm rocking the stage
On that X and I'ma hit it, like I'm cocking a gauge
I'm like em with hair down they back, or rocking the braids
They love my dick, and want me to stay in they cot for the day

I want to be the driver but I continue to ride
Will the game recognize me as the best
I go from home to the dome
If I'm the king why they don't give me my throne

[Z-Ro]
Living in the passenger side, a way of life
We're in cheves today, because the murderers pay tonight
They tell me I'm a profit when I'm pimping my pen
But my immediate surrounders got me living in sin
I put my faith in a fifty dollar bottle of drink
Using my focus choking smash on the throttle and thank
The lord, for giving me another way to get paid
King of the motherfucking ghetto where these guns get sprayed
Whether I'm fucking with a bitch, I'm breaking benz see lunch
But it's either that or you can't point us casualties when we dump
Street pain is a motherfucker guard me without a dot
It's like a murder scene without a victims hotter, ? Selmzyne?
Like my face can't place at the scene of the crime
Multiple shots never saw me but saw the beam of my nine
So rather living as a thug until they give me my credit
Cause I'm the throwdest baby don't you forget it, meanwhile

Living in the passenger side, I want to to push a 6 double O
But poverty refuse to let me drive
I wonder why drug dealers and killers live plush
Hoping niggas have a tendency to give up
Do I have to sell my soul, forever living in sin
But is that the price I got to pay to take a spin in the benz
I'd rather stay a poor nigga cause the fire gone burn
No hesitation through my dirt and then my tires gone turn
See I'm living on the passenger side, visualize
I'm coming bombing a condo with black lacquer inside
Took a long time coming, but I'm finally made
I wait for me and my niggas and now we finally paid
Yeah life is gravy, but I want right to the throne
Cause rather reggae, R&B or rap I write to the song
Oh jiggy bitches ain't nothing to me, I slap them down
Real niggas move around cause it ain't nothing to see

(Chorus - 2x)

[Z-Ro]
Living in the passenger side, I've been incarcerated
Plenty of times, never once did they let me slide
I guess it's because of the dark skin I have
Ain't no telling when I release the black Mac 10 I have
Is it a hundred mile motherfucking animal
Gasoline around your residence cause it's flammable
Genocide, I get banned on that, I stand on that
You'll catch me by surprise baby cause I planned on that
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
My black skin is a murdering bust the fucking door
Now if I had three wishes, what would be the first
To bring back all my people that done rolled in a hears
Say hello to my mother we up in paradise
Well reality is full of leaches and parasites
I keep it real with the game, so I report what I see
And tell the chairs of the passenger plus the driver seat nigga

Never could get a job, but needed some mo' change
C. D. 's wasn't selling, because I had no name
Nothing but a t-shirt, no piece no chain
Too many times, I was ready to give up
Run up in a bank, and say this is a stick-up
Put my pain on records, and record sales picked up
The tears I done shed, led me to the big bucks

Swear to God they holding in the world, but ain't nobody seeing dividends
That ain't the life of me, I had to get it

Everytime a playa, try to get his pockets swoll

When will they realize, God is running with me ain't no stopping me
Probably never will, so keep on trying
You can clip my wings, but I see happiness in the sky so I'ma keep on flying
Until I find, a rested place
So many battle scars, blood on my chest and face
Whether I'm working or rapping 24/7, me and Satan be scrapping
He want my soul, but I ain't gon let it happen
Even if I lose my life, trying to chase my dream

Don't hate, don't hate yeah

Playa don't hate me, hate the game

Playa don't hate me, hate the game
Cause you see me coming down up on your slab, chopping blades

[Z-Ro]
Playa don't hate me hate the game, ain't got no time
To be out here bullshitting, I'm out here trying to make some change
Be solo twisting I'm a Mo City soldier, I thought I told ya
Roll with us, or get your ass rolled over
See we all about our feddy, pulling up on chrome
Nigga for real ask G. I. N., or you can ask Chad Jones
Baby we Presidential playas showing up, all these gon mind
Everyone of us diaomoned down, bet you all them hoes gon shine
We living lovely sipping Bubbly, all the cars are foreign
Ain't no jackers we barring, cause we ready for warring
I'm the king like Tarzan, but mine is swinging on a vine
We swanging on 84's, and chopping in a line
Houston Texas the origin, of a baller's paradise
It's going down, I can smell it in the air tonight
So when you see us pulling up, dressed looking like a million
Balling permanent, keep our figgas changed like chameleon

[Hook:]

[Mr. Gott Damn]
Niggaz be hating for no reason, ain't no secret how I'm living
Escalade switch screens, is how you see your boy dipping
Blowing weed on the freeway, not giving a fuck
Getting my dick sucked doing eighty, bout to hit me a cut
20 inches of chrome, keep they mouth wide open
Toking cash and hoping, they can shine like me
Get out and put it down, and then grind like me
Leaving them haters and bitch niggaz, behind me
I hit the block, representing paper
4-4 safety off for them violators, and fake playas
Gott Damn be like go, too hot to hold
The weight up on my ice, keep me looking real swoll
So don't be mad when I show up, smoke something and po' up
I told you motherfuckers, what's gon happen when I blow up
Now hold up, I got one more thang to mention
I'm riding out Presidential, swinging lanes on a mission

[Hook - 2x]

[Lyrical 187]
I got my first piece of ass, at 13
And I prolly done ran up in every chick, that you done seen me with
I'm associated with playas, with green and shit
Bad bitches in Jeeps and Lexus trucks, and shit
I'm that nigga see come and get, on blunts weights and shit
Serving head in the parking lot, giving me fits
Now if you knew I meant your Ms., would you make me kill you person
Or would you deal with this broad, that got you into this shit
Would you peep the situation, or go crazy and start tripping
Like pulling off your shirt, and tossing your jewelry in the dirt
I'ma hit you where it hurt, and wreck shop like bad cops
On niggaz in the ghetto, for working they block
So stop watching me, with all that animosity
Cause your baby mama's spending, your earned dollas on me
Sad shit for two partna, it's all on you
Don't be mad at the playa, hate the rules

Up in the turning lane, with the doors wide open
We serious bout our habits, we never be choking
Catch us chain smoking, and violently choking
Why don't you wanna light up the blunt, that's in your hand
I'll pat ya with the 4-4, that is for sure man
Ain't no more breaking a leaf, ain't nothing but that dro man
Mess around and get too tipsey, you'll be on the floor man
Popping up, until I feel about as strong as four man
We don't smoke rocks but they are over our hand
Remember back in the day, I use to be a poor man
Now I'm gifted and sipping daily, with jewelry frozen

See I don't really talk it, I just live it
I don't say I'm gonna, I just get it
Give a playa the ball, he 'pose to run with it
But these niggas rapping gossip, like some dumb bitches
Like how he get that Benz, how he get that dough
Yeah I got some bread, but wanna get some more
See I went from grinding, all in front the liqour store
To a made man, I'm top knotch nigga role
And you could do it too, this should inspire you
To get ya change, get out the game and retire fool
Before these streets fuck around, and retire you

My mouth piece armed with invisible sets and trillion cuts
This boy throwed, I thought they told you nigga Presidential code
You can see it, when I'm hauling in my load
My Escalade, all work no play

Y'all know me, talking about this shife ass life that we live
Brothers killing brothers, sisters killing sisters
Fathers killing sons, god damn

[Z-Ro]
Let me continue by saying, that I don't love these hoes
My only love is found Ro, dumping optimoes
In an attempt to get lifted, trying to separate the real from the wicked
Be grown ain't as easy, as we thought it was is it
Nigga but you can visit me in prison, or keep in touch by the letters
Just seeing my partnas face, will make me feel better
Cause this earth is cursed, so I'm identified by pain in my verse
And will the final face I see be a nurse, for what its worth
I wanna die while I'm sleeping, not while I'm creeping
Because my closest homies, might be into grim reaping
Hard for me to believe, that I became the man I am
Went from bible study to moving grams, on a digital scale
I make mail, cause in yale I sell
Guaranteed to make a profit, never fail
Cause they run and tell more money for me, cause I wanna be able
Not to ball, but to keep food on the able, believe that

[Chorus:]
Real niggas keep it real with God, keep your head up
Stay down on your knees, cause this life is hard
I know you don't wanna live in jail, for living shife
Hoping you might receive a kite, from your child and your wife
Real niggas keep it real with God, keep your head up
Stay down on your knees, cause this life is hard
I know you don't wanna live in hell, for living shife
Or in the house of the Lord, all the days of your life

[Z-Ro]
Remember me and T, I still got love
But somebody been looking for me, so that's the reason I got slugs
Loaded up in a twelve gauge, holding it close when I walk around corners
Trying to stay sober, to be on my P's and Q's so no marijuana
But if its destiny for me to fail, I'd rather
Kick it in Heaven, and leave the jealous in this hell
I'm built to last so I'm gon blast, with intentions to kill
Because we living under the devil, for real
God don't love the world, Eddie Davis only son to save him
If it was me, I would of told my father pop I can't fade it
Because the world is so hateful (hateful)
Scandalous, conniving and ungrateful (ungrateful)
And if it ain't a nigga from the streets, then look to your family
Cause they gon tip with you, wait for you to get paid and try to sip with you
But y'all ain't drinking up out my cup, cause that will leave a poisonous
Stain
Its hard enough to keep my pistol from my brain, maintain

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
Rest in peace Grand Pappy Mafioso, day before yesterday
Another statistic, cause somebody let the ak spray
You know its hard for me to deal with, but I know what
I gotta do, get something to make them hatas blood spill with
Kill me if you can, then you's the better man
But I'm telling you right now, I'm a motherfucking veteran
Gotta spill them niggas be talking about, I'm about to pick this nigga
Gotta watch these hoes, because they skinless ass dickless niggas
And I don't wanna die, so if I have too I'ma blast on sight
Better take cover, because I'm coming for your ass tonight
And even still I try to keep my composure
But I find myself, drowning in codeine and the doja
I'll forever be thugging and mean mugging, while I'm clutching a fat nine
Eager to make a motherfucker, flat line
But I never start nothing with niggas, I just end it with a bang
When you do dirt, you get dirt mayn

[talking:]
Hell yeah nigga, ay yo

[Z-Ro:]
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class
At dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas

[Hook: x2]
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads

[P. O. P.:]
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit
I vividly, are-E-M-E-M-B-E-are
Craig up in the E-are, bloody getting cpr
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me
Me P. O. P., so many forgot bout
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

[Bun B:]
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

Plus my relationship with my friends ain't no good
Therefore I roll with Katie cause she's a bad bitch
One squeeze ten motherfuckers bleed and need a casket
No need to reload, I promise I'ma drop 'em all
Screamin ""Remember me?"" as motherfuckers stop and fall
Ain't no remorse, ain't no love in my life cycle
Cause when your family out to get you it be twice as vital

So I'm paranoid and trigger happy until I leave

If I gotta pull a trigger I'ma shoot to kill
Not tryin to hurt ya, I'ma try to leave you stiff as steel
Cause I ain't tryin to watch my back when I'm out in public
So when I blast that's yo' ass you went out and dusted
But I'm not tryin to send the wrong message to the kids
I'm just sayin even if you young they'll stil split ya wig
And I'd be wrong if I told you to let a nigga do ya
I practice what I preach and ride with much more then a Ruger
I guess the Lord'll deal with me at the end of time
I'm not a killer but motherfuckers gon' respect my mind
That's on my mama trust, nobody but friends to my kin
For the slightest disrespect I'll put ya spirit in the wind

So I take what I need, and seek forgiveness of the Lord

But when I open fire, seem like they be helping me out
And not a nan-nother one of these fellas, be still bumping
Clear the parking lot, ain't nobody left but I'm still dumping

I don't love see war this bitch, I only love my god damn wealth
Behind respect I go to war, cause I'm a fool in this bitch
I'm ready to work I'm a mechanic, I got my tools in this bitch
From Mo City to Port Arthur, we all underground kings
Meet me in Mo City, and I'll show you what underground mean
I got a rifle size hand cannon, gat in the club
Murder your ass tonight, tomorrow I'll be back in the club for real

Trying to get it baby

It's the same everyday, everyday is the same
Running up and down the block, chasing change
And off a million faces, there be a seven year case
So we gotta be careful, when we slang

[Z-Ro]
It's the same everyday, I gotta get up and get it
Trying to keep the lights on, and avoid getting evicted
Cause the landlord tripping, want me out of the house
Thinking it's nothing but that hard, coming out of the house
And it is I can't get a job, cause I'm an ex convict
All day I sell crack, not with but the bomb shit
My spot hotter, than a motherfucking stove
But if I can't recognize, your face shop close
I got uppers, downers, whatever you need
I got them wholesales, for niggas that wanna be
And when the drought come in, Z-Ro gon go to the stash
I'm in and out of season hustling, addicted to cash
I don't hustle for the fame, I don't hustle for the shine
Cause that's where a alot of motherfuckers, be doing time
Not me, I gotta stay free
Cause if I'm locked up, can't nobody pay me

[Mussilini]
Gotta feel me mama, I ain't trying to balla
I ain't gotta follow, plus I'm on the hunt for the dolla
Going through the drama, daily
Cause you realize, that the street pays me
What lately you been giving in, to the sinning of your kid
In and in women friends, getting trained in your den
Yep since daddy left, and granddaddy left
I been left with the stress, of the shelf
At the age of sixteen, my judgment was afreered
And for my 18th birthday, they sent the blue wern
I mean the blue warrant, my past pride's current
While my attitude's a middle finger, they don't know what I've endured
It's hell riding candy no license, uninsured
Pulled over to the curb, where's the weed and the syrup
But I'm staying on my note, yep perfecting is with time
Since I'm a boss hap, I use paper, pen in mine

[Hook - 2x]

[Mussilini]
We got rich white guys on heroine, snorting
We go to jail for stones, but they can leagallize abortion
Extortion, money laundering and inbroan
Who the hell gon do time for jobs, lost at World Com
This year America's fucked up, D-Black and Jono got time
I'm grabbing a phone, it cost a dime
I'm bout to put this land in line, y'all don't
Feel going, y'all feel bills and crime
So here's my mind, plus a toilet for a dookie
Seven C sale, Mussilini best boochie
Ignorance is bliss, so you better call Calvin
Shit I can't duck fly, for the whole damn album
My life is a near, and turbulence is here
Body full of wounds, I think them folks got the spill
The land of the lost, but I'm lost in this land
Trying to make a future out this corn in my hand, man

And running, from the scene cause Z-Ro done start busting
No Longer, serving fiends, I'm serving the drug dealers
Affiliated with killers and multiple blood spillers
A nigga from out the 4, you know I, don't sleep
If a nigga don't work then a nigga, don't eat
So a nigga is gone hustle, a nigga is gone grind
Watch a young nigga shine, bitch this world is mine
I wanted to ball in the mix, I turned my crumbs into brick
Out of town, dump u-haulers turning east bigga niggas in and out
With one callers, we shot callers, and ballas and 20 inch blade crawlers
Big body, tinted up, Mazzaratti Impala
We prowlers on the scene, we go our mug on mean
It use to be sipping fours but now it's jugs of that codeine
Quarter pines be puffing but it ain't nothing but grass
Now how you love this bezeltine and all this wood on my dash
All this starch on my ass, and all this money in my stash
And how you love the way your hoes get all this dick in they ass
We Screwed Up entertainers, hoe ass nigga restrainers
Assembly line in the kitchen pickens in proper containers
We real niggas, not ill niggas, polos rap more than Hilfigers
We in this rap game to get mill niggas, running up on us you get killed niggas

Staying crunk, blazing blunts, jamming Z-Ro funk
Keep mind on money working my hundred got these boys popping trunks
Screwed Up baller in the mix, trying to turn these crumbs into some bricks
Sideways on switches we gone sip, drinking on drink and smoking dip
Living my life in slow motion, riding high sipping potion
Bring wet on fly like the ocean, got a Screwed Up playa just coasting
With mind at ease blowing trees, stacking g's, swanging threes
We coming down watch us clown in these H-Town streets
Popped up and shining and blind you, fifth wheels reclining they minding
It's about that time Screwed Up take over, wrecking boys skills in rhyming
Six figga niggas and drug dealers pimping pens for our scrilla
Sipping drink and smoking killer, the coast, fly figgas
Pad blessed and chopped records Screwed Up, Houston Texas
We coming down, looking good gripping wood like some veterans
Money making Screwed Up baller blade crawling, shot calling
Made living missing Christmas stacking ends never falling

Big Jett hollering at all my partnas, youknowI'msaying

We gone ball till we fall
knocking down Fassacci at the mall
Everytime I sip my cup gone stand tall
got a wide ass phone when I make my call
White folks be tripping on salary cap
that's why your Prime Co. phone tapped
Studied the dope game for the rap
now cause of my skin I travel the map
From stage to stage to stage to stage
making a loot with a loose leaf page
I got on my knees and I say my praise
and repent everytime I misbehave
You want to get me for my riches
better mind your bidness, I minded for you
Fuck around and touch your brain I ball
with a mug Z-Ro gone shine for you
I call the shot, cause I cop the clock
everytime it get hot I drop the top, or
Bunny hop up out the cream of the crop
smash on the gas and never stop for cops
Ball till I fall, that's what I'm gone do
screen in my phone screaming who you do
I bleed the block with a hand full of rocks now
I got a cassette and as long as you
Talk about the fame, bout the struggle
talk about how long it took a nigga to bubble
Since I call the shots I don't call them off
hoes flock around me like a first time huddle
Don't have to kiss, I don't have to fuck
I just pull out my dick bitch you could suck
Or ball till I fall, and if I ever fall down
I'ma rescore and bounce right back up

Of course I'm thankful for another day, my Lord I can't lie
But everytime I wake up, seem like one of my people gotta die
Anthrax poisoning, Hussein and them blew up the Trade Center
Summer, Fall, Spring, Winter, people in the projects getting thinner
Barely enough government cheese, left to feed the rats
But we gotta get it how we live, and how we live is selling crack
How we live is kicking doors, how we live is pimping whores
How we live is what we do, so we don't live like this no more
How we live is wrapping em up, shipping em out wait to receive
An overloaded Houston Texas, niggaz make they own bleed
Every night another murder scene, that could of been prevented
But the truth is we most def, and the last soul tormented
Every now and then I duck my head, up in the sunday service
That's the only place where 5-0, won't burst us bust us
Nigga they don't love us, they wanna relocate us to the Penn
We wanna do right, but all we see is sin

In this land, we need you Jesus
Lord have mercy, we need shelter in the time of storm
Uh-huh, well, well, well

Yeah, Rostafar-i help me, help me
All the young picking them, living in a rush just to get wealthy (wealthy)
And in the ghetto, we struggle or we hustle till we bubble
On top, eliminating competition when we buck shot
Don't press that new, but a new clear shot
Fire, fire, fire, fire (fire)
Too many sickness and disease, under attack from overseas
Mighty job me and for God, please come save the day
If I should die before I wake, me leave a blessing for me people today
Mighty job me and for God upon you, take this pain away

Now I lay me, down to sleep
I pray the Lord keep my body, as my enemies creep
Don't wanna be another statistic, living through C. D. 's
Either the graveyard or max. Security, prison you'll see G's
Look at the homie's little girl, she ain't nothing but sixteen
Trying to support three kids, so she stay coming out her jeans
Getting pimped, by somebody that still live with they mama
But that's the only way she know, to get away from all the drama
As for books, the mind is a terrible thing to waste
As for crooks, the nine is a terrible thing to taste
Ask them niggaz that don bit the bullet, but they still here
My nigga we ain't seen God befo', but we still fear
I asked him for a blessing, and he sent me Eugene
Now I got two cars, a crib and everyday I dress clean
But it ain't no love, they wanna put a nigga in the Penn
I wanna do right, but all I see is sin

Packing a click-clacker, just in case somebody act up
Back up and give me space, cause I can't concentrate
If I ain't blowing sticky, or sipping some skee taste
Chasing that dollar bill, in this life that's too beautiful
Niggaz that got killed, they dreams'll be fulfilled
Still I can't cope, without finding some of that dope
On the hottest block of my town, hollin' fuck the po-po
On 4-4's I'm still swanging, banging up out the lot
Heated with plastic glocks, what you boys talking bout
It don't stop till I'm gone, and my heart stop beating
Until then I'm thugging, here bobbing and weaving
Beating and getting money, supporting my own habit
So bitch stay out my bidness, or I'ma let you have it

So when I say my praises to God, one verse is like a full choir
My every thought is pain, strain and stressing me to death
Everyday is like a rehearsal, that's prepping me for death
I think I'm ready, because this world ain't no friend of mine
Only thing I qualify for, is murder and Penitentiary time
Y'all should of shot me, in the jimmy instead
But I guess they was feeling eachother, to get head in the bed
Here I am, first born torn between heaven and hell
I tell my people so no to dope, but I let it sell
Need to practice my preaching, calling the kettle black
I know I'm on pot before or not, I gotta peddle crack
Ain't nobody got my back, except the laws when they on it
So I be going for broke, demolishing my opponents
Leaving no traces just blood on faces, believe that
Hk I'ma squeeze that, you won't even want be back

Even though I do my best, the only thing I earn is stress
So I, spend most of my days chilling with Mary Jane

I can't focus, I'm losing my mind real fast
Dreaming and fiending for the day, I could make some real cash
Dropping album after album, platinum song after song
But it's like I ain't did nothing, cause the lights ain't on
How can I win, it's like everything I do is a motherfucking sin
It got a nigga, fiending to see my end
All of my friends are fake, they come around when I'm spending cash
But when I'm broke they out the do', with wheels spinning fast
Lonely, daily dodging the devil but he on me
Telling my people fuck him, cause he be working through my homies
Burning bridges, and I don't give a fuck
Remember y'all laughing at me, when I couldn't get a buck
It's all gravy baby, I got bigger hurdles I'm trying to jump over my residence
And my vehicle, is something I dump over
And it might not be much, but it's all I got
So when I paint it, promethazyne is all I pop

I'm on pre-trial now, and I can't smoke no weed
Cause if I catch a dirty, I'm facing T-I-M-E
My first time ever sober, it's fucking with my brain
Got a nigga with an attitude, I can't maintain
If you cross me I'll bring it to you hard, not softly
Living like I'm invincible, one day it's gonna cost me
When it's time to pay up, and I lay up in a grave
Bury me with a fifty sack, and a motherfucking 12 gauge
Hey, no love in my heart
Cause my homies was phony, straight from the motherfucking start
Why couldn't I get a ride, if I ain't have no weed, these motherfuckers
Ain't my people, they gotta be strangers up a reverend breed
So I bless the streets, with my smith-n-wesson
And if you beefing with me nigga, better get your weapon
You better pray that I'm codeine, and I'm just tripping

If I knew then what I'm feeling now, how much shit I go through by
Living my life so recklessly, surprised they didn't kill me
Don't think I didn't try it a couple times, but I surround by
Living even more cautious, and them cats we lost in drive by's
Sitting beside your car at night, at odds I'm able to shoot first
But just pull it out and show it to you, and smack you with it first
Reduced to a comic book, somebody need to throw the book at him
Hit your crib steal your ride, with talons we could shoot at
Look at that, boy use to be in the church choir
What's wrong with him now, he just out there running wild
Can't tell him nothing, boy why you pop up with all that stuff
Why them people, keep knocking at the door at night so much

I'm not trying to have a good time, nothing but feddy that's it
Cause nigga, cash rules everything around me
Without it in my pocket, motherfuckers try to down me
Whenever I try to go get it, the laws surround me
Take away my name give me a number, and take me to the County
A soldier with them party packs, I'm coming out to leave

No socializing with them bitches, never bringing em home
It could be a set up, I get wet up and become a memory
Fuck the whole wide world, it's either them or me
I'm one of them boys with a gun, on the cut late at night
Everybody bring me they soft, because I bake it right
At a playa price, I'm on a money making mission
Never gave no Expedition, side panels full of chickens
Riding high, make sure to do the speed limit

Till I make it to the T-O-P, King of the Ghetto is who Ro be
You better just back up or get smacked up, you fellas really don't know me
A total stranger, man filled with anger
Since busters always tripping, always keep one in the hole
One deep is how I roll, just me and the calico
Trying to beef with Z-Ro, you gotta go you gotta go
Mash the pedal to the floor, let the tommy gun go
I ain't never had no love for a mark, is how it go
Fortune and fame bout to grow, 20 thousand for a show
And it ain't no more regular weed, ain't nothing but do-do and that dro
Ridgemont 4 is what I claim, blue and red but we don't bang
I'll wear my color you wear your color, because it's all about that change
I remain to stay the same, trunk full of bang screens rain
I'm still a Ridgemont hardhead, leaning in niggas brain

[Chorus:] [2x]
Southside, we bomb first when we ride
Swanging on elbows, chopping on choppers that's right
Cause we real, on a mission to get it can't stop
Going platinum, everytime another tape drop

Hoe ass nigga feel that there, Southside
S. You. C. Southsi' for li', ain't no hate to the other side
Nigga we all South of the Third Coast, feel that

And it go down, and it don't stop cause it can't stop
So therefor it won't stop, blades we gone chop
When the laws hit the block, fences we gone hop
Hit the stash spot out, for the glock
Fuck the crooked cops, Z-Ro feel that
We bomb first, when we rid"

Now watch your shoes when you stepping, Maybach with the mink floors
Mr. Bossilinie, cut two eye holes in the beanie
But I'm as quickly as pistols, never personal mayn believe me
Throwing boat loads like Bolo, in Enter the Dragon
Walking the ground pants sagging, hit niggaz with black talons
Ghetto smiling, niggaz ain't seen me in a while'n
I'm just trying to survive, just trying to stay alive'n
Bossed out like Boss Hogg, keep bitches in Daisie Dukes
Put slugs in niggaz, why they trying to put up they dukes

Not bragging or nothing, but these hands I gotta lay you flat
Like a tension reliever, you gon stretch out and then relax
Seem like the mo' realer I keep it, the mo' I get stabbed in my back
Y'all niggaz don't see Joseph Mcvey, y'all niggaz just see a rap
Y'all niggaz don't know how many times, I done went without food
Without shelter without clothing, real poverty is mind blowing
Sleeping outside, can fuck with your pride
In most cases its a decision, whether you gon roll over or ride
Not to mention the pop-po's pull us over, when we standing still

Pimping the pen, and I gotta keep a thermostat on my skin
And catch a cold, with the motherfucking ice I'm in
Big bubble lenses, at the front of the car
We in the club, running up a fat run at the bar
Puffing plex, anybody get a punch to the jaw
No soda water, got a pint doing it raw
And everyday, I put new shoes on my feet
Sugar brown ladies or red bones on my meat
I'ma skip with the rub or not, on my sheets
And ride with a big fo'-five, on my seat
Pulling out the yard, as I drop the top
Ready for the jackers, still gon c*** the glock
Pulling up at the club, everybody still show love
But I'm still not gonna stop for bops
But I'ma stop for the drank, man po' me up
Hoping to nine seven point nine, blow me up
But these fellas be in it for the competition

On 8-3's, and bumper kit
Candy paint, looking wet to spit
Piece on my neck, read Screwed Up Click
Album silver, bubble head lights
Trunk gon knock, like lights of fire
At the intersection, I run the red lights
All my jewelry, is draped in ice
Crazy chain, piece and medallion
Pass the seat, or yellow stallion
Pretty brown eyes, and thick thighs
Half Chinese, mixed with Italian
Paid for, everything cash
My rear view, is in my dash
Got a pop spot, to hide my stash
Hide my trunk, see the baby gash
Mild dog, is super meals
Drop my top, feel the atmosphere
Tweety singing, loud and clear
In my cup, is Belvedere
Pockets full, of big face bills
Three story pad, in Beverly Hills
So much ice, you get the chills
In the studio, I shred the reals

Man no more struggling we bubbling, collecting with Breadwood
White golf against the click, we drop bullets and I'm ahead them
We ride on top of the ridge, like a wide stallion
Bezeltine around me neck, with the diamond medallion

Barley moving on swangas, and knocking off the side rolling
Gotta give it up to the Fat Pat, nigga cause we Southside holding
Rolling in luxury cars, sipping on bar, talking on cellulars
Receiving messages from Mars, nothing but rap stars
Anybody wanna fuck with us, fuck around and get flipped up and zipped up
In a six foot ziploc, cause I got a glock in my right hand
And I'ma flip, when I can't even act like he wanna trip
I said it like that and I'll say it again, matter fact push record and play
It again
With a bop digger then, Trae and Den in a Benz
And accepting all the dope trafficing
Got the dope in the trunk, and we backing in
So much money, gotta back track my ends
I got the glut opium, black cause I'm African
American, Guerilla Maab gon shine for life
But our motherfuckers, are dull like a butter knife
I put it on my balls and on my life, Z-Ro never been shife
Cat don't come around me, just let me ball
If I fall off my note, then let me fall
Needed help from God, did he get my call
Pulling out the lot, and he let me crawl

And I know my fanbase is probably tired of me talking about the struggle
But since I resurrected time all the niggas don't want to see me bubble
Should I be mad at my friends, that's what Pac said
Although I clear my ruga ripping till they drop dead
I could a give a fuck about a buddy, he don't really love me
So there ain't no love for these niggas, there's only love for money
Paranoid like a defendant at a murder trial
Plus I seen it everyday, but signatured in cursive style
Motherfuckers be tattle tailing like they taking names
So when they take a son they drive by I'll be taking aim
Pressure to pian, are you able to maintain, where the sun don't shine
On a daily basis I hear shots but H. P. D. Don't mind
Cause they figure we'll kill eachother by 2000 and 2
But fuck the streets jesus our praises due to you
Only if they knew, this is my life

Surviving in the struggle, living so shife
This is my liiiiiiiiife
When will I get to bubble, living so shife

Ain't no waking up in the morning because I'm still awoke
Previous past tense events got a nigga ready to kill folks
But I can't lose focus, got my heart set on heaven
But I was a problem child running wild, for a nigga with a mac 11
I keep my friends and enemies closer than a mother and daughter
They'll sacrifice you like a lamb that gets slaughtered, weaker than water
With they woman ass ways that's why it pays to do drivebys
Niggas be horizontal as I slide by
All night long, I'm paronoid voice mail beeping for days
Everytime I creep you know I creep with aks and hks
The motherfucking killing field is where I lay my head
And the place that I make my bed is where I spread my led
Motherfuckers be coming to get me in the middle of the night
But I'ma wreck his face when I put a infrared beam in the middle of his life
When will it ever stop, until they drop I can't get no rest
Cause those that also feel me feel well to the flesh, in my life

Can I get a little rest, cause I can't take another test
Haven't I proven myself, so why do I feel like I'm that victim
I'm just praying for nothing and do the lord even hear me
Could it be that I was too inoxicated in the words for coming out early
Cause I've lost most of my partners, I'm losing family members
I remember when it was love, but I'll be lonely by the end of Decemeber
I'm feeling bad, but I can't talk to my dad, cause he don't care
Plus I'm missing my sister but she don't want to treat me fare
All this sleeping from house to house, fucking with my dome
Got two album of my own, but no home
So picture the park bench in blood, is the night time bed
Ripping the whereabouts to murderers and many nights I fled
Practically assed out, lord for being somebody pull some cash out
The reaction is the rawest, but I dash out
Fuck everybody, it's all about me and my woman and child
Because my 9 millimeter because he helped to rob, this is my life

Steady running around rapping and capping and talking shit

Be running up on you closed casket nobody gonna see you

My partner from Mercy told you we gone get you if we owe you
Military minded I'm a S. You. C. Soldier
Don't want it if it's hard cause the south lets you see over
I'm trying to keep my head on, but it's rolling off my shoulders
When I lost my people god damn, my heart was pumping colder
Shedding crocodile tears, man folks feeling this pain
And left a stain in my brain so I'm cracking like a window pain
On the edge having a conversation with my infrared
All these fuck niggas can get it two to the head and get dead

Taking out contracts on haters with a beam and a mask

I done showed up, then I poured up, then I blowed up like heats
Diamond slugs up on my teeth, I done been violent fuck the peace
I got a slug for these haters that's approaching me wrong
Let them mash off in first class there ain't no coaching my song
Hydro-V to the dome, with it on back to the chrome
I'm kind of quick to click so get gone or catch one to the dome
Mo-City Texas that's my home, but I can rome all over
So it's ghetto love these cats gone get me full up on sober
Real recognize real, and the fake gone fade away
Use to selling drugs to get that pay, but god done mad a way
For me to stack my ends, my paper, my moola, my fetty
And took this by surprise I knew you hoes wasn't ready

C. D., and they chose to make tapes, up on the stage
It use to be all about hooping now I'm all about getting paid
Getting leid I can miss it, I'd rather have my digits
Trying to get up on me a stack, taller than the tallest midget
I'm on bitches than a red nose pit, with his mouth on it

You can put your mouth on it, if you ain't than zip it up
Get off my dick bitch right quick because I'm about to rip it up

First things first off top, mama raised no fool
I was brought up in that South, in the swamps dropping too smooth
Hustling taking life, it ain't as trifling
Never will get catched dog, and corrupt snatching this
I be just, kicking the game while I'm young and
You should be thinking the same, don't be dumb
A small heart and a soft ass, that an't gon lasted
I'm watching all my niggaz, I grew up before in a casket
Some sad shit I seen in myself, pulling reefer
Black history, that was taught by my teacher
Go to Pimping Tina next do', I know she tweaking
But I ain't know she better hits know, until I be dead
Young nigga what you seeking, outside looking in
I'm here on this black top, confused with a flat top
They got dope in the streets, cause the game
I'm a stranger with no name, I'm for the fame my nigga

I'm a stranger, cause I'm a nigga you ain't seen
Face to face with death, bitch nigga you can't scream
Better cherish this your last breath, cause you done walked
Into an unfed guerilla, nigga now witness your last step
I was creeping, with the sawed off
In a rage bo'guard, blowing niggaz balls off
I'm the reaper, touching fellas on madula-oblan-gatta
Will I ever regret it, I think nada

[Klondike Kat]
I got this evil balling up inside, riding with my 4-5
And it'll be in my blood, I hope it's gon before I die
Grown men we don't cry, about it
Just put our straps up real high, then we walk about it
Gon be about it till I'm gone, I'm a gator boy
Knock the tops off a hater, for that paper boy
I'm just a stranger ain't asking for shit, then ask for life
But the Lord gave in, and you know he sha'll take it away

[Z-Ro:]
Keeping crack out my pocket, a pistol but I don't c*** it
All I wanna do is get paid, but the legal way
I use to be selling drugs, running up and down the boulevard
Better respect, whatever the desert eagle say
5-2 due for Z-Ro, with a mad super ego
Couldn't nobody, tell a nigga nothing about life
Till I started tripping too hard, smoking them sherms in the dark
And was a witness to my people, being shot twice
I had to get my mind right, stop gripping that iron tight
Everybody, ain't out to get a nigga for bread
But I promise it wasn't nothing, but niggaz be gum bumping
My pistol'll come jumping, nothing but infrared
32 grams up, and this killer could be a veteran not a rookie
Z-Ro is that nigga, that'll see thoed 'fore it's over with
Dealing with haters and perpetrators, trying to fade us
But I'm cooking up something major, wait till they get a load of it

[Hook:]
Struggling, to change
Trying to find, an exit out of the game
Looking for a better way, to make change
Daily decisions, bout to make a brother break mayn
All I ever did, was wanna shine
Make enough money, just so I could support mine
All the days of my life, I been on my grind
Laws trying to lock me down, for a lifetime

[Z-Ro:]
We use to be pimping broads, Mo City to Clinton Park
They tell us we went too hard, trying to make us a million
But look what we living in, gotta get us some dividends
Rolling over ridiculous niggaz, that be screaming out many men
Wishing death on you, when they pull or take on you
Tell me, what you gon do now
I'm really trying to change, don't make me get up and get that thang mayn
Close range, I will blow you down
Everyday, I'm banging screw
Your slab just ain't no slab, if Robert Davis ain't in it
Everyday, I'm banging screw
Your slab just ain't no slab, if Robert Davis ain't in it-in it-in it

[Hook:]

[Point Blank:]
Listen it's hard to think, when your mind goes blank
Leaning on these cake ass niggaz, like a pint
I write what I feel, and I feel what I write
Fuck if a nigga don't like it, and bitch wanna fight
The struggle ingrade in my skin, by the tip of a dull knife
One verse from Jay-Z, got me doing a hard knock life
Listen I try to stay focused, sometime my vision get blurry
And distracted, why all these people keep on fucking with me
I move swiftly through the vultures, rats and roaches
Playing chess, with these toy soldiers
But you can't complain, when you carrying the whole world on your shoulders
Cause people depending on you, niggaz gotta eat
Now how you gon look, big pimping and big living
And all the click that run with you, sleeping on the streets
I do the best I can, I bust my ass
If the next man can't do the same, I wash my hands I'm struggling to change

One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine

Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. To the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

[Chorus:]

[Lil' Keke]
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your cuz
I wish I was, able to socialize with y'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from y'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why y'all turning up y'all nose
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up y'all glow
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find

Wreckshopping all night long baby
Swing on 4's with me

Swing 4's with me, come roll with me
As the po-po, cause I'ma flow the tree
Make tracks stop, beating up the block
Ass end hop on the 4's and chop
Can't let these haters take what I got
Blue and frail, fresh out the shop
Some gone bop, the lighters gone light
That's why I keep glocks with infrared dots
No time to plex, got to push the lex
Keep them diamonds shining round my neck
Shots of chrome while I'm on the phone
Popping legs walking in my home
Walking through the doors, on marble floors
Chandeliers and studios
Got to pimp the pen, when I'm in the wind
And swanging 4's with optimos

Swang on 4's with me, and I like it

All on my dash, when I pass I'm looking oh so clean

Out of their minds if they're trying to take my bitch from me

Ain't the one to get took off my four

Little young got a gun and beam, and I make you scream
I work too hard when I grind, for niggas that wanna take my shit
And niggas will get hit, I promise these fellas gone mind
If I got to pull my piece to make a hater retreat
Then I'ma focus on taking him out with red dots, they will smell
It in the wind 'fore they try to move in I'm busting in the parking lot
In a big body Dave & Taylor ain't no haunt day
Going the wrong way on the one way, screams falling
Like rain drops, they gonna try to take me one day
But I'm armed and dangerous, eliminated the plex
When it came to us unlike these muts
I ain't no bust, riding on 94's and the game to us
Realizing that there ain't no changing us, re-arranging us
Homicide be naming us, drunk too many 4's now there ain't no waking up
And ghetto hoes be paging us, and steady broads be claiming us
But I'ma hit my switch, drop the top and unlock my kid

Hearing voices of the children of the corn
The mother that has finally been warned
Cause on a Polaroid in focus
There's a picture of my first born
I got a scary crimination, so I walked up in his room
And he spoke his first words (daddy's gonna die soon)
Running through the metals, people running
When they see me coming, a mother calling to her son
That's telling me to watch my back, I'm being hunted
Then it was gone, I turned around it had to be on
But then I had found, it was gonna be hard
For me to make it to the crib, cause niggas had me surrounded
Then all of a sudden, it was first and ten
Cause a nigga fell lite to the do'
Set trying to raise up out of that hoe
I step in and checking chins, broke loose with a loose tooth
I'm headed for that Cadillac, all of a sudden I felt c***
Needled ghosts steals that appear in my calf, now stick in my back
Then fired one, now I made it to the car and I crunked that hoe
And I hollered you niggas won't get me
Then I backdo' the beltway back to Mo City
But there's a Regal trailing close up on my fender
But in my hand, I got the synthetic rubber death
Automatic life ender, he's in the right lane and I'm in the left
So I hit the break and he hit the gas, and as he passed
I busted a shot that broke the glass
And the car was swerving, wondering to a Bourbon
Crashed in a diesel, then it burst to flames
I thought it was over, till the nigga pulled up in the Nova, uh
Now I'm doing 85 up ahead, out the window hollering catch me if you can
Could not lose him its still a pursuit, chasing till we hit Ridgevan
Pulled up in the front of the crib, put the Lac in park
And I unloaded the Mac, and I'm kinda cold
Cause the favorite mask of a mama
Bullet had my shirt spinning to my back
But I ain't got time to bleed, cause I'm getting up out of the car
Trying to catch my breath, and I heard screeching tires
And a bunch of foot steps, running with these niggas coming
I'm getting ready to split some wigs, but running up out of the driveway
There's a carriage that contains my kid
I dropped my strap, and hollered I'ma save you
They fin to kill your daddy but don't worry, you can resurrect me later
I'm almost dead but to my surprised, I done visualized
That nigga done rose up out of the carriage, I seen his big brown eyes
I shed a tear running to him, thinking I could use my body
To shield him from the blast
And I heard (fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck) everybody crashed
Then the niggas was gone and that was that, and since I couldn't breathe
I put down my self destruct, and I passed
That god damn thang to my baby boy
But I thought to myself, I can't just go out like no fucking flame
Got re-gather my nuts, and make these hoes recognize my fucking name
I'm ready to give up the ghost, and my first mind said close your eyes
But my second mind it said over ride, the first mind and grab yo' nine
So I stood to my feet, covered in blood catch a slug
That busted my ribs, and I grabbed that damn thang
From my baby boy, and I put him back in the crib
And since aggravation had my def callade, I put up the Mac
And I passed up the nine, and I strapped on a hand grenade
Got back in the car, only reason I see is bodies stacked
Fired up the dank, and I hit it so hard
The smoke started seeping up out the holes in my back
I crunked up the car, for my final ride
Wipe the blood off the locs, and put the Lac in drive
Motherfuckers better be ready to die, cause death is close
We gon go, out like G's and continue to plot on his ghost
I'm 28 plus all of my fate, hitting what do you know
Recognized the Nova, parked the car
And made my way to the do', they slamming them boulders
Jamming on screw, and sipping on hennessey
Without any warning I kicked open the do'
And said do you remember me
They jumped up quick, I grabbed the hand grenade
And shut the fucking do', and then I felt the heat from a  4-4
They hit the deck, but it really don't matter no mo'
They tried to get out, but my nigga we locked in
There was a grenade in my hand, I dropped the pin

Know I'm saying, going out like G's
Because we are G's, I wanna say what's up to my G's

Slapping her on the ass while she riding that donkey
And now my name in the mix
But that's what you get putting your thang in a bitch
You got to butt em' up stick 'em ha ha and dip
Flush the rubber yep and get in the car and flip
But hoes always know where your ride at
Or at least where it was they notice the tire tracks now they flat
So I learned to be polite move over please
Grind it up in them an damn near damage their ovaries
Jack that ass up look at a minute
Then urghhh ride up in it
It's a certain way you stroke the hoes
Take her on a vacation poke her nose

You wanna know bout my neighbor yeah I kinda knew her
She was impress with my whips I wasn't kinda sure
Kinda blew her off cause she was playing me tight
Bumping down and let them whitey boys change her life
I hope you ain't beefing
And my past ain't got nothing to do with me hitting that ass
Ma I'm tweaking, I'm from a different world
Where you don't tie a woman down if she want to look around go head and get it girl
Flexxa time to have sexxa

Calling my number cause no one do it better
Got you at home at night writing me letters

Pissed of cause too many people been in my face
Mean mugging everybody two seconds from catching a case
Plus somebody just hit my car man the shit don't stop
Go thru my phone and choose a victim take it out on the c*** (on the cock)
Ma thinking bout gripping ass that's why I hit it swift and fast
I'm a put this log on you you gon' feel it all in your calves
A gangsta so I'm raw with it I know what I'm doing
That's why she pop up at my residence trying to see what I'm doing
She knocking if the lights on ready to get her fight on
Cause last night she had orgasms all night long
Made her feel like she was married with children
But ain't no Al and Peggy I'm strictly here to do some drilling in your man filling
There would be my hand filling all up in your you know
But you disappointed cause you ain't my numeral uno
So you go acting a fool breaking all a players rule
Straight forgot you had dude at home

Moving fast I'm running around, looking over my shoulder burning up use my cash
Wonder my A. C. Tell em on E, burning up my gas
I'm just a G, everybody in the streets know me
I represent that Killa Klan and the S. You. C., and the Guerilla M double A-B
They call me Ro Dog, giving it to you raw fast or slow dog
It just took a little time for me to shine, and get up in the game and roll dog
Now I'm full grown like H-Town be the aids, Z-Ro done got full blown
Then I stood up in the ring, and a nigga done bit the dust but the bill got pulled on
And I'll super-soak the crowd, if I have to
Nothing but Benjamin faces I be after, then I get ghost like casper
Don't work then don't eat, play the game but don't cheat

And when the feds come to town, you know a nigga get ghost

I got the hustle going strong, when you niggaz in bed
They scared, but homie ain't no future in that
I'm a G from the streets, so I don't run with a pack
Different strokes for different folks, purple drink and the smoke
And you know I grind for the cash, when you at home broke
I work for the feddy, I push it and stay ready
The frame on the slab, is wide and real heavy
Niggaz in the hood, I'ma pass em the torch

For real, I'm going to the top this year

Go on and put me for a show, I want ten grand plus half the do'
No sub in the front just plain Z-Ro, not a substitute cause I ain't gone go
Nowhere life is hard but it's fair, living my life like I don't care
Look at my feelings when they get wet, they tend to stare
Don't make no sudden move, just might be a sudden death
These characters think they bulletproof, but evidently cat must not of been blessed
A victory for me, another victim of the mighty Southside
Got everybody running back off in the house, and scared to come back outside
Radio stations recognize, getting my regular thousand times
Hate me off that corner, Z-Ro tired of feeling nickels and dimes
The definition of a hustler, Houston Texas we bleed the block
Ain't no way in hell it's ever gone stop, can't stop

They don’t give a damn, unless you’re breaking your back for them
They won’t help you out the situations you in
They act like they a shoulder to lean on, 
They listen to your problems then they grin
This ain’t livin
They don’t give a damn about you when you drive a regular car
Then when you in that Bentley then they care who you are
When you broke they can’t see you standing next to them
But when you rich they see you from afar
This ain’t livin

If I ain’t throwing money in the club, 
They show no love for me in the club
Bitches didn’t wanna ride my 300
But they love the passenger side in my Bentley on dub
Why the fuck I gotta ball to be accepted
I’m not a man, I’m a medallion at a necklace
Say they my homies but I know they’d probably rob me
And leave a nigga dead somewhere in texas
Y’all motherfuckers fake, facing friendships off the money that I make
You come around and eat when your tummy got an ache
But when I’m doing bad I promise I see not a face
God damn right, my nigga, these are the prays
Maybe they’ll give a fuck about me when I’m in my grave
Sometimes I’d rather be doing time in the states
At least I know what I’m up against behind the gates, yeah

Maybe mama’s got my daughter seeing green
I’m not even a father, I’m an atm machine
They never call me to see how I’m doing
It’s just “we need this, we need that”
I wish I could let it ring
Sometime I wish I never wrote my first song
They wouldn’t know who I was and they would have left me alone
Sometimes I be like lord I’m ready, you can call me home
Can’t take it here no more, I would rather be gone
Y’all motherfuckers fake, facing friendships off the money that I make
You come around and eat when your tummy got an ache
But when I’m doing bad I promise I see not a face
God damn right, my nigga, these are the prays
Maybe they’ll give a fuck about me when I’m in my grave
Sometimes I’d rather be doing time in the states

Same nigga used to ride a fixed up Fleetwood
Today, his shoes don’t even cover his feet good
A nice neighborhood to a spot under the freeway
It’s hard to ball but the fall off it’s so easy
When you doing good, it’s so many people there with you
Even when you doing nothing, they just hang around with you
But let the lights go off and the water stop calling
Visits turn to phone calls and the phone calls stop coming
Fuck this Z-Ro shit, my name Joseph Wayne nigga
But if I wouldn’t Z-Ro, would they give a fuck if I came nigga
All the bullshit I go through, I guess I’m who to blame nigga
And I fucked up what about it, it ain’t gonna never change nigga

Get a job but my job, got to be filling out applications it's hard
For a young black male, to stack male
But do it legal, without the help of a crack sale
That's asking too much, cause my people having it rough
That's just your ghetto, everyday average stuff

Bitch I'ma for real life head bust, I'm coming to see you fuck a song

[Z-Ro]
Now I don't owe nobody nothing, but lately niggas and bitches
Been attempting to get close to me, flipping the access to my riches
But can't you see this tattoo on my arm, say one deep
That mean it's nobody with me, when I'm 'woke or when I'm sleep
I ain't never been the type, to hang with a lot of niggas
Plus my attitude is rude, so I'ma be done shot a nigga
Please let me keep my cool, until I get paid
Then it be fucked up if I miss my chance, at a million in my grave
I'm the king of the ghetto, because I'm still here
You can purchase drugs or pussy, or you can get killed here
City streets, they'll eat you alive if you ain't got no street sense
You better call an audible, 'fore you meet up with the defense
The jackers the killas, the crooked ass cops
I refuse to become a statistic, bro I got my glock
So before you run up on me homie, for an autograph
Please don't do nothing suspicious, I'm trigga happy and I might blast"

Z-Ro Verse:
Excuse me, get off my motherfuckin toes
I ain't got no love for you motherfuckin hoes
Raise up, 'fore a nigga blaze up
I'd be the nigga that'll tear yo face up
With a left, a right, I'm out-of-sight, I'm boss
I don't give a fuck, you see me flippin when I floss
Riding with the Trae, riding with the Jay'ton
Riding with my brother, brother, then we be on
On a money making mission, Stackin our feddy
The world ain't ready, so heavy like a Chevy
Slow it down going down, we gon put it up
If you talking shit to us bitch, we shoot it up
Talking bout yo block now, I be riding with my glock now
It's non-stop now, around the clock now
Gotta get my motherfucker paper
Stacking up my chips like Lego
Hey ho, I just want some brain
That's that nigga Trae, that's my right-hand man.
Man, Nigga we gotta master plan.
Nothing but thousand dollars spreads up in our hands
Fuck going to jail, gotta make bail
We living in hell, so what the fuck oh well
And I don't give a damn, as long as a nigga stay free
Out here sippin codiene blowing on tree
At ease, motherfucker, just relax
In my pocket, I gotta bunch of green backs
And that's fact, I wouldn't tell no lie
If you run up, I put a swoll on your eye
Don't even try to run up on that water
I beat the nigga like a motherfuckin motor
Like a transmission, and I'm standing up hustlin
On the motherfuckin corner and I'm scufflin
To get my motherfuckin cheese my motherfucking bread
And you get one up in yo head
If you running up, trying to take what mine.
And in my fucking pant's line, I got that iron.
Under my elastic, I'll put flowers up in a basket
For a bastard, to get his ass kicked
Try to fuck around with nigga that roll with plastic.

The ghetto motherfucking alarm clock
Wake up nigga

[Z-Ro]
Lord forgive us for sinning, give us this day and our daily bread
Cause if a nigga don't call you back when you beep him, he might be dead
Look at this world we living in, everybody got a bad attitude and a glock
Seem like we living just to become a victim, of a random shot
Everytime I turn my back, another y'all motherfuckers turn and crack
It seem like just yesterday, a young nigga stepped up to the plate and
Learn to bat, military minded at a early age bread to live in a murder maze
I don't wanna go to the early grave, a motherfucker like me
Ready to murder maze, I wanna go to heaven but not right now
Bout to pushing infrared like dimes, what you wanna do it like that
I can play eight to the Penn, cut your lights off right now
Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I wanna know, where's the fucking love at
I don't wanna put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Hook - 2x]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

[Z-Ro]
I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph Mcvey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga wanna tag along
Wanna see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Hook - 2x]

[Mussilini]
Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

What we doing Ro

Balling, when you see us in them streets
We'll be crawling, sipping drank and smoking sweets
Shot calling, making paper till we die
You-Hauling, with them chickens that don't fly

[Young Chris]
Pull up in the low-low, everything slow-mo
The Lex the four do', Perellis the low crow
If you on nineteens, you need mo' and that's for real
Diamond in the back, bumper kits and fifth wheel
When I flip it's a thrill, I give eye by sheers
Watching out for my paint, cause five coats gon spill
I sprayed wetter than wetter, from South Coast up to San Mcgregor
4's poking trunk open, showing chinese leathers
From a friend to a pen, standing next to Lick Land
I be damned if I'm slipping, I got that hot shit in my hand
Jealous fellas gon knock us, certified show stoppers
And most boppers they gon bop us, when we pull up on choppas
I'm screened up tinted mayn, watch me slide fo' lanes
And I'ma swing and swang, and let the back end hang
And I still like a tame, young playas we doing thangs
Just like Z-Ro saying, nigga balling mayn

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Z-Ro]
When I ball, it be like twenty G's up in my pocket
When I ball anything I want, I'm able to cop it
Cause when I ball it's to the point, to where they think that we broke
But I still be popping up on the scene, on a new set of spokes
Cause I'm a real ass nigga, in the field ass nigga
Eagle talons and hollows, up in my steel ass nigga
S. You. C. For life I love it, wouldn't trade it for nothing
Creeping and crawling on swangas, or might be blades with buttons
Gucci from head to toe, I'm looking sharp enough to cut ya
Gangsta strutting on hatas, cause ain't no love for bustas
Roll with us or get rolled over, we gon show you how it go
Young Chris done hooked up with the partna, from Ridgemont 4
And it's gravy that's how we ball, on cutters that's how we crawl
And never ever ever ever, that's how we fall
Check my track record baby, I've been balling a while
Diamonds all on my pinky and neck, all in my smile

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Young Chris]
When I ball if you don't like me, it's fa sho you gon knock it
And when the diamonds get to shining, shit I know you gon want it
Z-Ro and Young Chris, we ain't balling baby
Check the track record nigga, we been balling lately
Coming down on a daily baby, thought we was broke
Followed behind that Z-Ro, and bo'poking on spokes
Now you can still knock us, dick riders they still jock us
Ain't a damn thang changed, switching lanes on choppas
We dub riders, your ordinary Southsiders
We balling for real, Southsive and that's for live
Today is the day we ball, the next time balling out of control
Crawling 4's up on the scene, valet falling up out the do'
Driving reckless through Texas, I shine from my wrist and necklace
It's Chris the youngest one, I'm well protected
We be balling daily, never falling baby
Check the incoming calls, boppers calling baby

He was bumping, so I slapped a patch up out that dude

Y'all fellas, know what happened to that dude
He ran up in my face, and he ruined my mood
I couldn't let it slide, I couldn't let it go
Couldn't let a motherfucker, play me for a hoe
Pulled out my 4-4, and I just bust
Nan nigga nan bitch, will I ever trust
Unless it's my people, unless it's my kin
I don't love shit, but my people and my ends
Put my ends in my safe, in a safe place
I break a bone, in your motherfucking face
If you think I tell a story, if you think I'm lying
Pull out my iron, and I commits to find
Have a nigga falling, off of his game
If I hit a head shot, that's the end of his brain
Simple and plain, ain't it
This tool, will leave a nigga wig painted
Know what I'm saying, I couldn't be playing
I sit on top of the roof, and start spraying
At a nigga head, leave a nigga dead
(*claps*), leave him bruised and red
We don't give a fuck mayn, that's a clap
I put a motherfucking, clip in my strap
Bust at your back, bust at your front
Then I go to the house, roll up a blunt
That's how I do it, don't fuck with fluid
But I'ma be fluent like fluid, and I knew it
One day, I get a platinum plack
If you running up, you better back on back cause

What happened to that dude, what happened to that dude
What happened to that dude
It's your boy Z-Ro, and I'm way too rude

[Z-Ro]
I had to do it like that, and like this
Had to break a bone, and make a motherfucking wish
I did it like this, and I did it like that
A nursery rhyme, and still broke a bitch back
Like that, like this
Hit it from the back, and don't quit
Bitch fuck you hoe, I'm all about my dough
Standing on the corner, with my chrome 4-4
Maybe 4-5, maybe twelve gauge
Trying my best, just to make the front page
Put a homicide, on worldwide news
If a nigga chase me, I'll give him the blues
Pull out my motherfucking, power pellet
Roll up the doja, and I start to inhale it
Now I'm feeling fine, I'm really feeling fine
I dropped me a eight, in a thunderberg wine
Got a nigga feeling like, I lost my dog
Jump in my bitch, and I boss my hog
I hit the streets, the streets hit me back
I checked my pager, it was time to attack
The motherfucking dope fiends, time to get money
I want my bread, I want my honey
I want my streets of gold, for I can walk on
And a platinum walkie talkie, I can talk on
Man, I'm feeling way too heavy
A monster, so can't nothing scare me
I'm unscareable, it's unbearable
Man, when you hear me it's terrible
Cause I be beating, on your motherfucking nerve and
Might be in the Bourbon, or Excursion
It don't matter, cause I'm riding high
Leaning to the side, when I'm sliding by
All in your face nigga, slapping
Out the motherfucking taste nigga
That's how it go, never been a hoe
Try to take what's mine, and get a mouth full of flow

(*talking*)
Yeah, oh yeah, I'm feeling that
Shit, boys get the shit slapped out
Your motherfucking ass, what 3-2 say
Yeah man, you bootleggers, we got all kind
Of bootleggers out here though, you know I'm saying
We gotta put a slap into them dudes
You know I'm saying, these niggas that sue boys
For 150,000, like that's hurting my highsing
Nigga I'm still rising, while you coniving
You ain't shining, but bitch I shine like a light
All day all night, whether gun fight or fist fight

If you love living your life, leave me alone

They hate me unitl I'm gone, they hate
They hate me until I'm gone, if you love living your life, leave me alone

[Z-Ro:]
Fuck everybody lately, cause it was fuck me first
What's the reason for the season, of wanting to see me in a hearse
It really don't matter, because I ride or die for me
Even if they kill me, there's happiness in the sky for me
So if it's death around the corner, I can't stop it if I wanna
Jesus just let me empty my tip, and hit my marijuana
Yeah I seen it coming, nobody gon catch me off guard
Make em look me in my eye, before they break me off Lord
Excuse my attitude, but I'm use to negativity
My life explains my fuck everybody, on each delivery
Some say it's the drugs, others say it's a lack of love
It ain't gotta be a reason, crazy simply just because
Everyday of my life, has been a struggle and pain
So I perform with no emotion, no further need to explain
If you love living your life, leave me alone
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song

[Hook:]
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song
Nobody in the world loves me, they hate me until I'm gone
(what's going on), realizing I'm going crazy
Everybody watching me suffer, but won't nobody save me
This can't be life, I promise the world ain't shit
I never knew I'd lose my mind, and end up like this
Cause all I think is murder, realizing I'm going crazy
Wait till they get a load of me, it's fuck everybody lately

[Z-Ro:]
In my '73, rolling on top of the trails
Let down my window, and let my pistol excel
Disrespect me, revenge gon represent me like a thief in the night
So prepare, for permanent sleep in you life
I'm still a Christian on a mission, but my vision ain't clear
Looking for peace, but all I see is drama down here
So when the going gets tough, the tough pull the team together
Who ride, and get rid of our enemies together
But if you live by the sword, then you die by it
So when it's time for me to go, it ain't no need to cry about it
Cause I done done my share, of wrong doing
Exaturated resolvable situations, and left some homes ruined
Even niggaz, that call themselves friends
They'll be first to try to rob me, and then do me in
So if you love living your life, leave me alone
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song

[Hook:]

[Z-Ro:]

My every thought is aggravated assault, and get my bread
For the love of money, motherfuckers disappear
That's the very reason, Joseph Mcvey keep his pistol near
Come and get me, so you can put your hands on my riches
The only alliby I need to squeeze it, and ain't digging ditches
But if I gotta, kiss my freedom goodbye
I tongue kiss my ten millimeter, cause she didn't let me die
That's a down ass bitch, mayn
Unlike my friends, cause just to get some ends they ten to spit names
24/7-365, nobody at my side
They might hit me up, before they help me hide
So I roll by myself, or I roll with Trae
A. B. N. For life, focused on making the world pay
If you love living your life, leave me alone

Look What You Did To Me was my first cd
If it went three final on that I never had a worse cd

I done grabbed hold to the rap game and can't let go
I'm a feed it to you through the speaker
Listen at the highs listen at the mids
Everybody loving this even let the old folks listen and the kids
Certified ghetto platinum, cause I'm a champion
But it's for the money, catch it dead if you don't have no fun

[Chorus:]

It's been a long time I've been out on the grind trying to find my way
But I can't escape none of the drama, haters jeopardize my day
I tried to walk on the straight and narrow
And try to stay as sane as I can
But I'm just a man, doing all I can
Have mercy on me father, I'm guilty
But I'm trying harder to do right, do right
But when I see my children starving
I get gangsta and I start to mobbing
It don't stop, and it won't stop

My mind just goes off and wonders, cause it ain't stable
See I be fantasizing, bout putting food on the table
Cause in the ghetto my hood, prison is promised to us
Some of us let jail teach us, some let college do it
They think I'm nothing, cause I don't get up and get a job
But I be trying the only thing I get, is getting hard
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, holla if you hear me
And you with me now, got my life right with God
You hatas come and get me now, fifty rounds
Is what I'ma destrand, that's on my mama God rest her soul
Nigga picture me playing, foes gon read and deed follow my lead
When I'm sober I can't focus, pass that weed to me
And dedications all day long, seem like when I'm going
Through it my partnas stay gone, but its all gravy baby
Cause I want you to hate me, calico gon stay off safety
Murder motherfuckers, if they make me

[Chorus:]
Will I go crazy, I don't know
The pain is fucking with me lately, but it don't show
I can't let it faze me, cause I can't stop
I'm more than just a ghetto baby, cause I'ma reach the top

[Miss Dameanor]
Like Pac, I'll be the last motherfucker in this bitch freezing
And feel me money over niggas, be my pledge of allegiance
Whether I sang or I heat you, I'ma wait till I'm sinking
No dirt inside my credentials, bitches gon have they own reasons
This how we up in the game, I'm bout my paper fuck fame
The last day you gon see, we roll down feeling shame
This how the lessons gangstafied, paper chasing since youth
Bet not go squabbling for respect, to see who got the most juice
I been a witness to the struggle, days and spots have been missed
The devil huffing like a wolf, that's why I'm building with bricks
I seen and heard plenty shit, from ghetto baby to woman
Its either keep your head above the water, or get swept under
Been a guerilla in the midst, this matching soldier be marching
Now valet and curb service, more sauce for handicap parking
When more days get brighter, my tribulations get lighter
More shalant about my life, now I'm a Southern street fighter

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
Don't be telling me bout no riff-raff, I'm busta-free
All about my wealthy, don't need nobody to fuck with me
I'ma keep my twelve gauge, the only company I need
Can't forget about hydro, and a pint of codeine
Flipping to Austin from Houston, on a mission to make feddy
Either stop fucking with some of my people, cause they wasn't ready
But the whole wide world, its just me and my dreams
And anybody roll glock, is gon be seeing my beam

[Miss Dameanor]
Went from dirt packs to platinum, watch the jealous one hating
To see who's real from the fake, and thank the Lord what I make
Hard times brought tears, misery if you last
Realize I wasn't gon be shit, if I didn't get off my ass
For the ones who was there, anticipated my fall
I cry still on death field, but I can ball and stood tall
Now Miss Dameanor live lavage, went from broke to hood rich
Plan to live to the fullest, then I'm up outta this bitch

Dear Lord, this is your boy Bam
Can't nobody do what you done done God
One of the ghetto graduates, three men in here
Ready to deliver, number one, all they internal sins
On pen and paper, and right now, they fin to let
You know how it is, it's a chance, God bless us
Allah, you number one

[Wood]
Well it's my return, and I've been gone for too long
I'm in a different state of mind, yeah Wood is in the zone
Demonstrate the arsenal head shots, with red dots and wet spots
Soaking shirts up, till my churf up with red spots
Bag of leaves and the chronic trees, South Texas ki's and let you weed
They jacking leaves for cake and cheese, I make the G's and you may believe
Shouldn't wish up on your clover leaf, wishing up on a star
Losing my memory behind a bar, all I want is drank out the jar
Locked in the Penn talking back to the guards, shooting the kite
Taking the back of my broad, pulling a candy Lac in my yard
Strapped up talking back to you boys, I'm armed alarmed and informed
And I'm hollin' on my own, for the rings to the pawn
Gotta pass up the coin, to the Tre where I was born
Wood, and I'm hot as a fire place, in a eskimo's house
You get the, you get the, you get the splinters in your mouth
Quinbrown my hardest hood close to downtown, round for round
And pound for pound, I'm making you bitch boys bow down

[Chorus]
I've been waiting patiently
I wonder if a nigga's really blessed, cause I'm still here
Niggas steady, hating me
I wonder if a nigga's really blessed, cause I'm still here
I've been waiting patiently
I wonder if a nigga's really blessed, cause I'm still here
Why does he forsaken me
I wonder if a nigga's really blessed

[Chill]
It ain't my fault, my Lord please forgive me for static
But I had that line in my T.V., and being broke and don't have it
I'm playing a deadly game of chess, over rugers and vests
Ride on hollow tips when I'm spitting, still into the flesh
Thug wounds got me paranoid, tattooed and scarred
Running away from the fraud, hiding behind tint in the car
I'm blowing sweet after sweet, real niggas in her feel me
Surrand wrapping the duffle bag, swang bitching to bust me
I'm bout my paper, my Lord please don't let it be in vein
I got a son two little girls, and they got hustle in they vein
Kamikaze with an infrared, scoping my mind
Puffing on lime swinging on 20's, bumping low on the ground
Satellite shaking bitches, putting cameras on cords
Puff the yay and pass the weed, cause everybody love marijuana
I'ma slap for you nigga, two hundred fifty on concrete
Moved patiently and silently, you dialing nigga

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
I watch my life pass me by, in the blink of an eye
Another stick of fry, cause the regular weed no longer get me high
Popping extasy like Aspirin, come down a nigga block blasting
You don't wanna meet that reaper nigga, you hoes come off my cash man
I'm trying to keep it holy, this thug life keep calling my name
Every now and then I take a loss, but see that's all in the game
Look at what you did to me, I'm free but I'm still living on lie
Everyday it's one mo' murder, one mo' partna that drop
I wonder if the sun shines on the other side
Cause I bet my mama ain't seen a rainy day, since she died
I'm a living legend still in the flesh, automatic assault rifle and a vest
Cause my partnas try to put me to rest
So I treat my pistol like a queen, as I fiend for the green
And I never put anyone before my bitch, I'm jealous as I service my beam
A murdering team, forgive me for my sins O'Lord
But I'm trying to make it, cause this ghetto life is so hard

Feeling fine and lovely, even when it get ugly
I know I'ma make it, because the Lord is above me

Progress is so sweet, ain't tripping with envy
Slip and slide like a snake, pop up the world like a quake
Mashing hard on the gas, with the coast on the plate
Roll on cowards and busters, peeping them soldiers and hustlers
Got an eye for them fuckers that trying P. H. With? Snorkels?
Got a trunk full of clutches, blinding mine make you stutter
I blow like a hurricane, so close all your shutters
See I wants everything and everything I'm gone have
Roll out my red carpet just to go to my stash
Third coast, blind and shine like a brand new slab
On my birthday, I'm throwing me a fortune on pad

Entertainment center be lit up, and all the trunks gone lift up
Button rims they grip up, the talkers mouths gone zip up

We drew it up and screwed them up and see went through with the plan
Jumped in the mix with hundred bricks and now a mobbing gorilla
You had to miss go get her, about the scrilla my nigga
Stay loaded up and we ready, Box City working that jelly
Burning more streets than pereddy, while cutting up like machetes
No doubt screwed up candy paint, killer think straight drink
Down here we swinging the tank, and every thought be bout bank

Don't need no natural lemon tea I don't be training my voice

Hit the atm machine, ain't no need for me to pawn
Cause I'm paid, my game sharper than a razor blade
Bald faded and X-rated, my Gucci's is tailor made

From Daytona to Arizona no longer on the corner
World wide, I got to keep the dream alive

Dirty rats get splat when I pull out my black mac

From California to Rome, these hoes pussies stay warm

Thinking hard, running out of places to lay my head got me drinking hard liquor
Still a go killer, should I rely on my skills
In the mist of poverty it must be the straight up get to an ending peal off
Recognizing the drama offense of living in my life
Got to go get it and come back with it until it's prison in my life
Born struggling, a nigga acheived his bubbling
The fact that I can't get no job can't do nothing but rub it in
20 years old, I was screaming I would reach 25
Now 24 and still no dough I started struggle and strive
I was a Bridgemont hardhead, yellow and purple repper
And never let another nigga check us, nigga that was low yet
Use to live with Z-Ro all in your deck
But back in 1995 I would of been all in your chest
With a pistol grip punk giving up for you gone die tonight

Having visions of me in a V-12 motor corners my benz bending
Straight down to the T I'd have a?
I promise I'll do it right this time wait till the g get free
If I could make the jail house all of that Mo-Town live
When I ain't T. W. To the free the rap game is mine soon as I get signed off
Lock, a thug nigga fresh out the jail house
Still addicted to hustling attempted to pull my steel out
Show me the money, I'm gone show what you need
Half a ticket and a half-a-gallon and a quarter ounce of weed
I'm your mama I'm your daddy I'm that nigga in the alley

Praying to god I wouldn't lose my freedom or my life before the limelight

Hitting stage till my vision gets brighter
Remember poverty, it ain't a part of the plan
Cause while I'm on the corner hustling with work in my hand
Like a super star selling rocks, because the stage becomes a block
But my plot is put my trust up in my glock
Z-Ro the ghetto rap versus the world but could I lose
But even though I'm still paying dues, I'm still the last man standing
With a mad cannon ready to bust
Look how I did after I left that nigga dead in the dust
Cause I'ma ride when it's time to ride strictly for cash
I'm doing bad so I'm leaning on a beam and a mask

Sold up your block and take over your whole city nigga

Aggravated cause it's tough on the pole

And once it comes down to paper, you down to bump off your kin

So now you know when you see me, why my face is quick to chalk a frown
Cause I don't trust nobody, no not a god damn song
So now you know I'm a hog, from high to a deep level of cold
Thinking why niggas let me broke in this city of Houston

But now one one of you niggas would fight me, even if you was jumping me
You won't be to the end, I take your life and crumble your company
When you first started off, I did all of your production for free
But for the show date, you got everybody in the club except me
What kind of hoe could you be, a bitch to the third degree
That's why me and 3, ran up in your crib
And wouldn't play, let you live
If it wasn't for your cousin, cause for him I got love
But Midas please quit fucking with them scrub ass
Never show love ass, selling fake drug ass
Fin to catch a slug ass niggas, and I bet I be the one behind the trigga
Fin to put you in the dirt, till you get hurt, fucking around with the Network
Deserve a motherfucking slug in the chamber
And when I blast I'm screaming

When I be played up in my back, but in my face or ear to ear
You must of heard of all the murders that we doing here
Cause I could smell your fear
And watch you coming, you can't fuck with a nigga from bud
I'll leave laying on your back, with your body wide open
Choking on your blood, I signed a contract that was about a year long
But now it's expired, how the hell you gon get some points off my song
Bitch made nigga, show yo' face, even yo' nephew as well
Fuck around and pistol play with me, and you won't live to tell
Oh well, all I could say is I told you so
Should of stuck with a bench nigga like me, just got plex
You can't take it, talking bout what your pistol gon do to my chest
Hold that down, you don't wanna fuck around, I'm quick to pull chrome
But I'm more than words, up under your breath
And run tell chickens what's going on
Don't make me murder you nigga, you looking for me here I stand
About six feet even, cocked and meant built twin glocks in my hand
And to the niggas, that pulling the triggas on niggas like me
Sho' nuff gon stall, but I'm ready for the match
That's killing one more, one fall I'm killing on y'all

(talking)
I could feel it, ain't no more thinking bout
The sun gone shine

[Z-Ro]
Dj screw, Fat Mafio, and Gator are gone
I want to be strong but lately the pain won't leave me alone
For myself, crawl down and get away from this drama
No understanding by my father can't even talk to my mama
Got the world on my shoulders and it's too heavy to hold
Thinking suicide, but that won't be too good for my soul
Started out as a christian but sinning took over my mind
Time after time just for show that I resort to the crime
Where my real niggas at, the ones I helped in the past
Now that I'm doing bad and I ain't got no cash to make me laugh
I done got you where I want but holler if I roll
They want to know how many big faces a Mo City don fold
Want to jack me when I'm through and do my niggas for life
It's deja vue for me to be face to face with triggers tonight
I know your bad movs are swift really soon I'll be gone
Now try to cover up together just want some love before I'm gone
Still thinking of best free, no better person on the planet
Steady be driving away people I love and I can't understand it
God damn it how can I love without loving myself
Having visions of me pulling the trigger slugging myself
I done went from rags to riches, riches to rags now I'm stuck
Plus my boo is acting nautios because I'm bout to truck
And I ain't did nothing, when I grab something and start dumping
Ain't got no time for pussy just pimping a pen and bumping
On the hottest block, making sure the bills stay paid
Pick it up and drop it now flossing until I'm down in the grave
When it happen let it happen cause I won't bust back
Retaliation from busters trying to get they nuts back
I take it like a man, knowing I gave this life my all
No more hooks, no more verses this is my final curtain call

After the rain, after the rain
I still feel the pain, feel the pain
My final curtain call, asking y'all
Let me pray for my dogs, all of y'all

Living a thug life in blood it's like hell at home
So many cops around my hood it's like jail at home
But still I roam, on the block, with a pocket full of sweets
So much sales, so much smoke I got to get lifted out my feet
Cause if I wasn't some of y'all niggas would be dead round here
And pull par, we give you hot lead round here
And niggas scared round here, cause I'm a natural born killer
Ridgemont gorilla give you more chills than thrillers
I'm bone hard, you better open up your chest at will
The only investment that I receive was a talented deal
This life is real, and it ain't having no mercy man
So you still struggle seem like a nigga be thirsty for pain
I'm going insane, but to maintain it's really the key
But it's hard to do that when these hoe niggas is pressuring me
It ain't no lecture in me, I'm gone remain a g

[Verse 3:]
Is this the way it's suppose to be
The lord to hear my prayers are you listening
Forgive me for saying I'm trapped in a world
That's got a grudge against me living
What happened to the good old days when unity was a must, when you
Could put trust in your own people, without our own people trying to get us
And I could see the rules of the game
Are still the same, cause days are shorter
And times are harder, I'm fighting to keep my head above water
Cause I got to protect myself from the evil of my own people
The only personi fear is God
And through his eyes we're all created equal
And I can't understand how black on black crime hitting as hard as it did
Cause the half the niggas that you did you use to roll with as kids
Father forgive me for being favorless and hopeless
But in this cruel world, it's hard to stay focused if you haven't noticed
No one seems to want to follow the rules
If we can't live as brothers and sisters than we'll parish as fools
And to the youngsters coming up never sell your soul, cause
Life is priceless, stay strong and try to make it through this ghetto crisis

Don't violate me stressed don't cross the knife
Now I promote no argument me conversate when I won't come nice
Paranoid, paranoid, when I be coming on down fawn
Ever ball, approach me swinging make a man fall
Me serious with the fists one touch could make a fool die
Them turned heads and one could see the devil in me eye
But I'm off and, and rub the coffin, that's one interrogation
Scream heartless when I violate me rule and regulation
Me get the sawed off buckshot from the killing
Who plex me or plex cause me ready and me willing
Me ready for the battle, drink a gallon wanting the sexual healing
Ghetto life is nothing nice we have the cap peeling
We are the true jumping and you moving over
The ghettos I live cross the line, far from moving over
And eye of light, when me get the pistol and me brighter
Tell me this, who shall save the white man's idol

Fuck y'all I got my beams on your ass, right

About my aim, I'm consistently accurate with the trigger
My nigga don't count your chickens 'fore they hatch
If you owe me some feddy you better pay me I'm ignorant bout my scratch
I don't trust nan nigga cause nothing but hate they be sending me
Can't determine my friends from my enemies
I done had partners that done helped me when my life was on the line
Talking about hitting me right back I'm trying to knock this bitch down
Putting pussy before your partners disrespecting the game
What about you broke in them titty bars be collecting your change
Trick, nigga with all these bitch niggas are made to bleed
Since you giving me another reason to blaze the weed
And I don't want to do another killing, another bid
They've been trying to give me the crack since I was a kid
But I remain calm, pill popping smoking and leaning if I wasn't high
I'd leave these niggas choking and screaming

Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh boy things will get brighter

I keep my middle finger pointed out at all times, lyrically
Abuse somebody in all rhymes, indodging in felonious to the small crime
Everybody want to do a song with Ro, but none
Of these niggas want to get down on a couple of zones with Ro
Fuck rapping, I need some right now money, it's getting crucial
I'll be jacking for some right now money
Niggas ain't ready for the episodes that I supply
Pcp influenced, I'm relentless nigga you can die
Fuck all these niggas and these white folks, I'm all alone
No friends cause in the fucking end a nigga dies all alone
About to meet my maker, I hope my life is right
But it's hard to focus when killers try to murder me every night
I guess this life is really hard now, fiending for the day that this war stops
Pulling my pistol everytime a car stops
Live by the sword, die by the sword, nigga my time is borrowed
I paint this for another tomorrow

I'm crucified by the media because I'm loved by the public
Even though I'm rated number one keep your thumbs up and shove it
They said I'm trying to sound like Pac is my confession to that
Bitch I can't help it if I sound similar when I be stressing the fact
See I'm gone scream it cause I mean it anything less ain't excepted
The fact that I'm dark and I'm restless is no resort of living reckless
Rest in peace to my niggas that got caught up in the struggle
But I'm showing love to the niggas that don't want to see me bubble
But I take that back, fuck you, I made it to the top ten on my own
And every bitch in every city is singing my song
Imagine that I use to sleep on a corner
Even in year two triple O, fuck working I'm selling marijuana
Pulling the bull up over my eyes you just can never tell
But I know if I'm faking I try to rap now one of tapes gone sell
I predicted being real by staying true to myself

With a dope dog, that I stole from the law
Make you slip up out of your clothes on the way to see your balls

Times pass, thangs change but me I'm stuck in nowhere

And, rare digits, I'm speaking from experience
Thinking this might be the time for me to set it off
I'm lost and throwed so it seems it can't still matches
Some bank heists, and aggravated terroristic jackers
Drama related but damn it I've been straight since 98
I put that life behind me and still trying to reach the gate
They say money is the key to success but can't handle this
Without the paper on your hands it's hard times and stress
No shit, I told you that I can handle it
But damn it, I'll be damned if I'm gone let it handle me
I tell y'all what, I stay high, cause it keeps me from spilling away
It's inside, I'm a gorilla till I die

Trying to make a million pettiest songs in the same spot
Grab mentality of a sick nigga, anyway that I can get it

Remember my strategy, always bust first
In a situation me and Nina burst, leavin memeories on the streets
Heartless, with or without heat
Holding ground as if a nigga sporting cleats
Gorilla till I die cause I'ma be a hog, I want it all
Trying to ball until my final curtain call
If it means stepping on they toes they better be ready for my moves

When your kin people done turned they back
Every family that I know is just like that, my nigga how does it feel

How does it feel, when they don't believe anything you say
Always, got to show and prove yourself every single day
Man this ain't living, nothing but drama all through the week
And if they don't respect my words, why they want me to speak
I'm feeling worse, even though I put my family first
I'm shedding tears cause I feel as if I'm headed to the dirt
Ghetto on me, stressed out, mama buried ain't dead
Ain't got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head
Have you ever told a lie to make the drama stop
Watch the world you love turn against you no more family problems
How does it feel to be the black sheep, how does it feel to
Victimized yourself for one time and evermore after the g
And roses on the dresser bad, liquor approaching fast
Sitting around, waiting on death to come, watching time pass
My life, my life, falls under the wicked and shife
I wonder where I got to sleep tonight, nigga tell me how does it feel

I'm tripping cause of my facial expressions but they don't understand
24 years old and use to frowning daily, trying to figure out
Who was the friend, and who was the foe, you know it's bout to drive me crazy
Mama, tell Jesus I can't handle the pressure, look at
The way they do me down here, my vision is Z-Ro on the stretcher
Can't I breed in peace, won't y'all leave me alone
Like Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home
Bout a Mo City block, a place that ain't no glocks, and it ain't no sin
No longer watching my back for the retaliation
How does it feel to wish that you was dead, I can
Answer that cause many of nights my pistol's to my head

Of being neglected stressing enemies nigga tell me how does it feel

You must start with your face on these c.d.s now
What's the deal now, what it do on them zones now
Got them feds at your door so when you go now
How does it feel to have these seeds that you can't feed
And these blocks full of rookies that you can't bleed

There was a hustling motherfucker, with a cold ass flow
Everytime he hit the studio, his beeper go off
He left the beef to get his cheese, by selling people that raw
With a pistol on his right side, and one in his back
I-10 again and again, from running that crack
Girlfriend kept complaining, cause he never at home
So he told her deal with it bitch, or get the fuck on
It was money over bitches, on his mind
Plus all of his partnas, thought that he would never shine
The number be 15 and 5, up in the kitchen
He could do it straight up, or he could do it with a whipping
But then came a drought, and then he put his first album out
Decided to do it full time, cause record stores kept selling out
Still in the game, cocaine on top of the brain
From the studio to the streets, Z-Ro is everything

Do anything for my peeps

But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay
In the mean time they hate you everyday
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off
When three's comany and four is a crowd
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around

In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it
Got you looking at your people meaning shit

Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright

That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages
Stacking big faces and travel to many places
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow?
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight
It's whenever when we were boss want to do
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm thorugh

[Chorus - 2x]

[H2o]
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes
I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit

[Z-Ro]
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at

[Chorus - 6x]"

Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on the ledge
Feel like I'm falling off the edge it ain't no fable
It's reality, feel like I'm on the offensive, they trying to tackle me
That's why I keep popping fists
So rather relative or stranger, better keep your distance
I can't determine friend or foe so you in danger
Chemical imbalances of the weed and cocaine, but it really
Don't matter to society, a nigga that got no face and no name
Deserving more, but I'ma mob until I ain't got nothing left
And the only thing that's promised to me is more problems and death
Cause there's some niggas looking for me and they might be near
And if they kill me don't she'd a tear, remember I'm not happy here
Even still, got to keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend don't understand, didn't want to
Witness the wicked so please find yourself another man, haters feel me

(Chorus - 2x)
This is my liiiiiiiiife
Surviving in the struggle, living so shife

[Verse 2]
My opposition and proposition is scheming for cash
And if you bitches is scandalous, I get in that ass
So let's reliviate the pressure
Don't try to run it's guaranteed these slugs'll catch you
Oh yeah, I keeps a problem solver
A pistol grip, a automatic and revolver
Check it, and I'ma handle up baby
It's in my nature it's a must it ain't a maybe, peep game
The feds taking pictures, and tapping my phones
But if I catch you bitches snitching best believe me it's on
I analyze of this realize and open fire on bitches
And if I catch you bastards slipping I'm leaving bodies in ditches, huh
I bet that ass can pass it
Your life span it ain't long, you in a casket, check it
Niggas rushing your ass, mob deep with ski masks
Busting shots on the road trying to make your car crash, this is my life

(Chorus - 2x)

[Z-Ro]
These boys be telling me they got love, giving me false-i-fied tapping, but
I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rapping
See I know they want to get rich off me understand, even if I was
To die I still can talk they still put a mic in my hand
For trying to copy my style of life, pretending like they from my block
While I survive on willing to live while they depend on mom and pops
Before you make your move, check yourself and giving me for the millions
For the love of the struggle and just can't take it cause you not real
You want to be dead, there's gone be a dentist to see
When a nigga be scream and hollering I'm godfather
But I guess it's just the menace in me, plus
The only nigga that's skipping me from clicking is Herman Fisher
Relocated the killers and gats and drinking and if and burning swishers
Why they want to play with my life, they got families, nigga I don't
The only thing between me and them hoes
Is I'ma keep thugging they timid ass won't
Will they mind they own god damn business and keep they self out of mine
Because of a thin line, between handling business
And boo yeah coward a nine baby

They tell me put the dope down, and it won't hurt no more
But the only thing I really seem to understand, is murda mo'
They tell me keep my trigga finger easy, I'll open up your body
Too many casualties around here, dead bodies around here
And I can't get caught up, preacher can you save me, save me

They said it was gonna get greater later
But now I can't help to think that it ain't
But a nigga was fed up with this life, thinking about running a razor blade
Cross my wrist, every last drop till I faint
Taken out that punishment for the thangs that I never did
Coming up as a a young kid
Trying to get rid of all the animosity towards me
That was shown by the other kids, what do I do
Why do everybody wanna see a nigga fall
Mama dead and daddy can't be found
So when I'm stressed out, who the fuck can I call
All alone in my zone, with no friends
So I chose to make friends with drugs
Cause everyday, everybody around me
Trying to clown me, so I got a friend and I got buzzed
Out of frustration came aggravation
Depression coming down in my mind
Kept a nigga confused and straight crying
Dying, for sweet sticks and lines
Throwed off in my my mind
Trying to wonder why do Jesus let this keep happening
To a nigga that's steady being on his knees
And I'm begging him please, have mercy on me
Find a nigga a better way, right about now I'm to the point
Somebody better take this infrared away
Cause it was on too long, and I got a piece of chrome
And I want to you to come and look and see
The monster that you've created, look at what you did to me

[Z-Ro]
They tell me how the liquor ain't good for me
But it drowns out the vision of my casket
It's either my life or your life, that's right
I'm gon let you haaave it
Everyday haters, can't understand
The way I move my hands in ways, not known to man
Cause I can't get caught up
Preacher can you save me, save me

Could I be the invisible, individual nigga
That got a bit mo bigger
Baby, got ahead above one hitter quitter, knock out a bigger
Motherfucking boss mo' skills with a trigga
Shoots gun missiles, dropping a bomb
Chucking hand grenades, C4's explode
When I been sleeping on the same bench, for nine days
Living off of hot water and cheerios
Here it goes, my click might never grow
Nigga mind with the thinking throwed
Then puttin forth fists imposed to those
That acting like nothing but bitches and hoes
Suppose, all a nigga wanted was the good life
Living upper class, laying back on my ass
With a maid and a butler
Sipping on a ice cold glass
God damn it, I'ma do it but I had to start introducin
To em, to the mac nine plus one that's ten
And to think, many murders would of been avoided
I just wanted a friend, feel me
Better yet kill me, but I don't give a fuck
If I bust when I duck, cause I don't give a damn no mo'
You ain't dealing with the same motherfucker from three years ago
When a nigga fight fair, knocking a patch out your hair
With a quick lick, from a damn breaking, a nigga done went crazy
Look at what civilization done made me
This is my era of terror, I am the man with the gun
That admit it to the fist, never will I miss
When I be busting, a lot of your blood will be rushing
Was a nigga born like this
Innocent child with a smile with a dream of advanced
To the top, but I got a gun in your mouth
You want to respect me now, should of
Respected a nigga when you had a chance
Haters, been making me out of a punk trying to figure me weak
Better get ready, for them six foot put zip-locs
And a whole of cops, and a whole lot of blood stained
Sheets, drunk a lot of beers, she'd a bunch of tears
When I reminisce on them years, when I see little boys and girls
Living the life that I wanted to live
Since I really couldn't live with it
It's gonna be hard for the other motherfuckers to try
Cause they dying, hey mama
I want my Tonka toys right now
Don't make me cry, I don't wanna have to kill again
I kill em off, till the world is empty
Look at the the album cover
That's what you did to me

(*talking*)
If I done told you once
I done told you a thousand times
It's plain to see that you can't change me
Nigga cause I'ma forever be a nigga for life
A thug nigga, a Guerilla Maab nigga
A Killa Klan nigga, a Mo City nigga
Mo City mean mo killers, mo blood spillers
Mo burglars, mo murderers
Mo kick door burglars, mo niggas
That'll slap a patch out your motherfucking ass
For real, count on it, respect it
Trust it and believe it, we ain't no

Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh boy things will get brighter

After living through drive-by's got a nigga ready for war
500 push-ups everyday to keep my knock out punches up to par
Cause everybody want to test me, knocking them down punching
But they want to bust will I fight to jump so would the lord bless me
To keep on breathing leaving niggas unconscience
When I'm punching I'm going hard in the paint, so pack a lunch
To the niggas that we killing don't feel like you the only motherfucker
That really don't think we even love eachother
Gorilla till I die for real murdered by my right hand man
Or prosecuted by the white man's hand
I don't think I'm living to die, but I'm dying to live up under the stress
Fin to lose my cool so come out even to have you rest
All my sins are forgiven for living violently
With a gun in my hand, I'm creeping up on them moving silently
They left my peope alone when my cutlass exploded on the side of the road
The motherfuckers thought I died in the load

(Chorus - 2x)

(Z-Ro)
Am I the hunter or the most hunted
Telling my people they don't need a high to get by
But I'm telling a lie cause I'm the most blunted
Hard to practice my preaching when I'm under the stress
And I'm walking around with a 12-gauge sawed off
And a suicide note up under my vest
I want to live in peace but drama won't allow me
That's why my mind is gone, I'm seeing x's and tylenol three
But do you really want to see a nigga with the vendetta
Make everybody kill somebody I'm a trend setter
First I was spending my time with family mobbing showing my brother's love
Never thought it would it happen to shoot first releasing my brother's blood, uh
Why do these rookies want to rumble, got to do him in
Even if he's my kin that's the only way the cookies crumble
Calling up on your name in vain, this time I took a bow
But if there was ever a time I needed you god I need you now, lord oh mercy
Cause I don't wanto to die by the hands of my own kind
Really to get true to the overdose and free my own mind, hell yeah

(Chorus - 2x)

(Z-Ro)
I no longer need the weed to reach another level, I'm on a natural high
But I looked the devil in his eye, thinking the song I'm a survivor
Things ain't what they seem my yellows are green
People are demons, demons are people in my dreams, what does it mean
I'm trying come out of this motherfucking nightmare
Going against all odds but mama said they never fight fair
Somebody put a price on my head for living dead
Hoes was capping but now they in my bed, but they choosing to giving me head
Rags to riches, sagging the creases in my breaches
66 Impala candy dancing playing witht he switches
Finding away from righteousness and learning to sin
You'd be the same nigga that's kicking the door with me that's turning me in
Uh, why do the fiends buy dope from me they know they don't get high from me
Why do the fiends buy dope from me knowing that they gone die from me
A nigga was plexing with my partner why did he pull his gun
Now everybody related or cool with you can die that's on my son

I'm sick of this struggling all damn day
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray
This for the little kids that can't go play
Cause everybody outside playing with an ak
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost
Better not set trip, fuck around get tossed
I be a fool with that break them off
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off
Yeah I'm living a sin when against the grain
You don't know Z-Ro you don't know my pain
Tears be coming on down like rain
It's a full time job, trying to maintain
Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with dreams and hopes
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from songs I wrote
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill my shoes
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way
But one of these days gone be out there

Until we make it we mash together
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together

Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying alive

Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em spread
Me and my niggas we break bread, until the whole family's fed
You heard what, I said, in this, over bull
All that, I say, I speak, the truth

(Chorus - 2x)

Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime, and I know I'm wrong, but I got to get mine
Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay broke
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when she come home
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick
Give me a couple of zeros on a check
I might sweat, but never gone let up

Snatching our breath till it dims up your chest
How much pain can I manifest
When I come to wreck, ripping through your flesh, techs
My killers you'll never see, invisible invisible are we
Unseen like ghosts, strike like infrared beams make toast
We smoke the most but never bump the most
Our figgas are like a ropes around throats
Better fin to attack, cause we cloak in the image of smoke
Leaving motherfuckers broke like a king of jokes, mercy
I know not of a feeling, but the thriller
Of a killer gets my adrenaline rushing
Never stopping, watching niggas dropping
More breaking, blood gushing, I done opened the wounds
As I destroy cities with the fools, and masoons
Your doom has awaited, all your mercy is forsaken, time to die
Got to kill them all, every nigga fin to fall when I kill them all
Found them up in bombs, yelling stomach punches
Yelling and running K of dynasty coming

More of this contender, go-rilla, more member I be
It'd be a infinity, hoes want to get rid of me
Fin to be found dead and deceased
This ain't no game, ain't a damn thing changed
Cause I came to bring the pain
Glock ass still fits running on they head
While they play it I rise up in chains
Hag in here, hag in here, more deadly than anyone's intention
It had to be, more casualties
While I'm in more blemishes than fatal infections
Slice them up like a wolverine, but I use a machete and a guillotine
Want to stop like a king on my god damn dream
And now mark and ass niggas recognize my team

And tripping them niggas up with a 4-5
Hit the ground and running bud, then I probably bumping in blood

Steady with the dumb plexers, by the hand when I'm kicking your ass
And everybody better ball on
Cause I fuck around and y'all gone and a nigga like me
Cause I'm blessed with a tight 22, AK47, 3-57, Mac 11
Balling and and a 25, bulletproof vest and a sharpened shank
Motherfucker your body gone stank, I'm flawless
Swinging and leaving them jawless
One of these niggas are about to bleed
Running with the big dog follow my lead
They following they mama straight when we
Put him in the streets I'm a regular competitor
To the niggas that I want to act surely
Everybody want to live, let the early bird get the worm
Run up in the corner store bright early
Even though I be hanging with thugs
Giving me mugs, and I do a lot of drugs till I pass out
When I smell a dirty rat up all in my motherfucking face
I'm hunting they motherfucking ass out
Want to be stepping and pulling my whip
And I'm ready to go to war with them niggas
That be stepping and pulling back they fucking up grind
It's going down load the clip in the gun and I'm making them run
A gorilla nigga evermore buck and he died, but who was the nigga
That's talking down, don't really want me to get an attitude
I'm slapping haters up out the niggas that think of my trigger
Won't be getting no automatic beatdown but that's what I live for no mercy

Walking the land of a naked world
Looking down up on my enemies in vein
With a mind full of deadly games, I'ma serve your aim
Shouldn't of killed putting holes in your frame, feeling no remorse
As deadly force overcomes my thugs so bare witness
Sense of relentless, vengeance, and 24 victims of wickedness
By the hills of homicide, cause everytime I pull a whip and close
I can hear the sounds of bodies from the victim of 17 and reloads
Did you really believe that you could platinum-sieve a nigga like me
I was born to murder the world, but killers and g's and evil deeds
It'll be a whole lot fly bringing
Some saying if you run up on me the wrong way
I'ma be forced to pull a AK
Bust your ass in the head when the lead spray
My day, my day know you the fourth guy
To a region in mouth no time to shine
You the dead victim, of reincarnated

Dealing with insanity, probably dumping demanding me
Started out at a slow pace, now I'm losing it rapidly
Trying to keep my faith in God, but my spirit is scarred
I wanna do it but if I do it, I won't wake up to the Lord
I'm living hard, ain't nobody giving me no handouts
Since I'm one deep I get all the attention, therefor I stand out
Now everybody know, I don't socialize keeping
To myself, cause partnas might be bad to my health
Coming around, when I got a few ends when a nigga broke
They chunk the deuce, that's what they grooving
Mr. Z-Ro staying home alone, kicking it with my plastic or chrome
Until I find peace, I continue to roam
I just wanna be left alone, let me make it 'fore I snap this is my sermon
I'm a preacher, bitch this is deeper than rap

No one understands the life of the fast
Ain't no sense in, trying to close my eyes
Cause out this ghetto, I know that I must rise

I hope that you can cope, we killing eachother to make some divid-ends
I don't wanna sound crazy, but I'll make you push up daisies
You better give it up give it up, give it to me
Let me clear throat, even though I don't want to I'm hustling all night long
I had to learn the ropes, I got nickels and dimes
And 20's and halves, and even whole zones

You better give it up give it up, I gotta stay free

And ever since the days, of a little child
Sported a frown, like it was going out of style
Adolescence to juvenile, to a grown man
Innocent Christian, till I woke up with the blood on my on hand
God please forgive me for sinning, I'm on a mission
Gotta do something about it, fuck bitching with a vivid vision of prison
I'm paranoid, walking through the graveyard
On my knees screaming, release me from the demon
Mighty savior, the pain is major I've been hurting so long
I'd rather be wet when I'm depressed, cause I don't even know what's wrong

When a nigga hungry, and broke I go thru some mood swings
Lay it down motherfucker I got kids to feed
I was on the block when it moved slow, all Z-Ro needed was speed
Do I suffer from greed? I gotta get some cash quick
Cause I look back on my life a nigga ain't never had shit

And if you know who did the deed would you ride for me
Or did you squeeze the shot, jealous cause
I put my hustle to the fullest making it hard for you to bleed the block
That's what my father told me
Take care of your business nigga but don't rush it move slowly
Undercover with a birds eyes view, behind glass that's tinted
No licensee plates and expired ain't no telling who's in it
When you get paid, get another piece, tell me what you gone do
When all them niggas you've been capping on get to capping on you
Would you cry like a bitch, run up in yourself like a man
Or call on jesus when you see that warm blood on your hands
If the sun ain't shining, you better try to keep breathing
You won't make it to haven today, you just gone burn and bleed
But if you a soldier, who gone fuck around with you if you mobbing with

Looking at my partners when they talk to me, I laugh to myself
Fake ass handshakes I know they tend to be bad to my health
I was a nigga that was down to ride, and I guaranteed
The enemy layed it down to die ran out of ammo before he reloaded
I thought my nigga do it for me
The nigga that shot me ain't the killer he was suppose to be, I'm still here
I know your name and your face, and where you lay
I know where your daughter and your baby mama stay
Is it a good thing to die, and my reply is automatic
Keep your plexing to yourself cause static
Could turn into motherfuckers havoc
Jesus I don't know who to trust

Nigga even my girlfriend don't understand
Baby don't you realize I'm homeless
I'm homeless when it's raining and thundering
I'm about to take my own life but I'm not able to self destruct
But for the right price I'll pull the ak off the shelf and I'll bust
And if you wonder why my pants sag, I keep my pistol in my pocket
Cause motherfuckers want to see me take my last dance
But they can't catch rather I'm breathing or dead
And they can't stop me from reaching people, put me in the fed
Guaranteed, I'ma be smoking weed, pacing myself
Without a change in my schedule steady chasing my mail
Until my life is at the finish with no more breath in my lungs
I'ma put these bitch made niggas to rest not last in the sun

But all my niggas gone survive in this dirty game
Because we pack a 45 in this dirty game

Everyday my mind is set on money making ways
Even kick in doors, I can't be broke in money making days
I can't get no job in a white man's world that's why I live so raw
I can't watch my children starve homeboy so watch me break the law

[Chorus - 2x]

Ramon noodles, T. V. Dinners ain't no way to live
Rather be holding slab while grabbing grain rolling airport load for sive
In the streets of Houston Texas hustlers living in the cuts
On a mission chasing paper got no time for gold digging hoes get off my nuts

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'm turning suicidal in my older age, this game'll freeze you to death
And eveyrday I face the coldest stage
Tell me does every nigga that's thugging got to struggle to bubble
And so I'm ready to laugh successfully you don't want no troule
Cause I'm living more rugged than rougher than the rockiest road
I'm paronoid for life, got to keep a glock in the load
Am I addicited to caine (watch that tooting line)
Could it be a nigga that's hard to locate is somebody you could find
Z-Ro, certified platinum on a million dollar paper chase
Pulling up next to the police and blowing this weed in they face
But they try to blow my high when I'm on this hyper toiliking weed
But I'm gonna slice skills with hands that'll make you vomet and bleed
Aunte be worrying about me so I'm trying to get her to smile
But I know she know I'm wanted dead or alive
Got to keep my mind on my money making maneuvers cause my hustle is strong
A lot of fools get lazy now they hustle is gone
But I'm a hustler for life

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro talking]
Nigga hell yeah, know what I'm saying
Bridgemont Texas baby coming straight at you

My daughter needs pampers and milk
And my mind is confused on how we gone survive
So when you me strapped it looking with a bad one
You looking at the face of a desperate man I'm bringing the pain out with 45
But then I, fuck around and slip on my ski mask, ready to blast
Then I come through the door with a motherfucking 4-4
I want the Rolex watches and cash, and you can call the laws
I got another clip in my drawers, there'll be screaming and officers down
Because it's all about the money ain't a damn thing funny
What you got I'ma have out town, 'fore they put my ass in the ground

When a nigga be hustling on them corners

Hell of a hustler, got to work my muscle
Got to be wondering around, in the streets
Got to feet my feet, when I steel sweets
On a solo creep, nothing but a thug
Should of drove to them hoes, never wanted hoes
Got to keep my mind on my money, cause I got a dream
While pulling up on the scene, jumping out of paper land
Tell me if Hilfiger chose those jeans
Got a crease, and it never ceased to amaze me
By the individual hustle, that'd pay me
When I got to provide for my baby, and maybe
I be creaming the fucking, music and deep got to hit the week
Got to get a fat pocket, on a get it out free
Not the H. P. D., even though Ft. Baylow can't stop it
Got to be true to the game, never new to the game
A nigga did two and a half of the game, and I show no shame
Creeping your hustle, really means mess with the way that you make your change
Got a set of pumps and a nigga fool come through, and hit from the back
Were you thinking you a g, when you fucking that hoe
But I'm laving your frame and for chest, matter of fact I'm
Ready for the money like a bombs, so I said it be running out that chrome
Niggas be coming to the serve when I slam
But they better be ready, to find them another way home
When it should of got dark, for the money
Got to take a nigga life in the hustle
Wondering brah, I don't want to make no god damn headlines
I don't want to do, no god damn fed times

(Chorus - 2x)

Could it be the worst nightmare, hoping to God
A motherfucker where a nigga don't fight fare
Sticking and moving and bobbing and weaving
I'm lowered to a gauge, hold it right there
Selling my drugs and my gorilla thugs, man it don't stop till a nigga get paid
All in my homes what I'm about, trying to move an album funky like Dre
But I'm everyday, thinking about my rent and my phone bill
And my light bill, and my water bill, and I can't spill and my people peel
Every other motherfucking day it's a sequel heal, but I keep on climbing
I gotta get the diamonds in the grill, and the creases
And the clothes but the yellow bone hoes, keep popping me and ain't stopping me
And everyday cause a nigga be knocking me, but I'ma plant this on a nigga
Even nigga want to try me, fuck around and need me here I be
Nigga where's your Ridgemont I. D., have a motherfucker hollering out why me
And it's plain to see me losing the game, my life end

Feel what I say up under the evidence is still your homie
You must of forgot about the days until you be in 94
When it was 72 where partners sagging creases to find a hoe
Now they can't look me in the eyes, cause they might tell on theyself
About having something to do with trying to riddle my number one partner to death
You want to get even with me boy clear you can see me with a rap
But I'm about gangsta shit so bow before you see me with a strap
Cause I've been silent for so long, it's about time I broke the ice
Nobody want to box me why everybody want to pull a trigger to take a life
I'm down with crews cause everybody else is fake to me
Niggas with plex against me, they all cakes to me
And everybody want to be talking about they real and they got love
But motherfuckers don't love Z-Ro unless I got drink and I got bud so I got plex

Better have your life right in the bottle of your vest

Regular candy in river rain, we came to deliver pain
One hitter quitters and eagle talons up in your liver man
I came to bring the pain, all the way from the south to the west
Every one of my bullets are looking residence so they gone house in your chest
A nigga done been through so much shit the last five years of my living
Now a days the bitches are realer than homeboys so here's to my women
But then again I'm all alone I don't depend on a soul
Independently made a million then I took my benz on a stroll
Now everytime I come around my partners treat me like strangers
Never thought it would come to this I got to keep one in the chamber
What makes real niggas turn into hoes and make niggas go fraud
When it comes to me whether rapping them off to see this nigga go hard
Now everytime I come around my partners treat me like strangers
Never thought it would come to this I got to keep one in the chamber
What makes real niggas turn into hoes and make niggas go fraud
When it comes to me whether rapping the gangsta shit this nigga goes hard, plex

Rolling by my motherfucking self you don't want to plex my friend
Fuck around with me and you might never breathe a breath again
Cause a nigga might shoot you in a place where it takes longer to die
And you know what they say no pain no gain
I guess you fin to gain your heavenly high
Marcus I see you when you shoved that pistol up in his nose
Pulling the trigger my nigga blood was dripping all out on his clothes
Do you think that I'm suppose to sit back and charge it to the game
That's why your baby mama house went up in flames you know my name
I wish I would of been strapped cause my partner would of still been alive
I would of ran up on your ass and I would of dumped and you would of died
Since a nigga can't change the past I'ma knock your ass up out of the future
I use to be down to dump side by side with you but you forced me to shoot you
Too many of these boys be bulletproof, that's why they like to compete
But run your badass over Ridgemont you be dead before you get to Ridgecrete
You think it's a game, but I've been working on a straight aim I'm ready to kill
If I can't get to myself when you want to get leid by set of bitch got skills

I make all my money from selling all these drugs
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose
But I slowed down my hustle cause I'm digging you
And I, won't keep on hogging you
Even though you're the only girl I'm talking to
I'm in it to win it and I don't want to lose
But if I lose you, it's all a part of paying dues

[Z-Ro]
We went from good to better, better to worse then we separated
I should of beeped you to apologize but I guess I changed
Cause I be feeling like you wanted to end
Don't want to be your enemy baby, but I can't be your friend
Female associates are gone, miss, I loved you
And treated your kid as if he was my own kid
So if you think I was affatuated, bet one hundred c-notes
That I show you what it is to be broke
When I was ready to misbehave and get paid, my nigga run at me now
Knew it was peticular car cause I got you on my mind
Even all the days of my life I want you staying with me
But the way it's been it don't get gravy until you laying with me
Cause we be at eachother's thugs like we were crypts and bloods
Always the first to say I'm sorry grab your hips and shove
I want to kick it but I got business to handle with my crew
Call me later when you ready to say I do
Baby to know me is to love a thug

[Chorus:]

[Z-Ro]
Forgive me baby I'm a thug, what happened to all the capping
Now that I'm rich you want to greet me with kisses and hugs
I had to stop chasing you, I chose to chase my feddy
Now I get promenade in an escallade, and be low keyed in my cheve
Now you looking like you want to curse
Never put trust in the woman or a nigga, only put trust in my verse
Cause if it is well then I'll understand
If you ain't helping me making you could find another man
I'll get my pen and she is number one in my state
Got ladies looking from me head to chest then the navel
Willing and abel to be dedicated from the heart
Must of mistaken me for yourself that's why I cheated from the start
Freaky in the dark, baby I bet I make you c**
And if your nigga don't like it, I bet I'll make him run
I bet these bitches be tripping over the way I run through em like socks
Like them old niggas run through throw away glocks
Should of known me is to love a thug

Where is the love - 2x
[Z-Ro]
Nobody loves me, but I prefer to keep it like that
Cause
most friends are falsified trying to steal out your stack
So I keep my partnas to a minimum
even though I know half can't be trusted
The only feeling in the world might steal your girl
if I know flesh was lusted
Nigga now who was to blame for the pain cause fucking with me nigga
you get sprayed
Hardheaded that's like fucking a bitch with no condom
And knowing that hoe
got aids, better be smart, better keep your distance
Ain't got elements from loose leaf pages
When
I'm going off in the rage of furious chambers of twin gauges
My calico murders offending my
mind and my mind is so ready to click
Better freeze, better not breathe all I want is the money
Remember
you dead if you twitch, cause I'm a killa that's killing for cash
I show no car crash when I'm
stealing your stash
Don't fill in the streets because I'm too fast
But never revealing what's
under my mask
I'm making a dash, I jump in the Hoover and I smash
With a foot on the gas and then
I'm off in the night
A nigga was buried alive
But he really should of died dig him up his coffin
too tight
A nigga was showing a busta love, but now it's hunting for a busta season
And he can't
be the reason, to run in your crib and leave you bleeding
[Chorus - 4x]
(talking)
The question
at hand is
Where's your motherfucking love
I'ma do like that boy Al D said
I'm showing love
to the ones that showed love back
Fuck friends, so Mexican D, Grady
You know where your love

Why, do we live this way
So many murders, where the children play
And it's about, to make me lose my mind
We're running out of time, too many of my people dying
[Z-Ro]
Day by day it's more impossible, to hold on
I'm going head up with the shadow of death, and getting stole on
Will I survive, is God gonna come and save me
I started out as a Christian, now look at how this world made me
I'm crazy, and I can't make it no better
Cause I can't stand none of my friends, my only love is for the cheddar
I remember, sipping on Tangaray and getting high
Down with eachother, long as we was barely getting by
We grown men, and all living in sin
Shooting a kite to my people, cause he in prison again
Letting him know that the streets ain't changed, still wicked
Plus I been burying so many motherfuckers, we bound to kick it
Up close and personal, cause niggaz be pushing my button
I handle my bidness, and exit they homes gangsta strutting
One deep, nobody's got my back
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
Trying to stab me in my back, and if they could they would
That's why I pack my twin bitches, cause I don't even feel safe in the hood
At least on lock, you know what the danger is and what's not
Free world you'll be evicted, when a coward bust shots
That's the life cycle, kick it with real niggaz
And never let the shife by you, because the devil is they idol
Man they tied up my nigga, and sawed off his head
The cold part about it, they ain't even take no bread

Is it reality or just a fable
The most powerful lyricists in the world was on a low budget label
Even if I don't clear me in I just want to be living well
Not saying that heaven is promised to me but I don't want to believe in hell
Feeling on coming also cause problems worry me
If it ain't the stress somebody's always trying to bury me
So thinking I'm undercovers and the dope they try to deal me
Jealousy and envy make my niggas want to kill me
Everybody want to pick up a gun and bust thinking artillery fin to be
Drilling me nigga
But I' sick of this pistol play bumping ain't no more killng me nigga
Cause I'm a soldier, trying to keep his mind at ease
And if I squeeze then we all bleed

Feel a nigga worldwide, not just in Texas
I think I'm bout to lose my mind, aggravated and restless
I don't want to die

[Z-Ro]
Look at how they made me, traditon systems raised me
The drama that they give me never ceases to amaze me
They tell me that my mind's gone, coming up is what my mind's on
I guess there's nothing left to do but get my grind on
Thinking about my family but knowing they neglect me
I'm not gonna give up, I'm gonna make my family respect me
I'm talking to my father now, daddy I'm a grown up
Depending on you is false-a-fied because you haven't shown up
Caught up in these streets I'm taking penitentiary chances
I done forgived and I done forget plus I'm not giving you anymore chances
Quick to run out of the house for nothing now your son is feeling anger
Remember the times you couldn't come around because your life has been in danger
I'm a leader to follow is not my destiny
But I guess it was written for me to fall victim to jealousy
It's killing me to stay alive, but there ain't no use in me crying
No matter what I guess it's what is right, on southside

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Whoever would of thought that I would be this fam-ous
Put in work until it hurt but keep pretending it's pain it's
Affiliated with killers when we fight us to the death
Picture your partner cocked and aim and headed straight for your chest
It's hard to focus cause my homies keep on killing eachother
Everybody stressing cause ain't nobody feeling eachother
I often conversate with god but who's to say if he's listening
Even though I died as a sinner but resurrected as a christian
At 11 years old I was told that most friends turn to foes
From velicos to calicoes it helps when our battle folds
If it ain't true, if it ain't crew, it's a mexican deed
I'ma catch an attitude instntly bitch you plexing with me
And ain't no begging for mercy because you shot my nigga
And I swear to god everywhere you go it's gone be hot my nigga
And maybe god can forgive you but see the streets seeing different
They want you dead you might not make it to prison, bitch

Living my life on the corner with thugs selling my drugs known as a chiller
But push my button watch your life cause I transform to a killer
Me sipping the drink me smoking me dank me tipping me herb and formaldehyde
Open it all of me niggas are ready to ride
Could I be innocent till proved guilty by Judge Judy,
But the fact remains, they confiscated my weed and my uzi
Now I'm in correctional facilities, living raw
Sharing a cell with the niggas that I whupped on in the free world
But ain't a god damn thing changed I'm still breaking a jaw
Ain't fin to lose no sleep, over nan one of y'all, one of y'all with fours
Could run up on me, and I guarantee that one of y'all gonna fall

These jealous haters until they hear 1-9-3-2-0-7-0-6-8-T-W
In the free world one more god damn gin, causing havoc and fury
I'ma be popping pills, smoking that kill and for the members of the jury
Cause vengeance is mine, but I'm locked down, feeling forsaken

Asking me what does this mean to me
But I'm ready for the combat give me my motherfucking law back
bitch I don't want no needles in me, y'all thinking I mean it, trying to do me
In a room full of ever men taking my mind to a place that I never been
But I'm a soldier roamed the battlefield, in the middle of the war
You either have to die or have to kill, so I ain't guilty motherfucker
Raise up off of my N-you-T's, cause you can't harm me
Everlasting, I'm ever blasting I recking you better get the army to swarm me
Because the Indonesia canibus helps me tackle the pain
But I'm getting so weak because I'm shackled in chains
Now my brain is going insane, feeling like my spirit is about to get evicted
Cause I'm a victim of a world so wicked, time and time

Cause my brain is going insane lately, see how many
Enemies that I have and how viscously they hate me
Deliver my life from they power forgive my sins, see my sorrow, feel my pain
Let it never be said I trusted you in vein
Long as I'm walking this earth my problems go from bad to worse
And I know it's gonna be that way until they lower my casket in the dirt
But all I'm asking for is just a little piece of mind, and I know
That if I keep the faith it shouldn't be hard for me to find
But my mind is hard to turn the other cheek, could of been a wise man
Because of the revelation of scripture that I speak
Everyday for twenty motherfucking years
A nigga been facing so many fears, and nothing shedding so many tears
But dear Sandra don't cry, all I can say is if they kill me I took it
But even in death I'm victorious they couldn't fade me

Bio plavo nebo cisto
Poslije tebe
Nista nece biti isto
Jos trenutak sa mnom budi
Drugi dani, drugi ljudi
Vec sutra bice tu
Nijemi, pored nas.

Dan, nas je dan
Bio samo luda igra
Poslije tebe
Na mom licu prva briga
Ti jos nista nisi rekla
Ali suza vec je pekla
I sutra bices ti sama
K'o I ja.

Juce jos, juce jos
Nismo znali sta nas ceka
Jer je nosila nas rijeka
Juce jos, ja I ti

Juce jos, juce jos
Kako godine prolete
Ti si bila samo dijete
Juce jos, juce jos

Juce jos, juce jos
Nisam znao sto su suze
Al' mi ljubav neko uze
Juce jos, ja I ti

Juce jos, juce jos
Ali blizila se zima
Pramen magle, pramen dima
Juce jos, juce jos....."

Don't Panic (Panic!)

Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude I don't think we have the choice
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Gotta look just right
Dressing to impress the boys

Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Wheres the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird.

Should I go movie star glamorous, sassy or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me
It's the night of our nightmares
It's the night of our dreams
It's too late to back out of it.
Hey, makeovers, massages.
Don't know what a corsage is.
Been waiting all our lives for this.

It's gonna be a night (can't wait)
To remember (aw man)
Come on now, big fun (alright)
It's gonna be the night (I guess)
To last forever (lucky us)

Wheres my shaver?
Ooh, I love it.

Should I fluff it?
It's get later already should be there.

Her mother opens the door, I'm shakin inside
He's here, it's time, the hours arrived.
Don't know why, her fathers staring me down
Wheres my purse? Lip gloss? Now I'm really freaking out.
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes

We could be anything we wanna be
You can tell by the noise that the boys are back again
Together making history

It's time to show how to be a superhero
Just like a showdown, Will Smith and Bobby De Niro
We're the best, no doubt, doing it like we used to do
This is our time and I'm telling you all

The boys are back, the boys are back
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighborhood

The boys are back, the boys are back
Climbing up the walls anytime we want
The word is out, the boys are back

The boys are back, back to save the day
The boys are back, oh yeah

Keep coming with the right, win the fight every single time
Undefeated here in our house, yeah
We can rock, we can shock, anytime we like
And tonight we're going all out

It's time to show how to be a superhero
Just like a showdown, keep the pedal to the metal
We're the best, no doubt, doing it like we used to do
This is our time and I'm telling you all
Lookout

The boys are back, the boys are back
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighborhood

The boys are back, the boys are back
Climbing up the walls anytime we want
The word is out, the boys are back

Here to change the world
To solve the mystery, fight the battle, save the girl
No one can stop us now
We're the ones that make the rules, oh

The boys are back
Oh yeah

The boys are back, the boys are back
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighborhood

The boys are back, the boys are back
Climbing up the walls anytime we want
No need to worry

'Cause the boys are back, the boys are back
The boys are back, gonna do it again
And we make it look good

The boys are back, the boys are back
Tearing down the walls, anytime we want
I'm sure that you know by now

Zac Efron,The Other Side,/z/zac+efron/the+other+side_21251417.html,"Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream 
And it'll wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine

Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

Fifteen

I'd do eight

Twelve

Maybe nine

Ten

Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do
(To the other side)
So if you do like me
(We're going to the other side)
'Cause if we do we're going to the other side
We're going to the other side"

It's not gonna be the same around here without you
And I'm holding back a flood behind one tear

And we'll go down to the post-mortem bar
And catch up on the years that have passed between us
And we'll tell our stories

I never thought that I would ever see the day
And I don't wanna believe it's true
You were supposed to always be there
And a part of me has died with you

And we'll go down to the post-mortem bar
And catch up on the years that have passed between us
And we'll tell our stories
Do you remember when the world was just like a carnival opening up

Zendaya,Rewrite The Stars,/z/zendaya/rewrite+the+stars_21212113.html,"You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
Fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you
It's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you

It feels impossible (it's not impossible)
Is it impossible?

Say that it's possible

How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you
And it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied"

Lose all that gold, it’s all the same

Don't you ever let anybody put you down
Coz you are my little angel

Then she makes something warm for me to drink
Coz it's cold out there, she thinks
Then she walks me to school, Yes I aint no fool
I just think my Mom is amazing

Bridge/Chorus
She makes me feel
Like I can do anything
And when she's with me
There's no where else, I'd rather be...

After School, she's waiting by the gate
I'm so happy that I just can't wait
To get home to tell her how my day went
And eat the yummy food, only my Mom makes

Then I wind her up cos I don't wanna bath
And we run around the house with a laugh
No matter what I say, she gets her way
I think my Mom is amazing

Bridge/Chorus

In the evening, she tucks me into bed
And I wrap my arms around her head
Then she tells me a tale of a girl far away
Who one day became a princess

I'm so happy, I don't want her to leave
So she lies in bed with me
As I close my eyes, how lucky am I
To have a Mom that's so amazing

Bridge/Chorus

Then I wake up in the morning, she's not there
And I realize she never was
And I'm still here in this lonely orphanage
With so many just like me

And as my dreams begin to fade
I try hard to look forward to my day
But there's a pain in my heart that's a craving
How I wish I had a Mom that's amazing
Would be amazing"

Why don't we play our part what has hardened our hearts?
What has hardened our hearts?

Underneath the waterfall, million dollar shopping mall
Two boys play their games, helps to keep them nice and warm
Thousand people walking by, feeding their vain desire
Don't they see, are they blind, Allah loves the orphan child
Allah loves the orphan child

Like our Beloved Muhammad, Peace be upon Him
He was an orphan and Allah sheltered him
What status is given to these children… children?

Just by the riverside, right next to that orphan child
Families come to play, they don't see that's where she stays
Looking through empty eyes, who cares that she might die
O my child, don't you cry, Allah loves you more than I
Allah Love's you more

Their time
And while we call ourselves civilized, many people
Living empty lives
As they drone their way through day and night

I pray for our world to be filled with smiles
Like the colours of a rainbow and not just black and
White
I pray for our world to be filled with light

I pray for all of us, to choose the path that's right
To believe in Allah every day of our lives

In the evening on the tv news, I see images of war.
I see brother killing brother with no consequence at
All.
And while those who claim to be leaders, sell us tales
Of deceit.
But Allah alone know in their hearts what they reveal
And conceal.
And while we call ourselves civilized,
We go on killing human lives
Too caught up in our own web of lies

In time

Memories fade like a dusty window pain
And you can't see you past no more
The only thing that remains is that feeling of warmth
In your heart that will always be there, be there
An immortal smile, stays only for a while
But down the line, it strengthens us inside
We all live the illusion of many days to come
Not realizing that tomorrow lies with Allah

The only One,
The only One

Time goes by on the wings of a butterfly
And what goes with it is all that you have
So take the best of every moment, take the best of every man
Then move on and don't ever look back.. Don't look back"

When she was young she was beautiful and strong
The more children she had the more things went wrong
Now she's feeling old an dcold
And her heart doesn't feel love anymore

She sat me down and told me to sing her song
Maybe it would make her feel better,
Maybe her children would sing along
And see the wrong we have done,
Make amends to ment her heart

She still wouldn't hate none of her children
No matter what cruel things they've done
She'll always be there when her baby's crying
She's a mother she's a mother you can depend on

She's hopin'her children will love her again
Like once she remember,
Before skyscrapers and chemical plants
When she was all that we had,
Before they polluted her sacred land

Now her tears are falling like acid rain
And her voice sounds like earthquake
I had to beg her: ""mother, please don't leave
Give another chance, i'll talk to the kids

Momma loves to work, Daddy loves to play
Sometimes Daddy gotta go far away
I'm too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep, I'm gonna give you a fight

I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free

Wake you up a 5 am, before the sunrise I'll be your friend
And you know I don't want for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear my song

'Cause I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free

I'm gonna miss you now, Mister far away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you could bring it back to me
Color in the lines define this whole world for me

I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free

Practice makes perfect, and that I agree
But don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I've been told you reap what you sow

So I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free

Momma's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat, alright

I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry cry cry
Set the children free

Set the children free
Set the children free
Set the children free
(Free of their hearts, free of theirs minds)
Set the children free
(Free of their dreams, their imagination)
Set the children free
Set the children free
Set the children free

Everywhere
There is no happy song to sing when every time I'm frowning
I watch my back as I pass through cause they're aiming their bullets at me

Never forget your dreams life is full of ups and downs yea
No matter how hard it seems never forget your dreams
Just take it day by day by day by day by day by day
Day by day by day by day by day
We laugh at them for they know their day is coming
The wicked draw their sword to slay the upright
The wicked bend their bows to cast down the poor
Yet their swords shall pierce them in their own hearts
Never you lose your faith things and times will have to change yea
Say you might be down today but never you lose your faith
Just take it day by day by day by day by day by day

Never forget your dreams life is full of ups and downs yea

Dangerous

Now wake up lazy mind sleep for you

Now youth responsible, when all else
Have failed
And there will be no more blaming
Someone else

So glad to see
This generation will make the change,
Hard as it may be
My generation will make the change, this
Ain't no talk no cheap

Catch the wave, free the slave, emancipate your mind

Catch the wave (I'm gonna catch the wave), and free your slave (I'm gonna free my slave)

That man shall, endure forever more
And it was written, up in the book of life
That man shall, endure forever more

(Damian Marley)
Well did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh is not the ending to life fear not of the Anti-Christ
Did you know that I exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go a Zion and a wear jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your bodies just a vehicle
Transporting the soul
It's what's inside people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Every day dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the time take toll

[Chorus:]

(Capleton)
It is told that once this greasy order
Is form it comes into a young man's world
And two of dem is like a soldier
That joins the thunder is a wonder
One's attack is like a blunder
One is luckily a stranger
Dem both was born like Jesus inna manger
So join the thunder that's savin' our world

[Bridge:]
(Damian Marley)
A vester on his chest and rastafari is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got
Lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs through my veins

(Capleton)

(Drag-On)
Watch for sticks and stones
Stumbling blocks and piles
Life is one big road miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
And most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic
Blowing in through the air
So keep it realistic and always be aware
The truth is crying out
And it's so loud and clear, but most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution is in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari
Is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine

Saturday in the morning and the rain kept falling
Brother didn't get no sleep now he's really feeling beat
But there is no time to waste as the devil test his faith
He just walks away on a mission to complete

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking oh find you will be fine

She has her hand on her jaw as she wonders away
What will tomorrow bring will her dreams just disappear
She find words are hard to say so she prays everyday
She must find a way may the pieces fall into place

Frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something

Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Searching for something, looking for something"

I'll take you to the temple tonight

All my days I've been searching, to find out what this life is worth
Through the books and bibles of time I've made up my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert, this is a calling have you heard
Bring all the lovers to the fold, cause no one is gonna lose their soul

Love is my religion, Love is my religion, Love is my religion
Hey you can take it or leave it, and you don't have to believe it

I don't want to fight, hey let's go fly a kite
There's nothing that we can't cure, and I'll keep you in my arms for sure

So don't let nobody stop us, free spirits have to soar
With you I share the gift, the gift that we now know oh oh oh

[Chorus:]

Well I'm done searching now, I found out what this life is worth
Not in the books that I find, but by searching my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert
This is the calling have you heard, bring all the lovers to the fold
No one is gonna lose their soul

But they don't know naught, naught

Hey, it's not what's on the outside my brethren
It's what's in the heart
And the real you is inside of you my sistren
You know who you really are

All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
That's all they do is talk
Watch them chatty mouth a bark

Blessed be Jah my rock who teaches my hands
To wage war and my fingers to do the battle.
My love, my fortress, my strong hold, my deliverer, my shield in whom I've taken
Refuge and the one who subdues my people under me.
Oh Jah, what is man? Man is breath, his days are like passing shadow.
Oh, Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend, touch the mountains so that they
Smoke, flash forth the lightning and strike them, shoot forth thy arrows and
Confound them.

I know there is revolution brewing, I can see
People, I know there is a solution in you and me
Now they think they can fool all the people
But they can't and they ain't
Yes, they think they can fool all the people
But they ain't cause they can't

Falsely proclaimed leaders
They claim they're the leaders of men
But what is this, who are you?
And how can you be, how can you be
Who you ain't?

All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
Promise you this, promise you that
Chat behind the innocent back (repeat)
Them chatty mouth a bark
Yes all they do is talk
Them chatty mouth a bark
And all they do is talk
Promise you this, promise you that
Chat behind the innocent back (repeat)

All they do is talk, them chatty mouth a bark (repeat 3 times)

Them chatty mouth a bark and them can't defend them talk"

How could I be so wrong
To think that we could get along
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I count they'd be a million or two

But I walk on through that memory
That haunts me oh man that haunts me
I say I trod on through that angry grief
That taunt me, that taunts me

There she goes crying again
But her sexiness wn't cover her shame
And there she goes she's taking her true love
But while she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How, how, how could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Days I've spent wasted with you child

Now I walk on through those memories
That wants me oh man that wants me

That taunts me I know it taunts me

And there she goes, she's taking true love

Why should I be so dumb

Come on let's color the world in green
Let's make a difference in the way we dream
We're going to color a smiling face
On the people of the human race

You got me mile high cause you're my little pilot
I'm smiling, no sand in the hour glass
We can let the hours pass, baby, cause you're timeless
It's easy living right beside you
We got it, whatever we go through, baby

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cervesa cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

See, it's a Monday through Friday, 365 celebration
A every day-cation
Let my kiss be an open invitation
See where it can take us and get our hearts racing
I love flying way up there with you
You keep the air up in my parachute, baby

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, let's have a party
Get it sounding like Marley in here
Serve the cervesa cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving

Let love keep us lifting, my dear

She is my morning sun and when the evening come
She's the moonlit sky, yeah

Happy people do it one and one, let your tear be gone

The queen of my desire, you're my music from my song
The wood in on my fire, you're my fire that's never gone
Who feels it knows, fgl how it goes

Or write your own though there's a chance

You left a world of broken hearts
You couldn't tell us why
You only made us cry
Like in '64
The days are long the gloom is hid by night
They make a point we can't deny
The pain we can't conceal
The feelings that we feel
Those that never heal
So here's a lullabye
Close your eyes and sleep tonight
So here's a lullabye
Close your eyes and make us cry

The world you dreamed
We tried to make our lives
You made a point we can't deny
I know the dream was real
The difference is feel
How mysterious
You stole the show, you know you played it right
Way back in 1965
Oh no, well well
The truth was far from real
Reality was feel
Why not save a seal

The days are long your tune is in the song
Without your love along the way
You said the things you know could make it right
If we did'nt lose the way"

To be with you
And you smile at me while thinking ""Yeah it's only fair""

I wanna live my life
Sometimes my own way
Some people always get involved
They spoil it, destroys it and kills it again
But one beautiful day I will live my life
In a good way

They will realise what they're doing wrong
Your bigger brother or sister always get what they want
I don't know if they hate you
Or have a comparism

When Mr. Lonely and Mr. Frustration comes

""Why do I have so much trouble?""
삶은 멀쩡한 날개를 꺾고 대신 십자가를 쥐여줬어
한 발자국에 숨이 가빠
Nobody knew my existence

I'll never regret what had happened
난 불모지에서 뿌리를 내렸고 눈보라 칠 때 열매를 맺었어
괴물을 꺼내지 않으면 이 테스트를 끝내지 못해

평생을 동굴 안에 갇힌다면 you choose light or dark
편하게 박쥐로 남던가
처음엔 주변을 밝힐 만한 양초를 찾다
불을 손에 넣자 꺼내 들어 다이너마이트
인간은 다 기회보다 앞서간 자의 머리챌 잡아
구원의 손길을 원하는 자여 먼저 그 손에 반지부터 빼

목표치로 삼은 높이만큼 거꾸로 묻혀 봐

나의 존재를 계속 깜빡하는 이유였나

Do you see what I mean?
여기는 날 벼르는 새끼들 천지
고통에 무뎌 두려움을 스릴로 느끼지 Safety frigidity
현실주의자의 hyperreal 허구처럼 살아 허구한 날 ha

배춧잎으로 배를 채워 becoming vegan
갈증 안 가실 땐 독극물 삼키고 hiccup
선악과를 따서 입가심으로 씹어
저마다 입속에 뱀을 한 마리씩 키워
Huh 손사래 치면 불행은 멀리서
달려와 High Five 하고 피식 히죽여
No peace for the wicked, no more love

ZICO,One-Man Show,/z/zico/one+man+show_1718815.html,"[Verse 1: zico]
조명 대신 음소거된 tv, 협탁엔 찌그러진 캔이
넌 허술한 핑곗거리를 대고 다급하게 옷을 챙기지
도어락이 닫히면 곧바로 사색에 잠겨, god damn it
서로를 발가벗기며 한 번도 솔직한 적 없던 밤
불장난치는 쿨한 사이, 현타가 와, 이 온도 차이
비슷한 처지가 있는지 괜히 검색해, 정색해
그날 만약 맨 정신에 커피를 마셨음 얘기가 많이
달라졌을까

[Chorus: zico]
내 기분은 더 이상 enjoy 하지 않아
어차피 우린 첫 단추부터 fucked up 됐어, 어쩌겠어
난 빌어먹을 침대보다 안정감을 줄 수 있다고, yo
I think there is no other way

[Verse 2: Sik-K]
말했잖아, 보고 싶음
네가 나한테 오면 안 되니, yeah
또 난 아무것도 아니었단 생각들이 가득 차 괜히
네가 누군갈 기다리는 것처럼 나도 너를 waitin’
너도 나랑 똑같아, 혼자만 생쇼하는 건, 이 멍청아
부딪쳐서 spark만 팍 튀는 사이
네 입맛에 안 당기는 style
밀어는 내도 안 당기는 사이
팔랑 귀에 팔랑 귀를 가지니깐
너 포함 너의 지인 다
구분하겠지 내 감정 대놓고
넌 휩쓸리다가 나를 곧 놓쳐
나도 싫어 슬픈 결말
연기라도 해줘 sometime

[Chorus: zico]
내 기분은 더 이상 enjoy 하지 않아
어차피 우린 첫 단추부터 fucked up 됐어, 어쩌겠어
난 빌어먹을 침대보다 안정감을 줄 수 있다고, yo
I think there is no other way

[Verse 3: zico]
네 사소한 드립에 매일 오만가지 해석을 해
'야 이 미친 새끼야 정신 차려', 혼잣말이 버릇돼
난 내용물도 없는 판도라의 상자를 두고
열지 말지 몇 달째 제자리, ah shit
제대로 만나보자고 강수를 두려다가도
보조출연자 대사가 얼마나 임팩트 있겠냐고
난 싸이월드 시절도 이 정도 감성충은 아녔어
당장은 아니라 바뀔 수 없지만

[Outro: zico]
사랑하게 됐나 봐, 이쯤에서 끝내자
사귄 적도 없는데 후폭풍이 걱정돼, 어떡해
쪽팔림 감수하면서 one man show 하는 것도 지쳐
I think there is no other way"

[Verse 1: ZICO, IU]
In the middle of their youth
A girl and a boy live on a small island
The mood is like the weather here
Bright red fruits have blossomed
The other side felt a little unfamiliar
But now it’s the place I cherish the most
Like bedsheets I don’t want to come out from

[Verse 2: ZICO, IU]
Why did it have to be you?
Every day, I’ll tell you a different reason
Even if I can’t recognize the shape
You’re the person to draw the outline with

[Chorus: ZICO]
You waited for a long time
Hello, my soulmate
Everything became more like you
A transparent knot has been tied
You can’t leave this place, not even for a moment

[Verse 3: ZICO]
Stuck with each other
Laying on a big sofa
Playing around and feeding each other spoonfuls of ice cream
Put your hand on mine
And let’s dance in the daytime without any music
Our party is filled with word bubbles
Every time I breathe, I feel your scent
Even waking up is so fun
I can even get jealous of things that never happened
We fight a lot but it’s fine

[Verse 4: ZICO, IU]
These day
We’ve both taken out our own clocks
And we’re pouring sand inside without holding back
Even if we only have great days ahead of us
I only want to go back to your heart

[Chorus: IU]
You waited for a long time
Hello, my soulmate
Everything became more like you
A transparent knot has been tied
You can’t leave this place, not even for a moment

[Bridge: ZICO, IU]
Love is the true art
My expressions are increasing with time
You make me write words and draw pictures
Every time we meet
It feels like I’m going away on a trip somewhere
Oh I’ll stay by your side

[Outro: IU, ZICO]
You waited for a long time
Hello, my soulmate
Everything became more like you
A transparent knot has been tied
You can’t leave this place, not even for a moment"

나 같은 사람들이 발버둥 쳤기 때문에, yeah
We always say, 나중에 그 나중에를 위해
건너뛴 생일을 빼면 여태 난 십 대
철들수록 부쩍 상상이 두려워
미끄럼틀도 서서히 비탈길로 보여
낯선 친절은 의심 가
뻔한 위로가 더 기운 빠져
화기애애한 대화창 속 넌 정말 웃고 있을까
거리낌 없이 아무 데나 걷기엔
피해야 될 것이 너무 많은 곳에서
태어날 때나 늙어갈 때
움츠린 채 사는 우리

다를 거 없이 하찮은 하루
유독 좋은 일만 피해 갔구나
어릴 적 그림 속 어른이 된 난
분명 기쁜 표정이었는데

한 평생이 오늘까지면
발길을 돌릴 곳이 있나요
멋쩍다는 이유로
미루었던 사랑해란 말을, oh, oh
너에게 건네줘 right now

[Verse 2]
조심해, 시간은 무섭게 속력을 낼 거야
넘어지지 않게 서로 손잡이가 되어줘
개인이 할 수 있는 일은 실망밖에 없어
터질 듯 쌓여버린 이야기보따리를 풀어
삶은 교묘한 장난을 안 멈춰, uh
네가 공짜로 생명을 얻은 날부터, uh
우선시되는 무언가에 늘 묻혀있지 행복은
화려한 꽃밭 틈에서 찾는 네잎 클로버
나쁜 마음씨를 들킬까
너 나 할 것 없이 눈치 봐
걱정 마, 좀 부족해도 누군가는
인간다움을 느껴
남의 눈에 좋은 사람이기 전에
나 자신한테 먼저 화해를 청해
어렵다는 거 모두가 알아
이번이 처음 살아 보는 거잖아

[Pre-Chorus]
다를 거 없이 하찮은 하루
유독 좋은 일만 피해 갔구나
어릴 적 그림 속 어른이 된 난
분명 기쁜 표정이었는데

[Chorus]
한 평생이 오늘까지면
발길을 돌릴 곳이 있나요
멋쩍다는 이유로
미루었던 사랑해란 말을, oh, oh
너에게 건네줘 right now

Un grand monsieur, noir comme la nuit
Sa demoiselle avec lui

Tourne, tourne dans mes bras

Je lui ai vu une dernière fois
Un oiseau seul, posé sur sa branche
Au bord de Lac Bijou

Guettant du matin au soir
Jusqu’au dimanche qu’il est parti aussi

Burning, captive of your fire.

Last night you came into my room.
Around midnight the rain started falling,
I was holding on to you.

Come on, Sheila, let's run.
Don't stop believing that I love you.
Don't let them keep you in that paradise of fools.

Sheila was a dancing girl working in the evening,
On the altar of old men's fantasies,
She hitched down from north Mississippi
With a lot of hope and one pair of jeans.

Tonight I am going to steal her from the city,
Before she does herself harm.

We seem to be losing our way?
We spend so much time retreating
From the bitter words,
And trying to find a way to end
The doubting and the cheating and the lies.
Trying to get it right.

Holding hands underneath the moon,
Playing all those lover games again.

Every one of you is gonna have to pay her price.
Sooner or later she will get you all alone.
Once you have tasted the magic sweetness of her sighs,
She's got you where she wants you and she'll never let you go.

Underneath the evergreens,
I was sitting there and thinking
When along came a Cajun queen.
I said, ""I'm going to a party,
Baby, do you want to go? ""
She said, ""I yi yi, I yi yi,
I yi yi don't know"".

I yi yi, I yi yi, I yi yi, no no.
I yi yi, I yi yi, I yi yi, no no.

Way down on the bayou,
With my friend Thibodeaux,
We was drinking wine and feeling fine,
When he jumped in his pirogue.
He said, ""I'm going to the city,
Baby, do you want to go,
I said, ""I yi yi, I yi yi,
I just don't think so"""

Because she only talked ""Am?ricain"".

Tell the Cajuns from Am?rcains.

Hanging on a bar,
Running 'gainst my hard blues
And losing the race.

I'm right back at the start,
Trying to chase another
Sad memory away.

I went to the city,
Felt like playing the star,
Feeding the fires
Of the honkey-tonk queens.
But dealing in the flesh scene
Won't get you very far,
A man needs a woman
If you know what I mean.

Chorus : Lonesome moon in a crystal black sky,
The bottle's been dry for a while.
I done walked through the soles
Of my new cowboy boots,
Pacing the floor with
Sweet dreams of you.

Leads a serious life,
Trying to find the love light
To put in his song.
Trying to find the one lick
That's gonna make it alright.
Struggling with the right words
That all come out wrong"

From the bayous of Lousiane.

I miss my couche-couche and my boudin.
I miss my riding painted Patches
On a tour glide of the farm,
Think I'll ride on up and see my brother,
He's working on the barn

And he hides it in his heart,
And he keeps it hid away just for me.

Got so many things on my mind.
Seems like I'm rushing around with my head closed up.

Before it gets to late
I'ma gonna move on back where I belong
And set my spirit straight.

Zachary Richard,Zack's Bon Ton,/z/zachary+richard/zacks+bon+ton_20718503.html,"Way back in 1965, when I heard the Black Snake Blues,
I was just a country boy sitting back there in my room.
Snuck out the window, going down those country roads,
Looking for the King of that good rocking Zydeco.

Way down at Slim's Y-Ki-Ki, up there at the Blue Angel club,
Ole Clifton on the squeeze box, his brother Cleveland on the scrub.
I was hanging out at the back door, too young to get in,
I told my baby, ""Baby we gotta come back here again.""

Chorus
Laissez le bon temps rouler,
Laissez les boul? boul?,
Laissez les ognons brulaient,
Br?l? toute la nuit.

Then one day, my dream came true.
Hanging around back stage, Clifton said, ""Who are you?""
I said, ""I'm just a young boy, waiting to get old.
Get out on the road and play some rocking Zydeco."""
Zachary Richard,Zydeco Jump,/z/zachary+richard/zydeco+jump_20687514.html,"Rudy come running and I heard the screen door slam,
Said, ""I got the news right here in my hand"".
All the boys in the club house gathered round,
To hear the tale that ole Rudy was putting down.

He said, ""I don't know but I been told,
They got a new kind of music they calling Zydeco,
Shake it to the right, shake it to the left,
Shake it with somebody, shake it by yourself.

Chorus:
Jump. Zydeco Jump.

I'm living in the country, nobody for miles around.
We don't get the news about what's going down in town.
I'm not sure but I believed that it's true,
Sooner or later gonna bust on through.
If you believe in what the country people say,
They say the Zydeco music is here to stay.

Jump. Zydeco Jump.

Joe and Mary and Suzie Q. Happy as they can be.
Rudy says that the Zydeco Jumping is going to set you free.

Jump. Zydeco Jump."

Well I flew down to Miami
And met a girl, a girl mind you, named Sammi
Oh that cold night, I held her tight, too tight! 
I squeezed and I squeezed some more, till she didn’t breathe no more! 

I had to…
Hurry Burry Baby
Hurry Burry Baby
So the fuzz wouldn’t know what was, I had to
Hurry Burry Baby

I hit every beach up and down there in Florida near Miami.
But the waves, the confounded waves kept washing back Sammi baby
Oh why, oh why, did she have to die.
I said hey ghoul I love you, now look what I gotta do.

I had to…
Hurry Burry Baby
Hurry Burry Baby
So the fuzz wouldn’t know what was, I had to

Wonder what he's doing there?
Shoveling, cause he's digging a grave,
I sincerely hope he doesn't have me in mind.
Popeye's been digging there and he's digging deep.
Yes, he's been digging there for 3 weeks without any sleep.
He's got bloodshot eyes, is it any wonder, horrible horrible popeye!

So lock your door and get your gun,
Or Popeye will get you when he's done.

Popeye's digging now in time to the beat,
He's a real swinger he is.
Popeye's down there close to 9000 feet.
Don't go to near the edges my dear, might just fall in you know!
Popeye's grave would hold a million or more!
Popeye won't say who he's diggin it for.
He's pretty sly. Oh, he's a sly one that Popeye!

So lock your door and get your gun,
Or Popeye will get you when he's done.

Popeye wears a snear all over his face.
Popeye shouts, ""It's for the whole human race!""
That creepy guy. Horrible Horrible Popeye!

So lock your door and get your gun,

Mais je me noie dans le moitié vide.

J’aurais pu déchanter, mais la chance à ma porte à toquée,
J’ai quitté A-L-G, guitare à la main, T-shirt Bob Marley OK

État d’urgence, je fais du bruit comme les ambulances
Et si je m’éteins dans le silence, j’aurais été une étoile filante
C’est pour ça que je n’attends personne,
Je fais les choses à temps avant que mon heure sonne
Besoin de voir le moment en personne, est ce que t’entends ma voix qui résonne?

Exilée au bout du monde en solo
Allô Allô, et si mes rêves tombaient à l’eau Allo c’est qui c’est Zaho
Je fais ma vie en solo

En solo
En solo isolée, bienvenue de l’autre côté,
Mes larmes sont salées, qui pourra bien les consoler?
Toute ces lumières et ces gratte-ciels m’ont fait fleurir
Et me faner, je me suis raconter
Mais je n’ai pas fini pas fini d’écrire mon épopée
État d’urgence, je fais du bruit comme les ambulances,
Et si je m’éteins dans le silence, j’aurais été une étoile filante
C’est pour ça que je n’attends personne,
Je fais les choses à temps avant que mon heure sonne

La lune m’attire comme les vagues,
M’attire, m’appelle et je craque, oui je délire,
Je divague marée haute marée basse
Alors je cours et je trotte face,
Laissant derrière quelques traces,
M’en sors entre pile et face, marée haute, marée basse

Allô Allô, et si mes rêves tombaient à l’eau, Allô c’est qui c’est Zaho
Exilée au bout du monde en solo
Allô Allô, et si mes rêves tombaient à l’eau Allo c’est qui c’est Zaho

Éphémère quand tu passe comme un courant d'air
Quand tu viens me dire à quoi ça sert
De me faire endurer cet enfer
Et ce jour après jour

Tu as mis entre nous ces barrières
Et je ne sais plus quoi faire
Pour éviter d'aller vers le point de non retour
Tu ne fais plus le moindre commentaire
Et si tout ça de travers l'horloge tourne à l'envers

Juste un signe pour éviter que je devine 
Je peux plus lire entre les lignes
Tu sais très que ton silence m’assassine
C'est ainsi que le quotidien se dessine
Tu me parle plus comme un mime
Tu sais très que ton silence m’assassine

T'es trop fier le prix a payé est trop cher
Ne vois-tu pas tout le temps qu'on perd
Pour tout vouloir garder dans ton cœur scellé à double tour
Sois sincère même si ça ne va pas me plaire
Notre vie à deux est un cimetière et chaque jour qui passe c'est mortel

Rappelle-toi nos souvenirs
On était libres, on était libres
On avait toute la vie
Chaque jour, chaque jour
Semble si loin d'nos fous rires
À la folie, à la folie
Nos âmes sont en péril, nan

À quoi bon tromper nos corps
Nos cœurs en désaccord, le savent
On a tous les deux tort

Je t'aurais pris dans mes bras
Et comme tous les soirs j'aurais fait le premier pas
Oui comme tes les soirs
On ne peut plus se mentir, se mentir
Comme tous les soirs
Laisser les mots nous trahir, nous trahir
Comme tous les soirs

Mon amour, mon amour
Mais que sommes-nous devenus
Des anonymes, des anonymes
Qui vivent dans le déni
Chaque jour, chaque jour
Un peu plus à la dérive
Mélancolie, mélancolie
Mais ton silence est pire

À quoi bon tromper nos corps
Nos cœurs en désaccord, le savent
On a tous les deux tort

Je t'aurais pris dans mes bras
Et comme tous les soirs j'aurais fait le premier pas
Oui comme tes les soirs
On ne peut plus se mentir, se mentir
Comme tous les soirs
Laisser les mots nous trahir, nous trahir
Comme tous les soirs

Oh, oh, oh
Comme tous les soirs
Oh, oh, oh
Comme tous les soirs
On ne peut plus se mentir, se mentir
Comme tous les soirs
Laisser les mots nous trahir

Mon amour, mon amour
Il est temps qu'on se le dise
Qu'on se délivre qu'on se délivre
De ces chaînes invisibles

Je t'aurais pris dans mes bras
Et comme tous les soirs j'aurais fait le premier pas
Oui comme tes les soirs
On ne peut plus se mentir, se mentir
Comme tous les soirs
Laisser les mots nous trahir, nous trahir

Dans un 5 étoiles, ou a la belle étoile
Je me dévoile plus depuis que j'ai mis les voiles

J'ai une dent contre toi mais je l'ai mise sous l'oreiller
La petite souris passera me donner 2, 3 billets
Faudrait être amnésique pour oublier
Mais je ne le suis pas donc a toi je ne peux me fier
En avant la musique

Qu'il fallait laisser vivre

Un mirage qui m'apparaît dans ce froid
Je rêvais de voir le monde et ses saisons
J'y croyais à tord ou à raison
Et oh je ne connaissais que le tour du pâté de maison
Mais en jetant mes pierres je visais l'horizon
J'arrive à peine à croire que ça fait 6 ans
Que j'ai quitté mes amis et ma maison
Mes frères et sœurs ne pensaient pas que je vous abandonne
J'irais exercer mes prières et que Dieu me pardonne

C'est ça la vie, des Bas et des Hauts
On tient le fil comme au rodéo ohoh ohoh

Je compte les années, je compte les jours
En attendant de vous raconter mon parcours
Et vous dire que j'ai changé et combien vous me manqué 
Et vous dire que j'ai changé et combien vous me manqué 

Je me rappelle quand les voisins râlais
Dès qu'on chantait fort dans le pallier
On était tous dans le même panier
On croquait dans la vie avec nos dents de lait et malgré mes conneries
J'avais de bonnes notes car je voulais devenir astronaute
Mais j'ai compris qu'en étant une fille dans mon pays
C'était pas possible alors j'ai dit tan pis
Et j'ai continuai de chanter
Même si depuis j'ai changé
Jour après jour, année après année
J'ai pu shootais les étoiles en jouant ces notes

Emmène-moi loin de cette vie
Dans nos selfies
Moi je veux t'aimer sans filtre
Dans nos selfies
Comme dans nos selfies

Nos selfies, nos selfies

Le cadre est le même
Sauf qu'ils sont deux à sourire
Des émoticônes
Juste en cas de fou rires
Plein de fenêtres
Commenceront à s'ouvrir
Des promesses et des promesses
Décimeront leur avenir

L'invite est postée
Pour le meilleur ou le pire
Tout le monde a riposté
Le pouce en l'air
En bons convives
Ainsi de suite
Trois petits points on a compris
L’amour a porté ses fruits
Ils seront trois dans les selfies

On aura le bras assez long pour la famille
Les amis, dans les selfies
Oui dans nos selfies, dans nos selfies

Zaho,Serpent,/z/zaho/serpent_21432663.html,"Que fais-tu? A quelle place?
Je pense à toi quoi que je fasse
Rampe vers moi, en silence 
Je veux que des pieds jusqu'à la tête tu m’enlaces

J’ai peur qu’un jour
Mon cœur me lâche
Doux mélange d’amour 
Et de menace

Si tu savais l’effet que tu me fais
Quand tu m’embrasses
Je ne comprends plus ce qui m’arrive
Et c’est pire quand tu te tais
L’extase, même pas un mot 
Et je suis déjà ivre 

Dans ton regard, moi je m’égare
Je ne sais dire que oui, oui
J’ai beau me mettre sur mes gardes
Ça ne sert à rien tes yeux de serpent me parlent

Dans ton regard, moi je m’égare
Je ne sais dire que oui, oui 
J’ai beau me mettre sur mes gardes
Ça ne sert à rien tes yeux de serpent me parlent

Danse pour moi toute la nuit danse 
Serpent
Danse pour moi toute la nuit danse 
Serpent
Danse pour moi toute la nuit danse 
Serpent, danse pour moi, danse pour moi

Comme si j’étais sous hypnose
Je vois la vie en rose
Est-ce bien, est-ce mal, est-ce normal 
Que tu réveilles mon instinct animal

Je sens mes paupières lourdes
Quand t’es là, je deviens sourde
Je ne réponds plus de moi
Je n’entends plus que toi, parle-moi

Si tu savais l’effet que tu me fais
Quand tu m’embrasses
Je ne comprends plus ce qui m’arrive
Et c’est pire quand tu te tais
L’extase, même pas un mot 
Et je suis déjà ivre

Dans ton regard, moi je m’égare
Je ne sais dire que oui, oui
J’ai beau me mettre sur mes gardes
Ça ne sert à rien tes yeux de serpent me parlent

Dans ton regard, moi je m’égare
Je ne sais dire que oui, oui 
J’ai beau me mettre sur mes gardes
Ça ne sert à rien tes yeux de serpent me parlent

J’ai beau m’acharner, essayer de te charmer
Je suis alarmée, désarmée 
Quand tes yeux de serpent me parlent
J’ai beaucoup de mal à te cerner
T’as fait de moi cette maîtresse 
Qui ne peut pas te tenir en laisse
Tu veux savoir ce qui me stresse?
C’est qu’un jour tu partes et me laisse
J’ai beau m’acharner, essayer de te charmer
Je suis alarmée, désarmée 
You shoot on me with your snake eyes why homie

Dans ton regard, moi je m’égare
Je ne sais dire que oui, oui
J’ai beau me mettre sur mes gardes
Ça ne sert à rien tes yeux de serpent me parlent

Dans ton regard, moi je m’égare

On ne broie que du noir et on se dit ça

Les volontés les plus néfastes par se lasser

Et lorsqu'il revient là 
Tout va bien

Et souvent il m'arrive qu'on me vole mon sourire
Ça ne me fait rien
Et bien des jours, je n'en finis pas de souffrir
Ça ne me fait rien
Et bien des nuits j'ai juste envie de dormir à jamais, de mourir
Ça ne sert à rien

Une bonne ou mauvaise nouvelle
Une colombe ou corbeau qui bat des ailes
Pour me dire que j'ai encore fait du zèle

I can't see anyone but you

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you"

[English Translation]
While choosing, it seemed like a dream
If we could continue to live everyday
If we'd[1] made a different decision then
I wonder if we'd be able to laugh happily now?
The truth is, I can't open my heart to anyone else
In the weekend-busy city center
I started crying for no reason
I need you
Dreaming of tomorrow
At the entrance to my dreams, at last I can finally drop my mask, but[2]
If I still have things I can't say to anyone
So does everyone else, however
We'll be thinking of each other; we'll be living
I hear your voice on the phone, and
It makes me want to cry, even though I am strong
It hurts, but even so, I still want to see you
When did you say we'd be together again?[3]
You couldn't answer, could you?
I can't hide it, everytime I remember that face[4]
I miss you
Dreaming of tomorrow
I want to believe you
That you've just stopped somewhere along the way
Dreaming of tomorrow
I want to be staring at you
Because all I see is the sunlight streaming through the trees
I want to undo our old misunderstandings[5]
I want to believe you
That you've just stopped somewhere along the way
Dreaming of tomorrow
Sometimes these feelings are so earnest, it seems like they're going to crush me
Dreaming of tomorrow
I want to be staring at you
Because all I see is the sunlight streaming through the trees"

It's about time for a revolution

You need a haircut
Choose a bob or whatever
Better sooner than later
Get a haircut!

Last night before I went to bed
I turned the tv on for some cnn
Oh my god! Everything looks bad
Lets come together and make a plan

We need a haircut
Take some money and take the bus and go get a haircut
You need a haircut
Choose a bob or whatever
Better sooner than later
Get a haircut!

How bout a trim? Maybe a fringe
If not a bob, a funky top,
How bout a stretch? Shave it all off
And make it match your other half
Make you look good, make you a catch
Get in the mood, forget the rest
Mess it all up, give it a toss
Blow me away, impress the boss

And party in amsterdam

Where I can be whatever I want
And don't have to dress to impress anyone
Check out the boys lookin so fine
They don't yet know but they're already mine

Come on

Freaky funky hot
Hotter hottest on the dancefloor
Party party party on
Dance all night til you break a bone

You could've told me your name but you... 
I wanna stay naive but I know too much
Tomorrow is the 18th so you can take my youth away

I get the feeling that we're still together
Running away from everything that matters
You could be my star or my bad karma
You could be the knife that you stab me with again and again

(Chorus)
X you up in my love
And you can x me up in yours

Everyday I see your face
Wanna hear you say my name

I could've fallen in love but you broke my heart
So I took your ego and fed it to the dog
Be my lover
Be my x lover

Break it crush it take it drop it drop it
Steal it take it crush it take it take it
Break it break it drop it crush itstab it

All the ships have come to shore
It's a space invasion

Blood money donations
Only static coming through the radio station

Hey Hey
Show your teeth
Take a bite
Hey Hey
Ya can't compete
Wrong the right
Hey Hey
It's hard to breathe
Choke on another white lie
Can't accept defeat
We sell our souls to get by
Cuz nothing in this world is free

Here we go
Gasoline
Spark to flame
Set us free
Here we go
Energy
Light the fuse
To believe
Let's go

The cops broken in sound the evacuation
It's an eye for an eye blind retaliation
Survival of the fittest kills the strongest relations
Come and join the decline of western civilization

Hey Hey
Underneath
Sacrifice
Hey Hey
What you believe
To pay the price
Hey Hey
It's hard to breathe
Choke on another white lie
Can't accept defeat

They breached our apathy
Fight or disarm
Let's start a mutiny
Sound the alarm
Pay em in effigy

Never turn your back cause they are right behind you
Lying down as you fall

And never take it bad
Cause you have what they want
So all for none and none for all

And time are all we got
Dissecting lies and rumors in the thick of the plot
Cause you're fucking up on purpose and that means a lot
These ties that rot
Come and take a shot

She holds on but I outlast her
Build it up but what does that matter
We can build it up but we always watch it shatter
Get up the house is on fire
Get up I want to get higher
Get up you mother fucking liar
You make me feel alone
I burned out in Shibuya station
Lost all my friends hazard occupation
Manic Compression like quicksand slip
Ate too many mushrooms I'm gonna be sick
She says slow down you're going through the motions
I start to crash like a plane in the ocean
Build it up but what does that matter
When the shit goes down we all fucking scatter

Never said I wanted to live this lie
All you said was good-bye

Set it off
Focus on the flame
Set it off

But I'll fight the bitter end

I got a heartache
She's my insecurity
I got all these on my tongue but they escape me
I want to breakout, Carpe Diem,
I know, but all this doubt in my head It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to find my own direction on this busy one-way street
Where all the influential people never bother helping me

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side
Cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.

Check this shit out...
Imma refuse... Fucking recluse, hanging with my friends at the bottom of a
Tight noose.
Like an outcast, coming dead last, always up to something so you know you
Better think fast.

When it's battle cry, rebel yell our lungs out.
If it's do or die, than do you know we're dying to break out?...

(2x)
Hate us...
Brandish your loaded guns.
Burn us...
Blistering than a thousand suns.
Blame us...
Shame is fucking ton... We've come undone, we've come undone.

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side
Cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.

Don't stop, that's a hell of a lie... For real, it's even one I'd buy...
Can't deal, you got a crooked spine... That's fine cause I draw the line.
We see through your fake devotions going through the motions, bullshit
Notions...
Check out the hooks and the rhymes I render, we won't back down and we
Won't surrender... Won't surrender, we won't surrender!

Nobody's getting out alive, hostages in this world better pick their side
Cause...
We're not alone in this war called life.
Nobody's going easily, have individuals standing next to me cause...
We're not alone in this war called life."

I've got a nasty sense of humour and a case of high anxiety
If you please
I would rather be alone, than have the world around you judge me
So I've got my life together, but it's half of what it should be
So you think you can make it better?
You'd better help me, help me

Hang on but prepare
I can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, this is me

Can't you see
I've got a perfect explanation but keep it deep inside of me
Pardon me
But if you really want to know
Well then you'd better learn to trust me
So you've got your life together, but you say you gotta have more
So you think I could make it better?
Just be careful what you wish for

Hang on but prepare
Can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, This is me

Paint the perfect picture
But these pictures are deceiving
Cause the colours lost their place
And they're dripping down and bleeding
And they're running and running away
Packed it up and leaving
And these dreams turn to nightmares
Like a promise with no meaning

So be careful what you wish for
You just might get it
And if this is what you live for
You might as well forget it
You don't know what you wish for
The small print, never end
Be careful what you wish for
You just might get it (get it get it)
You just might get it (get it get it)
So hold tight

Hang on but prepare
Can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, This is me (Be careful what you wish for)

Hang on but prepare
Can't live up to you
Hold on, Hold on (You just might get it)
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities
Hang on, This is me (Be careful what you wish for)

Stop fronting and just be yourself

Till someone grabs their gun and starts their aiming

Cause it ain't about how hard you are
Try using your brain and you will go far

Its time for everybody to head out christmas shopping
Everyone but me i'll stay inside
No presents under your tree that have a nametag for me
And it makes my gifts so easy to hide I don't wanna go where shopping lines are slow
I rather stay at home with the frosty cold one
A bud on ice in may, a lazy summer day
An alcohol a day by the pool in the sun (now everybody sing)

Chorus
Deck the halls with bells of holly
'tis the season to be jolly but,
I hate christmas I'm glad it only comes one time a year

It was the night before christmas and all through the house
All the creatures was chillin like flint drinkin stout
I woke from my sleep, heard 'here comes the boom'
I knew that santa would be comin' soon
On dascher on donner, commit, on blitzen
I yelled 'shut up ya'll, ' but they wouldn't listen
And then he came down with his belly of jello
He says ""where the ladies at cuz i'm a real jolly fellow""
Then he gave me a wink and was quick out of sight
Merry christmas to all, and to all a super deeky duper fly night

Chorus
Deck the halls with bells of holly
'tis the season to be jolly but,
I hate christmas I'm glad it only comes one time a year

Chorus
Deck the halls with bells of holly
'tis the season to be jolly but,
I hate christmas I'm glad it only comes one time a year

Cuz I hate christmas, I'm glad it only comes one time a year

Cuz I hate christmas, I'm glad it only comes one time a year"

No ones there to catch you if you fall
Got your back against the wall

I got the rattlesnakes shakes
Going out of my mind
I think somebody cut my break line
The clutch is in 5
The latch has sprung a fucking leak
As the submarine dives
And everybody's got a nemesis
I know that you're mine

Time is running out on you
Whoa oh whoa oh
And there's nothing you can do
Whoa oh whoa oh
I hate to tell you but your days are numbered
Time is running out on you

Hey kid see the problem better deal with it
Here's a wake up call you'd better answer it
I won't stick around to watch you fall
Got your back against the wall

I got an end of days rate
It's only 9.95
I'm picking fights with my fate
He says I won't stay alive
I see a mushroom cloud
Open into the sky
From down in the gallows
To avenge and to rise

Adore me more on the floor and
Score the pain you inflict
I'm running out of my pills that I can take
Forsake my fake bellyache
I think I'm going to be sick
Anticipate the rush coming over me
Control my roll, stole my soul
And I took two to the head
I got to have what you keep giving to me

Call your bluff tuff enough and
I'm better off dead

She's slowly killing
Taking over, infecting me

When her lips are always loaded and she's gunning for me

I want to be all you think that you see

Floating away and I don't know why
Spend all my days in a bottle thinking
You're like an anchor got me sinking

Karma got to you
Ego ate through you
Nothing left to do but to bleed

Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
Cuz you have nowhere to go but down

Out come, out come the wolves [x4]
Come and get it
They can smell it
Fear is what controls you
If you let it
It will divot
Your entire soul through
They're on to you

Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
Cuz you have nowhere to go
Cave in, just surrender
You know you're already six-feet down
Cave in, just surrender
Cuz you have nowhere to go but down

Take a ride

Take it slow
And I got you all stressed out
It's out of your hands and I know you wanted more
What did you want it...

Wait for a sign a reason not to escape
Meditate, point break, mistake
Cigarette burns while my hand shakes
You can't go back
Tomorrow brings another day
Another chance, some other way
And time won't stop for you
Not even if you want it to
Let it ride
Try to tell myself to hold on
Let it go
But I always to let myself down
Thought that you had it down but now you just don't know
Bottom dropped
I spun so fast that I lost my bearings
Gather myself while everyone is staring
Have been asleep while my patience runs thin
Damn, what the fuck did I get myself in
And I miss my best friend
Cause we don't hang out anymore
I'm gonna sit and watch the waves crash on the shore
Break my fall and I'm just gonna kick it on the floor

Zebrahead,Livin' Libido Loco,/z/zebrahead/livin+libido+loco_20148917.html,"Enrique played in a band.
Down at the sand.
He hustled women and worked on his tan.
Drove an iroq camero quadrophonic 8 track stereo.
He was a sharp dressin' suave.
Cultured and smooth ladies man.

Maria stared in the show.
It's all that she knows.
She loved Enrique and bilar and snow.
She knew her lover had others, but her heart was a desparate young soul.
She sold a night to a stranger while searching for her pot of gold.

[Chorus:]
We can dance to the rhythm, we can dace to the mornin' light.
On a sultury summer night.
The time is right for love.
Livin' libido loco days. [x2]

Arturo led a small gang.
A downtown thang.
He loved Maria the young bird who sang.
He bought her heart for a night, with some lines at the local disco.
She wore his love on her face, in the back of Arturo's limo.

Enrique was quite aware, of Maria's afair.
He vowed 'vengence Arturo I swear. '
He brought his blade to the fight, but they both suffered their final blow.
Now Maria's in mourning, as she's left to live life alone.

[Chorus:]

It's been twenty years past, since Maria's been last.
To the disco where she lost her soul.
She wipes a tear from her eye, and she still fights memories of ago.
As her new limo ride let's her in and asks 'how much, let's go. '

And sometimes I'm dense but these thoughts come in a flurry
You say they're nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry

Like you wouldn't believe
And my breathing's out of whack, like a drum machine

Without you, I'll never make it
Is it okay now or did you meet someone better?
Without a mohawk with a real job and a sweater
Leaving me shell shocked steady getting ready for a header
I don't think I'll ever make it alone
Standing on the edge of the great divide
You're pushing all the right buttons to make worlds collide
Would you stab me in the back like a homicide
Or leave me buried in your bullshit like a landslide
Are you biding your time with me waiting for someone better to come along?
As I sit and I scream this song
Are you biding your time with me waiting for someone better to come along?

I feel this weight fall from my shoulders

[Chorus:]
All the plans we used to make
And all the life we had to fake
Now I've thrown it all away
How easy we forget what happened
Arguments are said and done
Smiles are made, embarrassed ones
Photographs are more when I can
Look in to the past but I won't stare

I am alive I am awake
It's not like I'm not aware
I just don't care
You are alone I am the same
It's not like I'm aware
I just don't

[Chorus:]
All the plans we used to make
And all the life we had to fake
Now I've thrown it all away
How easy we forget what happened
Arguments are said and done
Smiles are made, embarrassed ones
Photographs are more when I can
Look in to the past but I won't stare

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

It's always straight between you and me.

You say I'm immature
To hang around

This relationship is over as we scrape the ledge
And you call me a loser falling over the edge
Like you're cutting all your losses
Like a bet you can hedge
One two, fuck you!
I won't change for you

A black eye
And my heart is ripped out of my chest
Crucified
For not passing any of your stupid tests
Good-bye
Right now I could care less

I won't change for you

Tonight I wash my hands of you

We've come a long way
Don't look down!
Your heart is rotten

To form a target on your back
Take your best shot

That's it, that's all.

The itch makes your skin crawl

Hold on tight to the radio

Coming to the end of your life starring you
Breaking through
Hold on tight to the radio
It's sad but true
Coming to the end of near you

Give me. Give me. Give me
Got no heart to rot
When the scars and insecurities,
They hit the spot
And the acceptance that you crave
Is all for not
Left a crosshair on your head
Take your best shot

Who loves you?
Who needs you?
Always waiting for a call

Who loves you? Who needs you?
Sets you up for a fall

Because I'd grab the buried truth in the palm of this hand

My loud pulse throbs so violently it could rip me apart
Your voice -yelling- and resounding
There's simply no time to stop and stand around here ready steady go

Even if I carry these countless scars with me
Quickly or softly, either way you aren't getting my soul

If I met with you on the other side of that hill
What should we talk about? I only think of that experience

I came running through -quickly- in a total blur
My loud pulse throbs so violently it could rip me apart

And if she comes home
Do you think she'll want to stay?
Is there anything for her?
She's a runaway
Turn your back on yesterday
She calls at seven thirty
And wants to talk about her boyfriend one last time
Mom and Dad are fighting in the background,
Shattered glass cuts through red wine
I said:
""I don't know that I'm right but I know that you're wrong""

In another town
With the same old Bacardi

Too many repeats to blow my only other way out

Eyes making figure eights, a hung over golden state
Rebel radio, through the stereo
Punk rock scenario telling me to let it go
'Cause when it feels like everyone's against me
Cops wanna frisk me and no one wants to kiss me
I stay up high so I'm floating like a ghost
And I make another toast to the coast with the most

So what
If there's a change in the weather
So what
If it doesn't get better
So what
If the loving ain't free
Cause I'm happy right here in the California breeze

Skate around on the town with the summer set
Bummin' on a cigarette, hum like a turbo jet
On a plateau, I forgot to pass go
Kickin' it downtown ended up in the gallows
But when it feels like tomorrow's looking risky
The pressure's gonna twist me
And cynics come to diss me

Coming straight out the block, punk rock ain't no shock,
Blue hair everywhere cause we got the stock
Slide by all the narcs, as the late alarm barks,
Take a nap in the class on a film about sharks
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you

Didn't want to go, didn't want to stay, didn't want to lie by my side
I don't really care cause I'll still be there swallowing my pride
Someday I'm going to be there

Step out in the hall, with the girls dressed like dolls,
And the burn-outs are baked as they step out the stalls
See the games that they play, cause they practice all day,
And the more that I see the less I have to say but
It's a quarter to ten, by your locker again,
Cause I know you'll be coming round the corner with your friend
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you

Listen when I say
Today is the day
And I'm on my way

See you when you're wandering by
And you still catch my eye
Blow my mind
Cause my face you won't recognize

I know that it's crazy, how you seem to phase me,
When nothing else matters but that all escapes me
This is a new trip, got to get a better grip,
A day in the life and you know I'm going to take it
And then you turn and walk away, before I have a chance to say,
I know that you can make this all okay
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you"

Zebrahead,"Sorry, But Your Friends Are Hot",/z/zebrahead/sorry+but+your+friends+are+hot_20754563.html,"You are
My one and only
But one can seem so fucking lonely
Shut up
Hear me out
I got a bad habit
I can't live without something wicked this way comes
Infidelity
It's only sex, I'm just having fun
I'm the king of unaccountability
I was born with a devil on my shoulder
I had a guilty heart
Right from the start
I was born with a devil on my shoulder
It's ripping me apart
My hands are tied
With this feeling comes no conscience
Do or die
I'm content in misery
Don't even try understanding all this pain
The reason why
I don't know
Maybe you're to blame
You're so blind it's easy
Do anything
Just to try to please me
Shut up
Listen to what I say
Time is running out
You should bail today
Something wicked this way comes
Guilt inside of me
The king of pain I'm his only son
Make you wish you'd never put your trust in me
Wake up
This is never gonna end
Wait up
You're one in ten
I'll break up
Your will within and straight up
Do it all again
If you wait up all night, I'll be burning daylight
Me and my libido are in on the take, right?
Break what I want and leav you by the wayside
Promise I'll stop you can trust what I say
Psych
When I'm on top you'll be droppin' down the scale like"

Turn me on

You can take all this from me
Stands my integrity (now)
I'm so sick of mother fuckers
Crooked wars that they wage
Should I sit and count the seconds till were all blown away?
S**, tyrants, violence on the news everyday
Ignorance turned anger into hate
Turn away
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution [x4]
Revolution
Now you're gone and it's forever
Nothing is the same
Right to wrong we'll come together
Time to make a change
Turn the tv off
Turn me on
Disbelief confidence is gone
You can take all this from me
Stands my integrity (now)
And these wars that we wage
Why?
An eye for an eye
So I lock, load, engage
Casualty- high supply
We'll be missing all our friends who die to get us by
Courage facing fear
Hate increase decline

Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution [x4]

Turn me on
Disbelief confidence is gone
If you take all of this from me
Then all of you can. .. (come together)

Another Clean Break
Another Cigarette and I think I'm gonna be okay
Some other way
Some other mistake
Some other reason saying that you are never gonna stay

You are the plug and I am the socket
You are the rock and I come to rock it
You see the truth when I bring the bullshit
You make me whole when I feel alone

Hands to the sky
Why you want to go and roll by me?
Hands to the sky
Why you got to go now?

Cracked in two
I'm in you
I'm standing on this bridge and you're to blame
Count to two
Subtract you
I'm jumping from this bridge and you're to blame

Let's get away
Let's give in tonight
Let's put the blanket on the sand I think we'll be alright
Inside a place
I know you're all mine
Inside a crowded room your smile reminds me I'll be fine

You are the drug and I'm feeling higher
You sell your soul and I am the buyer
You're a b-boy record and I'm the dj
You do what you want when I want it my way

Why you want to go and roll by me?
Hands to the sky
Why you got to go now?

Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going 'round

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright They just seem a little weird Surrender, surrender But don't give yourself away
Father says your mother's right
She's really up on things
Before we married Mommy served
On the wacs in the Philippines
Now I had heard the wacs recruited
Old maids for the war
But Mommy isn't one of those
I've known her all these years
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright They just seem a little weird Surrender, surrender But don't give yourself away
Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year
Every time I got to thinking
Then they disappear
When I woke up, Mom and Dad
Were fuckin' on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling
Got my Kiss records out
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away
Away.........."
Zebrahead,Swing,/z/zebrahead/swing_20148937.html,"Here I come
Force like a vector, radar detector,
Abandon you cause I'm a defector
Loyalty reflective, crooked lie objective,
Never trust you cause you are deceptive
Base burned sample, lyrics are ample,
Don't step to me cause you I will trample
Mainstream averted, tracker inserted,
Found something pure, but it was perverted

If I ever got a chance, should I swing
Step to the side, swallow your pride,
Ignorance breeds more laws to abide
Ideal in your mind, expectation defined,
Picture distorted and you claim what is mine
Battle like war, chaos in store,
Money and power always glorify gore
Needless tradition, chose my position,
Sprang like a lion to meet opposition

Third verse and I'm gonna burst a new topic
Don't come to front cause you know I'll say stop it
Money you're a liar, printed on a flyer
Turned my back on you and you said fire
All shapes on the wall fall to form one quote
Check out the note that I wrote
And the hip hop hordes that have always been born on the street
Degenerate me

Here comes my chance should I swing"

Close it in, close it in

Spill my insides
Hurts just a little
Split, split right down the middle
Swallow my pride
Choke, then I let go

Stop, wake up
These lies will help me find you
Fade in, fade out if that's what you got
Girl give up, the truth can get you through
Can not deny
It can not be spoken

I think my instincts will get
Rid of me, rid of me
And my sins will weigh on me
Heavily, heavily
Will you remember reside
Fade away, fade away
Then I'm the one that should take all the blame

Do you believe that it's the dark before the dawn?
Do you believe
Do you believe that when you're down you carry on?
Do you believe
I know the pressure makes you audible to love
I know that you can rise above

Losing pace, I can't stay in this place
And I can't, and I won't, and I don't need you
Losing face, what a shame and a waste
And I can't, and I won't, and I don't need you

Stop, wake up

I only think about myself, s**, and the couch.
You. You light up my whole day.
Whenever you're away.
I'd love to say I've got you figured out.
No way.

If I get my hands on you, I would make you do all the things I want you to.
And bend your will to mine, never hear you whine.
Everybody break out.
It's enough to shout, it's enough to shout.
It's enough, yeah it's enough.

She's callin', we're brawlin'.
This is the hell that is my life.
I'm laughing, she's crying.
This is the hell that is my, hell that is my life.

I. I feel the world revolves around me.
I take my one way street.
I only have one serious bone in my body.
You. You say you're not amused.
You love to hate me too.
You claim you wish you never got my name tattooed.

Now you got your hands on me.
And you can make me be, what you want me to be.
And slash away my will, still you're my only thrill.
Everybody break out.
It's enough to shout, it's enough to shout.
It's enough, yeah it's enough.

[Chorus:]

You. You say you're not amused.
You love to hate me too.
And now you tell your friends we're through. .. .
And never screwed.

I can take you so much more.
And you've got so much more in store.
So when you say your mom don't like me, I say that your momz a whore.
Then you call me selfish pig and something small turns into something big.
The more you shovel the more I dig.
The more you shovel and the more I dig.

She calls, we talk, I scream, she cries.
This is the hell that is my life.
She calls, we talk, I laugh, she tries.
This is the hell that is my.

Zebrahead,The Joke's On You,/z/zebrahead/the+jokes+on+you_20976885.html,"Our lungs are chokin' in the haze
Distortion comes in waves
Gotta get away from the lies and the liars
Hearts are hand grenades
Sharp like razorblades
Gotta make a break from the lies and the liars

Wind me up and then let me go
A sabotage low in every flow
Stacking em up like a domino
Knock em all down with a single blow
Burn a bridge just to watch it fall
Flood the engine to see it stall
Things so small make you feel so tall
Push my back up against the wall

A tall tale to tell
A hard sale to sell
A break down
You're lying to yourself
A tall tale to tell
You're just an empty shell
A break down
You're lying to yourself

Half-Truth and lies
Empty alibis
Cut me down to size
Turns out the jokes on you
You can't disguise
Better recognize
I won't sympathize
Turns out the joke's on you

Shoot me down with a ricochet
Poison tongue and a price to pay
Sweeping down like a bird of prey
To tear me apart right where I lay
Turn a question into a brawl
Mix some vengeance with alcohol
Break my will just to see me crawl
Push my back up against the wall

A tall tale to tell
A hard sale to sell
A break down
You're lying to yourself
A tall tale to tell
You're just an empty shell
A break down

Zebrahead,The Juggernauts,/z/zebrahead/the+juggernauts_20754556.html,"Watching anvils falling all around
And they break our bones when they hit the ground
The siren screams without a sound
So we numb ourselves with drink and drown

Got to clock in, bar code and name
Zeros and ones, compose the game
And the roof's on fire but stops the rain
So clench your fists, enjoy the pain

Think back to the ways of yesterday
The ""I"" in team raised renegade
In punk rock clubs and razor blades
Where throwaway kids scream serenades

We lost control again
We lost control again
We lost control
Gotta find a way to make amends
Rewrite the end
Take back what time has stole

We are the angry, the innocent
We are the hungry, the discontent
We are the marquee, the one percent
We are the bourgeoisie of arguments

(Here we go, Here we go one time)
Dropping down a well that time forgot
With scars that show that we care a lot
In the sky we dreamt like a juggernaut
Of the things we'd do and what we saught

But one by one we fall the same
How much to lose, not much to gain
So have your hope hop another train
And bleach yourself but the strain remains

Think back to the ways of yesterday
When we never even had to get paid to play
Had a backpack filled with a lot to say
But the words have all been thrown away

We lost control again
We lost control again
We lost control
Gotta find a way to make amends

We are the hungry, the discontent
We are the marquee, the one percent

We won't wait
We're the lost, but we've found
We can't wait
Alarms are calling
We won't wait
We're not the fallen, the underground
You won't recognise us now

We are the angry, the innocent
We are the hungry, the discontent
We are the marquee, the one percent
We are the bourgeoisie of arguments

We lost control again
We lost control again
We lost control
Got a lost hope requiem
And we're wrecking 'em
There's no use settlin'

So when will the waiting end
If we don't pretend like a shotgun awakening
To blow off a pin-downed limb
She'd your skin cause the day is shuddering

So tie off the bleeding end and start again
The streets are barreling
With reason to reinvent our miscontent
The sound grows deafening

We want control again
We want control again
We want control
Gotta find a way to make amends
Rewrite the end
Take back what time has stole

We are the angry, the innocent
We are the hungry, the discontent
We are the marquee, the one percent
We are the bourgeoisie of arguments

We won't wait no
We were the lost, but we've found
We can't wait no
Alarms are calling
We won't wait no
We're not the fallen, the underground
You won't recognise us now

We are the angry, the innocent

A safety net made of thread to stop your drop

There's only one girl in this world who understands the real me
There's nothing superficial, artificial you get just what you see

I know a girl who takes up my world
Takes all of me and every breath that I hold
We meet and she makes me feel free
With one look she knows just what I need
And I've found that she's got me bound
Cause she's the only one that my mind surrounds
Only she knows the real me
And I know that she won't let me down

I know a girl who wakes up my world
Brings in the warmth when I'm feeling cold
And she's got places to be
But she says that she would rather stay here with me

Getting closer moving farther from the light

Somewhere I belong, someone to call mine
See the walking dead surround me
See the life and see the death and now

Down, down, down

I want to care a lot
I want to stop your fall

These words are where my soul resides
And never did I ever fit into this place, right?
And I couldn't stand looking at your face, right?
And you didn't mind making this a race, right?
So check out the bass
When I flow, I know, that I grow
Sit back relax and check out the bomb show, bet
And never could you ever bring me down, clown
Yeah, check out the sound!

Well I saw your face one time, I never thought I'd walk away
Then we hit the trip that wouldn't quit, and I never walked away again
I said I'd never walk away again

Let me jump back into the boom of the room
Come and take a ride to the top of the moon
I don't want to fight and make this a bad trip
I just want to sit back, relax, take a fat rip
Check out the shapes and the colors in the grooves
Check out the thoughts that make your mind move
Check out the lights that form the new patterns
Check out the beats and the rhymes that make us much phatter

Check out the zebrahead style
Boom, boom, boom in the room
And I kick
Free style form not the norm
Cause I slang it
Coming five fold take another hit and I hold
And don't try to wreck cause kid you'll get rolled
On the flip side if you choose to decide
Wreck it from New York to Cali or anywhere I reside
So check out the crew with the funk flow flavor
Spitting out smooth sounds that you know that you want to savor

I wish you could see all the that I see
Back in the day you were down with me
Back in the day when things were all right
Check out the lights
Check out the sounds that I found all underground
And the swing that I bring up all around
Watch the walls as they all come crumbling down
Check out the shake and the quake as I kick it down
This is the bomb track and we never take it back
Funky fresh flow is something that we never lack
So get up and ride this and never try to bite this
Aim for the sky cause you never know you might miss
Check out the shapes and the colors in the grooves
Check out the thoughts that make your mind move
Check out the lights that form the new patterns
Check out the beats and the rhymes that make us seem much phatter"

Want the fire to kick up
Crash my pick up
Die on abbey road
I keep the momentum by living
Perpetual state of locomotion
I try to defend it and end up by
Showing you shadows of my devotions

I walk the plank, and hope it's better down under the sea
I walk the plank, tell me will you take a walk with me?
It's not a lie if you can justify it all to your self
And when you die you're gonna go past the gates
Straight to hell

I'm just a lost cause
Whoa
I'm just over my head
I'm better off dead
Cause I'm a lost cause
Whoa
I fell over the edge and I'm better left for dead

Getting hard to breathe
Choking underneath
Gotta soul to squeeze
Fallen on my knees
Want the guard to wake up
Wipe her make up
Let the violence grow
Gonna lose control
Of my mind and soul
With the time I stole
Down the rabbit hole
Wanna smack my bitch up
Light the rich up
Break the fucking code

I poison like venom and drink
In the doubt that drowns me in the ocean
I try to pretend in the end but clock keeps ticking to self implosion
I walk the plank and hope it's better down under the sea
I walk the plank, tell me will you take a walk with me?

I fell over the edge and I'm better left for dead

Sink down to the bottom of the ocean with me
You couldn't imagine how many lost causes we'd see
Here and now, every second it's harder to breathe
Sink down, sink down

And everyone says get your head out of the clouds
And all I want to do is play loud

Break it, break it down
There's funk in the sound
I'm gonna live my life fly and keep my feet off the ground
And I'm not the only one when I see
You got your feet bound to the ground when you should be living free

So you get the feeling that I waste another day
Now I got the feeling that I'm not the only one
If you think about it, it's a waste of mind cause
Try to live without it and you'll stop

I think about the time when everyone will hear me
Hear my rhymes loud and understand clearly
That I can spend each and every day
Doing things my way and I'll be okay

And everyone's so strange
There is nothing that they can change

Show me how this all fits in your plan
Understand
That i don't need you
I just need to

Feel how does it feel
To crush the world in two
One last time
And I
Am wasted
Feel how does it feel
To scream without a sound
One more time
And I'm
Still wasted

Get me away
I'm thinking maybe someday
You'll find out who I am
But you don't give a damn
Closing my eyes
It's all the same to me
What I don't want to know
Is what I'm not going to see

Watch the world stop
I drop put my finger on it
Thinking back to the day you said
I could get up on it
Say that you have changed
I'm the same just a little loaded
Comin' in out of phase lost my place
Now I know I've blown it
Fall into a sea of your distress
And I confess that
I take less than your best
But you don't want
To give it away today
Blue sky grey
Nothing that you say
Take another trip
Take another fall
Take it all away

Mic stands, leopard head bands

Give a hand

Or could look away and never deal with it

This girl is pretty fly for a white gal
All the guys want her even though she's a juvenite
She's really kinda sad and just don't care
'Cause the only one she wants is her best friend Claire

I'm simple like you are, ordinary
My tired eyes can see
That time may fly
And what's left is
Meant to be
I'm looking out
You're looking in
It's taken more then time
To erase the stain
And it's never been the same

Any city
A girl turns 17, goes to a party
She and her girls are drinkin barcardi
Ever since she walked through the door
All the guys have been scoping and flexing tryin' to score
But she's a good girl
So she won't have none of that
She takes another sip
But has no clue of the spike from the G to the H to the B
She wakes up in the morning
Bruised and raped in the street

What's going on?
What's going on?
Ready or not - NOT
The world moves on and on and on
Yo, what's going on?

A kid that you know goes to school
He's really kinda shy and not that cool
He knows what it's like to look in from the outside
Inside, he just wants someone to confide
But everyone's busy and no one's got the time
He takes his dad's gun and says
""This is how I'll shine""
Boom, boom, boom
And the kids fall down
On the ground
Dumbfound (dumbfound)

What's going on?

Ready or not - NOT

Look out
She'll rock your world there's no doubt
She comes and goes when she wants to
I'd do anything she wanted me to
Who would blame me with legs like that

She's breakin me down
She's everywhere that I wanna go
Breakin me down
She gets me high when I'm feelin low
She's breakin me down
She's on the move like a rolling stone
Breakin me down
Just one look cuts me to the bone

She's like that
Like that
She's like that
Like that

Look out
She'll tear your heart out
Look out
She'll rock your world there's no doubt
She comes and goes when she wants to
I'd do anything she wanted me to
Who would blame me with legs like that

She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves and she moves
She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves with legs like that
She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves and she moves
She moves and she moves and she moves
She moves and she grooves with legs like that
With legs like that
With legs like that
With legs like that
With legs like that"
Zebrahead,Wookie (Playmate Demo),/z/zebrahead/wookie+playmate+demo_20531245.html,"In a cantina on Tatoine-a
A kereoki wookie sing-a
A hairy creature, with rugged features
Sang Van Halen's 'Little Dreamer'
And as he sang his tune
My girl started to swoon
As he escorted my love from the room
(Chewabaca Growl)
Chorus
My girlfriend left me for a wookie
She said he ate a better cookie (yeah)
My girlfriend left me for a wookie
Hope I find a wookie who loves me too.
End Chorus
His velvet jumpsuit, my cause was quite moot
The wookie elvis did sing quite cute
Sing under stop light, the mood was just right
For the wookie to score again tonight.
And as he sang his tune
My girl started to swoon
As he escorted my love from the room

I know things will get better cause it just can't get any worse than this... 

TRAPPED ANOTHER ONE! 
I'm bad fish, served on a cold dish, never gonna get it right cause I'm high and I'm foolish... 
I never fit in, no matter where I'm sittin'... if the story's got a hero, then I guess that I'm the villain.

So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh...) what you got, what you got?... I'll keep my head low! 
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh...) what you got, what you got?... Can't let it go! 

I know things will get better when I stop looking out through a broken window... 
(Ooh-woah-oh-oh...)
I know things will get better when I just break down that door... (HEY! )
Fall down, get pushed around, plant myself into the ground but... 
I know things will get better cause it just can't get any worse than this... 

Just can't get any worse than this... No it just can't get any worse than this... 

I spread a mean lie, my hope is low fly, riding on a curse the worse my tank is bone dry.
I'm fortune tellin', you're not buying what I'm sellin', if that look is a cry... then call me a villain... 

So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh...) what you got, what you got?... I'll keep my head low!

So pathetic, just forget it now (Woah-oh-oh! )... never make it sit and pass it round (Woah-oh-oh! )... 
Disappointment apathy, I'll take a double shot of misery (HEY! )... you can't fake it so far, hold it down... (Woah-oh-oh! )... 
Yeah ignorance is bliss, but it can't get worse than this...
