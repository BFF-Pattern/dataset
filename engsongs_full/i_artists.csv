Irving Berlin,A Fella With An Umbrella,/i/irving+berlin/a+fella+with+an+umbrella_20068111.html,"I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I'm just a fella, a fella with an umbrella,
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.
Raindrops have brought us together,
And that's what I long to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
So I'll be the fella, that fella with an umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.

Oh, the raindrops have brought us together,
And that's what I long to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a big break for me.
So I'll be the fella, the kid with the small umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
If you will be the girl, the girl who saved her love for a rainy day."
Irving Berlin,A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,/i/irving+berlin/a+pretty+girl+is+like+a+melody_20298549.html,"[Verse]
I have an ear for music, and I have an eye for a maid
I like a pretty girlie, with each pretty tune that's played
They go together
Like sunny weather
Goes with the month of May
I've studied girls and music, so I'm qualified to say

[Chorus]
A pretty girl is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain
Of a haunting [Refrain]
She'll start upon a marathon and run around your brain
You can't escape she's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you and then
Come back again
A pretty girl is just like a pretty tune"

Irving Berlin,All Alone,/i/irving+berlin/all+alone_20068112.html,"All alone, I'm so all alone
There is no one else but you
All alone by the telephone
Waiting for a ring, a ting-a-ling

I'm all alone every evening
All alone, feeling blue
Wond'ring where you are and how you are
And if you are all alone too



I wonder where you are (remember me) and how you are (remember me)
And if you are (I love you) all alone (I love you) too

Irving Berlin,All By Myself,/i/irving+berlin/all+by+myself_20068113.html,"I'm so unhappy
What'll I do?
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me
I'm growing so tired of living alone
I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night

I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire

All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf

I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older
All by myself"

Intro:
Everything went wrong,
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue.
For the longest while
I'd forget to smile,
Then I met you.
Now that my blue days have passed,
Now that I've found you at last -
{end intro}

I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always.
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand,
I will understand always.

Always.

Days may not be fair always,
That's when I'll be there always.
Not for just an hour,
Not for just a day,
Not for just a year,
But always.

I'll be loving you, oh always
With a love that's true always.
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand,
I will understand always.

Irving Berlin,An Old Fashioned Wedding,/i/irving+berlin/an+old+fashioned+wedding_20277073.html,"Interpolated in 1966 revival]

[Frank:]
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding
Blessed in the good old-fashioned way

I'll vow to love you forever
You'll vow to love and honor and obey

Somewhere in some little chapel
Someday when orange blossoms bloom

We'll have an old-fashioned wedding
A simple wedding for an old-fashioned bride and groom

[Annie:]
I wanna wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls
A lot of ushers in tailcoats, reporters and photographers

A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say
""Do you agree to love and honor?"" Love and honor, yes, but not obey

I wanna wedding ring surrounded by diamonds in platinum
A big reception at the Waldorf with champagne and caviar

I wanna wedding like the Vanderbilts have, ev'rything big, not small
If I can't have that kind of a wedding I don't wanna get married at all

[Coda:]

[Frank:]
We'll have an old-fashioned wedding

[Annie:]
If it's not a big wedding I don't wanna get married at all"
Irving Berlin,An Orange Grove In California,/i/irving+berlin/an+orange+grove+in+california_21299155.html,"I've a longing to go
Where the oranges grow
I know a cozy nest
'Way out west

And I miss it so
California my own
Oh how lonely I've grown
That's why I'm on the run

To the one
I left there all alone

Arm in arm we will rove
Through a sweet orange grove
Far away in California
Like a bird I mean to fly west again

And I'll hold her close to my breast again
When the blossoms unfold
And the green turns to gold
Some fine day in California

You'll see a happy girlie and a happy fellow
'Mid the fields of yellow
In an orange grove"

It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart

It's not the book I lent you that you'll never return

Be careful, it's my heart"

Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore

Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

I should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do"

Irving Berlin,Can You Use Any Money Today?,/i/irving+berlin/can+you+use+any+money+today_21298925.html,"Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any money today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Nice new bills that we're giving away

There are photographs on ev'ry one
Lincoln, Grant and Washington
Or you might like the ones with Henry Clay
Can you use any money today?

Two million, four million, six million, eight million, ten
Take what you want, when it's gone you can come back again
Bills that haven't been printed yet
You can have them by the sack

Coins that haven't been minted yet
That you never have to give back
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if we ever run out of checks for him to sign
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine

Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any dollars today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
We've so much that it gets in our way

In our Treas'ry there's a mighty sum
Millions we've subtracted from
The envelopes that hold our take home pay
Can you use any money today?

Home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold
Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold
Take ten million and please don't fuss
If you find it can't be spent

You can lend it right back to us
And we'll pay you seven percent
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if that feller with whiskers ever should decline
You can have mine
All of mine
You can have mine"
Irving Berlin,Change Partners,/i/irving+berlin/change+partners_20068116.html,"Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Ask him to sit this one out.
While you're alone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell
Him he's wanted on the telephone.

You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.
Won't you change partners and then,
You may never want to change partners again."

And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(come on and) dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That (those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...
(right up) to heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

Who pleases ev'ry woman, man and child?
Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?
-Who?
Colonel Buff'lo Bill

Who's got the show that gets the most applause?
Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws
Ten feature acts and there's the special feature still
-Who?
Colonel Buff'lo Bill

Did you ever see a cowboy rope a steer?
-No, we haven't
Or an Indian with feathers throw a spear?
-No, we haven't
Or a marksman shoot an earring from an ear?
-No, we haven't
Did you ever see a hold up?
-No, sir
Then gather closer
And let me give you some of the atmosphere

The hour is midnight and all is still
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail
Never suspecting danger as they roll along
The watchful driver is in his seat
His trusty rifle lying at his feet
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride
Never suspecting there is something really wrong

Suddenly there's a shout
-What is it all about?
What is it all about you ask? It's Indians
-Indians!
Indians
-Indians!
Very notable, cut your throat-able Indians
-Indians!

Just when they've taken ev'ryone by force
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse?
Who starts a' shootin' till there's no one left to kill
-Gen'ral Grant?
No! Colonel Buff'lo Bill!

-Certainly this is quite a thrill, better than all the vaudeville

Folks are dumb where I come from,

Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Folks like us could never fuss
With schools and books and learning.
Still we've gone from A to Z,
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
You don't have to know how to read or write
When you're out with a feller in the pale moonlight.
You don't have to look in a book to find out
What he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My uncle out in Texas can't even write his name.
He signs his checks with ""x's""
But they cash them just the same.
If you saw my pa and ma,
You'd know they had no learning,
Still they've raised a family
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally)
Cousin Jack has never read an almanac on drinking
Still he's always on the spree
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
Sister Sal who's musical has never had a lesson,
Still she's learned to sing off-key
Doin' what comes naturally (doin' what comes naturally).
You don't have to go a private school
Not to pick up a penny near a stubborn mule,
You don't have to have a professor's dome
Not to go for the honey when the bee's not home.
That comes naturally (that comes naturally).
My tiny baby brother, who's never read a book,
Knows one s** from the other,
All he had to do was look,
Grandpa Bill is on the hill
With someone he just married.
There he is at ninety-three,

Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
Oh, what music
The clarineter could not be better
Hear that strain

They simply ruin it
Look at 'em doin' it
Come, come don't hesitate
Everybody step if you want to see a glutton
When it comes to struttin' over the ground
Wait'll you see my little sweetie and me
Step, step, stepping around
In A Cozy Kitchenette Apartment

I'm getting tired of eating in restaurants
They don't appeal to me
If we could own a cute apartment
I'd know just what a joyful heart meant
I hate to think of waiters and bill-of-fares
When evening time draws near
Three little rooms will be just like heaven
When we are married dear
In a

Cozy kitchenette apartment for two
I'll be setting the table
While you're cooking a stew
For me and you
I'll be there to help you put the dishes away
Then together we'll listen to the phonograph play
The tuneful Humoresque
And oh, what bliss

I counted up this morning, it's about a million francs
And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why

I've got Harlem on my mind
I've a longing to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been wined and I've been dined
But I'm heading for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

I go to supper with a French Marquis
Each evening after the show
My lips begin to whisper ""Mon Cheri""
But my heart keeps singing ""Hi-de-ho""

I've become too darn refined
And at night I hate to go down
To the high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed
With Harlem on my mind

Em'ralds in my bracelets, diamonds in my rings
A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things
And I'm blue, so blue am I
Lots of ready money in seven diff'rent banks

I counted up this morning, it was 'bout a million francs
And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why

I've got Harlem on my mind
And I'm longin' to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been dined and I've been wined
But I'm headin' for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

I go to supper with a French Marquis
Each evening after the show
My lips begin to whisper ""Mon Cheri""
But my heart keeps singin' ""Hi-de-ho""

I've become too damned refined
And at night I hate to go down
To that high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed
With Harlem on my mind

I've got Harlem on my mind
And I'm longing to be lowdown
And my ""parlez-vous"" will not ring true
With Harlem on my mind

I've been dined and I've been wined
But sure as your born I'm headin' for a showdown
'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn
With Harlem on my mind

And when I'm bathing in my marble tub
Each evening after the show
I get to thinkin' 'bout that Cotton Club
And my heart starts chirping ""Hi-de-ho""

Help me!
I've been too damned refined
And at night I hate to go down
To that flat with fifty million Frenchmen taggin' behind
With Harlem on my mind"
Irving Berlin,Heat Wave,/i/irving+berlin/heat+wave_20068100.html,"We're having a heat wave,
A tropical heat wave,
The temperature's rising,
It isn't surprising,
She certainly can can-can.

She started a heat wave
By letting her seat wave
In such a way that
The customers say that
She certainly can can-can.

Gee, her anatomy
Makes the mercury
Jump to ninety-three.

We're having a heat wave,
A tropical heat wave,
The way that she moves
That thermometer proves
That she certainly can can-can."

Too much, I loved you right from the start,
Too soon, you vanished out of my dreams,
Too late, to start all over it seems...

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will make a fuss about you
But how about me?

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten

And maybe, a baby
Will climb upon your knee and put it's arms about you
But how about me?

Moonlight, was beaming down from the sky,
Lovelight, was gleaming deep in your eye,
Sunlight, for just a moment and then,
Twilight, and I was lonely again,

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten

And maybe, a baby
Will climb upon your knee and put it's arms about you
But how about me?"

How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?"

I know where to find the boys
I don't go through a club or two
I just find you and there are the boys
To get you alone I strive
You ask me to tea at five
I find you then with other men
And wonder when my chance will arrive

How's chances, say, how are the chances
Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with
In right with you

How's chances for one of those glances
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see

How's chances to end all your romances
And start taking your chances with me

My castle will need some restoring
Ceiling and flooring
Furniture, too"

I can't believe that it's happened,

I got lost in his arms, and I had to stay.
It was dark in his arms, and I lost my way.
From the dark came a voice, and it seemed to say,
""there you go, there you go.""

How I felt, as I fell, I just can't recall.
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall.
And I said to my heart as it foolishly
Kepte jumping all around.

Irving Berlin,I Love A Piano,/i/irving+berlin/i+love+a+piano_20068103.html,"[1st verse:]
As a child I went wild when a band played
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply
Divine
But today when they play I could hiss them
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine

[chorus:]
I love a piano, I love a piano
I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano, a grand piano
It simply carries me away

I know a fine way to treat a steinway
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories

And with the pedal I love to meddle
When padarewski comes this way
I'm so delighted if I'm invited
To hear that long haired genius play

So you can keep your fiddle and your bow
Give me a p-i-a-n-o, oh, oh
I love to stop right beside an upright
Or a high toned baby grand

[2nd verse:]
When a green tetrazine starts to warble
I grow cold as an old piece of marble
I allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause
At her best I detest the soprano
But I run to the one at the piano
I always love the accomp'niment and that's because"

I guess I'm ready to go
Right back on the shelf,
Because at last I've learned
Where you're concerned,
I've just been fooling myself.

I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.

I knew we'd have to part,
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart.
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat.
But more than that,
I never had a chance.

How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes"

My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you

My sense of humor, my disposition, my rosy future
I'll share it all with you

Someday, honey, I'll have money
You know what that brings
Furs and diamond rings
And besides those things
There'll be

My ear for music, my feet for dancing, my lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you

My head for thinking, my face for smiling, my hands for cooking
I'll share it all with you

Underneath my hat
I know where I'm at

I'm a bad, bad man
There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha

For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us

And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man
You may love us and leave us, but the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek when the minstrels come next week
When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man

For years I have yearned to play towns I could return to
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak
I'm glad you're not frightened, the atmosphere has brightened
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week
Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man
Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man
Send your mothers on Wednesday because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime, I'll have lots of open time
Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest
With a bad, bad man"

Soon little stars will appear in the sky

Evening, lady of the evening

Calling, while the shades are falling
Falling over land and sea

You can make the cares and troubles
That followed me through the day
Fold their tents just like the Arabs
And silently steal away

Evening, lady of the evening
I hear you calling me

After the sun when its day's work is done comes the evening
Then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening
There in the sky they stand, each with a torch in hand
Then one by one, little stars in the sky
Look down and say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye"""

Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep
Like a child would

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly

Or it just should be that you were meant for me, and maybe I was meant for you.
Maybe it's because the song we danced to, told a story old and new.
I can't figure out just why it came about."
Irving Berlin,Moonshine Lullaby,/i/irving+berlin/moonshine+lullaby_20258926.html,"Behind the hill
There's a busy little still
Where your pappy's workin' in the moonlight

Your lovin' pa
Isn't quite within the law
So he's hidin' there behind the hill

Bye bye, baby
Stop your yawnin'
Don't cry, baby
Day will be dawnin'

And when it does
From the mountain where he was
He'll be comin' with a jug of moonshine

So count your sheep
Mama's singin' you to sleep
With a moonshine lullaby

Dream of pappy
Very happy
With his jug of mountain rye

So count your sheep
Mama's singin' you to sleep
With a moonshine lullaby"

And I don't know where I am
I went into the fight like a lion
But I came out like a lamb.
My defenses are down

And I can't escape no how
I could speak to my heart when it wakened
But my heart won't listen now.

Like an organ-grinder's bear,
Like a knight without his armor,
Like Samson without his hair.

My cares upon the shelf
Because I find myself with

No strings and no connections
No ties to my affections

No dates that can't be broken
No words that can't be spoken
Especially when I am feeling romancy

Like a robin upon a tree
Like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody
I'm free, that's me

History placed them in a romantic set
In between book covers they are side by side
But the real thing hasn't been written yet

Now it can be told
Told in all it's glory
Now that we have met
The world may know the sentimental story

The greatest romance they ever knew
Is waiting to
Unfold

Now it can be told
As an inspiration
Every other tale
Of boy meets girl is just an imitation

The great love story
Has never been told before
But now
Now it can be told"

Once I got stuck on a sweet little German
And oh what a German was she
The best that was walking, well what's the use talking
Was just made to order for me
So lovely, and witty, more yet she was pretty
You don't know until you have tried
She had such a figure, it couldn't be bigger
And there was some more yet beside

[chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a feeling that came from the heart
She called me her honey, her angel, her money
She pushed ev'ry word out so smart
She spoke like a speaker, and oh what a speech
Like no other speaker could speak
Ach my what a German when she kissed her Herman
It stayed on my cheek for a week

[2nd verse:]
This girl could squeeze, and it never would hurt
For that lady knew just how to squeeze
Her loving was killing, more yet she was willing
You never would have to say please
I just couldn't stop her, for dinner and supper
Some kisses and hugs was the food
When she wasn't nice it was more better twice
When she's bad she was better than good

[2nd chorus]
Oh how that German could love
With a sweetness that's sweeter than sweet
Just say what you please, you would hug and you'd squeeze
Just the shoes that she wore on her feet
Her smile was like money that somebody owed you
That somebody wanted to give
When you felt like dying and she started sighing
Ach my it was worthwhile to live

[3rd verse:]
Sometimes we'd love for a week at a time
And it only would seem like a day
How well I remember, one night in December
I felt like the middle of May
I'll bet all I'm worth that when she came on earth
All the angels went out on parade
No other one turned up, I think that they burned up
The pattern from which she was made

[3rd chorus:]
Oh how that German could love
With a love like you see in a play
When she said, ""My dear,"" it would ring in my ear
For a year, and a week and a day
Her no was like yes, and her yes was like no
It was something like yes, it was, well
When we got together ach donner und vetter
'Twas love with a capital ""L"""

Oh! How I hate to get up in the morning

Is to hear the bugler call

Someday they're going to find him dead

Irving Berlin,Overture,/i/irving+berlin/overture_21301103.html,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]"

'Twas from a man I used to know
About a year or so ago, before he departed
He is just as happy as can be

I'll tell you what he said to me
He said, ""If ever you get heavy-hearted
Pack up your sins and go to the devil in Hades
You'll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies
They'd rather be down below than up above

Hades is full of thousands of Joneses and Browns
O'Hoolihans, Cohens, and Bradys
You'll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil
Because the jazz bands they started pickin' it
Then put a trick in it, a jazzy kick in it

They've got a couple of old reformers in heaven
Making them go to bed at eleven
Pack up your sins and go to the Devil
And you'll never have to go to bed at all

If you care to dwell where the weather is hot
H-E-double-L is a wonderful spot
If you need a rest and you're all out of sorts
Hades is the best of the winter resorts

Paradise doesn't compare: all the nice people are there
They come there from everywhere
Just to revel with Mister Devil
Nothing on his mind but a couple of horns

Satan is waitin' with his jazz band
And his band came from Alabam' with a melody hot
No one gives a damn if it's music or not
Satan's melody makes you want to dance forever
And you never have to go to bed at all"

To some sweet beautiful drag

If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because
I want to listen to rag

My heart is palpitatin'
From all this syncopation

Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was

But soon the maytime turned to december
You had forgotten, do you remember?"

Hoping to find some soil

The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high
Washington was my destination
And now who am I?
I'm the chosen party giver
For the White House clientele
And they know that I deliver
What it takes to make 'em jell
And in Washington I'm known by one and all
As the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
They could go to Elsa Maxwell
When they had an axe to grind
They could always grind their axe well
At the parties she designed
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call
On the hostess with the mostes' on the ball

Yes, the best that can be found
And a large amount in my bank account
When election time comes 'round
If you're feeling presidential
You can make it, yes, indeed
There are just three things essential
Let me tell you all you need
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall
And the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
An Ambassador has just reached the shore
He's a man of many loves
An important gent from the Orient
To be handled with kid gloves
He can come and let his hair down
Have the best time of his life
Even bring his new affair down
Introduce her as his wife
But she mustn't leave her panties in the hall
For the hostess who's the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
[Encore:]
I've been highly complimented
And I thank you what is more
You'll be damned well represented
By your new ambassador
For my one ambition is to make them fall
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball
In the handbag that I'll carry
There's a precious little note
To their highnesses from Harry
Introducing me he wrote:
""I'll appreciate a favor large or small
For the hostess with the mostes' on the ball""
There'll be no mistakes, I've got what it takes
To make friends across the sea
I'll make being smart an important part
Of my foreign policy
I'll cement our good relations
When I give my first affair
There'll be special invitations
To the Duke and Duchess there
Who's already written asking them to call
Not the priestess with the leastes'

That's if they're contented with the little things in life
Living on a larger scale would soon entail a lot of care and strife
We could be so happy with the little things in life

And we know
They wrote some words to fit
That catchy bit

And christened it
The Piccolino
And we know that it's the reason
Why everyone this season

Is strumming and humming a new melody
Come to the casino
And hear them play the Piccolino
Dance with your bambino

To the strains of the catchy Piccolino

But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone

It's wonderful, so they say

And, with a moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand
And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And, without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand
And

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way
So they say"
Irving Berlin,This Is The Army Mister Jones,/i/irving+berlin/this+is+the+army+mister+jones_20316227.html,"Sheet music version:]
A bunch of frightened rookies were list'ning filled with awe
They listened while a sergeant was laying down the law
They stood there at attention, their faces turning red
The sergeant looked them over and this is what he said
This is the Army, Mister Jones!
No private rooms or telephones
You had your breakfast in bed before
But you won't have it there any more
This is the Army, Mister Green!
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor
But she won't help you out any more
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band
This is the Army, Mister Brown!
You and your baby went to town
She had you worried but this is war
And she won't worry you anymore"

""Your presence requested this evening, it's formal
A top hat, a white tie and tails""
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat, white tie and tails

I'm puttin' on my top hat
Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails

I'm dudein' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails

I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas

For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails"
Irving Berlin,What Chance Have I With Love?,/i/irving+berlin/what+chance+have+i+with+love_20340428.html,"Love is beautiful, love is swell
Love is as sweet as a nut
Love is grander than tongue can tell
Love is remarkable, but
Look at what it did to Antony
It made a fool out of Antony
If love could do that to Antony
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Romeo
It dealt poor Romey an awful blow
If love could do that to Romeo
What chance have I with love?
Look at what it did to Samson
'Til he lost his hair he was brave
If a haircut could weaken Samson
They could murder me with a shave
Look at what it did to Bonaparte
He lost his head when he lost his heart
If he kicked over the apple cart
What chance have I
An ordinary guy
What chance have I with love"

In those Lenox Avenue clothes
Mister Dude has disappeared with his flashy tie
You'll see in the Harlem Esquire
What the well-dressed man will desire
When he's struttin' down the street with his sweetie-pie

Sun tan, shade of green
Or an olive drab color scheme
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Dressed up in O.D.'s
With a tin hat for overseas
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear

Top hat, white tie and tails no more
They've been put away till after the war

If you want to know
Take a look at Brown Bomber Joe
That's what the well-dressed man in Harlem will wear"

I hope, I hope, I hope it's me

Who do you want I hope
Who do you need I hope

You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers thru his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

[monique:]
You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him

That you can cast aside
I've got my pride
And I won't stand for that

I want you for my wife
Sharing my care and strife
And that may not be fun
For when it's done
You're stuck with me for life
You can't brush me off

But you can't brush me off
You can't rub me out

But you can't brush me off
You can drop a hint but I won't take it
You can tell me bad news
I intend to refuse
To go
No
You can't give me back

Irving Berlin,You Can't Get A Man With A Gun,/i/irving+berlin/you+cant+get+a+man+with+a+gun_20351548.html,"Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,
And now tell me what have I got?
I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint
I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a celler, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal
Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun
If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister
Oh you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie
For a gal who he thinks is fun.
But they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas
And you can't get a hug from a mug, with a slug
Oh you can't get a man with a gun."

I've tried so hard but I fear
You'll always follow me near and far
Just when I think that I'm set
Just when I've learned to forget
I close my eyes, dear, and there you are

You keep coming back like a song
A song that keeps saying, remember

The sweet used-to-be
That was once you and me
Keeps coming back like an old melody

The perfume of roses in may
Returns to my room in december

From out of the past where forgotten things belong
You keep coming back like a song"

Johnny was bashful and shy
Nobody understood why 
Mary loved him
All the other girls passed him by
Everyone wanted to know
How she could pick such a beau
With a twinkle in her eye
She made this reply
[1st chorus:]
He's not so good in a crowd but when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by it's cover
He's got the face of an Angel
But there's a Devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing but when he starts in to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit that he's nothing at all
But in a morris chair
You'd be surprised
[2nd verse:]
Mary continued to praise
Johnny's remarkable ways
To the ladies
And you know advertising pays
Now Johnny's never alone
He has the busiest phone
Almost every other day
A new girl will say
[2nd chorus:]
He's not so good in the house but on a bench in the park
You'd be surprised
He isn't much in the light but when he gets in the dark 
You'd be surprised
I know he looks as slow as the Erie
But you don't know the half of it, dearie
He looks as cold as an Eskimo
But there's fire in his eyes
He doesn't say very much but when he starts in to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train
You'd think he was born without any brain
But in a taxicab
You'd be surprised"

The way we stand out in

Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing
Out loud

Loving you
The way I do
Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat

I want to be romantic but I haven't a chance
You've got a sense of humor, and humor is death to romance

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember"

You can't stop people from talking
And they're talking, my dear
And the things they're saying
Fill my heart with fear
Now I could never believe them
When they say you're untrue
I know that they're mistaken
Still I want to hear it from you

Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Ev'ryone is saying you don't love me
Say it isn't so

Ev'rywhere I go, ev'ryone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so

People say that you
Found somebody new
And it won't be long before you leave me
Say it isn't true

Say that ev'rything is still okay
That's all I want to know
And what they're saying
Say it isn't so"

Written by:  (See Notes) 1883


God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.

(Oh tidings of comfort and joy),
(Comfort and joy),
(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)
(Comfort and joy)

In Bethlehem in Jewry,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn

The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
(O tidings of comfort and joy,)
(Comfort and joy)
(O tidings of comfort and joy)

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
(O tidings of comfort and joy,)

{O tidings of comfort and joy}"

Happy holiday, happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you

(If your nerves a wearing thin)
(Park your load down the road)
(And come to Holiday Inn)

If the traffic noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares down the stairs
Come to Holiday Inn

(If you can't find someone who)
(Will set your heart a-whirl)
(Take your car and motor to)
(The home of boy meets girl)

If you're laid-up with a breakdown
Throw away your vitamin
(Don't get worse), grab your nurse
And come to Holiday Inn

Before they ask us to pay the bill and while we still have the chance

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea

What a break for me

'Twas from a man I used to know
About a year or so ago, before he departed
He is just as happy as can be

I'll tell you what he said to me
He said, ""If ever you get heavy-hearted
Pack up your sins and go to the devil in Hades
You'll meet the finest of gentlemen and the finest of ladies
They'd rather be down below than up above

Hades is full of thousands of Joneses and Browns
O'Hoolihans, Cohens, and Bradys
You'll hear a heavenly tune that went to the devil
Because the jazz bands they started pickin' it
Then put a trick in it, a jazzy kick in it

They've got a couple of old reformers in heaven
Making them go to bed at eleven
Pack up your sins and go to the Devil
And you'll never have to go to bed at all

If you care to dwell where the weather is hot
H-E-double-L is a wonderful spot
If you need a rest and you're all out of sorts
Hades is the best of the winter resorts

Paradise doesn't compare: all the nice people are there
They come there from everywhere
Just to revel with Mister Devil
Nothing on his mind but a couple of horns

Satan is waitin' with his jazz band
And his band came from Alabam' with a melody hot
No one gives a damn if it's music or not
Satan's melody makes you want to dance forever
And you never have to go to bed at all"

Get paid for what they do but no applause.

Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful

And, without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say"

Up and down Park Avenue?
On that famous thoroughfare,
With their noses in the air?
High hats and arrowed collars,
Wide spats and fifteen  dollars.
Spending every dime,
For a wonderful time 

If you're blue and you don' know,
Where to go to, why don't you go,
Where fashion sits?
Putting On The Ritz.
Different types, who wear a day,
Co-pants with stripes, and cut away,
Coat, perfect fits?
Putting On The Ritz.

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper,
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Super-duper

Come, let's mix where Rockerfellas,
Walk with sticks, or umbrellas,
In their mitts.
Putting On The Ritz.
Spangled gowns upon a beauty of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie,
All misfits.
Putting On The Ritz.

Tips his hat just like an English chappie,
To a lady with the wealthy happy.
Very Snappy 

You'll declare it's simply topping,
To be there, and hear them swapping,
Smart titbits.

Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

I want my arm(s) about you
That (Those) charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...

And he can go right back where he came from
I'm afraid I never loved him
Sweetie he'd be better off with you
I could never make him happy

All I ever wanted to do was
Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he's read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had a little too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him cos I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me
Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Oh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
And, not for just a year, but, always

Irving Berlin,Always,/p/paul+mccartney/always_20993705.html,"Everything went wrong and the whole day long
I'd feel so blue.
For the longest while I'd forget to smile
Then I met you.
Now that my blue days have passed, 
Now that I've found you at last, 

Chorus:
I'll be loving you always, 
With a love as true always.
When the things you plan need a helping hand, 
I will understand always, always.
Days may not be fair always.
That's when I'll be there, always, 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year but always.
Days may not be fair always.
That's when I'll be there, always, 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year but always"

Have you seen the well-to-do 
Up and down Park Avenue 
On that famous thoroughfare 
With their noses in the air 

High hats and arrowed collars 
Wide spats and fifteen dollars 
Spending every dime 
For a wonderful time 

If you're blue and you don't know 
Where to go to, why don't you go 
Where fashion sits 
Puttin' on the Ritz 

Different types, who wear a day coat 
Pants with stripes, and cut away coat 
Perfect fits 
Puttin' on the Ritz 

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper 
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper 
Super-duper! 

Come, let's mix where Rockerfellers 
Walk with sticks, or umber-ellas 
In their mitts 
Puttin' on the Ritz 

Spangled gowns upon a beauty 
Of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie 
All misfits 
Puttin' on the Ritz 

Strolling up the avenue so happy 
All dressed up just like an English chappie 
Very snappy! 

You'll declare it's simply topping 
To be there, and hear them swapping 
Smart tidbits 
Puttin' on the Ritz 
Puttin' on the Ritz 
Puttin' on the Ritz"

Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek

The charm about you
Will carry me through

Irving Berlin,Mr Monotony,/s/sarah+brightman/mr+monotony_10211913.html,"Playin' on his slide-trombone
In a certain monotone
He was known as mr. monotony.
Any pleasant interlude
That would mean a change of mood
Didn't go with mr. monotony.
Sometimes he would change the key,
But the same dull melody
Would emerge from mr. monotony.

Folks for miles would run away,
Only one preferred to stay.
She would come around and say:
""have you got any monotony today?""


They got married as they should
And around the neighbourhood
She was known as mrs. monotony.
They were happy as could be
And they raised a family,
Six or seven little monotonies.


From another village came a snappy clarinetter.
She heard him play and strange to say she liked him better.
That was the end of mr. monotony.


Oh, she refused him when he tried,
Bringing her back to his side.
She just answered when he cried:
""have you got any monotony today?""
""have you got any monotony today?""
""have you got any monotony today?""


Bye, bye, mr. monotony.


Mr. monotony,
Is that you?
Hey, mr. monotony ...?


Oh, this playing is wonderful!
Oh, mr. monotony, i come back to you any time.


Mr. monotony, don't go away,
Surely i didn't really mean it.
Oh, mr. monotony, i need you back ...."

When he's invited
To hear some long-haired genius play
So you can keep your fiddle and your bow
Give me a P-I-A-N-O-O-O
And let's step right up to an upright
Or a fine-toned baby grand

One night while along life’s raging sea
It looked as if I would suffer defeat
The blackness of night closed off the light
My heart sank with fear
My desperate cry rang out with fright
All I could see was no hope in sight
With faith all but gone I met the one
Who came looking for me

He came looking for me
He came looking for me
He made a way
When there was no way
That I could see
When I drifted far
Jesus was near
To rescue my soul and calm all my fears
Now I’m safe from all harm
Since I’ve met the one
Who came looking for me

[Verse 2:]
Old Satan had already picked out my grace
His plan had moved forward to put me away
I’d drifted so far would anyone care that I’d soon be lost
I knew my destruction was a matter of time
Jesus appeared and said this one is mine
Now I’m safe from all harm
Cause He walked through the storm
He came looking for me"

Indigo Girls,(Unknown),/i/indigo+girls/unknown_10144526.html,"Me and my baby
We drank some magic tea
We're crusing down the rural roads
Aesthetics of poverty

I'm going down for the last time
I shifted to my level
Can you receive what you give me
Somebody should set you free

In the morning
When you wash your hair
I love those simple things that
Make me know your there

Come every sunday evening
It's leftovers from the weekenders
Lost limbs to identify
Frustration for the grieving"

Flying in from london

Where they say you should not wander
After dark

New york
Like a scene from all those movies
But youre real enough to me
But theres a heart
A heart that lives in new york

A heart in new york
A rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in new york
Love in her eye
An open door and a friend for the night

Nearer my god to thee
I start making a deal
Inspired by gravity
If I did wrong I won't do it again
'Cause I can be sweet and good and nice
And if I had enemies their friends
I'll hold to my life with the grip of a vice

And I'm up on the airplane
Nearer my god to thee
I start making a deal

That little spot on the ground is my hometown
I like to call it my home and it's sweet
I'd rather take a seat down there
Than a throne up here up above 30,000 feet
And I'm up on the airplane

I never should have read my horoscope
Or the fortune on the bubble strip
Saying what you think won't happen will
A great thing to read before a trip
On an airplane

Pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool
Big fluffy clouds like a feather bed
I'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head
Lying in my bed which is in my hometown
Which is on the ground
Far from an airplane

And I cant no I cant get no relief
Ah these businessmen they all they drink our wine
And the plowman well he dig my earth
And you know that ah none of them along the line
Can show me what any of this is worth
You know we wanted to see it now didnt we
Didnt we

There aint no reason to get excited
Ah the thief you know he kindly spoke
Well now there are those among us right here right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke
But you and I we have been through that
I tell you that this this is not our fate no no no
Now let us all not talk falsely now
You know the hour well its getting late

I said all along the watchtower
The princes they kept the view
While the women the women
They came and then they went
And barefoot servants too
Thats me thats you
But outside theres a cold distance
Listen for the wildcats
Here them growl
Two riders were approaching
As the wind began to howl
I said now shelter me

Oh there are those among us right here right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke
All along the watchtower
I said all along this watchtower
Those of you who still have eyes to see
Ears hear me
You will be saved by grace in the end
Saved by time if you dont understand
That your hatred is rooted in your fear
And your paranoia and insecurities
Well they dont belong here
You got to take someones hand
You got to learn to make your stand
And its one two three four
Look at the sky you can open the door
And take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Ah dont you want to touch
Dont you want to feel
Dont you know that this is real
I said shelter me

Dust in our eyes our own boots kicked up
Heartsick we nursed along the way we picked up
You may not see it when it's sticking to your skin
But we're better off for all that we let in

Lost friends and loved ones much too young
So much promises and work left undone
When all that guards us is a single centerline
And the brutal crossing over when it's time

Oooooooo
(I don't know where it all begins)
Oooooooo
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Oooooooo
(We're better off for all that we let in)

One day those toughies will be withered up and bent
The father son the holy warriors and the president
With glory days of put up dukes for all the world to see
Beaten into submission in the name of the free

We're in a nevolution I have heard it said
Everyone's so busy now but do we move ahead
The planets hurting and atoms splitting
And a sweater for your love you sit there knitting

Oooooooo

Oooooooo
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Oooooooo
(We're better off for all that we let in)

See those crosses on the side of the road
Tied with ribbons in the medium
They make me grateful I can go this far
Lay me down and never wake me up again

Kat writes a poem and she sticks it on my truck
We don't believe in war and we don't believe in luck
The birds were calling to her what were they saying
As the gate blew open the tops of the trees were swaying

I've passed the cemetery walk my dog down there
I read the names in stone and say a silent prayer
When I get home you're cooking supper on the stove
And the greatest gift of life is to know love

Veering off the road and into you
All the people drive by slowly gawking at the scene
Of the smoldering inevitable spark and gasoline
All the way I met you head on full speed
At the heart the blue flames burns
All the way I took the crash course impact
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn
No amount of th playing safe could save me from this day
The head seeking path of my trajectory
Didn't we cooly divest of predestination
Slamming into futures we can't see
I know what can happen when there's more than meets teh eye
But there's no way to avoid it just get in the car and drive
All the way I met you head on full speed
At the heart the blue flame burns
All the way the crash course impact
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn
It makes me laugh talking over tea
When I can still smell the smoke on my sleeve
Steaming like gunsmoke the wreckage of our past
The scene of a crime I still can't leave
Oh you and me, we should let well enough be
But each revisitation points to clues
There's the oilslick of uncertainty
And warning signs back there we didn't use
At least we laugh about it now how we escaped alive
It's remarkable the mess we make and what we can survive"

So far away from home
So far away from home

I don't know a soul whos not been battered
I don't have a friend feels who at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to its knees
Oh but its all right
Its all right
Weve lived so well so long
Still when I think of the road were traveling on
I wonder whats gone wrong
I can't help it I wonder
Whats gone wrong

And I dreamed I was dying
I dreamed that my soul
Rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying
High up above
My eyes could clearly see
The statue of liberty
Sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was dying

Oh we come on a ship they call the mayflower
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come in the ages most uncertain hour
And sing an american tune
Oh but its all right
Its all right

And I'm trying to get some rest

To get some rest"

Turning sharply past the graveyard to the lakefront with the black waves licking up the stones
To the swayed back screened in front porch who could ever stay the weight of flesh and bones

Andy aren't you tired from the sun and rain and river soaking you
From the beer cans on your dashboard and the bullet hole glass spiderweb staining your rear view
I have watched you watch an empty road is it only her upon which all of you's depending
To fill your twenty hour work day while all the fences in this county still need mending

And in the night I do my checking and fix the broken part with visions of rare beauty
But in my heart I know I'm second forever fixed in your pursuit it is my duty

Andy will you toss me a little scrap of something I can taste
Instead of dust from all the leaving and the smell of summer lying here to waste
Under the burnt pyre of all the cast away the tiny shoots will spring like questions will you take me
Out to the fenced field sprinkled with horses, wild in resistance to the taming will you break me
Will you break me"

Been afraid to look inside

In bittersweet and queen annes lace
Looked inside where a single rose grew
There I saw loves face

Down the county road we share.
Our southern blood, my heresy,
Damn that ol' confederacy.

Become the thing I am to you.
And you won't tear it apart
Without a fight, without a heart.

I'm sorry for what you have learned,
When you feel the tables turn.
To run so hard in your race,
Now you find who set the pace.
The landed aristocracy
Exploiting all your enmity.
All your daddies fought in vain,
Leave you with the mark of Cain.

It took a long time to
Become the thing I am to you.
And you won't tear it apart
Without a fight, without a heart.
It took a long time to
Become you, become you.

The center holds, so they say.
It never held too well for me.
I won't stop short for common ground
That vilifies the trodden down.
The center held the bonded slave
For the sake of industry.
The center held the bloody hand
Of the executioner man.

I thought of Atlanta
I thought of Toronoto
And all of the places we've been
I filled up my tea and looked into the trees
And still came up empty again
So I guess the next time you see me
In a world of partial truths
You will fully believe me
I have nothing to give except but to live
Like the person you know me to be
I can clean up the kitchen
And fold up your clothes
Neatley as I am able
Wrap a box up with ties for a surprise
And order you flowers for the table
I could book us a trip
On a plane or ship
I know how much you love the sun
You could gamble on me
Like the lottery
And I'll make you feel like you've won
And I'll bet the next time you see me
In a world of partial truths
You will fully believe me
I have nothing to give except but to live
Like the person you know me to be
Life is short and so on
I'd like to give you something to go on
Grow on
They recently paved the walk on our street
We looked at the shiny cement
We stopped the car ready to carve
Our names into permanence
For a moment we're kids
Intent on a whim
There is no shadowy past
But even so the urge is to go
And put something down
That will last
So here goes
The next time I show up for you
You will know
And believe
I am ready to give
Ready to live
Like the person you know me to be."

I just might
Stop to check you out

Body and beats
I stain my sheets
I don't even know why

My girlfriend
Shes at the end
She is starting to cry

When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out

I'm high as a kite
I just might
Stop to check you out

Let me go on
Like a blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands I know your the one"

Leaning over ledges, only two flights up.
Cutting my heart, burning my soul.

Nothing left but, blood and fire.

You have spent nights, thinking of me,
Missing my arms, but you needed to leave.
Leaving my cuts, leaving my burns,
Hoping I'd learn.

Blood and fire
Are too much for these restless arms to hold.
And my nights of desire are calling me,
Back to your fold.
And I am calling you, calling you from 10, 000 miles away
Won't you wet my fire with your love, babe?

I am looking for someone, who can take as much as I give,
Give back as much as I need,
And still have the will to live.
I am intense, I am in need,
I am in pain, I am in love.
I feel forsaken, like the things I gave away.

Send them on to a safer home (burn it to secrecy)

Soldiers are coming to plunder but there are some things they will never know
We made our love out of dignity, we dug our nails in the dirt
Hung out towel soaked souls out on the line we loved so hard that it hurt
To ease my pain I took a pen and paper, incarnate came the bleeding
Send it back before the public eye perverts it in the reading

Telling me his friends are gone
That they've died and flown away

Someone looked me in the eye
And said time will ease your pain
But behold, when you fall
It's that same old cannonball
Coming back for your heart again

Who shot me down
Who will cut me down

And some say your genius is in your madness will you get better then will you leave us?
How you mixed with the darkness at such a young age
Until in your chemistry science and violence turned silence to rage
Why are you dreaming this, one shoe off and a bridge to cross over
And where is your taxi fare, are you left by yourself or left by your lover?
For three nights straight now I dream I keep both of my shoes but I've forgotten my lines and
I've misplace my cues, and there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on,
And I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from
There were the secrets the big bang and the bigger joke
You seem to know all of them and injustice makes you red with choke
You love like you're desperate you don't know what love is
I thought if there was one thing I could give you one thing I could give you, maybe it was this
With your head on the bed board the anguished repeat the sweat of our sadness the twist of the sheets
I don't want what's best for you, where will I be when you've found it?
I pray a lot about these bad feelings inside but I can't pray my way through or around it"

Jangling beads, a silver ring.

Jumping up-falling down.

Look yourself in the eye before you drown.

Royal rebels discover you.
Trust? You turn there is no truth.
And circle, circle, why are you scared?
Why a smile instead of tears?
I'm gulping smoke to fade away.
Figures floating down to lay.
Meet the joker and the thief,
The king and queen but-no relief.

Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.

Just starin at the screen
An uneasy feelin in my chest
Just wonderin what it means

So come back woody guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into jesus
Maybe he can help us out
Come back woody guthrie
To us now

I followed in your footsteps once
Back in my travelin days
Somewhere I failed to find your trail
Now I'm stumblin through the haze

Theres killers on the highway now
And a man can't get around
So I just sold my soul for wheels that roll

See theres foxes in the henhouse
And theres cows out in the corn

And their proud red banners torn

But if you listen to the radio
Theyll tell you all is well

I got a job at the grocery store
A few bucks an hour and not much more
The world comes in just to take things away
And eat it all up and then they sleep into day

I try not to care I would lose my mind
Running 'round the same thing time after time
Only two things bound to soothe my soul cold beer and remote control

Once upon a time I was nobody's fool
Two jobs and showing up for school
I guess it comes apart so little by little
You don't know you're there till you're stuck in the middle
So I try not care I would lose my mind
Running 'round the same thing time after time
Only two things bound to soothe my soul cold beer and remote control

Sit down the room is dark the blurry graffiti on the benches across at the public park
The plastic's black and buttoned the haze is blue
And all I want is nothing to do

'Cause it's a long walk to the bus stop
It's a long wait for the turning clock
A two-tired car sitting up on the blocks
And things I put aside like that pile of rocks

I try not to care I would lose my mind
Running 'round the same thing time after time

Drug across your landscape and buried in your cave
You're piling up and out of sight
But trying to add it up just feels like counting shades of light
Call me when you breeze through to your appointments what you must do
Call me I'm collecting you
Hang it in my window let it complicate my view
The separation the glass of you
But I can paint this picture any way that I see fit
The art of pain the subject sits unmoved"
Indigo Girls,Come A Long Way,/i/indigo+girls/come+a+long+way_21099823.html,"I've come a long way
I was a show on ice
Dazzling and brittle
But subject to the sun

And then one day
I went little by little
Back to the water
The place where I'd come from

And I went under
Like stones tied in a sack
And I got emptied
And started my way back

My name
It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

And all my schemes drowned at the seams
Have left me fine in my own skin
I've come a long way
Just to begin

I've come a long way
Under the cover of darkness
Trusting a stranger
A boatman at the shore

The scourge of hope
The ugly face of danger
The keepers of the keys
Had me down on my knees
In front of the gilded doors

And in a world where every ax was poised to grind
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine

My name
It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

And all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind
I've come a long way

I used to be twisted
When you called it an opiate
A simple way to cope
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes

They start out tight
And then they hurt your tired feet at night
But then they give a little day by day
And then before you know it
You look back and you've come a long way

It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

You call my name
My name
You call my name
My shame
You call my name
My home
Everything I own
You call my name

If it's got my name, it's got your name on it
Everything I own has got your name on it
When I was trying to cross the river
You were at the river getting me across and now
Everything, everything I own
Has got your name on it
Oh everything
I've got your name on it"

Half light the moon left while a
A cluster of night jars sang some
Songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone
Down from the room

Come down in time
I still hear him say
So clear in my ear
Like it was today
Come down in time
Was the message he gave
Come down in time and ill
Meet you half way

Well I don't know if I should have
Heard him as yet but a
True love like his is a
A hard love to get and I've
Walked most all the way and I
I aint heard him call and I'm
Getting to thinking
If hes coming at all

So clear in my ear

Some hold you tight while
Some leave you counting the

You speak so cryptically that's not news to me
The flood is here it will carry you
And I've got work to do.

But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before
Come back here and shut the door

There is fire there is lust
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust
There's a bag of silver for a box of nails
It's so simple the betrayal
Though it's known to change the world and what's to come.

Just come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of it's own
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before
Don't you recognize them anymore
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.

There's the given and the expected
I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected
Is this for better is this for worse
You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.

I hear the owl in the night
I realize that some things never are made right
By some will we string together here
Days to months and months to years
What if everything we have adds up to nothing.

For the angry gods to see

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
He offered life with sacrifice
So that others might go on

And war was never known

And they lifted many stones

And they carried them across the flatland

Built up with their bare hands

To keep their bodies brave

Tu es dans ma coeur et dans ma tete

Where the winter never reaches
There we fell
Dying swan
On the dawn you danced before me
Though your eyes were dark and stormy
I stood still

Though the distances divide us
Theres a paradise inside us

Shed your dancing shoes"

Remember this in your heart

Lying on the bright blue jumping mat
Dinner bell is ringing
Barking dogs and model planes
And the sound of passing trains
We watch for bonfires in the sky
On the beach in July
Spin the bottle steal the kiss
Postcards to the one I miss forever
The one I miss forever

And as we sat stuck you could hear the trash truck
Making it's way through the neighborhood
Picking up the thrown out different from house to house
We get to decide what we think is no good
We're sculpted from youth, the chipping away makes me weary
And as for the truth it seems like we just pick a theory
The one that justifies our daily lives
And backs us with quiver and arrows
To protect openings cause when the warring begins
How quickly the wide open narrows
Into the smallness of our deconstruction of love
We thought it was changing, but it never was
It's just the same as it ever was
A family of foxes came to my yard and dug in
I looked in a book to see what this could possibly mean
Cause there is fate in the breeze and signs in the trees
Possible tragic events
When forces collide with the damage strewn wide
And holes blasted straight through the fence
The sky starts to crash the rain on the roof starts to drumming
And laid out like cash your take on my list of shortcomings
The show starts to close, I know how this goes
The plot a predictable showing
And though it seems grand it's just one speck of sand
And back to the hourglass we're going
Back to the smallness of our deconstruction of love
We thought it was changing, but it never was
Our deconstruction of love"

Trying to take her back. She sees the day lilies for sale sign
And the tears spring to her eyes. You turned the car around
You headed back down that track.
She's had a heart attack but the bottle of jack sits on the
Counter like the devil she knows. He beats her up as she fills
Her cup and the embers of a dying fire glow.
You see how she looked in her school yearbook.
Her friends signed the margins all around, would you stay in
Touch you know I'll miss you so much and I hope we get out
Of this town.
Every day that you get up and force your cards. You're
Playing your story in fists ans starts. You take your prospects
And your pick axe and you trudge down to the stream.
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream.
I went looking for the answers from someone I heard believes that life gets easier. You learn how to breathe or you lern how to grieve the past.
You study the masters and their books giving in to the barbs and hooks.
Till you execpt it with grace when your true love doesn't last.

And the covenants against the trailers.

At all those rotten men in ""camo"" drag
With their advantage and their guns
Up the deer stand shooting up a storm

Rhythm and rhyme and harmony

When you were sweet sixteen, I was already mean and
Feeling bad for giving it up to the man just to make the scene.
Where were you, back when I had something to prove, 
With the switchblade set and the church kids learning my moves?

I ran for miles through the suburbs of the seventies, 
Pollen dust and Pixie sticks, kissing in the deep end
Of swimming pools before I knew what's in there.
We come into this life waterlogged and tender.

Spilling their sons' blood like table wine
Remember everything in it's own time
The music whispers you in urgency hold fast to that languageless connection
A thread of known that was unknown and unseen seen dangling from inside the fifth direction
Boys around the table mapping out their strategies
Kings all of mountains one day dust
A lesson learned a loving God and things in their strategies
Kings all of mountains one day dust
A lesson learned a loving God and things in their own time
In nothing more do I trust
We own nothing, nothing is ours

The weightlessness of us as things around begin to shift

And I tell her youre getting by
But its pain and numbness
Side by side

You came on the scene
Like a star in the northern night
She spread her love to you
Like the warmth of a southern sky

And so it goes on
You know its night and day
One always slips away
Theres no one left to blame

Love falls down you know and your
And your heart falls to pieces
And your soul might get lost along the way

And all these songs
They used to make you shine
They are just lullabies for your nightmares
I don't want to shed your tears

I followed you northern star
And I shared the fall with you
Now I felt the cold glow of the sunset
And I saw that liars moon

Some of us will come down to earth
Some of us will burn
Loves not always as bright as it should be
Tell me do you want to be free

Well your love falls down you know
And your heart might fall to pieces
And I saw your soul get lost along the way

All these songs now they used to make you shine
They are just lullabies for your nightmares
And Ill sing them softly now

Lately I've felt the warmth
Of the one who tore down my walls
But then I look at you
And your twilight consumes it all it does

Now I wished upon your falling star
Praying I wont fall that hard
And that my love is all it seems to be
Because Ill swear it set me free

When your love flies away well honesty
That's about the best you can the best you can do
But arent you empty inside
Arent you

But you were long gone before I ever got to you
Before you blazed past this address

And now I think of having loved and having lost
But never know what it feels like to never love
Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above

Fare thee well my bright star
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise

Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings
For a cool evening I began to yearn
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire
Waiting to see if I would burn

Fare thee well my bright star
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive

And I caught you then in your moment of glory
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me
My once in a lifetime star of an age

So fare thee well my bright star
Last night the tongues of fire circled me around
And this strange season of pain will come to pass
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down"

And the stick of gold became the standard measure
Nothing much has changed in this modern age
And it won't until the pain's not worth the pleasure

And for all we've left undone 
There's another war to come.

Where they lie.

I miss the smell of ink on paper and it's morning pull
All the news comes via link now all so virtual
I don't know what to think 
I don't know what to feel
The beginning of the end or reinvention of the wheel

And for all we've left undone
We are still evolution

Can't do it alone oh no we can't although we've tried and tried and tried

I realize that the beast lie there in our plans
Peacefully sleeping, but faithfully keeping
They're ready for the burden man

But if you knew something (peacefully sleeping)
They'd take you to something (faithfully keeping)
You are dying for your burden man (they're ready for the burden man)

Wouldn't you feed it? (Wouldn't you feed it?)
Wouldn't you praise it evermore?

Past the sadness of the salt flats
To the prospect of the land fat
Or just a lazy orange house cat
On the sofa where I'll be put up
You've been the hole in my sky, (you're) my shrinking water supply
Before my well runs dry
I'm going round round round the bend
Fill it up again
I'd like to say that it was clear to me
Love triangle geometry
But in the end it's still a mystery
The placement of affection and the dissaray
I gathered up the courage that it took
Made that bed
I took one last look
And you could hear the pages flapping in the wind blown
Book of my days, my days

One tank gone second thoughts are on my mind
What's this trip gonna cost me this time
The devil I know is starting to look awfully kind
But the new road is an old friend
Fill it up again

On clover leaf and pine

But there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

I've seen like a bird
What pleasures the surface can bring
I've lost my best craft
Going foolishly back
To where to Sirens sing
I've stared up at the place where the water meets the sky
And though I stopped breathing I still believe I should try
Maybe a boat in search of lost treasures will pass by.

'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty
When she's shining in the port
And the harbor clings to the jetty
For protection and support
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day.

I've walked through the desert
Climbed over mountains so high
Through jungles and plains
I took buses and trains
And airplanes across the sky
But none as seductive as ocean before me alone
And now I know why
You layered your pockets with stones.

'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty
When she's shining in the port
And the harbor clings to the jetty
For protection and support
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day.

When I was a girl
All of my fancy took flight
And I had this dream
Could outshine anything
Even the darkest night
Now I wait like a widow for someone to come back from sea
I've always known
I was waiting for me

You went there too

Find the song in you that no one's heard
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight
Through this short life
Everyone's got a deep regret
We try to ground ourselves to forget
But your race to the end is neck and neck
You love them, you love them not

I offer thanks to those before me
That's all I've got to say
'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime

But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
To let the next life off the hook
But she'll say ""look what I had to overcome from my last life
I think I'll write a book""

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

You will understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
Its there at your command

Indigo Girls,Ghost,/i/indigo+girls/ghost_20067260.html,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to from our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever of the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

The Mississippi's mighty, but it starts in Minnesota
At a place where you can walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
But at this point you rush right through me and I start to drown

There's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals crossed and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret it gets whispered in a hush (don't tell a soul)
And when I wake the things I dreamt about you last night make me blush (don't
Tell a soul)
When you kiss me like a lover and you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like the piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
But I would walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
Dance the edge of sanity I've never been this close
In love with your ghost
Oooooh-oooooooh-ooooooh-oooooooooh
Oooooh-oooooooh-ooooooh-oooooooooh

Unknowing captor you'll never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it a cry to be free
Oh I'm forever under lock and key
As you pass through me

Now I see your face before me; I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill to swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me I can't swim free the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch I am no worse at most
In love with your ghost

Amy:
In love with your ghost
In love with your ghost
Emily:
You are shadowing my dreams"

Called me to say, he just gave it to god and slipped from the
Living' with bills piling up and a back that was givin' in.
It's been years since I've seen anyone, and now I'm just sittin'
Here in the dark, stallin' out in my car, wishin' I could bum a light
From the ghost of the gang tonight.
Cathy lost a nephew under the wheels of a train, in a
Mid-day sucide after a losing streak. He just stood on the
Tracks and gave it to glory, I never called her to say I'm
Sorry.
My friends, it's been years but I'm thinking about you
And all of your tears now I'm just sittin' here in the dark afraid to make a stupid call, wishin' I could bum a light from the ghost of the gang
Tonight.
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride for the years we missed
And the friends that died-side swiped baby on the road
Somehow, with a pack of dreams that just wern't allowed.
Maybe your walking those halls all quiet and sad, or
Sittin' in the dark all scared and mad, feel my hand reach
Across and don't forget where we come from baby, 'cause
There's truth in it.
Yeah we huddled against the cold in those days by the
Light of a fire in a pep rally haze. With a smokin' lounge pass and a
Reason for livin'. No Matter how hard it got, we
Wouldn't give into it.
My friends, it's been years, since I've seen anyone or cried these tears. Now I'm sittin' here in the dark, stallin' out in my car, wishin' I could bum a ride from the ghost of the gange tonight."

Something I could not foresee.
All the deals I made don't matter
If I can't just let you be.

Gone again gone again
There ain't no way I'm gonna let this heart mend
Gone again

I walked in King's Cross for a while,
Gave a junkie girl a smile.
We both trade it in for danger
Or the company of strangers.
She said all her family
Was at the welfare agency,
Then she swindled my last twenty
For a kiss and some poetry.

Gone again gone again
There ain't no way I'm gonna let this heart mend
Gone again

If I don't make Kakadu,
I'll be at the Rainbow Room.
I'll be courting some disaster
With the Melbourne wrecking crew.
Honey, all this is to say
That every dog don't got it's day,
If we take the love we're given
And we throw it all away.

A blistered hand on the handle of a shovel
I've been digging too deep, I always do.
I see my face on the surface
I look a lot like narcissus
A dark abyss of an emptiness
Standing on the edge of a drowning blue.
I look behind my ears for the green
Even my sweat smells clean
Glare off the white hurts my eyes
Gotta get out of bed get a hammer and a nail
Learn how to use my hands, not just my head
I think myself into jail
Now I know a refuge never grows
From a chin in a hand in a thoughtful pose
Gotta tend the earth if you want a rose.
I had a lot of good intentions
Sit around for fifty years and then collect a pension,
Started seeing the road to hell and just where it starts.
But my life is more than a vision
The sweetest part is acting after making a decision
I started seeing the whole as a sum of it's parts.
My life is part of the global life
I'd found myself becoming more immobile
When I'd think a little girl in the world can't do anything.
A distant nation my community
A street person my responsibility
If I have a care in the world I have a gift to bring."

All with hope, all with hope that
Emptiness brings fullness and
Loss of love brings wholeness to us all.
Everything that I believe crawls from underneath the streets.
Everything I truly love comes from somewhere high above.
Everything that I believe is wrong with you is wrong with me.
Everything I truly love I love in you and I love in me.
So give me hope, give me hope that
Emptiness brings fullness and
Loss of love brings wholeness to us all.
Swear you can't swim the river,
I saw you running to jump in.
I swore I would never be your sinner,
Until I held your sin.
Now you ask me why I'm here.
The same as you, I'm scared - it's fear.
I've become the beggar now, you've become the saint somehow.
Twist the words and place the blame. Tell me now aren't we the same?
Tripping in our yellow feet, checking underneath our sheets,
For some hope, give me hope that
Emptiness brings fullness and
Loss of love brings wholeness to us all."

Smashed by the bombs from above

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us

Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil
There's just no medium for life
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral the living God called
And I prayed for my life here on earth

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us

There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon
Bleeding it's light like a lamb
And the town is illumined, it's tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me the time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keep

Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of christopher robin and pooh

So help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at pooh corner by one
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky

Indigo Girls,I Believe In Love,/i/indigo+girls/i+believe+in+love_20537527.html,"When we tried to rework all of this
Each to her rendition
Painted ourselves in a corner
Lost for ideas blindly fishing
For a compliment or kindness
Just to bring us into view
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you

I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds
I tried to make out some connection
We were at a loss for words
After all that we've been through
I could not see giving up
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
And I believe in you and I believe in love

So we went rolling on down through the years
Taking time off we could steal
Until the thief of things unreconciled
Stuck it's stick into the wheel
Now we're tumbling in a freefall
No one's gonna go unscathed
But it's not because you held back and it's not how I behaved

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
I believe in you and I believe in love

There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands
So just let it go and see where it lands

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
I believe in you and I believe in love
I believe in you and I believe in love"

And you know I wasnt really looking
But I caught him out of the corner of my eye
The next thing I know he was moving my way
I thought he wanted to talk
But this is what he had to say

Amy:

Yall sing it with me

I have to admit I was a little bit surprised
But I wasnt really scared cause I was twice his size

I gave him my name

But I got to know your number
I know your name babe
But I got to know your number your number
I said one time or another baby
I'm gonna be your lover
Yeah I wanna be your lover

Emily:
Well I said to myself this guy is persistent
Hes a little bit dumb but at least hes consistent
I tried to talk cool but when we touched I went under
I made a quick decision and I gave him my number

Amy:
I know your number
But I don't know what to say babe

Emily:

Amy:

I wanna be you lover

Emily:
Well you probably wont believe this
But we got married one day
And I still don't know if he speaks english
Cause he doesn't have much to say
Its a damn good thing I like lying around
We don't make much conversation
But love makes sounds
You know what I'm talking about
Yall know what I'm talking about
Well one thing I've learned from being in this state

Emily and amy:
There are other ways to communicate

Sweet silver bells

Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere
Filling the air

Oh how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale,
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

On, on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To every home

It was you with the courage and the commitment
To start your new life
You make me believe in mine
But can't you see the confusion
Through my troubled smile
I'm torn between losing me
Losing me and gaining you

Maybe I've been distant
Maybe I've been cold
But I've done it for my own existence
And I do believe I do believe its getting old

I might never say I care

A suckerin his midst.

Owe you an apology too many thanks and that's not all. I've
Been running long before I learned to crawl.
My calender lies crumpled laid to waste. It's been
Scrawled on, thumbed through and changed. Will this be
The measure of my days? Dinners and appointments and
Deadlines I can't make. And when I start to see it making
Sense for me. That's just hope springing eternally.

Owe you an apology too many thanks and that's not all. I've
Been running long before I learned to crawl.
Outside the summer's gone for good. Dying impatiens
Stacked up wood. My friends will get together to cook. To
Talk about what happened to take a second look. The master
Loves the servant who blind heeds him. The husband the
Obedient wife. The snake will always bite the hand that deeds him.
Even if you love him even if you save his life.

Indigo Girls,It Won't Take Long,/i/indigo+girls/it+wont+take+long_20067416.html,"They said some men would be warriors
Some men would be kings
Some men would be owners of land
And other man-made things
False love as the eternal flame
Would move some to think in rings
And gold would be our power
And other foolish things

And you who dream of liberty
Must not yourselves be fooled
Before you get to plea for freedom
Youve agreed to being ruled
If the body stays a shackle
Then the mind remains a chain
And that will link you to your destiny
Where by other souls are slain

It wont take long
It wont take too long at all

Three men in a desert wandering
One is knowing and two are scared
They say time is in the river
Oh but the river is not there
Dry in spirit
Dry in body
Two will lend themselves to death
And in grief one weeps into his hands
And drinks his bitter tears

cause it dont take long
It dont take too long at all
No it dont take long
You may say
I dont know what youre talking about
And I say
You mean to tell me thats all

And I stand before you now
I am hopeful in my rage
You know love has finally called for me
I will not wilt upon its stage
But you know still smaller than my nightmare
Now do I print upon the page
And do we have to live inside its walls
To identify the cage

cause it takes so long
Why does it take so long
And it takes so long
You may say
I dont really care what youre talking about
Im gonna ask you
You trying to tell me you dont belong

I am my mothers daughter
But I have seen myself in you
Its this blessing that I follow now
And so I must speak true
I dreamed of thousands dying
It was you and you and you
And while the city sleeps so quietly
There is something we must do

And it wont take long
It wont take too long at all
It wont take long
May say
I dont know if I wanna know what youre getting at
It makes me wanna say
So long

Grief shall come in measures
Only grief alone will know
And youll see it on your family
And on your own face it will grow
Then theyll try to keep you hungry
And theyll tell you to eat snow
You know pride can be a moving thing
If we learn the strength of no

And it wont take long
It wont take too long at all
No it wont take long
You may say
I dont think this has anything to do with me
Did you ever think you could be wrong

At noon on one day coming
Human strength will fill the streets
Of every city on our planet
Hear the sound of angry feet
With business freezed up in the harbour
The kings will pull upon their hair
And the banks will shudder to a halt
And the artists will be there

cause it wont take long
It wont take too long at all
No it wont take long
And you may say
I dont think I can be a part of that
And it makes me want to say
Dont you want to see yourself that strong

Division between the peoples
Will disappear that honoured day
And though oceans lie between us
Lifted candles light the way
Half will join their hands by moonlight
The rest under the rising sun
As underneath the sun and moon
A ritualed wailing has begun

And it wont take long
It wont take too long at all
And it wont take long
And you may say
I dont know how to be a part of what youre talking about
And it makes me want to say
Come on
Come on

Oh beware you sagging diplomats
For you will not hear one gun
And though our homes be torn and ransacked
We will not be undone
For as we let ourselves be bought
Were gonna let ourselves be free
And if you think we stand alone
Take a look around and you will see

We are children in the rafters
We are babies in the park
We are lovers at the movies
We are candles in the dark
We are changes in the weather
We are snowflakes in july
We are women grown together
We are men who easily cry
We are words no quickly spoken
Were the deeper side of try
We are dreamers in the making
We are not afraid of why"

I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand
I look at the burned out empty like a plague across the land
And for everything I learn there are two I don't understand
That's why I'm still on a search through the weather strewn church I'm doing the best
I can and it's alright
And it's alright though we worry and fuss, we can't get over the hump or get over us
It seems easier to push than to let go and trust but it's alright
When we get a little distance some things get clearer
Give em the space our hearts grow nearer I ran as hard as I could and still ended up here
But it's alright I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand
I look at the fires of hatred burning up the bounty of this beautiful land
I know I'm small in a way but I know I'm strong
And it's my thirst that brought me to the water when I give it all up then she carries me on and it's alright
Yeah it's alright
And it's alright though I feel afraid my plans in pieces my plans mislaid
It's the will of the way the will of the way the will of the only way
That could have brought me here today and it's alright."

So sad to see the man losing ground

On all fours

Mama don't you call him my name
He can't hear you anymore
And even if he seems the same to you
That's a stranger to your door
Go on ask him whats he come here for

Oh my God a monkey can move a man
Send him to hell and home again
With an empty hand in the afternoon
Shooting for the moon

Hes halfway sick and its halfway stoned
Hed sure like to quit but hes too far far gone
And theyll wind him down with the methadone
Hes all on his own

I can feel the soul searching
Where do I go when I've lost my cause
We are the stories
Even the good ones let me down
There all just words to pass the time

I used to be so sincere
And maybe I still am
And all this small talk I've been reeling off
Is slowly getting out of hand

I mix real feelings
With the ones I wish I had
And I catch the most important ones
In between them all
Sometimes it seems like theyre all just words
To pass the time

And then weve lost our time
And weve wasted out words
And all the strain is gone
Sometimes its too unreal to believe
Just don't give it all away
Get a grip
Causes sometimes there are just words to pass the time

I said I'm too high I'm too high
And I'm scared of falling down
I've just been grasping for words
To make you want to stay
To make it worthwhile
I don't want spend the rest of my life
Just passing time
I don't want to spend the rest of my life here
Just passing time"

With lines crossing into a hand,
And a heart that would never bleed.
The twilight and the horse
Drawn on my arm
Standing for an addiction,
Pray we go unharmed.
Here is my love and anger
These are my gods, these are my scars.
Here is my love and anger
My arms are burning, but they're open wide
Some things, I hold too tightly,
Some things, I'll never I'll never touch.
I'm wearing down the stones
In the river
All my life, i've painted
With anger's brush
Here is my love and anger
These are my gods, these are my scars.
Here is my love and anger
My arms are burning, but they're open wide

Oh, you precious kid
I have a motion just for you.
A warrior, barefoot and dancing
With tears of pain and beauty
All of this is true for you

Here is my love and anger
These are my gods, these are my scars.
Here is my love and anger
My arms are burning, but they're open wide
Pointing out the graveyards
I will be the reaper
If you will be
The keeper of my heart"

What would you give for your

You had a hiding place.
Secret staircase, running low,
But they all know, now you're inside.

What would you give for your

Skipping stones, we know the price now,
Any sin will do.
How much further, if you can spin.
How much further, if you are smooth.

Are you on fire,

Replace the rent with the stars above.
Replace the need with love.

Replace the anger with the tide.
Replace the ones, the ones, the ones, that you love.

And when I burned away you wondered why
Well Ill tell you babe I could not bear to stall
I fell too fast I fell too far

But no matter what I do

I'm not your Land of Canaan, sweetheart,
Waiting for you under the sun.

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now.
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out.
I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight.

Well the meanings changed (for what it's worth),
It's just a senseless game.
I should think of love, but it's fear every time I hear
Your heartbeat strain.
It's not the fallen man,
It's not the call of time,
It's just the London skyline
Telling me you're not mine.

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now.
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out.
I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight.

My blood is running dry,
My skin is, my skin is growing thin
For every time you find yourself
You lose a little bit of me, from within.
It's just a raging cycle, why can't we
Bring it all to the end of the line.
From inside this existence, sweetheart,
Time is not on my side.

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now.
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out.
I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight.

Lately waking up I'm not sure where I've been
There was a table set for six and five were there
I stood outside and kept my eyes upon that empty chair
And there was steam on the windows from the kitchen
Laughter like a language I once spoke with ease
But I'm made mute by the virtue of decision
And I choose most of your life goes on without me
Oh the fear I've known
That I might reap the praise of strangers
And end up on my own
All I've sown was a song
But maybe I was wrong

I said to you the one gift which I'd adore
The package of the next 10 years unfolding
But you told me if I had my way I'd be bored
Right then I knew I loved you best born of your scolding
When we last talked we were lying on our backs
Looking at the sky through the ceiling
I used to lie like that alone out on the driveway
Trying to read the Greek upon the stars
The alphabet of feeling
Oh I knew back then
It was a calling that said if joy then pain
The sound of the voice these years later
Is still the same

I am alone in a hotel room tonight
I squeeze the sky out but there's not a star appears
Begin my studies with this paper and this pencil
And I'm working through the grammar of my fears
Oh mercy what I won't give
To have the things that mean the most
Not to mean the things I miss
Unforgiving the choice still is
The language or the kiss"

A single thing that we went through
But there are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you

And you could live your life without me if you had to
And you believe that in the end it all works out right
And I might if not for you
And if you ask one which one lives just alone for love
I do
There was a time when all signs pointed to the warm south
The planets all lined up and built a new house
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy
And when you looked at me they all came true
And if you asked which one wants to go the distance
I do
I'm gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think
I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong
I'm gonna play this song
Make some coffee black and strong
Give thanks for healing time
And finally make up my mind"

And everyones tied to their thing
To their past or their drink or the date that they bring
I just get tired all of sudden taking it in.

And I want to lay my head down on you

Because you're the only solid thing in this room

A room full of changes strangers illusion confusion,
I speak from my heart but I'm not really sure if it's true.
I wanna lay my head down on you.

Oh don't waste too much time planning
Or you'll get rug ripped out
And the only way you'll be satisfied
Is learning to live with out.
But some plan for the kingdom of heaven
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven
I don't know what to believe I just show up and breathe anymore.

And I wanna lay my head down on you
Because you're the only solid thing in this room

A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers
If I don't get out I'll do something I don't wanna do.

And I wanna lay my head down on you.

Was it so long ago
That we sat and talked in your car
Your things were all packed
And the place you were headed not really that far
Years later I think
That I would have been much more alive
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive

Well everything that's come before us leads us to where we are now
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling
That I'm lost somehow
I'm just a ghost looking in
Out of my own life just visiting
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep.

I wanna lay my head down on you
Because you're the only solid thing in this room
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view

And I wanna lay my head down on you."

Some long ago when we were taught
That for whatever kind of puzzle you got
You just stick the right formula in
A solution for every fool

I remember the time when I came so close to you
Sent me skipping my class and running from school
And I bought you that ring cause I never was cool
What makes me think I could start clean slated
The hardest to learn was the least complicated

So I just sit up in the house and resist
And not be seen until I cease to exist
A kind of conscientious objection
A kind of dodging the draft

The boy and girl are holding hands on the street
And I don't want to but I think you just wait
It's more than just eye to eye
Learn the things I could never apply

I remember the time when I came so close with you
I let everything go it seemed the only truth
And I bought you that ring, it seemed the thing to do

What makes me think I could start clean slated
The hardest to learn was the least complicated
So what makes me think I could start clean slated
The hardest to learn was the least complicated

I'm just a mirror of a mirror myself
All the things that I do
And the next time I fall I'm gonna have to recall
It's isn't love it's only something new

I sit two stories above the street
It's awful quiet here since love fell asleep
There's life down below me though
The kids are walking home from school

I'm remember the time when I came so close with you
Sent me skipping my class and running from school

The absent sound of another day as it recedes into the shadows until it's nothing
Fax papers slipped under the hotel room door like food for the prisoner or the prospect to the whore
Well fed and halfway drunk I ache myself for more until I'm shadows of myself until I'm nothing
Sixteen black churches burning on the TV all the way from Texas to Tennessee
A politician locks my eye and says to me there is no crisis here there's no conspiracy
I crave inertia every move made so I can stop
Whatever this madness is in me spinning like a top on a bed of anxiety
Over a deep dark drop down into nothingness into withoutyouness
Was it ever so evil creep like ivy, toe hold on the stronger half of nature's dichotomy
Beating back a path through nothing more than pure insistence
Until here becomes the distance
Hold my head love I'm sick tonight find the open hole and press your finger
There will all your might before the last ounce of my spirit bleeds
Onto the pristine sheets of the hotel bed in Leeds"

You remind me of Shalott
Only made of shadows
Even though you're not

I remember how I spent
All my energy and time
With affected conversation
Trying to pry inside your mind
You are as beautiful as truth
And as empty as a shell
And I came to you one night
And it made me feel like hell

Oh to reach through all your surface
Just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride
As I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart
And left me a fool
Left me a fool

Everybody loves a hero
An image to create
The antithesis of everything
Inside ourselves we hate
But you'd better close your eyes
When it's time for them to die
Because you'd hate to think the life
You'd built upon them was a lie

Oh to reach through all your surface
Just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride
As I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart
And left me a fool
Left me a fool

I resign myself to silence
I will never blow your cover
No one ever has to know
Who the hero took for lover
But it comes to mind as you blaze on
As brilliant as a star
How many you've left behind
How many casualties there are

Oh to reach through all your surface
Just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride

Never solve anything

Has no good idea
Of who the masses are
Well I'm one of them
And I'm among friends
We're trying to see beyond
The fences in our own backyards
I've seen the kingdoms blow
Like ashes in the winds of change
But the power of truth
Is the fuel for the flame
So the darker the ages get
There's a stronger beacon yet

[Chorus]

In the kind word you speak
In the turn of the cheek
When your vision stays clear
In the face of your fear
Then you see turning out a light switch
Is their only power
When we stand like spotlights
In a mighty tower
All for one and one for all
Then we sing the common call

I still have to tie my shoes
And get on with my day

And there are days I have to take the bus

Lifes so empty

Long distance from a phone booth
Like two players in a mystery straight out of our youth
Well Im finding that dramatics have lost their old appeal
I play the part of stoic lover but Im not sure how I feel

And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf

My father was a fisherman my mom a fishermans friend
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder
When I reached my prime
I left my home in the maritimes
And I, I headed down the turnpike
For new england
Sweet new england

Had holes in my confidence
And holes in the knees of my jeans
And I was left without a penny in my pocket
And ew-whee I was desitute as a girl could be
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it
Id surely hock it

I met a young girl in the parking lot
She was preaching to the crowd
By singing sacred songs and reading from the bible
Well I told her I was lost
And she told me all about the penticost
And I seen that girl as a road to my survival

Later on the very same night
She crept to my tent with a flashlight
And these long years of innocence ended
Took me to the woods
I said her comes something that feels so good
And just like a dog I was befriended
I was befriended

I said what a night
What a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was lying under the stars just playing my guitar
But I was thanking the lord for my fingers
For my fingers

I know I know I know I know
I know I know"

This thing they wont let us go

Gonna eat us from the inside out

I dont want you to feeling the fallout

Ah when the cancer finally took him
I was watching the trucks pull in
Me and your daddy we had a job
Under the ground mining uranium
Some things your daddy leaves you
Some things he dont
Some things are gonna be here anyhow
And some things just wont
One thing I want you to understand
Is you aint gotta be no mining man
I curse the day that I went down
And I pulled that shit out of the ground

Now we were living over in nevada
Thats where your people come from
Your grandma would take me and your daddy
On down to the gunnery range
We sit and watch the bombs blow
Until the sun goes down
All those colors running like the painted desert
And you get to see it now

Them government boys have something so damn secret
They had to hide it in the desert sand
Out there the skies so big
And there aint no mistaking it
Whose got the winning hand

Ah
Ah ah ah ah

I said Ive been all the way to alaska
To a town they call point of hope
Where they took some of what we got down here
Just to see how it would grow
I hear the lichen bought it
And now its running through the caribou
I said soon little darling
Youll get to feel it too
Get to feel it too
Oh I said soon little darling
Youll get to feel it to

Loyalties, I got em by the dozen.
We share a past, we share a blood relation
And that's as good as an invitation.

I'm in the North Carolina Mountains,
Just to the west of where I met my calling.
If you look south to the foothills of these mountains rising,
That's the place where it feels good falling.
That's the place that I know.

I look for words to fill the empty spaces,
All the life revealed in these back stages.
I reach for names like little puzzle pieces;
Oh perennial, come to me.

Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend

Loving the love I love

To love is just a word I've heard
When things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me
Can not stand the cold

And in between what might have been
And what has come to pass
Are misbegotten guests alas
And bits of broken glass

Where do your golden rainbows end

Why is the song I sing so sad

Well I could take it or leave it
You know thats what Ive said to myself
But then I start to tremble
And Im lost to a powerless cause

Im losing touch
Sometimes my memories
They just seem to fade fast away
Ive been losing too much
Losing the feel for the dreams I once thought I had
Sometimes I feel like theyre all circling around
They keep calling to me and I keep falling down
Id rather be alone and lonely lying on the ground
Than in those grips again

Theyre so cruel
Taught me to fly
Then they stole my sky
Taught me to love
Then they broke me down
Till there was nothing left but emptiness
And dont you ever feel like theyre all circling around
They keep calling to me and I keep falling down
Id rather be alone and lonely lying on that ground
Than in those grips again

Well I could take it I could leave it you know hah

You are my lifeline you make me happy
I said that, had to say it baby
Who on earth ever held me like you

Rusty components of an unmarked song
We've been staring down the brilliant dream, the sun burns our eyes
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

All around us things come apart, broken pieces and broken hearts
Fix me, oil me, match me with the next best thing
Person to person, nation to nation, heals the gate of communication
While it's time the time sneaks her weathering
We've been wanting to be held by binding ties
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

And when it breaks down I beg you don't go
I sickle your ship I'm ready to blow
I try to out think you with an army of words
I strategize; I am fighting for the love of my life
Iron, water, oxygen, scotch and soda or any combination starts the reaction
Is there no mastermind of modern day
Who can blueprint a plan to make love stay sturdy and weatherproof, ushering in a new revolution
At the drawing board the hopeful ones still try
How can we help it when we're fighting for the love of our lives"

Me myself with my face pressed
Up against love's glass
To see the shiny toy I've been hoping for
The one I never could afford
The wide world spins and spits turmoil
And the nations toil for peace
But the paws of fear upon your chest
Only love can soothe that beast
And my words are paper tigers
No match for the predators of pain inside her

I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through
Where there's now one there will be two

I was born under the sign of cancer
(Love will come to you)
Like brushing cloth I smooth the wrinkles for an answer
(Love will come)
I'm always closing my eyes and wishing I'm fine
(I close my eyes and wish you fine)
Even though I know I'm not this time
(Even though I know your not this time)

I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through
Where there's now one there will be two

Dodging your memories a field of knives
Always on the outside looking in on other's lives

I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through
(I have offered up to you)
Where there's now one there will be two

Strength from the milk of human kindness
A safe place for all the pieces that scattered
Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters"

To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of it's impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery.
There I am in younger days, star gazing,
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass, faith in love's perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery.
Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bent
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away, eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me
I'd still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift we could give
Tell all the friends who think they're so together
That these are ghosts and mirages, these thoughts of fairer weather
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery"

I want to slide into the black and wear the black mask, i might not get what i lack, but it doesn't hurt to ask if i want to sail, i need my life to be breezier i said, please, god, or someone, make it easier.

I went to sunday school every sunday swallowed the bait and i got the hook and when i needed something someday i would read the good book. tell me, what does it take to get ahead? sometimes i know i'd sell my soul when it looks like everybody else is flying, and i'm crawling in the hole, maybe if i open my own business, maybe if i buy the lottery ticket, someone tell me what is the secret to getting out of the thicket? give me more than just a sample, i need a whole lot of glory then my life become an example of the american success story.

Will you hide the dead mans ghost
Will he lie beneath the clay
Will his spirit float away

And every thought's a possibility
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen
Why do you spend this time with me
Maybe an equal mystery

So what is love then is it dictated or chosen
(Handed down and made by hand)
Does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years
Or is it just pop emotion
(Handed down and made by hand)
And if it ever was there and it left
Does it mean it was never true
And to exist it must elude
Is that why I think these things of you
I could go crazy on a night like tonight
When summer's beginning to give up her fight
And every thought's a possibility
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen
Why do you spend this time with me
May be an equal mystery

But you like the taste of danger
It shines like sugar on your lips
And you like to stand in the line of fire
Just to show you can shoot straight from you hip
There must be a 1000 things you would die for
I can hardly think of two
But not everything is better spoken aloud
Not when I'm talking to you

Oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight
Breaks a bottle to christen her
Basking in the exploits of her thief
She's a very good listener
Maybe that's all that we need
Is to meet in the middle of impossibility
We're standing at opposite poles
Equal partners in a mystery
(Handed down and made by hand)

We're standing at opposite poles
Equal partners in a mystery"

From your pearly gates
I realize that I just can't stay
All those mountains
They kept you locked inside
And hid the truth
From my slighted eyes

I came to you with a half-open heart
Dreams upon my back
Illusions of a brand new start
Nashville
Can't I carry the load
Is it my fault that
I can't reap what I sow
Nashville
Did you give me half a chance
With your southern style
And your hidden dance away
You dance away
And you dance away

All these voices
They whisper through my walls
They talk of falling fast
They say I'm losing it all
They say I'm running blind
To love of my own
But I'll be walking proud
I'm saving what I still own

I fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down
And I can't even see to stand
In nashville
You forgot the human race
You see with half a mind
What colors hide the face
Nashville
I'd like to know your fate
I'd like to stay a while
But I've seen your lowered states today
I've seen 'em today
Honey I swear I've seen 'em today

Now I'm leaving
I've got all these debts to pay
You know we all have our dues
I'll pay 'em some other place
Ah I never ask that you pay me back
We all arrive with more
I left with less than I had

Your town is made for people passing through
A last chance for a cause
I thought I knew
But nashville
You tell me what you are gonna do
With all your southern style
It'll never pull you through
Nashville
I can't place no blame
But if you forget my face
I'll never call your name again
No never again
No never again

I fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down
And I can't even see to stand
In nashville
You forgot the human race
You see with half a mind
What colors hide the face
Nashville
I'd like to know your fate
I'd like to stay a while

My prides in my pocket but I can be reasonable
Still all in all I forsee my own fall
But I've climbed too far to drop
So stop

I know it's your ego keeps the smile on your face
Because you know you got your options open
Shes a beguiling snake and shell keep what she takes
But when she leaves you I'll be the one coping
Honey don't make yourself so available
My prides in my pocket but I can be reasonable
Still through and through I can see clean through you
I know you like to be the one on top
But stop

You will miss my conversation
When you're talking to yourself
Youll be thumbing for advice
Through the pages of the novels on your shelf
Honey don't you see our love togethers the very best bet
Put your focus on me and I'll forgive and forget
Throw away your hidden ace you clever man
And take my hand

You neednt play the part of your image
This is not a one act play were living
And as long as I'm here the situation is clear
Itll be 50/50 take and giving

Take off your costume and remove your mask
If yes is what you will say were gonna start from today
Were gonna take it to the very top
And never stop"

Theres no way out and you know
Theres no way in
Were on either side
Scared to say were friends

Now I found jesus and you found yourself
Sometimes I still feel like I'm losing out
But we both found that its just too hard to know for sure
Just what we can lean on when were falling down

You always did see
The other side of things and sometimes
I'm bound to wonder
Do you see through me

With all the voids I tried to fill
And all the emptiness I tried to tell you about
There was never time enough
There are never words enough
And Ill never have the guts enough
But Ill tell you I've been needing you so bad

Theres no way out and you know
Theres no way in for me now
And were on either side
And were crying for a friend

And were scared to say were friends"

I was thinking hey I've got love to ease my mind
Then I got to the car and I was staring at your scars
Thinking hey, this aint no way to spend my time

Now I want a true love affair
Not this touch-and-go in the air
You know I don't know if I'm coming or I'm down
I don't want a love touch and go
I want a feeling I only know
Or else you can get me out of this town

When I saw you smile I knew one look into your eyes
And I was thinking hey, are you in love again
Then I heard you laugh honey you were laughing at the past
I was thinking this aint no way to treat a friend

You were laughing at the past
Honey you were smiling through your glass
Watching cars drive away in your mind
You were hoping I would leave
Honey I was dreaming I could stay
And this aint no way to spend my time
This aint no way to treat a friend
This aint no way to see me
I'm looking for the end
This aint no way to treat a friend

Now I want words I want touch
Maybe that's a bit too much
For one so far removed
From what you used to claim
Well if you be cruel, Ill still be kind
You know I've got it in my mind
I'm in love with you
I aint gonna play your games
If you want my advice
don't say its wrong if it feels right
don't push me down just to see me crawl
Ill be crawling on the floor
Then Ill be reaching for the door
Ill be crawling right out of your eyes
Honey Ill be walking right out of your eyes
Honey Ill be walking right out of your eyes"

As we drove from the Lacandon into Comitan.

Gloria was singing and Cecilia closed her eyes,
And I saw them drifting out over the night sky.

Nuevas Senoritas,
Are you gone to brighter days?
Have you found your greener valleys
And the place where your heart lays?

I'm heading back to the flatlands and you're heading up to the hills.
The rain brings you home in the middle of July.

I guess I just got lonesome when I think about how you feel,
With six months gone and no one to dry your eyes.

And the place where your heart lays."

Where now it's melting, the solid frost was once a veil on greener landscapes we would see
Beneath my surface the water's heating
And steam comes up and out the tears you see me shine
For every strange and bitter moment there was never a better time
For every pleasure exacts it's pain
How you hurt me how you were good to me
Beneath my window a mournful train that makes me smile at my bad poetry
Beneath my surface a song is rising
It may be simple while it hides it's true intent
We may be looking for our deliverance but it has already been sent
It's in the night fall when the light falls
And what you've seen isn't there anymore
It's in our blind trust that love will find us
Just like it has before
They're sending soldiers to distant places
X's and O's on someone's drawing board
Like green and plastic but with human faces
And they want to tell you it's a merciful sword
But with all the blood newly dried in the desert
Can we not fertilize the land with something else
There is no nation by god exempted
Lay down your weapons and love your neighbor as yourself
In the night fall when the light falls
And what you've seen isn't there anymore
It's through our blind trust that love will find us
Just like it has before"

That's always on your mind.

Oh Ozilline, I feel for you.

As soon as the corn's in,
The deer will come to feed.
When the berry ripens,
The bird will come to eat.
Build by the river,
Its pretty but you'll pay,
'Cause the springtime brings the flood plain
Or your cutbank washes away.

Oh Ozilline, I feel for you.

I had to put the dog down,
Before I hit the road,
I watched that sweet old life
Become a bag of bones.

When your body's broken
And your heart wants to give in,
And you hear that hoot owl callin'
Just like she was a friend.

Were a generation running out of time
There's a bomb, there's a man
There's a gun in his hand yeah
Nobody smiles at strangers were scared from birth
Afraid the mans gonna take us for all that were worth
Strip us of our pride
Make a strike from inside
Come on and tell me
How long will we be victims of fear
With a man and a gun and the day after fear
Jesus smile down upon your children
Smile down upon your family

Even lovers have trouble at hand
What's your preference where do you stand
You get all uptight about it
Wanna fight about it
Wanna fight about love
No no no
Wanting independence separate but equal
A lover here another there
One more for the sequel to the heartache
How much more can we take
Wont you tell me
How long will we be victims of fear
With a man and a gun and the day after fear
Jesus smile down upon your children
Smile down upon your family

Now Im talking about
Altruism and unification
We forgotten what that means
Cynicism in this mighty nation
And hatred is spitting us right at the seams

Oh but I still believe that good will prevail
And if we don't ever try
Its damn sure that well fail
Lose another day
The american way
So come all believers
Come all races
Start looking at the souls
Not at the faces
And were there
And were learning to care
I want to know baby
How long will we be victims of fear
With a man and a gun and the day after fear
Jesus smile down upon your children
Smile down upon your family
Jesus smile down upon your children
Smile down upon your family"

On a no news is good news middle of mid-year day
I feel no I'll with time to kill I wanna play

Let's make peace tonight
The moon is bare and shining bright
Let's make peace tonight in a good time

Callin' on my good friends today
You know the drive's about an hour away
We'll be pitching up a tent by the trees
We'll be wading in the river to our knees
Oh now love's been planted & we're checking out the yield
Two black dogs and a white one running in the field

Let's make peace tonight
The moon is bare and shining bright
Let's make peace tonight in a good time

We used to have some money but we spent it
So when we want to have it then we rent it
But we're cuttin' up the rug and I know you love me love me
And the best of everything here is free
Oh when things get messy then we tidy up the room
We'll be no stranger to the dustpan and the broom

We get together periodically
I got a bad case I can't shake off of me
The fevered walking round wondering how it ought to be
You work in the system
You see possibilities and your glistening
Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em
When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman

I dream like a mad one
Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can
I'm a psychic and a laywoman
I see love and I like to make it happen
What we get from your war walk
Ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock
I want the pendulum to swing again
So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind

It doesn't come by the bullwhip
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips
Not the company of gunslingers
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger
She is she is she is

It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit
Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate
Too hard just to go by a blind faith
But they left out the sisters
Praying to a father god so long I really missed her
The goddess of benevolence
You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left

Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress
Relegated by the Vatican
But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again

If we're a drop in the bucket
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it
Until the last drop of sun burns it's sweet light
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right"

I see the water lapping on the shoreline
Buried forest of a man made lake
Cemeteries are laying underneath it
Your heart like a damn embrace

We're floating we're swimming
And at this moment we are forgetting
What we caused what it takes
The one perfect world when we look the other way

I'm okay if I don't look a little closer
I'm okay I if don't see beyond the shore
I'm okay I don't have to do the killing or
Know what the killing is for

We're talking we're driving
And in this moment we are denying
What we caused what it takes
The one perfect world when we look the other way

One perfect world... When we look the other way

You can see beyond the middle isolation
And the miracle of daybreak doesn't move you anymore
Connect the points and then see the constellations
As the night comes down on the reservoir

We're swimming we're floating
And in this moment we are beholden
To what we've caused to what it takes
The one perfect world
Can we learn to live another way

Perfect world... Can we learn to live another way

One... Perfect world
Get to be a ripple in the water"
Indigo Girls,Philosophy Of Loss,/i/indigo+girls/philosophy+of+loss_20067444.html,"Welcome to why the church has died
In the heart of the exiled in the kingdom of hate
Who owns the land & keeps the commands
And marries itself to the state
Modern scribes write in Jesus Christ

Everyone is free

And the doors open wide to all straight men & women
But they are not open to me
And who is teaching kids to be soldiers
To be marked by a plain white cross
And we kill just a little to save a lot more

The philosophy of loss
There are a few who would be true out of love
And love is hard

And don't think that our hands haven't shoveled the dirt
Over their central American graveyards
Doctors & witch hunters stripped you bare
Left you nothing for your earthly sins
Yeah but who made this noise just a bunch of boys
And the one with the most toys wins
Who is teaching kids to be gamblers
Life is a coin toss
And of course what you give up is what you gain

The philosophy of loss

Whatever has happened to anyone else
Could happen to you & to me
And the end of my youth was the possible truth
That it all happens randomly
Who is teaching kids to be leaders
And the way that it is meant to be
The philosophy of loss"

And conform with the stream
Were born and bred believers
In the american dream

And we drink our whiskey straight
Though we do not like the taste
And we dress in obligations
With a top hat show of haste
And we hinder our reactions
As we measure what we say
Until someone starts to cry
And the faces turn away again

Take it slow and easy
Sing about the land of the brave
And the home of the free
And theres a man who will tip you
Better than youve gotten yet
If you play us a happy song
And help us forget

Well we donate to our charities
To deduct our future taxes
And we flock to bars for drinking
Though one never quite relaxes
And we compromise our standards
If it means well get attention
And the things we need the most to say
Are the things we never mention

Take it slow and easy
Sing about the land of the brave
And the home of the free

Its hard to keep in mind
Sometimes when youre searching for relief
And hell is all you find
And I know that I'm a romantic
I might seem a fool to say
I'm know I'm going to see a few hands joined
Before my dying day

Sing about the land of the brave
And the home of the free

And your hands upon my knee

So were okay

Chase all the ghosts from your head
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
Well look at them together then well take them apart
Adding up the total of a love that's true
Multiply life by the power of two

You know the things that I am afraid of
I'm not afraid to tell
And if we ever leave a legacy
It's that we loved each other well
Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people
Trying on the treasures of youth
But a road that fancy and fast
Ends in a fatal crash
And I'm glad we got off
To tell you the truth

And your eyes are getting wet
I took us for better and I took us for worse

Suddenly bend with ease
The closer I'm bound in love to you
The closer I am to free

The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
When I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days
And now someone's on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom

My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark

Be a pawn for the Prince of Darkness any longer)
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from it's cage and it bled upon my sleeve
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing

The world on it's knees and a band on the run

I think I know what's wrong
Pushing the needle too far."

Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
Wont you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them are gonna stop the time
How long must they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
Weve got to fulfill the book

These songs of freedom

Negligent vendors
Aren't you precious inside
I have no need for anger
With intimate strangers
And I got nothing to hide
Yeah

I laughed as I said it
This is my situation
It's not pictures or privilege
It's just self preservation

Any obligation
It feels so funny to be free

Negligent vendors
Aren't you precious inside
I have no need for anger
With intimate strangers
And I got nothing to hide

We act empty and innocent
But we are fueled by distortions
(I remember you)
Of lives led in discontent
(When we were shiny and new)
Trading misfortunes
(Now you guard your faith)
'Cause faith is one thing
That is hard to deliver
(Temper your speed)
It feels so funny to be free

Negligent vendors
Aren't you precious inside

I have seen a look like that you licked your chops from where you sat
Make your kill for a thrill and you don't mind waiting
Rise up your dead, there's life in the old girl yet
Rise up your dead
When it bums you out, all the hunters sprung to pounce
And at best it's a mess like a nest infested
You remember there's more than this
There always was and always is
Tend the artist in your charges, you are full invested
And if you need to, read your mindless mag
Call me up for tickets, we'll go see sugarland
And it gets better even when it's been a drag
Just move to the music, move your body to the band and
Rise up"

Indigo Girls,Romeo And Juliet,/i/indigo+girls/romeo+juliet_20067329.html,"Romeo and Juliet"" was written by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, and
appears on that band's 1980 album, ""Making Movies.""  Amy Ray has
performed it fairly regularly since at least 1987.  It's always been
one of my favorite DS songs, and I was pretty floored when I first
heard Amy do it, so I once asked her about it.  She claimed that she
was inspired to cover it after she saw Dire Straits on their
""Brothers in Arms"" tour.  She felt that the arrangement that they
were using for the tour really lacked the edge of the ""Making Movies""
version, and she wanted to try to bring back that edge.  Which she
does, because her stripped-down version is PURE edge.  (Personally,
though, I LOVED the DS arrangement from the ""Brothers in Arms"" tour -
I like it better than the original, in fact.)  Anyway...  Amy tends
to improvise with this one a bit, so I just transcribed the lyrics
off of ""Making Movies.""
Romeo and Juliet.
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like ""You and me, babe, how about it?""
Juliet says ""Hey, it's Romeo! You nearly give me a heart attack!""
He's underneath the window,
She's singing ""Hey-la, my boyfriend's back -
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that!
Anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?""
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
We come up on different streets
They both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean
Yes, and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
When you can fall for chains of silver
You can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything - You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say ""Oh, Romeo, yeah,
You know I used to have a scene with him.""

Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die""
There's a place for us
You know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way its meant to be
I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat to Bad Company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said ""I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die""
There's a place for us
You know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
And a lovestruck Romeo, he sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
And says something like ""You and me, babe, how 'bout it?
You and me, babe, how 'bout it"

And you're off in perfect fashion

And you'll flee cause you're born to be free
And if you go I'll understand

Flirting with madness a loaded gun

Up deep burn all you leave behind you
You are the surface of my sun

I measure to what degree
I can shape up what's been forged in me
The cooper penny hissing in the pool
So much for wishes so much for cooling
Down this fire impossible desire
The further you get the more I'm drawn

To make connections with the eyes that left me blind
Left my love for the strength of that white, white line
I left one more time I could have heard I love you
One more time I could have heard I care
One more time when I needed that emotion
One more time I wasnt even there

Through the darkness and the distance
Lie champagne and smoky smiles
Bounded by the sorrow having lost love to the miles
I feel you
Youre not a stranger to this white, white line
I watched your eyes chose words so slowly
Illusions to my view
But I laugh and say its highway 75 that draws me here
Its not me and its not you
There was one more time when I should have said I love you
One more time when I should have told you I care
When we sit here in silence
And we miss the ones we love that cant be here
Its the love we leave behind

I tried to lose this restless spirit in a mission of regrets
But I cant survive without this war
And your eyes reflect the visions that I cant forget
I find balance on a darkened highway
I find truth by the side of the road
And someone elses tune to lift me high above the line
That leaves me running from the cold
Running from the cold
Running from the cold"

Hurts inside, cause either way you're screwed, eventually
You'll find you may as well feel good; you may as well have
Some pride.

Her thing, pack it into the Indian Casin and make the
Hillbilly scene, kick up our heels and join in.

Falling softly as the rain;
No footsteps ringing in your ears.
Ragged down worn to the skin,
Warrior raging, have no fear.

Secure yourself to heaven.
Hold on tight, the night has come.
Fasten up your earthly burdens,
You have just begun.

Kneeling down with broken prayers,
Hearts and bones from days of youth.
Restless with an angel's wing,
I dig a grave to bury you.
No feet to fall,
You need no ground.
Allowed to glide right through the sun,
Released from circles guarded tight,
Now we all are chosen ones.

Secure yourself to heaven.
Hold on tight, the night has come.
Fasten up your earthly burdens,
You have just begun."

It's a strange way to show it as distant as last night's dream unravels
She's saving me I'm a very lost soul I was born with a hole in my heart
The size of my land locked travels
I try to put it aside but it's too much bigger than me there's a big brown hawk in the tree
Lighting and leaving
There's tea leaves tossing, heads up pennies in my pocket, dead star like a rocket, the arc of my grieving

Then days so still the beauty gives you pain
The heatwave kills the green and she remains unseen
But colors up my dream with all things blooming
This is not all there is it's not a kingdom it's not an angry god
It feels like her
It feels like no fear, it feels like no doubt, it feels like inside out
The ashes stir

Stealing from the candy store
I think I've taken to your smile

And I hunger for your laugh
Do the craziest things like look around
When I know youre nowhere near me
Break my back on a song
Though I know youre not there to hear

Unanswered questions lying on the coffee table
From a song I haven't finished since last summer
Cause I never could decide how much was gin
How much the sea
Or other incidentals clouding what was really me

Everything I am is bare feet and burning sand
Waiting for the calm cool hand of the sea

A madman of emotions waiting for the drug effect
Of the reason and the intellect to comfort me

Half the time I love you like you love the falls first breeze
Then you seem as distant as the skeletons of trees
Far away outside my window
Where inside I think of you
As if I thought hard enough Id know which way to turn
And what to do

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I'm quite sure Ill be alright
We all live with some distraction
Its just too bad
Mine will hang around all day and night
Like an uninvited guest
You can't turn away try hard as you might
Lord knows I've tried

I might let it go and take a long long run
Quit my job and join the coastline baking in the sun
Then again I might just make big plans
And leave them on the table
Like the song I left unfinished
And the words I am unable
I will always be unable to express

Youll be the one I'll turn to now
There's gonna be some hard times coming down

Without you the world would be so crowded
Without you the moon would be so clouded
Without you I can be anyone
Anyone at all but myself

If ever your candle wont blow out
Or your sorrow seems so interrupted
Well I'll be the first to bring the darkness down
Ill be the silence at your side

Without you the music couldn't move me
The words would ring true
But the tune would feel so empty
Without you I can be anyone
Anyone at all but myself
But myself

Wish I was a slow moving sea
Moving away from the land so cautiously
Id find me an island to surround
Just like you did as I was feeling down
As I was feeling down

Without you the world would be so crowded
Without you the moon would be so clouded
Without you I can be anyone
Anyone at all but myself
Oh but myself

Wish I was a slow moving sea
Wish I was a slow moving sea
Love is like a slow moving sea
Keeping in touch with eternity
Wish I was a slow, slow, slow, slow moving sea
Love is like a slow moving sea"

Tactician politician hold his head and wonder why
I'm always struck that much harder by the power of suggestion
By now I know the answer's always in the question

Now that we're done with that why don't you warm the car
All of the fields are filled with fresh boys playing football
More than the weather chills, the bands practicing their drills
I've got to get back to something real with you

I had to call your parents to get your number again
I was either gonna be the prodigal or the banished friend
We were standing against an outside wall, I was afraid of what you'd say
It took me ten years to call you back but here we are today

Now that we're done with that why don't you warm the car
All of the fields are filled with fresh boys playing football
More than the weather chills, the bands practicing their drills
I've got to get back to something real with you

So life has brought you this: two marriages and three kids
And me life as slick as ice that finally hit the skids
You're as sweet as you ever were
A slight sickness of regret washes over me
And in the end that's all I get

Now that we're done with that why don't you warm the car
All of the fields are filled with fresh boys playing football
More than the weather chills, the bands practicing their drills
I've got to get back to something real
I've got to get back to something real
I've got to get back to something real with you"

With a sagging heart and a break apart
Voices in me stood as thick as thieves
With no sympathy for the beggars art
I have passed these pines 'bout a million times effortlessly
Now I grip the wheel fear is what I feel
At the slow unraveling of me

You tell me it's temporary it's a matter of time
By God don't you think I know it's in my mind
It's right over left and healing the then
I'll soon be to nothing but I don't know when

Well the way I flee on my crooked feet
Barn happy horse on a one-track course
Then I self despise cryin' out my eyes
'Cause the happy trail led me to remorse
But the road is long and the song is gone
I blow empty in my cicada shell
If I saw my choice I might find my voice
But I don't know when and I just can't tell

You tell me it's temporary just a matter of time
By God don't you think I know it's in my mind
It's right over left and healing the then
I'll soon be to nothing but I don't know when

Deep behind my face is a safer place
But old gears are hitched tight to the gate
It's a daily grind waiting to unwind
Till I hear that click that unlocks my fate

So tell me it's temporary it's a matter of time
By God don't you think I know it's in my mind

Light the bayou with our tail lights in the night
800 miles to el paso from the state line
And we never have the money for the flight
I'm in the back seat sleepy from the travel
Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans
I'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black
When the first breath of Texas comes in clean
And there's something 'bout the Southland in the springtime
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason
Though I miss her when I'm gone it won't ever be too long
Till I'm home again to spend my favorite season
When God made me born a yankee he was teasin'
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'
Than the Southland in the springtime
In Georgia nights are softer than a whisper
Beneath a quilt somebody's mother made by hand
With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations
And the peach trees stitched across the land
There'll be cider up near Helen off the roadside
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers
And the smoke from the chimneys meets it's maker in the sky
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers"

you're either sinking or thinking
the dark's your romance
or a special one's shining a light on a chance
that it's all very worthy to ache
in the middle of the night

Sometimes I can't sleep
I can't keep all these feelings at bay
I am rage, I am sorrow and grief
all alone in my way
I know humor and heartbreak
and people are life
if I keep my eyes closed
i'll be open to strife
because the powers that be send their love
in the middle of the night

I'm gonna stand up
and let myself be counted for
stand up now
I've got my one life
and what's it to amount to
if I don't learn how
to love you and love myself beside you
mix the gentle and proud
I want to love life.
The vision in the window told me --
stand up.

To my mother my father
my witnesses live in my jagged heart
that for years has been running like fire
as though that was its part
from lover to cover and ocean to sky
from desert to mountain and promise to lie
I can say that I've prayed to forgiveness
in the middle of the night

I'm gonna stand up
and let myself be counted for
stand up now
I've got my one life
and what's it to amount to
if I don't learn how
to love you and love myself beside you

The vision in the window told me --
stand up.

Now I can see love in the woman
And love in the man in myself
I see how most people just ache to be good
at expressing themselves
and I wish I could tell you just right what I mean
about the light shining down, if I'd only come clean
but for now I live with myself
in the middle of the night.

I'm gonna stand up
and let myself be counted for

Man, let me tell you somethin
Check this out (What up?)
It might sound shady
But I fuck a rich hoe named Grady.
They call her that cause her hair is blue,
She's one of them rebellious rock chicks too.
Anyway she has a big hoop in her neden,
Rings, chains, needles, pins, and things
Tatoos, it might sound fierce,
But I swear to God the bitch gots her butthole pierced.
She told me she liked it rough, I'm like straight,
First thing she did was punch me in the face,
I'm about to plant one to her jaw,
Before I could she was tounging my balls,
Oooooh whadablah, I dropped my weapon,
Looked down and my nuts was kicksteppin,
We was butt naked all over the floor
It felt weird though cause we was at the Faygo store.

Nuthin like Gretta the millionaire's daughter,
Something like 950-sumthin pounds,
5'8"" tall and she looove clowns.
Bitch had titties like water balloons,
My boys used to swing off 'em like baboons,
She'd buy us chocolates, swiss cheese pie,
And take it, and bake it... Completely naked,
An ocean of loopness it ain't like nuthin,
Just jump anywhere in the mess and start humpin,
Don't really matter where I stick my dick,
I just reach (yeah), and grab (yeah), and stab (yeah), and jab (yeah),
But that ain't the reason that I love this hoe,
She used to do a funny little trick with my dick hole:
She'd blow into it and make a wish,
And my nuts would expand like puffer fish.

I'm dead and lifeless
The casket maker
Soul taker, your life is
Priceless
Especially on the black market
If you're alive and breathing
Then you're a moving target
Which means you can be hit
And the quickest lickity split
Lay down in the ground
Surrounded by a casket
That I built
Out of warped woods and drift wood
Rusted railroad spikes
Collected from the neighborhood
Skilled in the family trade
I'm center stage
In the most horrific side of me
You'll ever see is like an instinct
Some sort of nervous twitch
I'll stack the bodies 10 high
And bungee cord them to the trailer hitch
Pulling dead weight
Just made it over the border
And out of state
No time to debate
Time is short and the day is only so long
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn

10 bodies put in the ground before dawn
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn

Blaze Your Dead Homie
The unliving I'm dead and lifeless
The clock bearer
So terror the time is
Precise when your body is separating from soul
That's where I take your life
And transform you to a ghost
And you're powerless
Body limp, like dead fish
Only choose 10, never more
Less cause that be selfish
No headstones
Just 10 open holes in grounds
And dead bodies surround me
You're face down
No garbage bags
Not saying they trash
I'm just saying it preserves the body
And makes it last
For the future
And the time the to come ahead
Take it from the dead man
Things are easy when you're dead
I'll be back for you
I left the shovel right beside you
I hid you pretty good
I don't think no one's gonna find you
Time is short and the sun's coming along
I left the burial site before dawn
[Chorus: X2]
I left the burial site before dawn
I left the burial site before dawn

Am I the sand man?
The one that freed you or your ghost
Or the mad man?
The one that slitining your throat
Tonight's the night
10 more coming to join you
I'll make it interesting
I would never disappoint you
There's 30 of ya'll all
Together and collected
And this here, chunk of the Earth
That we've infected
And now you're expecting them to grow
Into the millions
Unless they find a way to capture, apprehend
And kill me

Guilty guilty guilty

Now I've woken, been reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple, push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the Mrs. leave the room
Lest she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirmy, filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next to work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalpel and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aid
Operate, then strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another, then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
'Nother wicked life to grab
Screaming that he thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The steering wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station fourty four
It's the wicked clown show
Watch me juggle, watch me dance
In 3D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wander endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still you see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all of y'all

Sunny days, I hit up the beach with cleats on
I stomp bitches in their ass, trying to tan in their thongs
All day, see me fucking hookers at truck stops
And then I kill them, 'cause that's where my buck stops

And burnt holes in his face with a magnifying glass

And murder people telling stories where the campfire's at

Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, now how ya gonna act?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ri-ii-ii-ing

[Chorus (2x)]
Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Ring two, how do you do?
I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch, who?
You don't try to front ho
Try to play me out just cause I'm running with the sideshow
Or maybe it's the leg growing out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
I'm popping in like a pound of lead
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head
Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits
Cuz when I was two my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone
So don't be stickin your finger in my face stank
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the...

[Chorus (2x)]

""I certainly hope your enjoy yourselves
Here at our three ring exhibit
But to be honest I really don't see
What's so fucking funny about it
These fucking people are real! ""

[Violent J]
Ring three, the icp
Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me
That's how you get fucked up
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink from the bird
Have Snake woman kick my love to the curb
She busted into my tent, now I'm fucked
Had the fat bearded lady in the buck, uh
Fuck that, bitch, suck that
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac
Just two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Call me Don Knots cuz I'm getting on it every week, uh
So come see the carnival and threw me your change, bitch
I chill with the three rings

[Chorus(2x)]

""Well, that's it
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you had a good time
You fucking heartless bastards
You saw what you wanted
So grab your fucking kids
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours
And get the fuck out of our circus tent
You cold-hearted sons of bitches
You think they look fucked up
Just wait till I kick your
Fucking lips in a couple times
You'll be sittin up here like a bitch
And we'll laughing at your folded ass
They'll call you lumpy
After I done put knots
All over your fuckin forehead
Yeah, hey, hey little boy, come here
How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot
You fucking little bitch
Come here, I'll shove that
Fucking corn dog up your ass
Get the fuck out of here
Show's fucking over
Get the fuck out of here
You fucking heartless bastards"

Insane Clown Posse,Angels Falling,/i/insane+clown+posse/angels+falling_10144859.html,"I climbed up the tree in the back and got on my roofto with my 22,
It's hot with little pops,
Started bustin off shots aimin all at the sky,
I emptied out my gun bustin all at the sky.

Then I went and stole a bow and arrow from my dad
To the arrows I tied gasoline soaked rags,
Climbed up with the zippo, Lit em all of into the sky,
A trail of black smoke leading into the sky.

I bought some chinese stars from the kung fu surplus,
They had em under the glass, I made the purchase,
Climbed up and I whizzed em off in the sky,
Even stood up on the chimney, whizzed em off in the sky

Then I found a double barrel with shells at Wal-Mart
I threw it next to the faygo in my shopping cart
I got home, climbed up, blew it into the sky
3: 20 in the mornin bustin off at the sky

I got a blowgun too, a real one at that,
I dip the tips in poison, Lay up on my back

And now they piercing through the air straight up into the sky,
Its like the only thing you hear is "" phew"" into the sky

I bought a harpoon off the internet and went up
And tried to shoot it, but the fuckin Rip off, it got stuck.

I said fuck it, and I threw the spear up into the sky,
As fuckin hard as I could, threw it into sky.

I sprayin mace up there
I throw m-80s up there,
I'm shooting everything I got,

I sit and wait in my chair
Because I hate the sky above whether moon or sun
Whether rain or snow, since the pain has begun
I'm tryna aim for the heavens up into the sky
Tell me why the love of my life had to die
Hows she gonna leave mea and not even say bye
I know that shes an angel and theyre lettin her fly
Every plan I thought we made together was a lie
She chould of hung on, ill bet she didn't even try
She left me dry, and that no one can deny
And whn sh falls from the sky
I'm asking her why

Angels
Are falling
Angels
Are falling
Falling angels...
Come crashing down
To the floor
Wont stop
Till I get the one that
I'm lookin for..."

I mean you got carried away in the moment
I could fogive you.....i could do that
I could do anything if I wanted

I could buy you a lexus truck
With a white leather interior (I could)
I could kill off some bears and dogs and shit
Just to make you a fur coat
I could love you and treat you with class
And have babies fallin all out your ass
But thinkin about that
I feel I'd rather kill you
Cuz I got you in my car
You aint goin no were bitch, your dead

Id rather cut that neck in half
Id rather choke out that bitch ass
Id rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie (2x)

I could take all the face paint off
And get a real job workin for your dad
I would rather take a 10 pound axe
And stick it in your daddys forehead
I could let you move into my house
You fuck the neighbor everytime I go out
And whipe his nut on my pillow
But I think I'd rather kill you
Cuz we parked here all alone
On this here dark alleyway, hey

Id rather cut that neck in half
Id rather choke out that bitch ass
Id rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie (2x)

Im the one that killed your precious cat
And stuffed em in your fuckin mailbox
If I only hadnt cut off my hair,
Id choke you with all my dred locks
When I scream at the moon every night
You shoulda known somethin just aint right
Cuz Im gonna slap you
And then Im going to kill you
Cuz the moon told me to
And it's watching us right now

Id rather cut that neck in half
Id rather choke out that bitch ass
Id rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homie (2x)

I could go back to school instead
And try to get my diploma
Id much rather bang your head on the wall
Until you fall into a coma
Cuz I can't get you outta my head
Id cut my head off but then I would be dead
And I aint the only motha fucka that's diein
So lets just die together

Poored out the holey water bless the dead is what I said
And heard the demons screamin as his body bled
Now Im drunk on the freeway just the other day
I saw a fine hitch hiker and I wanted to play
Pulled up to the curb so I can offer a ride
She said thanx I said no thang and she got inside
Im peepin as Im creepin Im packin an erection
Im stairin with my dick Im like look which direction
Made it to her ave, she got out and said see ya
Hey babe why don't ya chill and kill this 2 liter
Went into my trailer, I filled up the glass
Before she took a sip I had my dick in her ass
I banged it and banged it the shit was obserd
Like she was sporty spice and I was some fuckin nerd
Then she rolled over and gave me a kiss
She said when am I gettin paid? what bitch?
First I tried to choke her she went for the door
She said welcome to the disease there's no cure for
Bitch I love you but now you gotta die
I chased her through the door but she slammed it in my eye
She passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Billy pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Still about 30, I went for the hatchet
And screamed at the moon like a sick psychopatchic
Chopin and chopin they said j what tha fuck?
On the news they found her head stuffed up her butt, what?

Mad at the rydas cause we all rich and shit 
Think about what you used to have 
And what you don't have now 
Trying to hate on me with a glass dick in your mouth 
Used to represent in Cleveland black trucks with the bumps 
Drive through the car wash now see you work and wash my shit punk 
You had all the bitches, paper, no trouble 
Now your ass is up in the air gettin banged out for pebbles 
I don't give a fuck it's like a horse with a broken leg 
An old crusty ass broken down piece of shit 
What's next? 
Next time I see ya 
I pull out my heater 
And meltin your brain with hot lead you muthafucka 
I can't take it no more 
I gave it everything I had 
Back on the bottom and everything is lookin bad 
Face mad cause I'm hungry and I'm broke as fuck 
I see your man on the corner and you know he's stuck 
He out of luck in the wrong place at the wrong time 
I give a fuck if he blind 
All his money mine 
On the dime I whip the gat out 
Handles slippery cause I'm sweaty 
He tried to move so I'ma pull this lead out 
Check his pockets loose change and a note

Returning back to the hood servin fools like a paper route 
Scrounging up whatever loot they got to buy a key 
But if ranchers grew weed like record sales and popularity 
Back to the corner slangin loose and clumps 
Gotta live ghetto fabulous with rims and bumps 
Gotta have the fuckin heater cause my hands are stingin 
Coming back in 2's and 3's tryin to peel your cap 
Cause occasionally you serve a lemon head delight

Welcome to the Dark Carnival super show, you're our specialy invited guests and I'll tell you what fo'
Cause you're the evilest pedophiles, rapists, and abusers
All together we've got
Fifty-thousand of you losers
You're all about to witness an incredible sight
Nobody's ever lived to tell about it
And don't think you might
It's about to rain flames, 
Frames, and brains
To be blown into peices is the reason you came
Racist bigots, wife beaters, judges, and cowards
All crowded together expecting a show and some dollars
But instead the shit you're gunna see
You'll fear it in Hell
It a constant explosion, see and feel it you shall

In the deserts of Nevada
Where nothin else matta, 
It's the perfect place for you and your intestines to splatta
And while Bang! Pow! Boom! steady stomps you all out
You're in the hole for the nuclear fall out 
With the snakes and fakes creapy sneaks
Hooks and crooks and horney freaks
Shaddy ladies evil ernies richy richs and charlie cheaps
Bang! Pow! Boom! they say the show is the bomb
I heard it's strait up explosive, some even call it napalm
Nobody battles back, this ain't no kinda war
It's a one way execution, blow you strait to hell through the floor
What the fuck you think you here for? sound the alarm
Ladies and gentleman eat shit and die, let's bring I'm out

The air is thick with sick demented brains and thoughts, 
But here they are all together, every one of them caught
This is a celibration, in fact the carnival's cheering
It's not too often Bang! Pow! Boom! makes an aperence
And the winds in the sky will carry away all the ash
But for now let us enjoy, the big bang blast!

At a party before rollin a splif
In behind the glass I see crackheads all night
But tonight the moon is red and shit aint feelin so right
My first sight was a basehead tryna break into my car
In plain view too I ran out with a crowbar
Hammered it across his cranium he fell over dead
But not blood only dust
He's a fuckin basehead
Here come another one
Jumpin out of a tree
But I aint even have to move he missed by like 20 feet
He slammed down on the pavement
I quickly started kickin
Beat him with the crowbar
Until he finally stopped twitchin
Looked behind me seen another zombie in the register
I'm used to shooin 'em off from beggin from the customers
But now I gotta reach up under the seat and grab the hand axe
Whipped it from there and stuck it into his back

The attack of the baseheads
They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
The attack of the baseheads
Every city every town
They always on the hunt for something never to be found
The attack of the baseheads
They on a mission
They always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
The attack of the baseheads
Every city every town
They always on the hunt for something never to be found

Goddamn its two more in the cooler once I'm back in the store
Pull my hand axe out that back and then attack 'em some more
I charged
But he bust me in the head with a pepsi
No affect
I left him shakin on the floor like epilepsi
With they necks severed
Fuckin zombies for rocks
Another jumped my back and we went through the glass
Into the parking lot
He tried to kill me
He told me gimmee some change
All diggin in my ear for it and shit
Deranged!!
I grabbed him by his head and tried to yank it to the left
To break his neck
But his head spun all the way around
And that was fuckin it
I was outta there I seen another comin out the grave
Zombies beggin for change!!!
I'm fuckin swingin at 'em knock they chin off they face
But they still coming at me hands out they wanna base
They must think my white eyeballs are giant crack rocks
I gotta slap em out they funky ass socks
Help me!!

The attack of the baseheads

They don't have a brain left behind they empty eyes
They want crack rocka cocka and they buzzin like flies
You might pull they arm off you try to shake their hand
Because their souls been gone its just a shell of a man
Walkin around lookin for rock anyway they can get it
Even if you got aids them dirty bitches let you hit it
And you still gettin somethin worse than you already got
I seen one catch one in the head not even know he got shot
It was crack smoke blown out the side of his head
He put a champagne cork in the hole and that was it
Baseheads zombies millions of 'em and more
With the steam roller roll em over flat on the floor
There like dead ass bodies walkin around without the ghost
With no clue were they fuckin headed but the rock roast
Opportunities were givin
They let em all pass
Now they themselves aint worth the shit out they ass

Enjoy this tale of a personal rejuvenation, redemption and scrubification
As told by the great Shaggy 2 Dope!

Grand Papi, was a World War II vet
And I found his bazooka set in the basement,
With a bag of mortars
Yeah, bitch, I'm done taking orders,
Dragged it outside and tried it out
Dropped the shell in and fired it out
Across the street to the neighbour's kitchen
And now half of their house's missing
Fuck yeah!
I grabbed the rockets
Beer truck in the scope unlocked it
Blew the wheels off and flipped it twice
I'm realizing with the Zooka Nice

And I'm dancing!
He's dancing
With a God damn bazooka
Bazooka Joey!
Bazooka!

And I'm dancing!

I sent a hot one
Right through the doors
And let it mangled in a pile of boards
I swear my shoulder is loving the shot
Fuck the abomination I plot
I'm blowing new cop cars into stock yards
Bitch, this is a bazooka
You not hard!
See the swat team hiding in the limousine
It seems they smithereens!
Pull out my hair, screaming and laughing
Get shot at and shooting back in
Terrorizing
Paralyzing

Electrifying!

Remember me bitch 8th grade
Ball park skinny ass well-fare aid
Ustler and bruce brothers we was the shit
Dungeons dragons, and bruce lee flicks
Quit school nobody missed us,
Nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us
Now look at these beautiful model type high class women
Takin my dick in em
You don't remember my kind in class
The whipped out freak starin at your ass
Never had the courage to even say hi
Only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind
Now your flashing your titties at me waitin in line
And that's fine while you're working your charm
Look beneath the paint bitch it's the scrubs who won

*People murmuring*

You used to say ahhh hah!
Look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again
An outcast I knew I had to do something
Figure out a way to make something out of nothin
Open up shop got what you need
Speakers clothes cds or bags of weed
But that shit got me nowhere except jail
Me and all my homies to broke to make the bail
So now were right back at the place we started
Chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs
Assed out but we was like fuck yall
We got each other and the drop of the homie call
Look at us now bitch holdin platinum
All up on my dick but I'm the same as back then
Forget the money and fame because
Beneath the paint lifes just as it always was

*People murmuring*

Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?
Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?

Another girl I don't dare to confide in
Playing that role it hurts inside
Here I am thinking she wants me
She only wants that killer on her cd
Just when I couldn't feel any worse
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first
The day I finally get to leave this land
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (analyze!)
The shell of a used up man
The shell of a used up man
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man

But I like fucking crack heads with one titie

And I do it at the drop of a dime
And I get the scabies almost every time
So, let's talk about my nut sac
I don't front, Jack, I got bugs on my ball sac

Well, I'm Violent J and I ain't no bitch
I'm always quick to tell you when my nuts itch
'Cuz bitch, if I'm itching when I come home
Drop a brick in a sock, swing it on your dome

You didn't think nothing of it, just let me stick it
Probably should of known 'cuz I thought I heard crickets
In your neden but I ain't sayin' nuttin' though
I ain't sayin' nuttin' till I'm done nuttin', ho

And know I'm like, ""bitch how can this be
Tryin' to sleep and my nuts get up and watch tv
Then try to walk to the store and get a 40
How'd these bugs get on me? ""

Somebody asked me, how I got scabies
Probably that homeless, fat, redneck bag lady
That I fucked in the shed
Then the little critters on my dingaling said

We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts, we want your nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts""

'Cuz I got me a prudy womans love

I met this bitch and went up in it
Dropped her off, went to the clinic
Bitch, I got bizugs on my siznac
So, tell me, what's up with that?

Should of said something 'bout your bug problem
Now, I'm gonna have to sock you in your mouth, bitch
Can't keep my motherfucking hands out my drawers
Stick a roach motel up under your balls

Nah, I'd rather stick 'em in a deep fry
And sizzle those motherfuckers off my wang
So, you wanna fuck around, always gotta buck around
Lift up your dingaling nothing but a bug ya found

Now, they call you funky nuts 'cuz you like funky butts
Scratching and biting them, now they call you monkey nuts
But I ain't sayin' nothing 'cuz you ain't playin' nothin'
Bring the track back and I get back to the nut sac track

So, now I try to rap 'cuz the bugs is biting
But I ain't going out like a bitch, yo, fuck that
Stick 'em in a blender and hit the switch
Then I hit the bitch

Met this bum in the back of a dumpster
Fucked her in the rumpster, juggaluga humpster
Had to take a piss, so I pulled out my wang
Then I heard my dingaling sang

""Your nuts, we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts, we want your nuts

And carry two unfortunates off the Ogre's cell
It aint no guards playin' cards, aint no uniforms needed
You the only one around butt naked, bloody, and bleedin'
With 7 demons in your ear got you believin' your heathen
Talk you into pullin' out your own intestines to get even

Put his hand up on my shoulder felt the claw of the beast
I never thought it'd be so fuckin' easy, killin a priest
We went into the confession booth, he took off his clothes
And cut some yay right on his bible top and ooted his nose
I jammed a butcher's knife, 12 inches into his gut
He looked me right in the eyes while I was yanking it up, preacha killas!

Crooked preacha killas      Stop it!

I walked into the semon, strapped with an iron crowbar
I beat a nun into a bloody stew in the trunck of my car
How the fuck she got fake titties and a pussy ring? Bullshit!
She sucked the preacher dick in the pulpit I know the going's-on,
I've witnessed it while pushing my mop,
And blood gushing don't step when my hatchet go chop
I aint a fuckin holy rolla, I'm outta controlla face painted,

We shootin' for the preacha, fuck, I missed and hit the reverend but it doesn't matter though they say he's going to heaven
And then I shot for the preacha, I blew his ear off we in the balcony bustin' gone of pcp and Smirnoff
I shot again, missed and hit somebody in the choir they fell back into the candle rack and caught the place on fire
I shot again, I finally caught the preacher in his dome then we put our barrels to eachother's heads and took it home

I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel

And while I'm thinking it's awfully dark and kinda funny
Don't think too fast though, just dig, things could get bloody

I'm thinkin', ""Well, she's better off inside if she died""
Nah, she needs me, I can tell, my baby wants me

I pry it open, the odor hits me, there she is

Why? I never liked chicken pot pie, or the chopped chicken on rye
Tell Mr. Billy Bob I'm a cut his neck up
Slice, poke, chop-chop, stab, cut
""What can you do with a drunken hillbilly?""
Cut his fuckin' eyes out, and feed 'em to his Aunt Nilly
Willie, Willie chicken neck, chicken huntin' gotta love it
Hit him with the 12-gauge bucket, chicken nuggets
Laid out all over the grass
Then his little hound dog'll eat 'em up fast

Wipe the sweat outta my eyes, cocked the hammer

A skinny redneck with one of his kinfolk
I pull up along side and blast the passenger
Blood, feathers and bone, a massacre
I kept shootin, hit the driver
He fell on the horn stuck
Threw a Molotov cocktail and blew up the truck

I had a brain, but life had to ruin it
Dissinfected, Disected, Don't Respect It
When you put me in a cage full of animals
Savages and cold blooded canibals
I can't help but come but abouts me
Try to run but they found me, surround me
Then they choke ya, and provoke ya
Try to smoke ya, turn you into a joka
I tried to rub it off, but its all I know
The only thing I ever knew, so what to do
Look at you, a bigot till your growin old
Your growin mold, with a soul that's freezin cold
So I confess, but even if I'm all wrong
I'll be down with the clown till I'm dead and gone

Chorus

I confess, this lady had a purse, so I took it
I took it home, opened it, I shook it
She had papers, lipstick and nail polish
Credit cards and about 27 dollars
I bought a 5th, drank it and laid there
It seemed like, I could see the purse everywhere
On the light post, by this mail box
I tried to run from it, I ran a couple blocks
But there it was, on the side walk, waitin for me
It tried to lure me to it, I had to fuckin' do it
I picked it up, and stuck my fuckin' hand in it
It was full of rats, and they fuckin' bit it off
Father I confess, I'm a criminal
But my worlds too subliminal around me
Look at them, all the wicked masses
That's why I'm down with the clown till I'm ashes

Chorus

Its like a circus, a wicked carnival
Everybodys got a tickit, they're lookin
For the freaks, to point and gawk at
Look at yourself, the jokes on you jack

Are you going to suck the poison out too?
Do you know what's under my apron?
No maam, I aint never looked... A c*** like I got, I guess.
No clyde, it's a nice big c***.

My name is shaggy but some call me saggy balls
Cuz you can see my ball sack hangin out my drawers
I wear short shorts, bitches stop and stare
Later on you see me partin through their cotton hair
I need a bytch
I always gotta check and ask
How many corn dogs been to the cotton patch
And when I fuck bytches that's what I'm tryna do
My nuts is people so I'm tryna stuff em in there too
Cotton candy
It wasn't made for the mouth
You don't believe me?
Then take a look and then south
Rotten candy, is what you'll find without a doubt
I stick my wang in the cotton hole and then I'm out
Jump steady, rude boy, and nate the mac,
They huntin cotton, and shaggy shag know where it's at
So don't be stingy, there's more than one wicked clown
And bytch you got enough cotton here to go around
Now some bytches wanna go and shave the cotton off, straight to the candy
I'm with it
I wont get lost
That's why I bring the clippers with me
They comin in handy
When you fuck around with the cotton candy

Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy cotton candy
Yeah hey hey,
Cotton candy don't get wet until it's in your mouth she told me (2x)

My name is j
The kiddies call me jitty pants
Cuz I can play the flute and make my dick start to dance
Like a snake I make it shake, rattle, and roll
And this year my balls made it to the cotton bowl
Unlike shaggy, he's scared of the cotton pie
I ate so much cotton candy I got pink eye
I can remember the first time I had a taste
She pulled her panties down and stuck the cotton in my face
I said your daddys home
She said so fuckin what
I tried to take my ding-a-ling and stick in her butt
I tried to push it in
I couldn't turn it out
She said cotton candy don't get wet until it's in your mouth!
Ohhh shit, so what was I to do?
Run like a bytch, or have the cotton stew?
I thought for a second, then I said what the fuck
I ate so much cotton that my tongue came out her butt!
Bblblbllll bytch, I'll have another bowl
My boys had to come and get me cuz I lost control
On our way out I had a new attitude
I'm like lets go eat some more pussy dude!
[Chorus:]
Marge, you know where the money is. You get it and hold it for
Miss vicki while I kiss her pussy.
Sure, clyde, honey.
Okay clyde, now before you kiss my pussy lips, lick the insides of my thighs,
Here and here. Yes, it helps get pussy warmer.
Yes, maam
That's it, clyde, nice and slow. Oh, that's nice, clyde baby.

Nice and slow. Oh, that's nice, clyde baby. Oh god! Oh! Lick the hairs of my

Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'
Tastes like chicken finger lickin' deep fried
I ate a dead body, but don't tell, I lied

I just ate my first dead body last week
Still got a finger nail caught in my teeth
Before you start yellin' and cursin' my name
Remember something's wrong with my brain, insane

Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall
I'm slidin' and I'm bouncin' off shit like a hockey puck

Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
But I'm not a Martian, you wouldn't understand

We got somebodies, we got nobodies

Some people run, 'cause they don't like the smell

Others line up just as quick as they can

Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head

Of a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut
A dead body bitch learn to keep her mouth shut
Ridin' in the back is my dead body crew
Only they can never think of nothin' to do

If you think I'm sick take a look at yourself
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand
I'm just the dead body man

We also collect dead bodies
So, if you know any dead people
Or you yourself are plannin' on dyin' soon

Gathering candy treats door to door

Probably 'cause the pumpkins on my porch are real
Real human heads carved out with steel
Cut out the eyes, man, it takes but a minute
Rip out the be	-be	-be	-be	-brains and put a candle in it
Maybe they run 'cause I take 'em inside
Come and meet Mother, two years ago she died

They burn down the city and they leave it crispy-charred

Hungry bellies, I can see where you're at
Sitting on my window, I can turn into a bat
Watching you remove all your little clothesies for bed
I crash through the window and land on your head
Drinking the blood, blood is gone to the bone
But now, I must leave, Mother's calling me home
Up to the moonlight, I'm gone from the scene

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I, I don't know, every time I see a video show
I see horrors and sharp teeth, why?
Most these puppets open butt holes up wide
I can't even walk down the street
Without these demons swinging off my meat
Demon faces appear everywhere
Mothafuckers trying to analyze my nut hair

(Anybody Killa)
I see demons everywhere
But I just keep walking like I don't care
When I'm at the mall or on the streets
They are always at drive thru's when I'm looking for eats
I can't shake them. Every time I look ones coming
If I lose it, I'm afraid I'm gonna start dumping
Stay calm, clear my brain
Set fire to a face so I don't see it again

(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why
(You got a demon face!)

(Monoxide Child)
Are you ready for the jump off?
I'm in a traffic jam with the punk ass cops behind me
In a raid van understand I got a demon in my trunk
And it's face change form and the hater got bucked
He kept looking at me and I started to panic
So I nutted the fuck up and let his whole crew have it
The cop hit the lights and pulled right by me
Now I'm of to burry this bitch behind me

(Violent J)
Demon coming around looking like gwar
See them in my minds eye, I know who they are
Face pissed off, I'm there and I can't keep calm
I'm steadily exploding, just chilling, the bomb
I see Medusa seduce them with aids in they ass
And a band of necks trying to chase my cash
Better go knock on the van with some of them local openers
Cause they be hoping for you whores...

They're always watching me

So many have that demon face, think the so real
They call me fake for goodness sake
Man I just don't know
But I advise you not to trust any them hoes
Them things ain't eyes in the front of they head
They hazard lights one and the walking dead
You're a talking head with a tail to match
Worried about my (Demons) mind your own scratch

Now I done been in all types of holy places
Situations with demon faces full of hatred
Condemn the sacred Adam and Eve was in the garden naked
That's why I never talk to a snake bitch
So I won't be bit in the snake pit
Game is immune to a venomous fake bitch
That's why they can't take it

Insane Clown Posse,Dirt Ball,/i/insane+clown+posse/dirt+ball_20067662.html,"Galacto Inspector do you read me?
Yes Captain
Status?
Completed
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly.
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball,
And study peoples life styles,
Their general habits of living in their strange society.
Yes
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain
Very well, may we have your report?
A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably 'cause they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars.
They supposed be there just to serve and protect,
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks.
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land.
This I don't understand.
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe.
On top of all that, ""What?"" he's mad old.
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a kid,
But that shit was like 400 years ago.
Captain ""Yes Galacto"" I just don't know.
Any kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said 'Stale'
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?
Cause the old ass judge looked at me and said:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(x2)
Very interesting, thank you Galacto Inspector
Now probes Data and Data, do your read me?
Yes, here sir
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the 
Dirtball?
This is professor Data
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered.
We came in contact with several different specimens of life.
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right.
Upon sight people judge and stereo type.
Their forms of government and religion are glorified.
Purified as the waters that are now polluted.
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted.
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her.
She's high off that cane.
Depending how you slang you can get most anything.
From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane.
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight.
He control's and manipulates their whole United States.
I call to the white castle.
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle.
He said the information I requested was denied.
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(x2)
Judging from the information so far collected
The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving this information we'll make our final judgment.
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good.
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods.
I think there trying to kill me 'Well what do you mean?'
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phaser tron out, hold up *buzz*
'What was that?'
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships.
They swell each other's lips.
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life.
So they come home drunk and beat they wife.
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it.
You ask me they can both suck my petty lip.
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy.
Another thing they love to watch horror movies.
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD.
They tried to ban this one group ICP.
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head,
And then he took his microphone and said:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

Get the fuck out
So get the fuck out

Nah, fuck that, since Basement Cuts, motherfucker

How long will the juggalos be down with me?
How long till they forget me, check it out
What if I grew another fucking head
And his name was Violent Ed
And he'd head butt me every time I cussed
I would need two microphones when I bust
Would you show me love even with another head
Or would you be like, ""Fuck you and Ed""
Or what if I sold out like a bitch
And took the make-up off and went soft, eww
Called myself Detroit Southwest Lover
And put my ugly ass face on the album cover
With R and B top ten hits
And we had Jodeci singing all over our shit (aaahhhh!!!!)
Fuck that, though, yo, I'm a juggalo
So don't forget me like you did with Menundo

What about when the world's like fuck us kill us, what will you be? (down)
What about when I'm 103, what will you be? (down, down)

What about when the carnival comes to your town? (I'm a be down with the

How long will you be down with a ghetto puppet
I say I'm sick in the nugget and you love it
I ate a dead body, I ain't proud of it
I told you all about it, and you all applauded (Hey!!)
I got problems, I'm haunted by a carnival
I could run and tell a doctor, but what for
I just put it on tape with a fat beat
And make a quick buck, I'm like fuck
I could of came out sportin some Hammer pants
Kick-steppin with Shaggs, and tryin to dance
Making mom happy, keeping it soft
I'd rather grab my dick and tell your mom to fuck off!
I know then you'd probably start to trip
And swing at me, but hit Violent Ed in the lip
Look I don't even know what I'm trying to say
Just don't forget me like you did with Rob Base

Imagine a place that exists beyond, a place that's seldom seen
A place that even the wickedest souls that burn have never been
There was a soul named damion he was nothin heaven to say
Instead he was cast to the flames of hell to serve an eternal grave
Even in the after life things don't always go as planned
Satans realm sees through, it's hectic and over jammed
Damion earned his spot in hell right until his dieing day
So the wagons took his sorry soul and taunted him all the way
They finally reached that resting place and endless pit of fire
But damion had excapte throught the back door of satans lair
Out the back entrance of hell with no were else to hide his time is just a toomb resting in the echoside

Echoside echoside not without my echoside (4x)
In the background: take me to the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me from the nethervoid and bury me in black
Take me from the echoside and never bring me back

Damion ran as far as he could before his legs began decaying
There were many dead trees of blood red skies and headless children playing
A wicked man with a long black tongue saw damions legs were dead
So he layed on top of damion and then licked the back of his neck and said
Backwords talking saying: fuck the devil fuck that shit we believe in life legit
If you diggin what we say
Why you throw your sould away?

Echoside echoside not without my echoside (4x)
In the background: take me to the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me from the nethervoid and bury me in black
Take me from the echoside and never bring me back

Backwards talking again saying: fuck the devil fuck that shit
We believe in life legit
If you diggin what we say
Why you throw your soul away?

Damion crawled for many hours in puddles of blood he lay
Torchered by everything he saw yet wishin along the way his arms decayed and fell off his body as he rolled along the floor
Still trying not too look back, as if something else were in store
The clouds above were dark and hot yet dripping with blood rain
The ground infested with rodents that crawled throughout his veins
As damion layed in echoside, hells screams could still be heard
Blood red sky would flicker with the torchering that occured
Thinking that he had escaped every scream he heard he laughed
With the headless children pointing and urinating in his lap
He finally saw some fortress gates so he quickly rolled into it
These red gates were the front doors of hell, he never knew it, he he

Echoside echoside not without my echoside
In the background: take me to the shadows on the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
Take me from the nethervoid and bury me in black

I tried to visit Shaggy, I stepped up off of my porch
And it was dark as fuck, I couldn't see, not even with a torch
I hear the streets talking, and they're aware of my moves
They whispering and swinging from trees above, I hear the loons
I tried to jog a little, crow eyes glow like cats
Demonic zombies runnin up on me, I slap 'em what the bat
But my eyes keep bleeding from the rays of the darkness
They powerful and burn you something heartless
I hear a giant thunpin, some kind of ogre or something
I see the phantom screamin as the giant behemoth is comin
And it swing at me! I felt a rip, my head went spinnin
And flippin and rollin and finally landed in position
I could see me body, still standin, headless as fuck
It finally fell, but what the hell, still got my nugget, but I'm stuck
I can't move, fuck I'm only a face why even try?
On top of that, its a centipede crawlin in my eye I wanna die

Everyday I die
Back to the start another try!
I got the time so why shouldnt I?
Everyday I die
Back to the start another try!
I got the time so why shouldnt I?
I got too much time on my hands...

I tried to visit J, I walked out into the cold
I see they don't collect they dead, they all up over the road
And some are fully rotted, and some they most have just spotted
I see a headless body that resembles J's but I doubt it
I seen a Centaur, I threw a ptchfork at it above
I watched it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood
I'm fuckin about to hurl, I close my eyes and walk on
Its giant crows swoopin at me, got me, carry me on
I cut its claws with the Hatchet in my hand
Even in hell you best believe I keep the Hatchet in my hand
And as I'm fallin now I see the Witch is riding my chest
With its claws on my neck screamin I should of confessed
I slammed down on to an iron gate a demon, statue near me
Four pionts stickin out my chest I'm hangin there dearly
And the hungry goblins? They got a fire beneath me
They cookign my legs to make myself eat me, I wanna die

Everyday I die

I got the time so why shouldnt I?
Everyday I die
Back to the start another try!

What's your pleasure?
(1st Verse- Violent J)
Fat Sweaty Betty, the bitch ain't nothing new
Her moms used to babysat me back when we was two
We'd go to the playground and to the skating rink
And we'd go under the bleachers and she'd let me hit the stank, well uh
She moved across town and never came back
Until the other day, I seen her at the Chicken Shack
She said her name was Betty, I can't believe this shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty beeitch
She said, ""Hey, J, tell me how you've been?""
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, ""Hold still,"" and flicked it off her face and said,
""Betty, oh, Betty, what you say we leave this place?""
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across the rip of cellulite
EWW! It was nasty, but I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fucking knocked the wind out of me
I couldn't breathe, she wouldn't stop, I'm almost dead
I took the lamp, and bust it on her fucking head
We got dressed, I gave her a little kiss goodbye
Fat Sweaty Betty, My fat sweaty pumpkin pie
(Chorus)
Fat Sweaty Betty
Tell me when you're ready (x2)

(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
Big fat slop of shit people call Betty
Flabs of fat on her back, her neck...sweaty
Boogers running down her nose all over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that, 'cause I want to see the neden
I had to see the cat, the cheesey cheena cheden
Rode my bike to her house, ""Hey yo, Betty lemme in
I'm packing some snack cakes, bitch lemme in.""
I can hear her coming down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motherfucking underwears
UUGGHH!! Shit, fuck that I'm turning back
But no, the door shut, and she's going for the cake snacks
I said, ""Relax, hoe, I'm here, I'm bu-si-ness
you can have the candy, first you gotta wait a bit
I need a favor, come on, Betty, drop them drawls.""
AHH!! I knew it, Betty had balls
Oh, no, here comes that ass

I wish I never came, oh boy do I wish
See Fat Sweaty Betty, the sweaty fat bitch

Another funky, funky rhyme
Got another funky rhyme
Another funky rhyme
Another funky, funky rhyme

Aw shit, man, that's the ICP
This is my jam, I'm on a psychedelic
Motherfucking, inter-galactic void G
Aw, shit

Well, they let the gate up so I bail
It's been six months pick me up from the county jail
With a smog mother payin' my dues
Steel toilets, worn blankets and rubber shoes

But I ain't naggin', here come the fellas
I can hear the muffler draggin', 8 men in the car long
And the Faygo is almost gone
My nuts are kinda hard so I need a mate

So my homeboy's cousin set me up with a blind date
She said, ""Pick me up at three""
Can't bitch, the bus don't ride your street, ho
We gonna eat at Mexican Village

Take a cab and I'll pay the tab
And when she showed, well, I'll be damned
Left my wallet at home on the TV stand
Have her pay him and for dinner too

The knot in my sock, it done bit you
She's all prettied up for nothing
I'm smelling like shit and my chin is scruffing
And I'm chewing on my food like a pitbull

'Cuz I won't front for the ho
Stuck my face in a bowl of soup
And just sucked it all up threw my missin' tooth
The bitch jumped up with a boom

""I have to fix my hair"" and broke to the bathroom
She's got the tab, so I go for mine
And order up some '52 vintage wine
Hey, Louie, bring a fuckin' steak with that

Motherfuckers like jail say fuck dat
She's back now and her hair ain't fixed
Probably took a long greasy-ass smelly shit
I ain't saying nothing though

I ain't saying nothing bout the funkin' ho
What's up bitch, I'm ready to break
How long can one fat bitch take?
Quite snacking and pay me saps

'Cuz we goin' home to meet her pops
So Joe, what is that you do for a living?
Aw, come on pops, you seen me selling rocks on
Verner and Springwell, matter fact
I think I sold to that fat bitch in the kitchen

Your dad's really cool sweetheart
I mean him letting me use his car
And he slipped me a fifty, Violent J is kinda nifty
If I'd a hit you'd be home through

But now you're coming home with me
Dad, I gotta bitch in the bedroom
Take your ass to the bar and don't come home soon
Now the juggla's known to smack hoes
But I need the shot too, so I switch to the mack mode

Now woman, you know I love you
So why don't you just let me fuck you
Now bitch, I know you's a freak
So let me get a little kiss on your cheek

And a fuck to go with that
Come on, nympho, let me hit that
Tell ya what you let me stick it
And I gotta left over piece of chicken for ya

Ya little sewer skank
Ya nasty little pipe-smoking sac-chasing, ho
And that was that
A little smooth talking she was on her back

And I'm finally sticking
Dump ya, and I'm eating my chicken

No way! I should've known you guys would be a bunch of baby pussies about it. 
Fuck that ain't afraid. You don't even know where it's at. 
Yes I do. Then where is it then?

Off lickety trail there's a pond where many a children died,
It's a place to run to and disappear a place where some folks hide.
But they will tell you about the rumors that swell around this lake,
Some say there's something in the water them deaths are no mistake.
The fog that rides along the top has been said to carry voices,
Those of the dead who took the dare and jumped in they made bad choices,
Some have seen and others heard that they seen along the bottom,
Are all the bodies of the girls and boys preserved and remaining half-rotten.

The water's fit with murky mud,
The weeds are red like splattered blood.
In this pond a spirit cries,
Snakes and bugs replace his eyes.
Some don't believe and dared to swim,
Something under will pull you in.
Hidden deep in the wild brush,
If you know where it is then hush.

We almost there,

At Fonz Pond.

Off likety trail there's a pond where many a children perished,
The water is black even in the sunlight deep and dark nightmarish.
Some believe the bodies surface and bask underneath the moon,
Others say they seen a headless boy stumbling 'round the lagoon.
The loons scream all night long,
Sounds malotic sings you a song.
Missing children swampy depths,
Mysteries are secrets kept.
Staring owls snakes and frogs,
Leeches living off hollow logs.
Somethings watching from the water,
It took them missing sons and daughters.

It's over there.

Only terrifying horror tales emulate from this one place,
Several children young boys and girls disappear here without a trace.
What you believe and what you don't is entirely up to you,
But if you go up there and swim alone you'll know exactly whats true.
Somethings dragging through the mud,
Mosquitoes attracted to the blood.
They say the dark depths have no bottom,
Some never came back up and got 'em.
Crazy kids come party here,
It swallows more souls every year.
The jump right in and disappear,
Best to stay away from up there at Fonz Pond.

There it is.
Don't go in the water,

Wicked clowns in the moonlight creeping
Slide through your window under your bed
Crawl in through your ear, eat your head

Bumping into bones 'cuz I need light
Tip-toeing down through your windpipe
Climbing down your spine was the fun part
Looky looky and I think I see your fucking heart

Uh, huh, so I'm stabbing like it ain't nothing
Wicked clown cut his way out your belly button
I'm like a vulture waiting in a dark place
Swooping down and I'm picking at your dead face

I'm sick but you don't know the whole deal
No one ever loved me and they never will
Bitch, I take you out on a blind date
But then they find you dead under a wooden crate

Rapped in a bag deep in the woods
'Cuz my mother always said I was no good
Locked me in a closet, fed me dog shit

And then they woke up a lot of souls
And hope to hell with the Nitty folk

Stop into the graveyard been chillen here for days
Workin the graveyard shift diggen up all the graves
Sellin all the stiff to the Dead Body Man
Wakin back to life so then I began to ran
The decrepit mutha fucka was followin right behind
I don't know what to do, I think I'm losin my mind
Right then the corpse came jumpin out a tree
Way out a tree
And fallin on top of me
Back on my feet
As I began my face
Put my hands around his neck and tried to put it in a brace
But a nope, that's not how the shit goes
His head popped off and started nibblin on my toes
I got dead bodies to the right
I got dead bodies to the left
I thought the cary one, but what about the rest?
Tie me up with some veins dragen me into the tomb
I knew I had to be doomed
'cause I can hear the loons in my head
It was dead, echoin through my brain
Tellin me somthin's wrong then I felt the pain
It was nockin down my flesh by the pound
But that's what happens 
when you be fuckin around in the graveyard, dawg

Come to the graveyard now you see what's goin on
You scarder then a mother fucker shouldn't of brought
your ass along
Ain't no place to hide, and really no place to run
And plus I pack a bible, a shovel, and a shot gun
Don't you point your finger though ICP don't ride a hearse
You think it's over now, but now it's gonna get much worse
Deadly sour paid a gang, nothing else can fuck with that

Suck on my dick you rich hoe

So why you gonna play hard?
Brother blow your hole card
And I'll go slap your ass with the shovel in the graveyard

Deep underground
Never to be found
Then my body rots as I'm sleepin in peace
'cause nobody dares to ever wake the deceist
But who is this mutha fucka nocken at my tomb?
Disturbing the worms that are trying to consume, my body
It better be somebody worthy, bastard, 
oh, he he, it's the Ringmaster
Giving me orders to awake from the dead
My body is decade I need to find a new head
And a new leg, but then I'll be straight
To crawl from the dirt
And put in some work
One O'clock one thirty, two in the morning
Wicked Clowns ICP and Project Borning
At the graveyard I got the whole wide world in my hands
'cause I'm the Dead Body Man
Wicked, Wicked Jokers, Wicked Jokers, Wicked Fun

Insane Clown Posse,Growing Again,/i/insane+clown+posse/growing+again_20407243.html,"The jump off one summer night I noticed my shoes was fittin wrong
My feet was all the sudden a half an ich too long
I jumped in my car and though ""now who the fuck was in my seat,
Fuckin with my lever and re-adjustin my mirrors""
I stopped to get a slurpee and I noticed I was floodin' in my jeans;
Getting back in my car, I split my ass seam
My shit ain't hardly fitting anymore, fucked up detergent or
I'm growin bigger than motherfuckin dinosaur
Got out the car and had to duck to get in shaggy's place
You should have seen the fuckin look up on his painted face
He said ""holy fuckin shit, I don't know if you knowin
But you growin and it's obviously showin, homie""

[chorus 2x]
Watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
Watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
And now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again,
Now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again

The next day I woke up, shaggy's three dogs were trippin on me
Laid out on his couch a smooth nine foot three
They don't fuckin love me no more, I stand up
And put a hole in shaggy's ceilin with my big ass nug
The dogs ran, shaggy's like, ""holy fuck, don't move!
First thing you gotta fuckin do is do not move!
We need to get you out the house before you fuck my shit up! ""
I had to crawl through the hall into the front yard, then get up
I'm lookin through the eyes of a twelve foot tall man
Don't feel any different though I could use a tall can
I'm growin every hour and the reason's unknown
Now I'm sitting on your home with my feet on your lawn, damn

[chorus 2x]
Watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
Watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
And now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again,
Now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again

To me, suvs and sedans, they're like pop can
A little bit heavier but tin in my hand
Shaggy's chillin on my shoulder in a custom made basket
""i'm tryin to ride with my boy in this bitch, and outlast it""
I try to stay in one place, it ain't no use in hidin
Hella choppers beamin with coppers on all sides
And the media, government are offerin jobs
World press, scientists, all swarming with this mob all around us
""fuck it J, you only gettin bigger, dog
You and me, right now homie go for a jog
We've been sittin here lettin them observe us and for what?
I say you tell 'em fuck the world and throw the lotus up""
Now I'm runnin, every step is 32 miles
Shakin' the earth, turnin buildings into piles
And I'm runnin, crushin trees like blades of grass
My head's above the clouds, all they see is my ass
And I'm runnin, 600 mile an hour wind gust
Footsteps explosions, three day of dust
And I'm runnin' I can still hear shaggy on the megaphone
""keep keep keepin' on! don't stop! come on!""
And I'm runnin through states in two step or less
Through the oceans, and don't even be getting my nuts wet
And I'm runnin, finally gravity took me away
I ran right off the planet into the black of outer space and I'm runnin

[chorus 2x]
Watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
Watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down

Insane Clown Posse,Guess My Religon,/i/insane+clown+posse/guess+my+religon_21036159.html,"Why is everybody always playing with God? (X3)

Ain't that a bitch?
The church house getting rich
And I'm looking like dookie on a stick
As soon as I walked in, they couldn't wait
To pass that fat ass collection plate
And before I could stick my dollar in
The ushers were making rounds again
To get here I had to catch a ride
And these motherfuckers talking about 20 percent in tithes
Telling me it's for the homeless and those with no where to go
But at night, the church doors close
The poor get a cup of soup if they lucky
While the pastor peeps a black screen and he gets stucky
He says he talks to God on Facebook
The congregation cheats the whole place crooks
I don't give a fuck about your blessings
You want to know my religion, why don't you guess it?

Why is everyone always playing with God? (x4)

I got to talk about these snakes behind the pulpit
Cause they full of that bullshit
It's no wonder they think they large
When these motherfucking members treat they ass like God
They pulled a man in outta wheelchair
He backflipped across the stage to get paid
They went to the next town more money made
It ain't even real wine, it's Kool-Aid
Half the choir hit the weed that morning
They can't help it, church is fucking boring
I'm sick and tired of my homies getting killed
And the pastor is saying ""It's God's will.""
Fuck the enemy is what I said
I won't turn the other cheek bitch
I'll bust your head
Put your hands on me, it gets scary
I'm a put your ass in a cemetery
There's so much about religion I find odd
There's no middleman between me and my God
I don't give a fuck about your blessings
You want to know my religion, why don't you guess it?

Why is everyone always playing with God? (x4)

Just because you got a collar and big book
Don't mean that you ain't a sick crook
So many ways to be misled and get paid
Who are you to tell me when I'm saved
Real believers would practice what they preach
And praise the Lord more than one day out the week
Another reason they ain't repenting
The church house be having some fine ass women in it
And that's why the preacher can't spread the word of the Lord
Cause he be looking just as hard
It's the blind trying to lead the blind
And you wonder why people are so behind
The vows, you don't want the truth
He's jacking off the other side of the confession booth
All this shit is way out of hand
All these motherfuckers doing the hook behind the choir stand
You getting mad cause I'm questioning your merit
But bitch, dammit, if the shoe fit, wear it
I don't give a fuck about your blessings
You want to know my religion, why don't you guess it?

Why is everyone always playing with God?

Yeah, some of you motherfuckers phony as hell
Jumping up and down, catching the Holy Ghost
Spinning all up in the air and shit
When you fall on me, I'm going to knock you smooth out
I don't give a damn, I ain't even playing
Fake fucks, coming to church on Sunday with a motherfucking hangover and
Shit
Still drunk, selling weed in the pews

Fucking old ass pedophile
I seen the preachers car parked outside the Sunrise Health Spa
There goes your donation money
Hookers and crack
You fucking bitches
All these poor ass old people don't know any better

To find the fothermucker
And he's gotta pitbull dog
And it's sitting on my chin like a frog on a log
I throw a bone to try to distract
Cuz I'm wanting my chinny-chin-chin back
Ill never be one to boast
But there's my tongue hanging off the lightpost
Cuz my head exploded
And my brains unloaded
All over this beautiful city
Teeth and bones to the nitty gritty
There's my eyeball stuck to the wall
Right next to my splattered jaw
I don't dig this game
Chasing my brains all through the sewer drains
My heads all over the block
Cuz I done went lunatick-tock tick-tock
Come on, dawg, what's wrong with my head?
It blew apart but I still aint dead
I get no respect
I got nothing but guts hanging off my neck
But I'll still chilling
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling
I'm chillin, I'm illin

If you come across a spine
Best believe it's mine
Oh, forget about my tongue
Cuz vato can't breathe without no lungs
I lost both of mine
Now that's an item that I wouldn't mind to find
But forget about dat
Cuz I'm roaming the streets with a splattered back
I'm trying to rap to this freak
But she can see my ribs all in the street
Then the chit-chat went dead
She noticed that I aint got no head
Shhh, I think I hear my heart
But damn, it got hit by a smark bus
And landed in pontiac
So I tell my mellow to send it back
Come on, wined and my back blow up
Look for my guts, look for my guts
I gotta call from nate the mack
Says he might of found part of my back
Then bring it on over, ace
I got slabs all over the place
But I'm still chillin
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling
I'm chilling, I'm illing
With my guts all over the ceiling
Youll never guess what's up
Ahh, I'm down on my luck
Got no head
Said I got no head

It done fried my brain

Fuck! Damnit! Another Halloween
People on Military know what this means
Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars
Creatures in the streets, and razor blades and candy bars
I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block
Spit in my face and gave my a rock
I tried to give it back and said ""I'll take nothing instead""
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head
Walked to the next house directly next door
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor
I said ""Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?""
She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet
I ran to the next house happy and giddy
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty
I said, ""Trick-or-treat."" she sad ""Treat-or-trick.""
And squeezed on her titty until it.....fuck it, that's too sick
Next house up was sittin back in the woods
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back
And then I heard ""COME ON IN"" and yo I'm like FUCK DAT
This house belongs to Mrs. Cherry Spoon
She said, Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon
I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts
I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst
I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home
Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone
I walked throught the field, and to the next crib
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib
I said ""How bout some candy."" she said How bout instead,
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread
My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb
And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat
I punched him in the neck, and power bombed him in the street
Now my bag of candy has doubled in size
Up to the next house for my scary prize
I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit
Rock through his window and ran across the street
To the Dayton Mansion I'm in for a treat
I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler
A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker
I said Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back
It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready
But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny
The next house is abandonded so forget it
But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it
I ran up to the door ""Trick-or-treat, you can't hide""
It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died
The next house is mine the last on the block
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her glock
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady
And we yelled ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!"" to the whole city

Fish jump out the water tryin to swim for the moon
Vibrational booms drying up the lagoons
My bumps pop fake titties and melt ice grills
Relocate your piercings (dissolve your pills)
Police wail on they sirens but I blow they tweeters
Illuminated liquid leaking outta my speakers
Each drop burns all the way down to the earth's core
(dust devils) sweep across the earth's floor
Crows and ravens don't flap they wing
They just float on the waves that the humdrum brings
Those that have heard can't descibe my bump
(they know) something from the beyond in my trunk

Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)
Na na na nana na na (boom) (all night)

It's Friday night, dark, scary
Lonely walkin' through the park cemetery
And it's foggy, cold and smoggy
Hear a dog, a howlin' dogie

I'm scared, should've brought a shotgun
Would've, should've, but I ain't got one
But I'll watch my back, and what's that?
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback

Better run, hide, quick, fast
It's comin' for my ass with a shovel
Nowhere to run or to hide but a grave pit
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit

Took a fall, even at six foot
Down the stairs hit a floor
And through a door
Into a whole new world of stiffs

Bodies, heads and sexy little dead chicks
Club lights, sounds bass
DJ's spinnin' with maggots on their face
But what I saw next that really took me
Uhh! They did the headless boogie

Hey, yo! I heard that you died
(Yea)
Fuck that! it's time to get live!
(Yea)
Dead bodies let's all take a ride
Lead to the left and slide!

Hey, yo! I heard that you died
(Yea)
Fuck that! it's time to get live!
(Yea)
Dead bodies let's all take a ride
Lead to the left and slide!

Aww yea
We dug up the finest bitches
In the graveyard, so common down
And if you ain't come
To get your funk out
Then get the fuck out, bitch

They all stand straight
And swing to the side
(Uh!)
No heads, but they feet still glide
(Uh huh!)
Take a step back, twist and dive
(Yea!)
I even seen Kurt Cobain gettin' live

No heads, but they all funky
And drunk, drinkin' old spunky
Don't be shy, everyone's able
Hit the floor leave your nugget on the table

And kick step, but when you do kick soft
If they're dead, your legs might fall off
The whole time, I can't believe
I can't conceive I don't wanna leave

Hoo
I'm kickin' into a freak with no head
No face but the rest is straight
She's with it, I hit it like a G
Her back fell off  ugh! Excuse me

Zombies, mummies and Frankenstein
Drinkin' cisco, disco dead wine
Dead stiffs, comin' through the door
Heads fingers, and limbs on the floor

I'm gettin' drunk, I wanna be down
What's up? I wanna be the headless clown!
  (Heh hehe!)
They rolled out the jigsaw and got raw
That ended it all, I did the headless boogie

So come on by, and we'll chop your nugget off
So you can freak that shit

Insane Clown Posse,Hell's Forecast,/i/insane+clown+posse/hells+forecast_10144927.html,"Violent J: Something had woke me a thump on my roof, it was followed by crashing, more thumping ensued.  I jumped out of my bed thinking I’d been invaded, heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated.  Looked out of my window, blood dripped down the glass, I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass.  I ran into the main room and Shaggy was dead, so was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady and abk.  Bolted out the house to see if it’s a joke, I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke and the sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin’, it’s raining with corpses, the blood is appalling.

Shaggs 2 dope and A gang of juggalos [Chorus:]: Mama told me when it rains-It pours, but never mentioned dead bodies-Dead bodies.  Mama told me when it rains-It pours, La de da da de la da de.

Violent J: I never seen so many... Horified looks on people’s faces...(The blood is appalling) I hope I never see what all them people saw... And put them in their places...(The blood is appalling) The sun was so hot... So ho... I was burning... Yeah.  Dead bodies lay randomly, some stack in piles, on all of their faces pure horror, no smiles, I see children, and elders, and ninjas my age, all lay naked and mangled, most withered for days.  I found safety a shelter, I’m under a tree; only fingers and organs come falling on me.  I lay sleepless for days the raining continued, the heat of the sun baking corpses like food.  Then it finally stopped, I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies through what was my hood.  It was right at that moment the Wraith had appeared, and the message it left me might sound kind of weird, but take all that I’m seeing and opposite that, truth is I’m the one dead and this is my Hell’s Pit."

Healed, but I can assure you, this boys spirit has been healed! Inside this

Insane Clown Posse,House Of Mirrors,/i/insane+clown+posse/house+of+mirrors_20067693.html,"Ladies and gentlemen, the House of Mirrors
For just one bet, venture through this wonderful exhibit
See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes
You, young man, would you like to go into the House of Mirrors
Well, okay

Have a good time, son
And good luck finding your way out
Wait a minute, I don't like it in here
Hey, wait a minute, let me out of here
Let there's dead bodies in here
There's dead bodies in here, I don't like it in here

Step inside, come my way
This here is your fatal day
You have lied, they have cried
Now your life has been denied

Look into the big mirror
Your reflection is so clear
Devil's head, rotting flesh
With the snakes inside your chest

In the mirror you can't hide
You've been granted Jacob's lide
Whipping fear, spinning pain
All you crying is in vain

You're the beast you never knew
This reflects the things you do
Others starving down the block
Richie's heart is like a rock

How can I make a law?
I'm just here to break your jaw
House of glass, down and up
You might get your ass cut

Mirror of life, mirror of pain
Death, I wave my magic cain
Your last words are those of fear
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors

Magic wand, magic mirror
Timeless clock says death is near
Death is here, death is on
My king bishop takes your pawn
You can't break House of Mirrors

That's bad luck for seven years
Only in my wicked realm
Of thee untold, now unfold
Thinking back, what you do

Buy a richie home or two
Even though some down and out
You keep what you could live without
You're the beast you never knew
This reflects the things you do

Others starving down the block
Richie's heart is like a rock
First I grab, then I stab
Cut you up into a slab

Grind and twist, flick my wrist
Toss you in the magic mist
Look into halls of glass
Every mirror shows the past
With no love you kick the sin of face
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors

Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror

Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Exec
You should explain to E why icp should let you live
As you look on I see this image in your reflection
A bigot under cover, showing no affections
To the ghettos and the hoods

Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow
'Cuz you refuse to lift a hand
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand

And if I were you I'd fear myself
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth
You just gotta let 'em fall
You Violent J, ""What up?"", bash that head against the wall
And don't let him run for the door
(Where you goin, bitch?)

Make him detour to the sore
And let's wash away his bigot sins
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends
And let them see what they really like
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike

So look closely in the mirror
You're the beast you never knew
So be the next to volunteer
To live in the hood with the icp
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the wickedest of all
Three blind mice, deepest fear
Welcome to the House of Mirrors

Three blind mice, your worst fear
Look into the deadly mirror"

A richie boy  you look a little bit like Dylan 
The 90210 bitch with the funny hair 
So I'm gonna change a few things around  here and there 
Start with your eyes  I pluck 'em both out your head 
And pull your balls out your sack and stick 'em there instead 
Then I snap off your toes and stick 'em in your nose 
And pull the hair out your head until your skull shows 
You're almost ready, gotta fix you for the show tonight 
But your lips, man, to me, they just don't look right 
They could be a little fatter, even more 
So fuckin' fat that your lip is draggin' on the floor 
Tie your tongue into a knot and stretch it out 
And tack a sign on it, tellin' what you're all about 
Set you up, 'cause now you're ready, so open up the door 
'cause at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show 

[Chorus: x2] 
Carnival thrills 
Carnival shows 
Carnival excites you 
Carnival kills 
(Ah, oh, ah, oh) 
Another freak show for the jugga-lugga-lo 

So there you are, come on in, chickie, wow! Ain't you a pretty? 
I think I'll start with the silicone that's in your titty 
I'll pull it out and put it in your forehead and cheek 
So now, you look like the elephant bitch freak 
Don't try to run, chickie-poo, I'm just gettin' started 
I'll beat your head in with a brick until you're half-retarded 
Remember that ugly girl you laughed at at the prom? 
Don't try to laugh now, bitch, you look like her mom 
You came to do the starin', but it's you they're starin' at 
I'll stuff you full of chili-cheese dogs to make you fat 
Then I'll stretch your fuckin' lips and stick 'em in your ear 
So all that evil shit you talk, only you can hear 
I shave you bald, and glue your titty on the top 
And then I spit on your nipple until you drop 
Hey! Almost ready? Jump steady, open the door 
Cause at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show

Ya feel better now? I didn't let ya pass,
How bout I stop my car, and beat your fuckin ass?
How many times will my neighbor beat his wife?
Somewhere in that house there's a butcher knife.
Fuckin drunk, swingin his fists about,
Why don't you wait till he sleeps, then take him out?
How many times will I sit in a hot car?
Traffic jam, been sittin for a fuckin hour.
Must be an accident, I hope nobody died,
Finally get there, and the crash is on the other side!
The gawkers roll by and creep slow,
Hopin they can see a mangled body show.
Some park, and stand there and watch it all,
With their kids, they point, and fuckin stare! (and just look!)
I remember one time I was pulled over,
Handcuffed, the cop was like, shows over.
People watching, hoping that he shoots me,
I just wanted to choke their fucking heads!

No smiles, no help, you're just a piece of shit,
Im gettin pissed, calm down, fuck it, forget it,
Back to my car, and there it is, another ticket!
How many times will a crackhead smoke crack,
And ask me for some money cuz he wants crack,
Give him money, again, he's coming back,
Walk away, and heres another, gimmie crack.

And have to listen, and learn all this bullshit,
Learnin history and science, fuckin wait,

Oh shit, I jumped in the wagon
No more laggin', I'm taggin'

Grippin' my wing wong, something's wrong
Who's this, not a bitch, but a dude
And he's tellin me to beat it, fuckin' rude

It's Jimmy, her man, a punk ass
So I throw a left hook at him, splat
Then I came back with a right hook
Pow, he fell to the ground, I didn't mean to kill him

Pull his plugs out and start chokin'

Tell Santa that he better stop frontin'
That cookie eatin' mother fucker never leavin' nothin'
But this year I swear I won't let it happen
Sleighs, gifts and reindeer we Christmas jackin' (gimme that)
Surround sound, hot chocolate for days

Yeah, he was old but he had a fat wallet (cha-ching)
Only workin' one day a year
With a plush-red suit and a iced-out beard

I hid behind a chimney
And bust him in the skull with a bottle of Jim Beam
I rolled him off the roof and onto the driveway
And jumped in his sleigh ride and tried to fly away
Rudolph bossed off on me, he wouldn't move
I had to kick him in his ass, outta put him in groove
Take me to the hood, to all the poor little kids
This year, everybody about to get some good shit
We landed on a house, I went for the chimney
But the roof was feeble, I crashed through and smashed through the kitchen table
Daddy came bustin' out the bedroom strapped
Third shot blew off my Santa hat, fuck that
I ran out the back door and I hopped a wall
Steady whistlin' for the reindeer, but they're like fuck off, then took off
I almost caught a slug in the ass, and became a ghost of Christmas past over that shit (over that bullshit)

Only rich boys get big toys from Santa
I waited all night in my pajamas mother fucker

ICP in this bitch
Ya know what I'm saying
All you bitches, man
Come over to my house
And I'ma take ya upstairs
And I'ma stick you with my wang
Ya know what I'm saying?
I stuck her with my wang
She hit me in the balls
I grabbed her by her neck
And I bounced her off the walls
She said it was an accident and then apologized
But I still took my elbow and blackened both her eyes
I stuck her with my wang
Bitchy bitchy hoe
I'd like to stick a Faygo bottle in her neden hole
I twist ya and turn ya, just to shake it up
Pop off the lid now it's shooting out her butt
I stuck her with my wang
She grabbed by me nuts
She told me that she loved me then commenced on the sucking
I tried to hold it back, but I nutted in her ear
When it dried up, the bitch couldn't hear
(Chorus)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, yo)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, then he hit the door)
I stuck her with my wang
I'm ringing dingaling
After I hit it, my boys will do the same
Bitches come in flocks when the carnivals in town
Suckin on my nuts, trying to be down
I stuck her with my wang
The freaky little slut
She wanted me to stick my finger in and out her butt
I asked the bitch why, she gave no reply
I went psycholistic and I stuck it in her eye
I stuck her with my wang
I hit it slow motion
I had the Ringmaster brew me up a love potion
I put it on her neden, I know this sounds insane
Her coochie started whistling and singing out my name
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy, stick me with your wang!
(Chorus X2)
I stuck her with my wang
I hit it chicken style
I hit up in Meijer's in the home improvement aisle
She called me Bob Vila when I stuck it in the place
I tied her legs behind her head and kicked her in the face
I stuck her with my wang
I took some Elmer's glue
I slapped it on her titties and I stuck her to the roof
And when I came back, I opened up the door
Her titties were so long they was draggin on the floor
I stuck her with my wang
A little two on one
I told her call a friend over, we can have some fun
I heard her knock knock, I'm finna get some stank
I opened up the door
Hi, I'm Frank
I kicked him in his ass (He kicked him in his ass, yo)
I kicked him in his ass (He kicked him in his ass then we fucked him up)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, yo)
I kicked him in his ass (He kicked him in his ass then we fucked him up)
I stuck her with my wang
All kind of bitches, man
Ya know what I'm saying
Fat bitches, skinny bitches
Ugly bitches,
I stuck her with my wang
Bitches with hunchbacks
Bald-headed bitches
Motherfuckin
Nasty motherfuckin noodle-stank booty-wack bitches

Take me back home to my gutter, and that's where I wont ever leave
Again!

Hey! I'm comin home, home to the criminals and crooks,
Home to the gangbangers shootin dirty looks.
Home to the killer cops beatin down my ass,
Home to my '72 vallary prayin it will last.
Past all the rich bitches tryna play me out.
Doggin on my neighborhood, don't know what it's about.
So now I'm clockin nuggets, never hangin with the rich.
Id rather hang out with the crookeds at the party store, bitch!
Gimme coney, dawg, with a little smog,
Cuz it tastes better than the poisonous fog.
Seen it from the sewers in my slummy neighborhood.
But the ghetto got love and the love is all good
So I don't give a fuck about your mansion by the lake.
You can suck my dingaling until your neck breaks.
Cuz all I wanna do is hang with the zombies in the zone.
Break out with the faygo. I'm comin home.

[Chorus:]:
Home to the creatures, home to the crooks,
Home to the fools readin witchcraft books,
Home to the monsters roamin the land,
I wanna come home but ya don't understand.

Bitch, I'm comin home, and I'm not alone.
Jokers and freaks and the dead body bones.
Every single thing that ya never wanna see,
Add it all together and ya got me!
Ah, nobody give a fuck about your punk ass rules.
Keystone coppers and your hypocrite schools.
Id much rather lay around the streets and the gutter,
And make dirty phone calls to your rich mother.
Put up last midnight and I'm wakin up the dead.
And we playin kickball with sombodys head.
We go skinny-dippin in the barrels of toxic waste,
After that, I pour myself a little taste.
So tell your mother that she's nothin but a fat bitch,
And all my homies don't care if the hoes rich.
Somebody out here, please let me know if there's a phone,
I need to call my mother, and tell her I'm comin home.

[Chorus:]

I'm comin home. Chicken, chicken bone.
Sugar plumb wishes and ice cream cones.
All these fake people sayin hi to one another.
Then they sit around and talk shit about each other.
Watering the grass, diggin in they ass,
Tryna make sure they didn't lose any cash.
Workin hard all you life, and now you're finally rich.
But look at you, you're just another whack bitch! Heh.
Call in the slum, that's where the bums,
Murderers, and slaughterers. So that's what I become.
Spare a little change, cuz I just ran outta gas,
Reach for your quarter and I'll stick your fuckin ass.
Nobody wants to be around the ghetto breed.
The ghetto got each other, and that's all we really need.
So what the fuck I'm doin down here? I got a land of my own,
Hey, yo, dawg, fuck it, we goin home.

In funky ass gas station toilets
And if I was a Serial Killer
I would be strange and deranged
And I would never change
If I was a Serial Killer
I'd be known as the smoker
Cause I'd cut off and smoke all they hair
And if I was a Serial Killer
I would sleep on broken glass and thumbtacks
And I would smoke mad crack

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
First thing I would do is kill a couple hotties
They'd always get some mustard up decapitated bodies
Dumped on State police law just before dawn
To let em know my ritual had begun
I'd crack a 40 with the devil tell him dig me a hole
Cause I'm coming when I die until them I'm in control
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I aint
But if I was I'd do my walls all blood red with blood paint
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I aint
But if I was I'd never stop cause I know I can't

If I was a Serial Killer
I would drive a black van
And I would ride around on college campus
And if I was a Serial Killer
I would walk among us and gain trust
Until I needed that rush

I'd park outside these bitches homes and then drive away
Then come back with my lights off this time I'm here to stay
I'd wear human bones around my neck and have my ceremonies
Then go back upstairs and microwave some macaronis
You know what's all up in my trunk
So don't ask me to pop it
Once I get out to my cabin
Then I'll finally unlock it
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I'm not
But if I was I'd snap a photo once they died on the spot
This is if I was a Serial Killer and though I'm not
But if I was I'd know that I can't so I would never stop

And I don't know myself anymore
(and I don't know who I am anymore)
And I don't know who to be anymore

Except that I am strange and deranged

Thank God,
Many people think I'm odd
But I talk with no one,
And I walk alone, and I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
I get home and don't say hi,
It aint no onw there,
I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs
To my room
Get in bed and just wait for dark cause that's when the real show starts (tap tap)
'tap tap' on the glass go the piece of ass'
So young and pretty its too bad she past
But she comes to my room and we talk at night, she's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight
In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone, and I kiss her cold lips until morning comes
Then she gone,
I can still hear her voice loom.
But she only exists in the dark of my room

[chorus: x2]

Love...
(i can't ignore you)
In my room
(do anything for you)
Love...
(i do adore you)
In My Room...
You and I

I try to smile alot, but I'm always frontin, but I do love a ghost and atleast that's something.
She don't talk much,
When she do it get cold,
Usually we just lay there and we hold each other, we're lovers we don't need others,
One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
And it scared my baby guess she don't like pets so I twisted its fuckin head off at the neck
Look baby,
Its gone its doomed please come back to the room I do anything for thy, don't ignore me this is more than a sick love story
W/o you id bring a shotgun to school and I will if you want me to for any reason
I hate that you leave when the lights come on and if I had it my way the fuckin sun would be gone!

[chorus x2]

Sometimes I kiss her and I start shakin, she slips me the tongue and it taste like bacon.
Uh oh somethings wrong baby's upset
She told me she was spotted by the neigbors kid
She can't come back now cause they know our secret
Uless I can make thenm keep it.
If I do she may come to life now in their yard with a shotgun and knife
Cut the screen
Went in and found the kid
Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head, the daddy was nextrunnin down the hall, I shredded his throat and he was
Quick to fall, tossed themossberg and gripped the knife, started stabin the shit out of his wife,
Went home a bloody mess with a job well done.
Wash up and wait for my baby to come

 I'm the redneck in the moshpit
 2 axes come in handy
 to answer Violent J, ya damn right its a stanley
 in the shadows of the dark with darkman like spawn
 in the dash blazin it up with explosive bombs
 I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM
 while zipping bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM
 ice mixed with blood is the killers milkshake
 here with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathbreak

 (Chorus)
 Disrespect me I'll run in your house
 like puffin steam stout
 break both your arms, gun in your mouth
 knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth
 bullets bust through the back of your head ya die swift
 fuckin wit tha clan, watch what you say
 we kill *Beep: Lame Lyric Censor*
 shoot you with an SK or a AK bitch you gonna die either way
 I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head
 cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead
 catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho
 and crack your skull with a bottle of Mo
 I'm a Sing-Sing killer
 gun groove captain
 brooklyn home of the original gun clapping
 gats get brung, niggas get done
 sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons
 I'm a killer

 (Chorus)
 (Screams)
 OVERDUB: To die is a fate that must come to us all
 But how horrible to be buried alive
 from the darkness they shuffle eyes glazed with death
 hands clawing for blood!

Insane Clown Posse,Intro,/i/insane+clown+posse/intro_10144765.html,"To all that are receiving this broadcast, we are now entering the
Thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage
This ongoing event has now been upgraded to a national emergency
It has been a sleepless night past Metro Detroit as panic and terror

Has swept the streets it seems much of Detroit as well as
The rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable
Cloud that still clutches the sky from New York to Honolulu
Miami to Fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided

But a wall of darkness and artificial night still grips the land
Witnesses now tell us thousands upon thousands of people
Are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are painted
And and and they look like clowns

The people are running and screaming but eye witnesses say
They're not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy has overtaken them
At this time we do not know where or why the people are running
But there seems to be an organized plan directing there action

It's like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina
The immense crowd of clowns are now on the move all in unison
Moving in one direction towards an unknown destination
Almost as if they see what others cannot heeding an inaudible call
That silently pierces this calm before the storm"

The signs are everywhere!

Violent J:
Holy f-ck it's hot outside, extra hot
The sun is closer then it's ever got
The sky's polluted, it's raining crud
Pandemonium throughout the hood
Every hour the planet shakes
Buildings collapse from the earthquakes
Freeways are packed, horns are blowing
Nobody really knowing where the f-ck they're going

Tidal waves swallowing the shores
Coffins pushing up through your floors
It's suddenly freezing, we fall to peices
Pray for allah and call to Jesus
Some stay home and hold their wives
Others flip out and end their lives
Me, I climb the roof of my house
Spread my arms out, and sing

It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]

Huh, walking along my path
The city has morphed into a blood bath
Some are looting, others shooting
The devil's in the sky and he's recruiting

Tornados twisting through downtown
Throwing buses and trucks around
It's snowing, hailing, and burning up
I rock my headphones and turn'em up
Folks dying, crying, dead and crawlin
Run to the curch, can't fit 'em all in
Watch the groundscape crack in half
A bottemless pit down Gratiot ave
Some stay home and welcome death
Appreciating each additional breath
Me, I climb the roof of my house
Spread my arms out, and sing

It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]

Fire, Ice, Lava, Winds
Hurricanes, Earthquakes
Taking it all in (Boom! Pow!) [x3]

Acid rain, lighting, sin
Earth shattering
Taking it all in (Boom! Pow!) [x2]

Boulders f-cking fall from the sky
Death with no clue when or why
The sun explodes and we absorb it
Our planet spins right out of orbit
Aliens show up and eat mankind
A virus spreads with no cure to find
God has had enough of our shit
A nuclear war breaks out and that's it

To be on this planet living your life
To see it all end would be alright
You can't complain, you wouldn't die alone
You can die with loved ones and die at home
And you're not missing anything when you're gone
Plus seeing it all end and what goes on
To see this great world come to an end
Would be the next best to seeing it begin

It's all over! (Here we go, in the air we go) [x2]

Explosions!
Corrosion!
Burnt up and frozen!

On tv, they make them try to hide their shit
But real Juggalos always bear the hatchet

And all the fresh titty bars dj's with mullets

But don't get excited thinking makes you a Juggalo

And then shit it out and screw it back into place
If you don't think so you can suck my bone

Well I like to hang with Tall Jess and Jump Steady
Nate The Mack , Violent J and Uncle Fredy
Chunky Mutha Fucky and Scott got my respect

And I fucked the Lion Lady in the neden hole
And sometime she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts
And it feels so good
So tell your boys that they all a bunch of jump suckers
I walk around your neighborhood chokin motherfuckers

Jacob tells me ""climb the ladder and jump off""
""Head first on the street, don't worry, it's soft""
So I jump, thump, I'm on a gurney
Jacob laughs at me ""your so fuckin' nerdy""
Fuck him, I hate him, I can't escape him!
I finally get alone, he calls me on the telephone
""Brrb"" ""is Violent J there?"" here ""hey it's Jacob!""
""I want you to piss in your underware, ok bud?""
Sure, I'm pissin' now, it fuckin' tickles
Jacobs dissin' again, I hear his giggles
After I cut all my fingers of for that mother fucker
I've finally had enough
Go see a doctor, Doc, hello
""Hi, have a seat, let's see umm... What is it.. Joe?
Yeah, Joe Bruce, my friends call my Chucky ""Chucky?""
Either that or Bucky, fuck Me!!
I'm sorry Doc, it's Jacob again, my name's J
""Tell me J, who's this Jacob anyway?""
I fucking want him dead, it's a voice in my head
I gotta lotta voices, but this one's mislead
He tells me to drink toilet water an shit
""Do you do it?"" No.. Yes!!
I can't help it though, I can't stop it
""J..what I want you to do is drop it"" Drop what?"

Is it the end of the world?
Yes, it is the end of the world
And it's also the beginning
The beginning of a brand new saga

Blaze Ya Dead Homie:
I gots love for my homies, members of the Lotus
United we stand, squashing all deadly forces
Been to hell, could of spent eternity there
All the bad shit I've done, I should still be there
Juggalos can ya feel me, feel me, worldwide, worldwide
Running with the hatchet straight out the Lotus Pod
Always got your back till the end screaming juggalos
Dark lotus, psychopathic that's the way you go
Monoxide Child:
So many people in the matrix die alone, hey
Not me, my soul belongs to juggalos, they
Keep me going when I'm down and out
I pick the phone up drop them a line and here them shout
Saying Twiztid is the shit, and I'm down with the clown
Dark Lotus for life until I'm dead in the ground!
I give a dap to all my homies and killaz who get it started
All my juggalos always represent for the departed
Chorus:
Mass murder makes me happy!
Dead bodies make me happy!
Say what you will of me
I'll always have juggalo family!

Dead bodies make me happy!

I'll always have juggalo family!

6 individual pedals formed from 1 stem
Who try to run away and not follow any trends, no friends
Cause we accend from the dirt, filth, grit, and grime
And combine Juggalo minds to crush Mason shrines
What's yours is mine it was mines is yours
Let the wagons of the Dark Carnival show you different worlds
Any hoes front a juggalos or the hatchet
Tell them to come suck on your dick, we psychopathic!
Jamie Madrox:
All my life I've been living it all alone
I'm like a king with no people and no crown or a throne
And what I'm speaking on is what I'm feeling like
Do you know what it feels like to feel the warmth of the sunlight
I'd really like to know cause I've been chilling in the dark
For so many years that I question love in my heart
And I hate everyone, and I hate everything
Except for all the juggalos and the love that they bring!
[Chorus:]

Let me get your ear and make myself clear
It's the L Family Juggalos right here
You can take away my mic you can take away this life
But this love we got ain't never gonna stop
We eternal, pass the earthly bullshit
Dogs on another level can you feel this
It's Twisted, Blaze and icp,
And if you're fuckin with my dogs then you D-I-E!
Violent J:
If it wasn't for Shaggy my shirt would still be baggy
I wouldn't be fat, I'd still be hungry and crabby
We used to buy our own records at the stores
So they would think it's a hot seller, and order more
But we built a team of same killers with the same dream
But we couldn't reach the top, we'd stay B level like Charlie Sheen
Finally realized we will always have the juggalos
I'll never give another second, to them other hoes!

To them distant ass relatives over in Ham dinner
If they miss you so much why don't they just call a (motherfucker)
If you wasn't blood, would you still have love?
Or infact does the blood make you think you have to love?
Look I probably love my family more then anybody here
But my homies are family too Third cousins get outta here

Who was you tripping with when you did them mushrooms?
Who the fuck threw up all over your car?
And then felt worse then you about that shit in the morning? (Friends ya'll)

And now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft

In the mirror, I see the face of Frankenstein
An' that face is mine

I go to work at Subway, slicin' ham
Cut my finger off again
I walk home, tryin' to dodge an' hide from thugs
They like to beat on scrubs

I go through this all the time though, I call
J, where the fuck you at? The mall
Did you get your ass stomped again?
No, yes, haha, so?

Nobody sees what I see, do they?

I could derail a fuckin' train with my forehead
I now live by the Carnival dominion
So Motherfuck your opinion

I'm a loony path, I kill pedestrians
Families, neighbors, best of friends, anybody
An' if I don't kill 'em, I keep 'em
In my basement an' drill 'em dead

Just kiddin'
All I really did is unlock the forbidden
I just let my fuckin' mind unwind
I don't care what you think, you don't intertwine

Fuck the world, fuck everybody in it
Even the Sneaker Pimps girl, I'd fuck her in a minute
You can live to impress an' dress fresh, bitch
I don't care, fuck everybody out there

Rydas, loonies, stalkers, fat mans
Gangstas, nymphos, crackheads, assholes

I smoke peace pipes with Indian war chiefs
I steal jewels with Chinese ninja thieves
I dress well like yuppies an' crush walls
I throw giant ice bergs like snowballs

I surf tidal waves, drink molten rock
I'll put a fuckin' tornado in a headlock
I'll go to Italy an' straighten that tower

Here I go again, another day
Dealin' with these motherfuckin' idiots at Subway
It's okay 'cause now I see behind it
An' I keep myself reminded

None of these robots, 9 to 5 puppets, that I see
Are any better than me, motherfucka

But if you a sewer skank, let me hit dat
'Cuz I'm Violent J, ain't even one to fake it
I wanna see some folded up skank bitches naked

I pass out when it gets dark
And woke up naked at the Clark Park
Gotta go, gotta get before I get the wrap
Gotta chopped off head, chilling in my lap

Knife to the neck and got some more

But after you leave, I'ma stalk ya
If you're a little kid, I'ma take ya
And if you're neck, I'ma break ya

Willy, Willy, watch your mouth
And fuck the south

Running with a gang of twenty street hoods, yo
What's up, bitch, ah, what's up, ho?
Sometimes you act like you ain't down
With a psychotic wicked clown

Fucking my friends ain't healthy
'Cuz I grab you by the face and fuck you up
And it's like that bitch, that's the way it is
I'm allowed to fuck, ho, I'm in show biz

Sets in the hood want me for dead
So I paint my tag on they forehead
Stick your little 'kay by my tagging'
You can fit twenty clowns in a Volkswagen

And we coming straight to your brick house
I'ma huff and puff and blow your fucking neck loose
And then I might mug ya
'Cuz they're will be no fucking with the Juggla

Juggling eyeballs, juggling heads
What you've heard about, what you've read
The juggling wicked clowns will come
To your birthday party, wedding and bar mitzvah
And cut your back off for a small fee
The Juggla ain't taking no shorts from nobody

Tweedle-dee and tweedle-doh
Let the fucking bass go

And the Juggla make it last
Down with 2 Dope and try and get trashed
My fellow fucking fellas
Southwest gangster killas

Violent J, the psychopathic
Some might say I'm schizofrantic
Others think I'm quite the psychic
But somehow the bitches like it

What's up, bitch? Let me get the shot
Right here and now, butt-naked on the spot
Why am I like this, like that?
Why are you like that, like this?

The ghetto took my brain
And Motherfuck, I want it back
I'm that nerd in the back of the class
That went psycho and killed your ass
I slash and cut and hack
With a 'Kick me' sign on my back

In my corner is scyne therapy
They take care of me but don't stare at me
'Cuz like I said I'll mug ya
Now run on home and don't fuck with the Juggla

Finally happened, the wicked clown has come to your town
And he's got your daughter by the hand
Showing her a new land, the southwest ghetto zone
Where all the Jugglas roam, come one, come all
And have the Juggla cut your face off, skip to the lou

Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts
Here they come, nope, wasn't them
Seems like the same car's driving by again
It pulls up, ""hey man, you're outta luck""

Rapper dies of aids but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend

He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown, who says, woman love his s*** smile
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon
Sharon, what's your question?

Contestant number one, I believe first impressions last forever
So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house
And have dinner with me and my family
Tell me what you would do to make that first impression really stick

(Violent J)
Let's see, hmm, well, I'd have to think about it
I might show up in a tux, ha!, but I doubt it
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do
And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, fuck you!!!
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, Get the food ready!
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this
You know for only thirteen, she got some big tits
After that, your dad will try to jump again
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware
I'd try fuck her till I nut in my underwear

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick
He sits on his bench and get's all the respect
But if I get a chance, I'm going straight for the neck
He walked in the room, and everybody rose
Lopped off bucket chilling underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit
But what this piggy don't know
Is he's about to get his neck wet
Now I seen the bailiff, I'm thinking what the fuck?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid
Will pick it up
Old-ass man, I let him get away
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case
His eyes are blood red with a wicked looking face
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die
So I racked on the bucket, made it fucking rain pork rinds

[Chorus:]
Three little piggies to make that piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (no!)
I might choose an ax (yes!)
The Carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks

My axe is my buddy, I bring him when I walk
Me and my axe will leave your head outlined in chalk
My axe is my buddy, he always makes me laugh
Me and my axe cut bigot spinal cords in half
My axe is my buddy, and when I wind him back
Me and my axe will give your forehead a buttcrack
My axe is my buddy, I never leave without him
Me and my axe will leave your neck a bloody fountain

(Chorus 2x)
Everybody everybody everybody run
Murdering murdering murdering fun
Swing swing swing
Chop chop chop
Swing swing swing
Chop chop chop

My axe is my buddy, we right the planet's wrongs
Me and my axe leave bigots dead on richie lawns
My axe is my buddy, he never makes me cry
Me and my axe will leave a divot for your eye

You know Jamie Madrox rapped about something like this,
only I never really thought about how horrible it really is,
laying in a coffin, in the pitch black dark,
The only sound being that of my heart if I'm alive.
But I've got no pulse or even breath for days,
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze,
But I do recall my funeral, them lowering me in,
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in.
I tried to move my fingers or somethin, got nothin,
But dirt hitting the top from them shoveling, n I'm fucked.
It's been at least two weeks but I don't keep time,
I just lay here motionless in this rotting body of mine,
I tried fantasy realms and dreaming my way out,
It only leads to mind panicing and torturing thoughts about running and breathing
will it ever really happen again?
Please God, heaven or hell just let something begin

And I don't have no where to be
Just another street hood in the inner city
And a man is gonna ask for some change
Give him a dollar, so he can go and fry his brain
Fuck no, I push him out the way
Cuz that sad motherfucker got shit to say
My homie was known for the mackin
Now they got him doing 10 for car jackin
And I'm thinkin that I'm next to go
What the fuck I already live on death row
So many out there want me
Everybody wants to put a bullet in my head
But I don't give a fuck if I die today
Everyone alive is gonna die anyway
What the fuck is life about
Come home late and daddy blow your mouth out
That's in the past now, I aint soft
Daddy hits me today and I'm a blow his fuckin head off
For now the bullets close but miss
Livin my life at a risk
You know, j, man, you're right
Too many motherfuckers out there are fake
People need to understand
That if you get hit enough times
Then you start hitting back
All we are are pawns in the game board
And if this is the way everyones playin it
So be it, motherfuckers
Count us in
But the icp is playin for keeps
Mackin is a game and everybodys playin
Are you the one gettin played like a sucker
I think I liked it better when I was a kid"

I hit it so quick, I made her butt-cheeks clap
Why wait around till she gets married
'Cause I'm ready as long as the neden's hairy

Tootsie-tootsie pumpkin pie, oops
Looks like you got nut in your eye
My fault, I didn't notice, you was still there
Now go and wash that shit out your hair, bitch
I want a girl not afraid to bone
Even if her momma's and pop's still home
And if her daddy suddenly walks in
He just might see me my nuts on his daughter's chin

Everybody in the hood says that you're easy
You look a little cracked out, a little sleasy
You're a basehead, baby, it ain't shit

That just makes the bitches melt, only on wluv

Hello, baby, I was thinking about you
So I wrote this song
I like to dedicate this to the love
That has expressed from you and I
So just sit back and enjoy

Eh, yo, bitch, come over here and let me kick it to ya
Tried to stick my nuts in ya then I never knew ya
'Cuz your ugly and you know you can't hide that
So what you look like a chicken with a hunchback

Oh, it doesn't matter that you from down South
If you talk like it, I'm a smack you in your mouth
Bitch, I admit it, I'm quick to hit a woman, hey
But that's okay, 'cuz bitch, I'm Violent J

And I'm a Southwest mack daddy juggalo
And you're nothing but a two-bit stankin' ho
But I love you and I hope you realize that
I don't care about the hair growing out your back

Smoking that blunt, drink some Mad Dog through the night
And your ugly bitch turns into Karen White
And I stick my wing-wang in the middle
I like a filthy-ass ho, the kind that make your nuts shrivle

Bitch, I'm knocking at your door

I guess you want me to take you on a big date
But what you're saying don't sound all that straight
All I wanna do is feel your butt and squeeze your titties
'Cuz I can't feed your fat ass on a buck fifty

Let's make love my sweet little dove
I wouldn't get near that neden without a glove
'Cuz it's rats and spiders up in there
Hittin' that'll take the curl out your nut hairs

I smack your tittie and claps when it hits the other
But I don't want 'em clappin' too loud it'll wake your mother
Bitches always front like they don't wanna let you hit
But then they always screamin' banshees when you gettin' with it

So don't fake the funk, I'm nothing but a ghetto punk
All I'm trying to do is stick you in your fat rump
So get the fuck out them dirty-ass drawers
And come and twist my balls 'cuz I love you

I wanna hit that neden so damn hard
Let my nuts bang on your anus
That's my only true desire
I feel for you, I think for you, I breathe for you

All I want is a little neden
Ya know, everyday when the wind blows
All I hear is my nuts flapping against your booty, ho

Reaching just above me , I see my pillow's there
But yet I have no head, my head is on the chair
I'm staing at my body, I look as if I'm weak
So give me back my soul, my body you can keep
Sitting on my lawn, tt's just before dawn
I listen to the screaming, another life is gone
I'm playing with the children, children of the dead
My mother say's their evil, my daddy he gives a shit
Their eyeballs are bloody, their skin is ever pale
Their askin me to follow, I shall, I shall
They dress me as a clown, I'm screamin as a loon

I'm starin at you sleepin through your window like a stalker
I'm taping on the glass, I lick it with my tongue
I notice that the house is vacant, I'm starin at no one

They tell me I'll have wings if I let them peck my eyes

I plat my little seed, and slowly she will spurt
And now she is a tree, I hear the heart pound
I take her in my arems, and we make love to the sound

Carrying the demons soring with the hearts
I put it in my body, the wind will bring the rain
Only lay it's demon egg, deep inside my brain

My daddy's tried to kill me ever since I was a tot
By poisoning my bottle, I feed it to my friend
'cause if he dies my buddy our friendship will never end

It's singing lullabies, and stringing on the harp

Aqui tenemos de todo

Aqui en mexico! (mexican cry)

Mexico city (city)
A place you can go
And live your life in the low
Mexico city (city)
A place where you can hide
And everything will be tight

They want me on a murder rap which violates my probations
Aint no fucking way I'm staying here with what I'm facing
Sold my car to a junk yard
And bought a one-way bus ride
Take me across the border i'll coooool out and hide
After 80 wicked hours of stale they hit the last stop
Threw me out the bus left me standing there hasta
Turned and started walking tell me what is there to see
Everything was all in spanish but the sign ""Welcome to Mexico City""

Mexico city (city)
A place you can go
And live your life in the low (ok)
Mexico city (city)
A place where you can hide
And everything will be tight (alright)

Maybe I can fetch a job, find a wife and start a family
In M-E-X-I-C-O C-I-T-Y
Maybe I can learn spanish cause nobody is understanding me
In M-E-X-I-C-O C-I-T-Y
Maybe I can get a place, settle down and try to blend in
In M-E-X-I-C-O C-I-T-Y
Maybe I can just relax, be myself and quit pretending
In M-E-X-I-C-O C-I-T-Y

You can say harbor bay or south monterey
Even islands off the map within their dead sea passageways
Don't fucking matter man from pakistan to chuck E. Cheeses
From the ramada in granada I do far as the equater reaches
Virginia beaches, saskastun, cancoon, the blue lagoon, from desert sanddunes metropolis is
To the boones
From pueblo north cakalaki back to waikiki
They searchin high and low for me
But I'm in Mexico City

Mexico city (city)
A place you can go
And live your life in the low (ok)
Mexico city (city)
A place where you can hide
And everything will be tight (alright)"
Insane Clown Posse,Miracles,/i/insane+clown+posse/miracles_20873099.html,"If magic is all we've ever know
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
And I see miracles everyday
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
And a million stars way above em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
And everything chilling underwater, please
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
Long neck giraffes, and pet cats and dogs
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equals
Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
The sun and the moon, and even Mars
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
ufos, a river flows
Plant a little seed and nature grows
Niagara falls and the pyramids
Everything you believed in as kids
fucking rainbows after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
I fed a fish to a pelican at (Friscal?) bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away
And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen

Music is all magic
(Are you a believer in miracles)
You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)
It's just there in the air
(Are you a believer in miracles)
Pure motherfucking magic
Right?
This shit'll blow your fucking mind
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)

Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
And it fills the room, from the floor to the ceiling
I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding
Water, fire, air and dirt
fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
And I love my mom for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
Miracles ain't nothing to lie
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
Miracles each and every where you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours for you to explore
There's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
To witness that without explanation
Take a look at this fine creation
And enjoy it better with appreciation
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
To ignore the miracles of every day

(Are you a believer in miracles)
Magic everywhere in this bitch
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)
It's all around you, you don't even know it
(Are you a believer in miracles)
Shit's crazy
(Do you notice and recognize miracles,
So many miracles, the magic miracles)

Are you a believer in miracles
Do you have time for the miracles
Do you notice and recognize miracles
So many miracles, the magic miracles
Are you a believer in miracles
Do you have time for the miracles
Do you notice and recognize miracles
So many miracles, the magic miracles
Are you a believer in miracles
Do you have time for the miracles
Do you notice and recognize miracles
So many miracles, the magic miracles

I Love you, I love you
Kill you, must kill you
Must kill you, must Kill you

I'm kind of fat and I sweat a lot
But that's the only bad quirky dinks I got
That and maybe the whole murdering aspect
But we needn't really got to that yet

I love people, I love everything about them
And that's why I gotta live life without them
I know it don't make any sense to you but fuck you
This songs about me exclusively

Murder, murderous, murderation
The murdering mentality without an explanation
I'm Mr. Happy and I ride a bike
I ain't got a seat, I just sit on the pipe thing

I whistle, I sing, I'll pet your poodle
I'll twist and squeeze your neck like a wet noodle
'Cause I'm so happy, I'll stab your ass
And lay down next to you dead on the grass
And sing, ooh, it feels so good every time I murder, I get happy

Happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest

Murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you

I love you, so hand me you neck
Let me teach you about love and respect
Respect the fact that I love to kill all
Wait a minute y'all I gotta take my pill
Zanoffs, it works, down to only three people a day

My victims, I give them love and care
I don't wanna get blood everywhere
I don't use a chainsaw or a butcher knife
That's son ninety's get it right

I never mutilate or chop my loves
All I really need is a pair of gloves
Or maybe a car, I'll run 'em down wit it
I know that can be messy but the birds will get it

Don't you see that I love you
I'm Mr. Happy, I'm all about fun
Now get into the pit and try to kill someone
Ooh, it feel so good every time I murder, I get happy

Happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest

Murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you

My bike has a basket full of strawberries
I picked them myself along with apples and cherries
And lemons and oranges and boogers and limes
Plus there's a faygo in there but that's mine

Red flowers like after your dead
I plant seeds and grow 'em out, the side of your head
I got flowers all over the back yard
In the form of a jokers card

Uh, oh, feels good
I'm like the chuckle of my neighborhood
I'm one of them midnight creeps at dennys
Talking to myself and lickin' my pennys

I got a french fry hangin' out of my beard
Don't go near that guy, he's weird
You know I'm all good and everythings all right
When you hear this scream in the middle of the night
Like this, ooh, it feel so good every time I murder, I get happy

Happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest
I'm happy, happy, happiest

Murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you
I'll murder, murder, murder you

Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit
Nobody even notices I'm here cuz I ain't shit
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying
Sweat is on my forehead cuz my brain's inside decaying
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her
Something's happening but it isn't very clear
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall
Some are yelling "" sick"" and the others stop and stare
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere
See, my head is spinning cuz I'm lonely and I'm twisted
But I have a secret everybody missed it
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag

I wish somebody knew me cuz then they could say I'm wrong
But since nobody knows me I got it going on
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock
I guess I'm just a ghost cuz everybody walks through me
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move
A dead body rotting in the back of the room
For weeks and months, stinking up the class
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash
I can hear the teacher man talking about columbus
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell
But I have a key, it's called insanity
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag

"" okay, today we're gonna learn about a great freedom. If you'll turn
Your textbooks to chapter four we'll get started. America's the
Land of the free, we all live together in the same wealthy community
And we are alternate equals. Yes?""
"" man, mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""
"" uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now.""

No, they can sit and front about it all day
But I left his fucking body in the hallway
And in the morning they opened up the door
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard
I could chop my arms off and run around the class
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast
Cuz they'd rather learn about redneck chicker
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter
Fuck washington, benjamin, fuck em all ah
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out
And the class wanna know who could it be
But I'm like dewey boodie, you ain't never heard of me
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag

I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker mr. Johnson anyway

Forks up, forks down, man, forks sideways

Swung on his pipe once again for the road
Hold up, dawg, uh! This shit gets old
Now I walk the streets with a shattered skull
I'm gonna swing my axe to his jaw
Where the motherfucker at? Where the motherfucker stay?
How ya gonna fuck with the juggla jay-ay-ay

Pops opened up... Pops hit the floor

First I plan my escape
Nothing on papes and leave the scene without a trace
I'm lookin dead in her face
But she don't see me
I'm unnoticed
I head straight to her bedroom window for better focus
Hokus pokus
I see the doors unlocked, I let myself in
Head for her room, with plans of murder and mayhem
There she go, there that bitch lay
Living on this earth to my dismay
Time to pay
Palms are sweaty, I'm about to vomit
I grab the knife out of my belt and jab it in her stomach
Again, and again and now she's screaming like I care
But I could give a fuck less
Before she dies I grab her by her blood soaked hair
And tell her s***s gonna be alright on my end
I'm glad it happened this way
Back in my daughters life again
Aint it a shame that it came to this
Life goes on except for one less bitch
Aint it a trip?

It was tuesday, december 24th 97
Time on the clock 1: 11
Thinking bout sending somebody to heaven
Or the crossroads
A fate of a soul lies in my hands I suppose
Now I'm wearing dark clothes
Parked on the side street
Peepin out the scenery
Make sure nobody seeing me
As I move to the trunk of the stolen car
Up to the back door with the crow bar
So far the plans fool proof
Called from the phone booth
Got the message machine
Nobodys on the scene
Kicked in the backdoor, 1: 34
Looking for the family dog thor
Kicked em in the jaw with the work boots
Knocked a couple teeth loose
Smacked em in the mouth with my empty deuce deuce
Then I smile
Break his neck and watch him piss on kitchen tile
Never liked him since the day he tried to play me vile,
And tried to bite me
Stab a steak knife in his head
So much for that mans best friend
Now I'm all up in the place and
In the bedroom masturbating
Cummin on the sheets and pillow cases
Fuck that bitch
Shes just a c*** and her mothers nothing but a s***
Can't wait to seal her mouth shut
2: 30 she returns home from work
Nice blouse, tight shirt
Business attire for this hooker for hire
Threw the keys to the table, said baby are you home
Didn't expect to see bones were alone
And she's reaching for the telephone to call the police
Strangled with the chord, now deceased
In the process of her suffocation
Finger fucked her for demonstration
Let her know I know her many faces
Now she's dead in the closet
Hangin out with all the winter clothes
In the struggle suffered a bloody nose
But I'm straight though
As I move to the bathroom to wash my hands
Its all part of the plan
Don't think you understand see?
Murder, murder, murder
You never heard of redrum in reverse
Bodies in the hearse
Now your lifes gone cause we wanted you to die
Time to kiss your ass good bye
Don't ask why"

Bodies draggin' from my truck, driven by a bigot fuck
Why you think the heavens cry, acid rain and blizzard skys
Ain't no coverin' the tracks, that's why I'm here and oh yes

Car broke down on a drive through the ghetto
All the weird people, you gotta get the fuck out
Need to use the phone, step into my funhouse
Hey yo, dope, looks like we got another
He'd like to go for a ride on the neck cutter
Straight to the cart for the next spectacular
Just to know, it's a dead body sittin' next to ya

Get ready for the carnival thrills
Should of cut your little faggot ass in the hills
Boom, through the door into the room, you gotta check it out
It's where we cut your fingers off and stick 'em in your mouth
That should show you that you greedy little rich fuck
If you're bucking with the juggla you're a dead duck
Eight fingers in your mouth and two sticking out your nose
Further down the hall, the room with jokeros

That's where you get by seventeen wicked clowns
For the seventeen dead bodies never found
And they jump on your back until your ribs crack
Toss you in the cart and push you down the deli tracks
Spinning and twisting, rolling and bumping
The dead fuck next to ya is trying to tell ya somethin'
Listen close, you can barely make it out
""Bitch, you ain't shit in my electric funhouse""

""Help me, I'm trapped in here, somebody let me out
Oh my God, ahh""

""Come here, rich boy
My head is spinning 360 degrees
Richie, richie, richie
Come here""

""Bitch, fuck you, yeah, know what I'm saying
Wicked clowns running the funhouse
Ain't no way to get out until the killer
Gets your neck cut like a man""

Pick a card, any card, any motherfucking card, a joker's card
Sorry, bitch, the luck of the draw
Violent J's gonna have to ice your jaw
Snap, bang, snip, boom
Send that motherfucker off to the next room
Crash through the doors on the windy spinny trail
Through a loop-de-loop and into a big nail
Straight through his left eye and out the back of his head, is he dead?

No, 'cuz he has to go to the next phase
It's the room of giggles because of your ways
You like to sit and laugh at people when they suffer
Well, now you sit and watch me laugh when I stick your mother
It's the funhouse, bitch, everything's funny
You act like whipping on your ass, ain't funny?
And the ride of your life only gets faster
Off to the r-r-ringmaster

I take my bobo gun and blow your fuckin' mouth in
Eh, yo, the next room, it's called the chicken pen
And it's a little tribute to the bigots of the south
We take a dead chicken, shove it in your mouth
And we stuff it down your throat with a pitchfork
'Cuz you're a big gut, that's what you get for it
Now I take your sorry ass and I throw you out
'Cuz I don't need your dead body stinkin' up my funhouse
Funhouse, stinkin' up my funhaugh"

[Host]
""Let's meet contestant number one
He's a schizophrenic serial killer clown
Who says, ""women love his sexy smile""
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon
Sharon, what's your question? ""

[Sharon]
""Contestant number one
I believe first impressions last forever
So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house
And have dinner with me and my family
Tell me what you would do to make
That first impression really stick""

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it
I might show up in a tux, ha!, but I doubt it
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do
And look your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!""
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this
You know for only 13, she got some big tits
After that, your dad will try to jump again
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware
I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear

[Host]
""Now, let's meet contestant number two
He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak
Who works for the Dark Carnival
He says women call him stretch nuts
Sharon, let's hear your question""

[Sharon]
""I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions
A man who expresses himself in his own special way
Number two, if you fell in love with me
Exactly how would you let me know? ""

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
First thing, I could never love you
You sound like a richie-bitch, yo, fuck you!!!
But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care
By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here
I'd go through your phone book and whack em all
And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!)
Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay
I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day
I'd grab your titties and stretch em down past your waist
Let em go, and watch em both spring up in your face
I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can
Get you naked, and hit it like a caveman!!!
When we go to the beach and walk through the sand
I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin
As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back
And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!

[Host]
""Well it sounds like contestant number two
Is just over-flowing with sensitivity, Sharon
It's a tough choice so far!
Sharon, let's have your last question and
See which one is going to win the rights to your neden""

[Sharon]
""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the
Same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would
Your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins! ""

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar
And tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are
I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake
And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Ricki Lake!

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick
I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick
And then to get your attention in the crowded place
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face

[Violent J]
Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better

[Violent J]
Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap
Shit, you don't want contestant number two. He's mad wack
I walk into a barn and there he was
Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it
It was a big fucking smelly-ass farm llama

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Damn dawg! How you gonna diss your momma?!"
Insane Clown Posse,Never Had It Made,/i/insane+clown+posse/never+had+it+made_20067610.html,"First I was born young and healthy
I told my mother one day I'd be wealthy
Can't forget my first day at school
Got stabbed in the head with a pencil but it's cool
Get my education, a job and a family, a good reputation

And what about grade two?
Got shot in the neck and the bullet went straight through
But I'm packing a textbook
Don't fuck with me 'cuz I'm going to grade three

Thank God it's lunch in a minute
Bit into my hot dog with a razor blade in it
And it cut my tongue off
But I know how to multiply so what's up, boss

Finally had to step out
I dropped out of school when they ripped my neck out
Who knows where the road led?
Seen a man with a briefcase and no head

So I'm like fuck that
Show me a quarter and an ounce of crack
And I'm straighter than a fucking light post
I sold a lot of crack but I bought the most

Now I'm a base head down on my luck
Roaming the streets and got hit by a Mack Truck
And thrown about a block
But I'm thinking nothing but gimme a rock

Holding my sign I'll work for crack
With my old-ass E. T. Shirt on my back
And I'm sleeping in the gutter
Right next to Jam Town's mother

I'm eating dead rats in the street
I keep on checking for my own heart beat
Now I'm weighing at a buck-o-five
Twitchy little neck and I'm barely alive

Got my first taste of life in hell
I ate a dead, shh, but don't tell
Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change?
I'll cut your face off and eat your brains

You know all about me
You act like you ain't seen penitentiary
Spitting and cussing and you know I'll piss
With these iron braces on my fucking wrists

And I'm heading for the slammer
Serial killer, all on the camera
First day, they broke my back
Next day, they broke my neck

Third day, they broke my leg
Fourth day, they broke my head
Swallowing kept on trucking
But there'll be no fucking

That's strictly for the soft
Seen a freak in a week and my nuts fell off
So I'm finna escape
How much shit can one club no take?

Stop, fool, stop or I'll fire
Shot me off and I fell in the razor wire
I'm all tangled up, cut, cut, cut, slit, slit, cut, cut
You don't love me, I really don't care

Tie my ass up in the electric chair
I got no family, I got no friends
I pray to God that my life ends
They thought that they had killed me

They took me to the morgue
I'm just a little stiff that's all, like a board
I lay there in my coffin, just chill and wait and chill
But then I jump out knife swinging all about

And motherfucking mother, mother, mother, motherfucking kill
I used to wonder what life's about
Until it chewed me up and spit me out
Your ghetto created a psycho nut
Not just psycho, psycho nut

Now I'm living in the walls of your house
And I'll die there and lay and rot like a dead mouse
I'm packing a sickle I'm on your roof and I'm playing the fiddle
You want me in a straight jacket

'Cuz when I see a throat, I'm a hack it
Where I'm at? What's my name?
Somehow, somewhere, I got hit by a train
And it ripped my legs off, uh, nothing but a minor coft

You can't get me I swing from a tree
Shouting and cussing and shooting at me
Everybody's end make two cents
A branch broke and I fell on a picket fence

I'm stuck and they're coming to get me
Rip myself off and I took my lungs with me
I'm stuffing them back in
Fuck! They won't go back in

Now my life's gettin' dense
'Cuz my heart's still beating
On a wooden fence
They shoot me up and down

Thinking, thinking, thinking clown
Wicked, wicked, wicked clown
You wanna know all about a wicked clown
I never had it made"

I throw a roundhose and knock his beard off his face
I tell him, ""Dad, now look at all your broken glass,
why don'tcha pick it all-up n' stick it in yer ass.""
I watch him do it, ""Now hurry up ya take fo'eva'.""

Cast out colorful shiny diamonds wonderful
I'm not the one that bullshit about the thunder though
We keep it juggalo
We underground and more
Rockin shows in my underwear
Never been the one to care
Spend every penny that we ever made on weed and beer
I make the rainest
But the joker cards is forever famous
But who can blame us

Insane Clown Posse,Ol Evil Eye,/i/insane+clown+posse/ol+evil+eye_20067683.html,"Start the movie
I loved the old man
He had never wronged me
He had never given me insult
For his gold I had no desire
I think it was his eye
Yes, it was this
One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture
A pale, blue eye with a film over it
Whenever it fell upon me
My blood ran cold
And so, by degrees, very gradually
I made up my mind
To take the life of the old man
And thus rid myself of the eye forever

So I'm headed door to door
With my grandmother's cookie jar
I'm sellin' cookies, twelve for a dollar
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any
I resort to goin' cheaper two for a penny
Anybody, everybody, they hate me
I can tell when they spit and degrade me
There's only one house left
The last on the block
Old man Willie on the hilltop
I ring the doorbell, the door creeps open
And there it was starin' and scopin'
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin'
I was trippin', ahh, see ya
I ran home, I couldn't stop thinkin'
About his eyeball winkin' and blinkin'
And it looked not a damn thing
Like the other ugh
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker
It hypnotized me, mesmerized me
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me
Creepers, where'd you get that ball
And tell me how it even fits in your skull
I want a big long knife to stick it in
I wanna lift up the eyelid and kick it in
He's gotta die
I want his eye buried in my backyard
It ain't hard, I'm killin' old evil eye

Evil eye, ohh
(bitch gonna die)
(bitch gonna die)
(Die, die, dee, dee, die, die for his eye)
Evil eye, ohh

Now this is the point
You fancy me mad
Madmen know nothing
But you should've seen me
You should have seen
How wisely I proceeded
With caution
With foresight
With patience I went to work
I was never kinder
To the old man
Than during the whole week
Before I killed him

A day gone pass since I heard about J. O.
Met up in this sleigh, 'cuz I don't fuckin' play
Anyway, I gotta do him in
Got a rusty revolver
Put the silver bullets in
I'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget
Down my drawers with the bucket
It's time to go, fuck it
I stuck it up to his neck
When he came to the door
I really didn't know what I was in for
First the cold man stared
No a gaze, no a stare
Kinda like there was no one there
How weird, my body froze
With the blink of his eye
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break
I gotta try to make my way to the gate
Wait, I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground
What? What the fuck was that?
I think I heard a sound
Turned around, there it was
Starin' at my face
This little old man's eye's
A make me a mental case
That's when I felt the pain deep inside
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide
I want a big long knife to stick it in
I wanna lift up his eyelid and kick it in
He's gotta die
I want his eye buried in my backyard
It ain't hard, I'm killin' old evil eye

Evil eye, ohh
(bitch gonna die)
(bitch gonna die)
(Die, die, dee, dee, die, die for his eye)
Evil eye, ohh

That night it ceased.
The old man was dead
I placed my hands on the heart
And there for many minutes
There was no pulsation
He was stone dead
His eye will trouble me no longer
His eye will trouble me no longer

Bitch gonna die
Bitch gonna die
Die, die, dee, dee, die, die for his eye
(Evil eye, ohh)
Bitch gonna die
Bitch gonna die
Die, die, dee, dee, die, die for his eye
(Evil eye, ohh)
Bitch gonna die
Bitch gonna die
Die, die, dee, dee, die, die for his eye
(Evil eye, ohh)
Bitch gonna die for his eye
Bitch gonna die
Die, die, dee, dee, die, die for his eye

I busted my nut early
She asked me for some mo' dick
And started sucking mo' dick
I said relax you freaky bitch and sit yo' ass up on it
Her momma's in the kitchen
Her daddy's watching the game
I got this bitch all knocking shit off of the shelves And screaming my name
Bitch you take this dick up
And pay me for that weed
You can't just smoke my shit up, get some dick, and tell me to leave
Your little sister's watching
I think that bitch is hot
I know she just a youngin' but I'm good for what she got
She peeping through the keyhole
I think she wants some peehole
I fucked that bitch in the butt, in the backseat of yo' daddy's Geo
I stole yo momma's vicodin
She just had surgery
But, I was so quick in and out of that purse
That bitch never heard of me
I would try fucking yo momma
But that bitch just so fat
I seen that bitch step on a one dollar bill and leave four quarters flat

Necks I'm slashing
Haul assing
Heads I'm smashing and crashing
Cause deaths my passion

Wicked shit never gets spun
That's why we get clever, get guns

Cause ain't nobody coming by the house giving free shit
So he gettin kinda skinny and my brother's almost dead
Got no other choice but for milk and bread
Stepped out the house for the first time in 2 years
Cause my neighborhood it ain't really good
Lay up in my bedroom night after night
I hear screams, zombies shootin and lootin
But now here I am and I'm walkin down Jefferson
With a bag of moneybacks I don't understand
How the world can be full of so many evil doer's
I can hear 'em underneath me in the sewers
Keep seeing shit out the corners of my eyes
Steady lookin over my back I didn't realize
Where I was goin
I didn't want to bother anybody
Accidentally stepped on a dead body
Hey motherfucker watch where the fuck you're goin (Sorry)
I might be dead, but I'll kick your ass
Now I apologized but he still had to talk shit
So I stepped over his face and kept walkin
And here's the part of my story that get's really scary
Had to walk alone down Military
I can see the crackhead's hiding in the trees
Lookin for some change
Lookin for some brains
Everything seemed too quiet as I walked down the block
Until I got hit in the head with a rock
Can't really tell I musta been out for quite awhile
Cause when I woke up my Nannycoat was outta style
And the crackhead's took my moneybacks in a dash
And ripped off my arm in the process
But fuck that shit I still gots another hand
So I can still get the shit for my little man
And I'ma walk with my nuts hangin out
I ain't scared, but this is where it get's weird
Factories, toxic waste, and chemicals
They have strange effects on the animals
In my neighborhood and some get a lot bigger
Like the giant rat that jumped on my back
I'm runnin like a maniac all through the ghetto zone
And it's steady takin bites out my nug bone
Wrustling around and found it's tail
So I straight bit it
Then it ripped of my leg and broke with it
Tried to catch up but I couldn't move quick enough
This little trip to the store is straight fuckin me up
But that's ok cause the store's just down the block
So I hop
And it seems all wrong as I look up in the sky
I see the vultures waitin on me to die
But I made it to the store so fuck all you hoes
Peep out the sign
Hmmm Closed
Picked up a mailbox threw it through the wall
Cause I'ma get my shit so fuck all y'all
Took a loaf of bread and a carton off the shelf
Even took a Faygo 2 liter for myself
Walked out the store like a cheap ass when I heard
The click-click sound of a mossberg
The store owner he didn't like a beat and eat
That's why he didn't see a problem with buckin me
Blew my muthafuckin head off my shoulders
Didn't say nothin kept buck buckin
But I gotta say I made it home in a heart beat
Nobody fucks with a head rollin down the street
Now I think about it was a full man when leavin out
Now I'm a head with a loaf of bread in my mouth
Bouncin up the stairs
I knock on the door with my chin
Hey yo little man won't ya let me in?
And best believe it was good to see my little brother
Hey you forgot the milk you dumb motherfucker
Lock the door behind me cause I'm back on route
Back to the store and I'm out
Uh, uh, who's pussy is this, bitch?
Uhh, who's pussy? Yeah
Eh, what the fuck are you looking at?
Ain't you ever seen pussy before, stupid ass?
Slap that ass bitch
Oh, uh, oh, hey
How's it happenin' again?
Hey this song right here
We're ready to slow it down and get a little sexy, ya know

The car broke down and she was like ""Honey, get the flash light""
Still one in the dash right?
Only cause it's late at night
And who knows
What's out there
She was right tho
Ain't gonna help with a light tho
People dying tonight
Cause yo this maniac is, out there
I'm hanging like a possum
Murder tricks, I got some
Spot them
Look come around to the bottom
And slaughter them, out there
His boo was locked up in the car
On the phone and tripping hard
Screaming
F**k that bitch was scurred
There's a killer out there
Cut that crying shit off
I cut
You die
I get off
I'm crawling up on the car
Trying to rip the moon roof lid off, out there
Bitch turned the wipers on
Hazard lights and blew the horn
I smashed with my axe, and pulled her to the lawn, out there
She kicked me hard, to the grill
With one of them, Doc Martin heels
Murderas, you know how that feels
Your lip be out there
Time to die
Close my eyes
Swung and felt a thump
I done spilt her head in half like a tree stump, out there

[Chorus]
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Lights on in the house
But it's dark outside
You can even close one eye
Look bitch, I'm out there
Camp fire lit
Boy Scout meeting's they talk of me
Even they leaders got memories of me, I'm out there
Forensic scientists try to finger me out
But I'm too quick for their Sheriff's stupid asses
I'm still out there
Pull up all your road blocks
I'm running them them's in my socks
Silently taken out all cops, one by one, I'm out there
Leave they bodies
In the street
Continue on my murder spree
They can believe all my heat
When I pull it out there
Break up into the Zoo
Dress up in a monkey suit
Sticking up families for they loot, my brain, is out there
Handy with an ice pick
Pull it out and use it good
In and out your temple
Blood is squirting all out there
I'm the urban legend you heard at your college dorm
Jump out and squeeze your vocal cords
When you out there

[Chorus]
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing

(Bushwick Bill)
Some where out there a remnance of Bushwick
My mind loads clips at your block
And leave you stuck bitch
A psychopath
With a clasp and a black ski mask
Leave you in body bags
For a news flash
I might be small
But I got big balls
Write my name on the wall
With bloodstains after the brawl
Evil thoughts run deep in my brain
I'm sick and deranged
So picture the pain
Flowing in my veins
Yeah I'm sick
I'm sicker then Hitler
My gat spit streak mothaf**king forbidden scriptures
Niggas run from a gun, forgetting they can't
I drag a Mossberg, cause it won't fit in my pants
I run up in your ride, it's parked and
It's darken
Jump out your glove compartment, sparking
The shit that I do, make many faint
Dead saint
Turn your blood into candy paint

[Chorus]
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there

Pain is sexual 

And I'm horny, I'm horny, horny 



[Violent J:]

I jump in the mosh pit, but I'm alone 

Between 4 trees I get it on 

My brain is hemorrhaging, it's them or me 

It ain't easy knocking over a tree (I pass out) 

I wake up the room is padded 

It would appear I've had it 

But hold up 

Close rip, wrap them around my neck 

And choke myself to death, no breath 

Now I'm out, I'm strapped down 

Wait, I can still move my head around 

I got about 4 inches between the back of my head 

And the metal gurney bed 

BOOM! 

Slamming it, retractions 

BOOM! 

I feel the back of my skull is cracking 

BOOM! 

A broken bone is piercing my brain 

And oh, I just hammered it in... 





Ahhhhh 

Ahh I hurt myself 

God I hurt myself 

Stop me 

Pain, pain 

Stop me 



[Monoxide Child:]

I'm sitting in the dark, talking to myself 

Why does everybody tell me that I need help? 

I'm in love with pain 

I take a needle or a knife 

And drive that mother fucker through my windpipe 

Just might 

Take a razor blade 

Dip it in some gas 

See if I can take a little skin of the calf 

Grotesque I'm a walking body bag 

And when it all heals I'll pick the scabs 



[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]

Alone in the casket, buried in the earth 

Self-inflicted wounds, blood stains on my t-shirt 

Kick out the door till my legs fall off 

Try to use my head my skulls to soft 

The pain overwhelms shooting through my kidneys 

Blood rushes out when I stick a shank in me 

Keep stabbing and sticking 

And pulling all the blood spitting 

And I cut off the oxygen 

And take my own life again 



[Chorus:]

Why, tell me why 

Do you hurt yourself, when you know I love you 

AH STOP ME! 

Why, tell me why 

Do you hurt yourself, when you know I love you 

AH STOP ME! 



[Anybody Killa:]

Do you wanna die? Do you need my help? 

Is it self mutilation that you're bringing on yourself 

Went through the same situation 1 year ago 

I guess that explains all the scars on my throat 

Why you still breathing, are you still alive? 

Escaping from the deamons that you had locked inside 

You death suicidal than come an play my game 

One gun, one bullet if you're it no pain 



[Shaggy 2 Dope:]

A layer up skin ohhh, I pull it back 

And smooth it back down with some simple smack (OUCH) 

Wednesday nights I got kicked off my bowling league 

Just cause I show up bite a bowling ball and leave 

Yea go ahead curse me you faggots 

So I throw my legs onto moving cars, you got your habits 

I don't consider it hurting myself, it brings me joy 

Now shut the fuck up here 

Batter up UHHHHAHHH!! 



[Jamie Madrox:]

Cut and slice away with a steak knife 

Hit myself in the ankle with a PVC pipe 

Exacto blade underneath the fingernail 

Bleed and make another cut, fucking might as well 

Tablespoon of Morton's salt pour it on the wound 

If it don't burn you don't know what you doing 

If you fail just return to start 

Self defecation is a beautiful art

The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus.
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot,
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot.
And I'm sittin in a 64 rinekeys,
With shaggy dope written on the car keys.
I look around I can't believe that it's possible,
I'm dead, and I made it to the carnival.
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of,
Everybody and they mama got clownlove.
Japanese, lebenese, and chinese,
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto cheese. (hoo hoo)
Hangin out with redneck truck drivers,
Instead of always givin each other piledrivers.
I see my old homey, he died in a drag,
Chillin with two bitches, what up, shag?
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk,
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it.
And to think, I always been afraid to die,

Free money, and mad bitched non-stop.
No water, it's faygo on tap,
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack wit it,
Cuz I can, cuz I'm fat paid,
I got a five story funhouse with a maid,
And she walks round wit her titties hangin out,
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off. (hoo hoo)
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see,
Jimi hendrix, selena, and easy e,
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off,
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt,

He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood.
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine,
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my ax in my holster,
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster.
The sheriff at the border, he tried to take me out,
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his adams apple out!
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place,
He opened up his door, and shot me in the face.
It blew me off the porch, and blew my head in half,
But I'm a juggalo, so it only made me laugh. (hehe!)
Ax in hand, I rose like the dead,
And swung with all my might,
I made a thump noise in his head.
Since we out west, I grabbed the shot gun,
And blew his fuckin' tongue out the back of his cranium!

Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie.
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy cry.
I might use a gun, (no!)
I might use an ax, (yes!)
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick,
And this little piggy is a mutha fuckin' dick.
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a volkswagon bug 17 deep
Packed full of juggalo's lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now the air kazoo like starsky and hutch
But there's only 2 of them the rest are out to lunch
They call up dunkin doughnuts to gather up the rest
25 piggy's with they bullet proof vests
We lead 'em on a chase, they blowin off rounds
Now they all front cuz we at the carney grounds
And they gettin swallowed by they very own greed
Dark carnival and wicked clownz cuz we need

I might use an ax, (yes!)

The last little piggy, his house is made of gold,
He lives in a mansion on his own private road,
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait,
I snapped his fucken neck in 2 and slammed his nuts in the gate! Cuz this little piggy, must defiantly die,
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky.
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil,
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel.
People in my city, they fight for they meals,
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills.
A ritchie is the devil, he never really made it,
So I'm a cut his hand off and slap his face wit' it.
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed,
I grabbed a brick, and roller-laid it upside his head.
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late,
And tied his neck in a knot and watched him suffocate, cuz I need

Oh yeah well that's cool, check it out

We been here and there we been pretty tight
Something happened last night that you might get upset about
But hear me out
I didn't mean nothing by it, I'm a make this quick
I gave your mama this dick

I don't know how it happened
I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping
I was over there mowing the grass
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass
And then, I went inside to make a phone call
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra
One thing just led to another
Next thing you know, I'm butt-fucking your mother

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo

Don't hang up, I still got more
Your momma gives head like a heroin whore
I wasn't thinking about how you was my bud
When she spreaded my butt cheeks and went for the Milk Dud
We broke out with your with grandpa's gin
Got drunk, I fucked her with a bowling pin
She's freaky
Her nipples look like peanuts
Your mama's one of my favorite s***s
She likes licking from the back of my balls
To the tip of my dick with one big lick
She calls me her big teddy bear
Roooaaaaarrrrr
I chase her around on my underwear
I'll admit I like spanking her butt
I used your sock though to catch my nut
Don't worry
I put it back, I knew you better
That's probably why your toes been sticking together

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo

Your mom's ass look like oat meal yo
It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though
And I ain't trying to diss her either
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some
Every hair is like a foot long
Bitch looks like a werewolf wearing a thong sometimes
It's all right with me though
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole
And your dad's so dumb he's knowing nothing
Here I'm stuffing her muffin not to mention the pickle puffing
And I'm hoping you and me are still cool
I'm spending the night so she can drive me to school tomorrow
And we plan on fucking again
All right I'll talk to you later

Won't you be my prom queen?
Everybody has a real good time

Won't you be my prom queen?
(It's time for my senior prom)
Won't you be my prom queen?
Everybody has a real good time

Another morning, I must get up and go to school
I'm taking too long gettin' dressed, tryin' to look my best
Because today is not your ordinary every morning
My high school prom is coming and I heed my daddy's warnings

I'm going to find myself a girl to take to the prom
I shouldn't have too much trouble because I'm
I'm very nice, my mother says, I'm very handsome
When I wear my good vest and mother knows best

I got to school, I straggle through the hallways
I stop and gaze at all the girls just like always
But this time, I must now approach them
Or my daddy might get mad and break my wrist again

And so I choose her, her hair, it matches with her face
She is so lovely, my heart and pulse begin to race
I make my way between her friends and to her presence
Hello, Christine, would you be my prom queen?
(I'd rather die, I'd rather die, I'd rather die)

There was a time when I could except a no
That was before, Christine is gonna have to go
My parents will be proud of me when I bring her home
So now I sit and watch her practice in the gym dome

Christine is famous, she has so many different friends
Will they miss her when she's dead or will they just pretend
Nobody talks to me, I only talk to I
And I been telling myself all day, she's gotta die

Good morning, everybody
This is Principal Rogers and I would just like to congratulate
Our Senior class
And wish them a great time at tonight's prom dance

Won't you be my prom queen?
(I can be your prom king)
Won't you be my prom queen?
(I can be your prom king)

Won't you be my prom queen?
(I can be your prom king)
Won't you be my prom queen?
(I can be your prom king)
Everybody has a real good time

It was really fuckin' easy, I'm a human hater
I took a towel from the locker room to suffocate her
I had to throw away her gym bag and all her folders
And when it got dark, I carried her home on my shoulders

My daddy was asleep, when I snuck her in the back
I thought about my situation and it's kind of whack
It sounds cheap, but we're having prom in my cellar
But she's dead, I guess, I'll never have to tell her

I took the bottles up to Meijer's, four dollars worth
I took the 17 dollars that was in her purse
I bought balloons, and streamers, and stuff to munch
I had a dollar left, I bought a Faygo punch

I hung the streamers and balloons on my basement wall
I banged my head a couple times, I'm just too fuckin' tall
I would have took her to the school like a normal man
But I had to kill her first they'd never understand

I put a record on and then I picked her up to dance
I pray she cannot feel the woody growing in my pants
I know my daddy would be proud of all that I've done
Instead of burning me, he'll probably come and hug his son

I think about it as I dance slowly to the beat
The more I think about it, tears are rolling down my cheek
I hope that I showed Christine a night like no other
Cause after all, that's how my daddy did my mother

Our Seniors deserve a night to celebrate with friends
And celebrate all their great work
Prom night is your very own special night
And everybody always remember their high school prom

Won't you be my prom queen?

Won't you be my prom queen?

Have crossed the line into your neighborhood

Deal with your own creation

Well, I've been to the storm house and then some
Payed me dues, but I'm still a street hoodlum
Dropped out of school, 'cuz I couldn't find my locker
Stubbles on my chin, I got hair like Chewbacca

Might see me sleeping on the street
Don't look for a job, 'cuz there's no jobs looking for me
Then it all went to my head
Next thing, forty nine motherfuckers dead

Tell the pigs, I did it, place spot at your back
And beat you in the head with it
And keep your bitch in place
Or I'ma send her ass home with a foot print on her face
I'm hating s***s, shoot them in the face
Step back and itch my nuts, 'less I'm in the sac
'Cuz I fuck so hard, it'll break they back

All the pressure's packed into one nut
I was waiting on a bus and my head blew up
And the sight'll make ya sick

Thought you knew it bitch
The icp is made up of psychotic
Demented psycho clumsy motherfuckers
And when we'll put a hook on your dumb leg
Like it ain't nobody's business

So, I'm standing by the train tracks
Then you see me running but naked with a battle axe
I'm swinging and slicing and chopping and cutting and
Ah, until I'm nothing

Seems like I always get beat down
Like the hawk turned to the wicked clown
Tail turned out to the ghetto 'cuz
Southwest Detroit is commended one's home

So you might see me at a festival
Cussin', rude and scratching my testicles
With a cold two litre in hand
Rapping to the bitch at the French fry stand

Take it to the Patent Park
Then I'll make a sexist remark
'Cuz they're all eventually bitching
Serve me fucking take your ass to the kitchen

Police don't like me, it's obvious
Just don't look in the trunk

Insane Clown Posse is back in this mutha fucka
Hey yo, Violent J, whats up?

It's Christmas, time for a sadah, maybe your wife
Maybe your daughter, it's midnight, I land my sleigh
Make way for jolly St. J, climb down the chimney for the murder
Dressed as the fat man everyone's heard of, shimmy down
Shimmy down, what the fuck, somebody help me, I'm stuck

Now, what to do, I feel whack, I got stuck in a chimney stack
But I hack and shimmer on down Santa Claus Clown
Can't fuck around, now living room, I creep, tiptoes
'Cuz they asleep, I pulled out the axle and slid down the hall
I got a gift for all of y'all

What's that, I better hide quick, oh fuck, it's the real St. Nick
And he must've been taken a shit but regardless
I better move quick now, so I jumped him, Santa's no joke
Fucked around got my damn neck broke
He strap, he shot, he didn't miss gunshots, ho, ho, ho
I had a red Christmas

""I'm dreaming of a dead Christmas, the kind you'll never have again
'Cuz if you have a dead Christmas that means you're dead
And that's the end""

Have a merry Christmas you fuckin' chump
Seasons greatings loser, yo 2 Dope kick it

Jack Frost nibbles, ha, but fuck that I ain't got a home
So he nibbles on my nut sack and my butt crack, toes and elbows
My nutz is froze, fuck you hoes, so I made a friend like me
A snow man, he was down with the clown like a blow man
Had a hat and eyes outta charcoal and a pipe, we fill it with endow

Me and him sang songs in the snowflakes, he ate snowballs
I ate cornflakes and we both would freeze our ballz off
I was there every time his head fallz off, I put it back on for him
With a smile, he was my boy, made from a snow pile
Then the storm came, a blizzard, snow, wind, ice, a blizzard
We pulled through we hid in an alley, the next day
It was like sunny valley

He was melting and I was just fine
He got pissed and pulled out a nine

If I'm gonna die you should come with me 'cuz we boyz
It hit me, damn I'm dying, I'm dead he got his wish
And all I got was another red Christmas

Silent night, Violent fight, now I'm dead one to the head
Christmas this year seemed so whack

'Happy New Year' bitch, boy, hey, I got a new years resolution
For your chicken ass mutha to kiss my mutha fucken ass

Jingle bellz, jingle bellz, jingle all the way
Pass your fucken mom up if the icp don't play
Hey, Wicked Clowns, Wicked Clowns
Bitches, drop your drawers
Don't talk back just suck my sack and fiddle with my ballz

Lookin like a host from the Barbary coast
Nigga don't wanna get burnt like toast
Whassup wit deez nuts in ya me-outh
Aight everybody.. C'mon we out
Took her to the six dollar hole in the wall
And I like how she's holdin the balls
Gobble gobble, from the incision
Stuff that bitch and it ain't Thanksgiving
Didn't even have to fuck all night long
Take me home, damn it's on
Jumped out the cover, snatched off the rubber
Met the hoe's mother - yo whassup?

Got to the panties, her ass started fightin
And I'm thinkin bout my dog Mike Tyson
Took her ass home, all alone (ring ring)

Bottom of the ninth swingin, for my life
I'm up at the plate, goin for the gate
They got my moms seated in section eight
Been on deck since my last felony
I'm that 0 for 2 mothafucka
With the louisville slugger
Shay whitie, that left hand punk
Is on the mound and he comin wit dat off-speed junk
Its the westside hustlaz, vs these la pigs
You can say the damned vs the nigs
My little homies in the dugout
They lookin sad, cuz fourteen niggas done struck-out
My first offense was possession of weed
Now I'm in the major leagues and
That mothafucka bill clinton-is a son of a bitch
Had the nerve to throw out the first pitch
I'm just tryin to get rich like trump
The home run king is now in a slump, pass me a hunk
How the fuck can I stay out the pen
When its one-two-three strikes you in
Chorus:
One-two three strikes you in
Now how the fuck a nigga supposed
To stay out the pen, I'm on a blend
Of gin and hen, everyday of my life
With two strikes it aint right
Hes in the wind-up
Here come the pitch
I swing, aw shit (foul tip)
They felt the chill cuz if I get on first
You know the deal - a niggas gots to steal
Like to steal home and I betcha
That I can run over, the la pig catcher
Just because I'm black, wit a bat
They wanna send a nigga back to the warning track
Fulla count they say I wont amount to shit
But fool I can hit like kenny grit
With a split in my mouth on tha cellular phone
(its going, going, gone!)
And watch a pitcher get served
You from tha la pigs
I know you coming with a curve
Ay batter, batter is the chitter-chatter
I'm the designated hitter, a nigga
Much badder, than babe ruth
Will I tell the truth and nothing but the truth
Hell yea, Id rather be shootin hoops
Cuz a niggas guaranteed to win
Against a bullshit loss and three strikes you in
Take me out to the ballgame
Take me out to the crowd (wha what, wha what)
Another nigga on trial
Keep ya peanuts jeezuh
And fuck you cracker jack
I hope I never come back
I gots to root for my homeboys
If they don't win its a shame
Cuz its one-two-three strikes you in
Twenty-five years of pain you know my name
They wanna nigga to run and get hung
High strung, so this pig can win the cy-young
Ima hit this mothafucka a mile
In the batters box, high as steve hal
You can't salary cap my gat
No strike, cuz gangsta-rap is on the map
I'm like satchel paige wit a gauge
Or jackie robinson, when I'm robbin one
Of you cracker jacks fool I'm a mothafuckin vet
And fuck yo seventh-inning stretch, so
Take me out to the ballgame,
And see my neighborhood name
In your ghetto hall of fame
Chorus x 3
Yea (it aint right)
Playin people like a game (it aint right)
Human beings, puttin em in a jar (it aint right)
For double life, triple life (it aint right)

Hey look at this! I was cleaning out my nest
And I found a book of my old poetry

(ice cube)
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at at&t
'cause when I was in school I got the A. E. E.
But there's no S. E. For this youngsta
I didn't have no money so now I have to hunch the
Back like a slave, that's what be happenin
But whitey says there's no room for the african
Always knew that I would boycott, jeez
But welcome to mcdonalds can I take your order please
Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer
'cause my baby doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from bush
Or jesse jackson, and operation push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douch
A masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood
To the whorehouse bitches,
Miss porker, little joe or todd bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'm never givin' love again
'cause blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my w-2
Now senators are gettin' hired
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

Tell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)
Tell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)"

[story-teller] once upon a time, in the black part of the city
[young kid] yo g, yo g you better get out of here man, 5-0
[door swings shut, car peels out]

[russ] yo ice cube, man
[cube] whassup man?

[russ] yo ice cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches
And the niggaz?  why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man?  the
Fuckin kids? !
[cube] word

Verse one: ice cube

Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of i-c-e
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe
At that type of shit he's a pro
So jack and jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see dr. bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on sesame street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a air jordan
Ride to the fellow mister rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on lorenzoes
He broke out, little bo peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins

[little bo peep] yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with snow white, she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red riding hood, and little boy blue
A bad influence?  yo I don't know
But ice cube'll tell the kids how the story should go


Interlude: little russ

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is little russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!
[well, you know the rest]

Verse two: ice cube

Humpty dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a coup de ville
Lookin for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And mister rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause mister rogers found out quick
That humpty dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So mister rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down sesame street and caught em
Little boy blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence?  yo, I don't know
But ice cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go

Outro: little russ, ice cube

[cube] aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?
[russ] yeah you aight, you in the house
We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa
[cube] yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass

Chasin' me down like the ice cream truck
These police, they never light me up
I'm that nigga, baby, hype me up
Fuckin' up at work, they never write me up
They always hold me down and raise me up
And all these women wanna glaze me up
Never turnt down, I'm turnt up

Always on ten, always too loud
Always too hard for this boujee ass crowd

Too much game tryna sell some
You know you can't hate on a real one
Too $hort, I ain't no nice dude
I'm like Ice Cube, run up in your wife fool
O.G., enjoyin' my life
Still gettin' money when I'm on the mic
Thirty years later still spittin' flows
Gettin' paid to call these bitches hoes
I get love wherever I go
And I'm always tryna get some more

Boy, do what I say, nigga, robot
You kinda hit and miss, I'm the sure shot
Never sold out, niggas bought out
You also 'bout to fall out when I go all out
Michael ball out but never touch no balls

Oh why did fools had to let loose
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce
Big tom had to push us
13 niggaz runnin straight to the bushes
For they gats so they could draw down
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down
Not known why I dropped out
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out
So now I gotta jet
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin wet
Tryin to see if we got him
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out

Woke up in the back of a tray
On my way, to mlk
That the county hospital jack
Where niggaz die over a little scratch
Still sittin in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
Yo nurse I'm gettin kind of warm
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees
Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move""
Yo, I didn't do a thing
Didn't wanna go out like my man rodney king
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now I'm handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime

I need to see a md
And y'all mothafuckers giving me the third degree
Look at the waiting room
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin help
Since we poor
The hospital move slow
Now I'm layed out
People steppin over me to get closer to the tv
Just like a piece of dog shit
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet
One hour done passed
Done watched two episodes of m*ass*h
And when I'm almost through
They call my name and put me on icu
Halfway dead
No respect and handcuffed to the bed
Now the trauma starts
Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart
So I begin the ass kissin
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103
Only got a band-aid and an iv
That's when I start cussin
Police steady askin me who did the bustin

Why oh why can't I get help
Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin
So at 10 p.m. I was audi 5000"

Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in

Arrest the president, arrest the president (Crazy)

[Verse 2]
I took back my ice, in all black tonight
That's right, some niggas gotta sacrifice
Not a criminal (No), I'm a seminal (Yeah)
I was free once, now I'm clinical (Crazy)
You so technical, this was Mexico
Now everywhere I go is owned by Texaco (Fuck them)
Fuck them and the rest of you (Hell yeah)
I turn a fruit into a vegetable (Pop you motherfuckers out)
I'ma roll with the aliens
Man, fuck these homo sapiens
They don't really wanna make friends (Hell no)
All they want is a Mercedes Benz (Hell yeah)
All they want is they dividends
And decibels, fuck these citizens
They'll treat us like hooligans
Throw 'em in, they don't care what school he in
These people don't play fair
It ain't even fair at the state fair
Give a young nigga grey hair
That's why I'm here, make your ass lay there
Punk, you better stay there
Close your fucking eyes like it's day care
Make myself clearer than Shakespeare
I'm here to take money even fake hair
So desperate is what I'm left with
For the record you affected
Who you elected is so septic
So full of shit, I can't accept it

[Chorus]
Arrest the president (Woo), arrest the president (Woo)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Nigga)
Arrest the president (Nigga), arrest the president (Nigga)
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Nigga)

I reside on the Westside (Westside)
I murder with my third eye (Third eye)
Niggas so fly, get a bird's eye (Ahh, ahh)
I make 'em scream bloody murder
Let's meet at the White House (Come on)
Run in and turn the lights out
Man, they treat it like a trap house (Yeah)
These motherfuckers never take the trash out (Damn)
They just cash out and mash out
Nigga take your drugs and pass out (Shut the fuck up)
Niggas love to go that fast route (Yeah)
I see you and your black ass, get out
Homie, you play too much (Yeah)
While these devils, they doin' way too much (Much)
Most of 'em won't say too much
Why they're steady planin'? God knows what (God knows what)
That's why I roll with the real ones
Real ones tryin' to reach millions
Real ones tryin' to make billions
Real ones dressed like civilians

Arrest the president, arrest the president
Arrest the president, you got the evidence (Woo)

Never thought these niggaz was the feds

Lay the whole fuckin' room down

Smokin' marijuana in my sauna,

And find the money that's gone
And we'll take you, shake you,

Ya say I'm on yo' hit list,

Tryin' to turn my muthafuckin' cheese into Swiss
Rappers make bucks and I can hear it,
Hard to fear it,

It's the boss player,
Never lost hair over assholes,
Blast holes in you muthafuckin' tadpoles
Like a bullfrog,

Guppies get worked like puppies by the bulldog
Where millions never gave a fuck about Sicilians,

Extreme fun, Wit this mean one
But you'll never get none fuckin wit them broke hoes

Tighter than virgin cocks, At the mall like dispurge a lot

But I'm servin rhymes, Two cds at a time

And play po, And stop niggaz knackin
Still keep the set crackin
All about the cheese and how it's stackin
And plus, It's mo cheddar down the line
Ain't no better time for me and a gang of niggaz on the grind
Tryin to get the income, And then some
Stash a little bit and spin some
Keep it poppin till the end come
Can't stop it, Then shawties wanna grip
24/7, Money got a nigga whipped
Chip after chip, But if I slip
Have the homie send me O. T. And work the flip
Cause the world is payola
Silk the spot and left connect on ya wall in a black crayola

Wish I got paid for rapping to the nation
But that's not likely so heres my application
Hand it to the man at at&T
Cause when I was in school I got the aee
But there is no se for this youngster
I didn't have no money so now I got to punch the
Clock and slave and be happy
Cause the whitty saya there no room for the african
Always knew that I wouldn't clock G's
But welcome to mcdonalds can I take your order please
Gotta serve you food taht might give you cancer
Cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes but they never give me back
What about diaper bottles and similac ]
Do I have to sell me A whole lotta of crack
Produce in shelter and clothes on my back
Or should I just wait for help from bush
Or jessie jackson and operation P. You. S. H
If you ask me the whole thing needs A douche
Or massingale
What the hell
Crack I'll sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss parker, lil joe, and todd bridges
Or anybody that he knows
So cop me A bird better known as A kilo
Now everybody know
I went from po
To A nigga that got dough
So now you want to put the fed against me
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'll never get love again
But blacks are too fucking broke to republicans
Now I remember I use to be cool
Till I stop filling out my W2
Now senator are getting high
And you blacks in ghettos at night cry
So now you want to give A pep talk
But sorry this is our only room to walk
Cause we don't want to drug push
But A bird in the hand is worth more than A book"

Ease back, white bitch, I don't play that
Just because I got on my L. A. Hat

Sorta like Patty Herst but I'll burst first, bitch

So fuck you bitch and your Coppertone
Stringy hair, no derrier, frontin' and fakin' with your silicone pair

But steady talkin shit in the holding tank
First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screamin for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they runnin up in ya slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan (Check that shit out!)
Now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rollin your eyes and neck
You better run a check

Cause fuck you and that shit ya stressin
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighbourhood hooker (s***!)
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Givin up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and ya dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane hit
Sprung, niggaz call her 'Lips and Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
Cause women like you gets no respect

Chase it like a cheetah choke it out and subdue it
Self educate nigga don't hate cuz the game

Don't change just the fucking rhyme sayers

A say might get you through the day
Or change your whole life in a major way
The shit they say might catch you a case
The shit a say feel like your birthday

Straight hell on earth for come about the abyss

Bring bomber jacket if there's another hustle out there

They keep calling all the lil homies
Keep falling in em sand traps

Then sue us watching katrina is worser than argentina
See new orleans getting bitch slapped by a fema lousiana
Got racist ass politics free the genesigs nigga
Free the genesigs your honor osama obama
Even ya mama aint fuckin with ma karmas they want us to quit, forget,
And not give a shit about these sick ass politics
A lunatic is in the white house

But they'll make a nigga bow down
In the penitentiary a billion dollar industry

Ice Cube,Color Blind,/i/ice+cube/color+blind_20066642.html,"Ice Cube:
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothas in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin I fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Now, do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
So when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride...
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin indo
Comin up fast, rollin down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, cuz I'm color blind

Threat:
Killa Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But wearin the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
Cuz I slang these thangs like a G
It's on, is anybody killin for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

KAM:
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it aint no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even she'd a tear
Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
Cuz brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

WC:
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

Coolio:
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin
Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

WC:
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I I put in my clip

Coolio:
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggaz to Harrison Ross

WC:
Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
Thinkin should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

Coolio:
I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)
Cuz I'm colorblind

King Tee:
Niggaz in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned baby
Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin, gettin smoked like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

J-Dee(Lench Mob):
I understand how all my homeboys feel
Cuz I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep
Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind. . ."

I'm makin' hits with yo' bitch ass, talkin' 'bout
That same old shoot 'em out. I'm smokin' fifty blunts,
That's why yo' shit ain't comin' out for, like, fifty months.
Ain't nobody tryin' to hear... your nigga outdated.
Your wack-ass quit tellin' niggaz that you made it.
I'm never faded, like a ghost, Villain, disappear.
Buy some shit to resurrect my dick the next year.
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, to the earthquake.

But no, I pay my respects and I'm through(whaddup cube?)
Hug my crew, and maybe she'd a tear or two
And I wanna get blitz
Grab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce
About a brother who had to be the one and only
So I dedicate this to my dead homiez...

Verse two:

Another homie got murdered on a shakedown{three gun shots}
And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted{two gun shots}
A framed picture and a closed casket
A single file line about 50 cars long
All drivin' slow with they lights on
He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
What good is that when you're six feet deep?
I look at that shit and gotta think to myself
And thank God for my health
'cause nobody really ever know
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
So I take everything slow, go with the flow
And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know(word!)
'cause that's what pops told me
But I wish he could have said it... To my dead homiez

Verse three:

I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
Now it's ""rest in peace"" after every one
Except me, but I ain't the one to front
Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month
Plus, I knew him when he was yea big
Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig
But somethin' ain't right
When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
Lovin' each other in a caring mood
There's lots of people and lots of food
They say ""be strong"" and you're tryin'
But how strong can you be when you see your pops cryin'?
So that's why ice cube's dressed up
Because the city is so fuckin' messed up
And everybody is so phony
Take a little time... To think about your dead homiez."

And if the s** was good still be the whole frame
Fucked around and told my plan to the man
Sitting next to the god damn men
How was I to know son
That the nigg' blow with one and told the 4-1-1
With a big fat grand
Talking 'bout all the whores that I ran up in
Broke a nigga plan like dishes

And see up I'm still #1 with the bullet
What the fuck do I sing?
It looks like the Predator
It's gettin dissed by the editor
Looked up and hell of white for caper
It's to lynch a nigga on paper
But I'm much too black for the god damn cracker
Huh! Dirty Macker
Even the Guardian Angel got mental
But never seen their ass walking past South Central
Little super hair oh don't lemme catcha
I fuck around and wetcha
Try to dirty mack me out
Try to take food out my kids mouth
You're looking at my people are stronger than your evil
All you ask where they got the hip hop
At the dope the 187 taxi on your toe
So act like you know
That nigga that's known to jack
Devils in little red hats
Motherfuckin dirty macks!

Chorus

Don't come to an O. G., with that 'he said she said'
Bitch, hit the freeway, dirty mack's get tossed
'cause I fuck around, and jump your ass like Kris Kross
Just might blast, snake in the grass
Gotta shake up the ass
Found at a trunk of funk
Tall and stiff as a philly blunt
What more do you want you unfucked up the plot
And deserve just what you got
'cause I'm hotter than tabasco
You little ass hole
Mow I gotta do you like grass chow
Pko now you see they flow on cannabis

Get your ass in here boy 
You hear me calling you? 
O'Shea!

When I was young I used to hang with the seventh graders 
Little bad motherfucker playing Space Invaders 
Fucking with the girls in the fourth grade 
Either feeling on they butts or pulling on they braids 
Walking with the schoolhouse bully 
By doing that I had a lot of pull G 
Cheating on tests making a mess 
Cussing like a sailor at recess 
It must a been a half moon 
Cause you'll catch me running out the little girls' bathroom 
Chewing on Good and Plenties 
Got my gamble on at lunch pitching pennies 
Yo I was living like the class clown 
Pulling all the hokes, making all the jokes man 
When you young it's hard to see 
That it's wrong throwing rocks at the RTD 
Popping out your window with a BB gun 
Better yet knocking on your door and run 
Playing hide-and-go-get-it for a little stank 
Even though I was still shooting blanks 
As soon as the dark hit 
I was stealing candy out the corner market 
Until I got my ass whipped 
Cause I was ten years old, doing dumb shit 

Thirteen, that's how old I was 
When my jimmy started getting a little peach fuzz 
And I was looking at any butt and ass 
Me and my homies started cutting class 
Going up to the high school 
Looking for any bitch I could lie to 
Tell em I was older than I really was 
Smoked my first joint and got really buzzed 
That's what a mack's made of 
But when I got my first piece of pussy I fell in love 
Hard as a rock the long way 
And then I put the rubber on the wrong way 
But I still gotta have it 
Overexcited and fucking like a jackrabbit 
Goddamn I was hot 
A virgin but I still knew how to lay pipe 
Even though the hoe worked me 
I still knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque 
Then the shit got strange money 
I started shaking and jimmy felt funny 
Then the nut came gushing 
I jumped up got dressed and start pushing 
Cause I thought the bitch broke my dick 
Cause I was still young doing dumb shit 

At 17 got my first Volkswagon 
And mastered the life-long art of dragging 
To the women in college 
Hung out with the OG's and got some street knowledge 
Breaking in cars and all that 
Hitting punk fools with a baseball bat 
Fucking at a real fast rate 
Til they said that I might not graduate 
Then I said fuck the dumb shit 
Cause Pops'll fuck me up quick 
If things continued 
So I start rapping about shit I been through 
And I got real good 
Now I look at all the kids in the neighborhood 
Trying to be baby macks 
Doing shit that I did seven years back 
Going through a stage 
But before they can grow up they on the front page 
And they mommas is having a fit 
Cause they died young doing dumb shit"

You came to the club, stepped to the bar
And pulled out a wad of Doves
After you got buzzed, she walk by
You saw how big her ass was
Got her on the dancefloor
And she started dancin like a ho
Jimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home
So you gave the bitch a lift
She didn't wanna trouble you
But hopped her big ass in your bmw
Hopped to her house and started kissin
And Jimmy just wouldn't listen
Cos you got real horny
And that ain't cool at four in the morning
Started undressing the ho
Got to the drawers and the ho said ""No!
""Not on the first date
""It's gettin kinda late, could you come back at eight?""
You said ""Yeah!"" cos you thought you met a wholesome ho
But nigga, she know you rollin in some dough
And you'll regret and somethin 'bout a bitch you just met
Don't trust em!

Dick hard as a rock
Straight on a solo creep
Can't wait till her little boy go to sleep
So you can seduce the G
Bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
You got her worked out cos you the man
But the bitch got diff'rent plans
She said ""Take off your clothes, jump in the bed""
While she powder her nose
You get butt naked, cos you ready to wreck it!
Cos you's a motherfuckin punk, next thing you know
The door flies open with a blast
With four niggas in ski masks
Pointin a gun at the pimp
You're scared as a motherfucker and Jimmy done went limp
They beat you down just a taste
Take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
Drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fuckin car
Take you out and pop the cap
I told you the bitch was a trap
Don't trust em!

Here comes the big-headed
Nigga that's dippin
Sippin on Courvoisier
Goddamn I must havta floss today
Now pimpin aint easy but it's necessary
So I'm chasin bitches like Tom chased Jerry
I'll put the pedal to the flo-uh
In my two-tone Ford Explo-uh
You know how it's done
Sounds bumpin
Ain't that sumthin?
Jumped on the 110
She's flyin in the Blazer
Like ""Go Speed Racer""
But I ain't gonna chase her
Like Racer X
But I won't flex
Til it's time to have s**
So when you wanna get togetha?
Cause you know a nigga like me
Is down for whatever

And I'm down for whatever

Verse Two

When I was little I didn't wanna be like Mike
I wanted to be like Ike
Cause
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties
And he liked green like Bill Bixby
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty
Pokets never skinny
Played let's get it on in the living room
Cause he'll turn the party out sayin, ""This is MY muthafuckin house""
And y'all gots to go

Solid Pro is down for whatever
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever
And it don't seem to stop

Verse Three

Now
I don't talk a lot of shit
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead
Then my niggas wearin blue or red
Cause I got the gift
To hit these hos swift
And I'm smellin like a fifth
Of sumthin
Yeah, that's right
I'm standin in the store
Koreans
Act so nice
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells

Yes, I'm straight, go to bed *thunder claps*
*Animal screams* Yeah! Yeah!
*Woman screaming* It's alive!

[Ice Cube]
It's pourin rain, thunder and lightning
Clash of the titans, I'm home writin
Gangsta rap has arrived, I'm the only man alive
October 31st, 1985
Hard times, just got harder
Adolescent Ice Cube, the shit starter
For bein this mean as sixteen raps, feel like the bitch scream
A martyr, thanks to the father
You learned about your triple beam from me
A little G never thought, that I could change the world
You stopped payin for pussy and hit that ass for free
Witta attitude, a Raider jacket and a jheri curl
Got every girl wantin to do me, screw me
Oooh wee *woman screaming* it's alive
Boyz N The Hood, the first rap, the first movie
So whatchu gon' do 24-7, 3-65
Dr. Frankenstein
Dr. Frankenstein

[Mr. Short Khop - x2]
You better run and hide
Ooooh wee, it's alive
Cover your ears and your eyes

[Ice Cube]
The world had to bow to this new style
Dial 9-1-1, makin more money than the law allow
But fuck Tha Police, they can get deez
Illigitimate, counterfeit
No-body, but everybody wanna take the star's place
Now who was sayin shit like that before me?
Even got white boys talkin shit off the shit I invent
No no, motherfuckers musta took a photo
And be Scarface in the car chase
Tryin to call my gangsta shit 'mafioso'
But who ya usin? Fool it ain't no solution
To the evolution, of pimps and prostitution
I cuss, skanlous, I give a rush
To niggas who mind turn to mush, smokin on brush
Hush, I'm just a lush for this Hen
Chrome electroids, connected to my pen
When, blowin motherfuckers ain't knowin what we goin through
Spiritually, lyrically showin you
Gettin liberated by this monster I created
Dr. Frankenstein
They call me, 'Amerikkka's Most Hated'

[Mr. Short Khop]
We love to bump you Frankenstein
Don't fuck with the stress
Yo' shit is the best
Take my body and my mind
If you want, hit me again
Hit me with that game to win
We love you Frankenstein
We love you Frankenstein

[Ice Cube]
Ya fuckin up the formula (call the coroner)
Now how many times did a nigga have to warn ya?
It's outta hand, cos sucker ass niggas like you
Try to pay the rent off my blueprint
New cent to the industry
You thought my shit was biodegradable, uh uh, it's unfadeable
Unstoppable, runnin through your suburbs
Incredible thug words
We gets down, nigga do the Monster Mash
And watch a nigga like me collect monster cash
Cos I'm sittin wit this bitch who got monster ass
Keep em wonderin how long the Don will last
And never pass, and when I want it buttered on toast
Can't no nigga see Ice Cube on no coast
So all you gotta do is focus

And see that I'm the fuckin loccest with this hocus pocus

Every January 16th, it's ""The Dreamer, The Dreamer.""
And all of you say, ""I have a dream; The Dreamer.""
And what did he dream?It stuck him right there.
And little black boys, and little white girls
Will one day hold hands together.
Shit.
Is that where it's at?Is that where it's at now?
Them little blacks hands are yours.
You can't hold the black brothers' hands?
But you gonna grow old holdin' crackers' hands
Before you hold each other's hands?
You gonna walk with your enemy
Before you learn to walk with one another?
How sick can you be?
(Enemy)

Verse One:

Where you gonna go when the brothers wanna bust a shot
Where you gonna go when I wanna kill bloodclot
Supercat said that the ghetto red hot
Bust a gloc, bust a gloc, devils get shot
Nappy-headed, no-dreded look where ya read it
Buck the devil, buck the devil, look who said it
Listen what I say after 1995 not one death will be alive
God will survive, him protect the civilized
Who really cares if the enemy lives or dies?
Not me, not me
Me never eat from the tree with the apple
I'd rather have a Snapple
Do you know where you're going to
Do you know where you're runnin from
Scared of the sun, I live in the sun
You shrivel up like a raisin
And burn like the blunt that I'm blazin
Ku Klux Klan scared of my nutty beats
Cause them nutty beats equal bloody sheets
Out number you somethin like 15 to 3
See, don't love your enemy

Chorus

Enemies, enemy runnin from the G
Enemies, enemy, you're my enemy
Enemies, enemy, when will I see?
Enemies, enemy R.I.P.

Verse Two:

Where you gonna run when God wanna do ya?
J. Edgar Hoover, I wish I woulda knew ya
With the boom ping ping is the ring from the fire
Me not afraid, cause me know Elijah
Goin to the East but straight from the Westside
Swing down sweet chariot nad let me ride
Through the fire, through the fire that will please us
I know that Farrakhan is your baby Jesus
Devil don't you know I'm a soldier?
In God's name and the baby claim I'm gonna hold ya
Like Folger's Crystals feds
I'ma pick your ass like Juan Valdez
You don't care if me die from the cracka
You don't care if me have a heart attacka
You don't care if me get car jacka
You don't care cause you're nothing but a cracka
Now it's Judgement Day, and Allah'll never play
""freedom got an AK,"" them Guerilla say
Bobby Seale said, ""please make it rough, bro""
When God give the word, me herd like the buffalo
Through your neighborhood, watch me blast
Tribe of Shabazz, get in that ass
You shoulda took heed of my word and became a friend of me
Now you're just a enemy

Chorus


Verse Three:

Now I change my style up, my style up,bodies pile up
Just to trouble you, throwin out the W
Sent me a subpoena
Cause I kill more crackas then Bosnia, Herze - govina
Each and every day out a siz-tre Chevrolet
With the heavy A to the muthafuckin K
Now you treat me like a germ
Cause your scared of the su - per sperm
Please don't bust til you see, the whites of his eyes
The whites of his skin, the whites of his lies
Nappy head nigga with the bone in his nose
Ya scared I'ma put this bone in your hoes
But I don't wanna, I've been to cona
From the cavebitch with the nasty persona
Hit me with the big black billy club
Cause you white and your hoe than a silly nub
Three men in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
And it's really scary, now they're in the military
Sodom and Gomorrah, devil read your Torah,
Bible, Holy Qur'an
Once again it's on, got the hollow point teflon
And the brother Ron 2X, so who's next?
(devil)
With Dub C, Brother G
Crazy Toons is a crazy coon ready for the enemy
High off the Hennesy
Hundred ten degree, no it's not Tennesee
West L.A., what the hell can I say?
Niggas wanna play, each and every day
Pass me the pill, a nigga shoot the J
Rougher than the roughest rough muthafucka, had enough muthafucka?
Handcuff this muthafucka with the duct tape, tie it to the bumper
Grab his bitch, dump her, cause nobody wanna hump her
They call me Thumper cause I thump til it hurt
Knock your dick in the dirt, puttin in work
Master Farad Muhammad comin like a comet
When they see em, they all start to vomit
1995, Elijah is alive
Lewis Farrakhan, NOI

Everybody Wants You

You see 'em comin'at you every night
Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight
You know their business, you think it's a bore
They make you restless, it's nothin' you ain't seen before
Get around town, spend your time on the run
You never let down, say you do it for fun
Never miss a play, though you make quite a few
You give it all away - everybody wants you

You crave attention, you can never say ""no""
Throw your affections any way the wind blows
You always make it, you're on top of the scene
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine
Puttin' on the eyes 'til there's nobody else
You never realize what you do to yourself
The things that they see make the daily reviews
You never get free - everybody wants you

Everybody knows you
Everybody snows you
Everybody needs you, leads you, bleeds you

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams
Days at the mirror, patchin' up around the seams
You got your glory, you paid for it all
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol
Say goodbye to conventional ways
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days
The more you understand, seems the more like you do
You never get away - everybody wants you"

Go to school, the teacher wanna fuck the students
Go to church, my preacher turned to prostitution
The prosecution never read my files
That evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial
This shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows
Birds fallin out the sky, fish dyin' in piles
Its fishy, politicians smell like my bowels
Talkin' that shit, really crampin' my styles
I got many, now I'm pinchin' pennies no doubt
I sqeezed Lincoln so hard, a fuckin' booger came out
Its a shame, I used to be on top of my game
They took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains
I met Mr. Lee Harvey, from the tea party
He used to hate Obama til' he felt hurricane Charley
Looking for his FEMA check, it's gone with the wind
When em' dicks is in, you know the fix is in

For my birthday, buy me a politician
It's a shame that you got to teach yo' children

Everythang's a scam, beat the next man
That's capitalism, they'll just build a new prison
For you slick ass niggas' that's tryin' to beat the system
Put you on the front line if you ain't re-enlisting
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get ready for the lynching
Brain-wash media, and puppet politician
Keep you out of position, out of commission
By medicine or food, that's not a decision
The 99 percent, is man tryin' to vent
Police grab my fuckin' arm, then they got bent
Now it's in a splint, I can't pay my rent
The interest on my credit card I ain't made a dent
The U.S mint, I heard they bout' to print
But it's fucked up cause' I won't see a cent
I'm sick of gettin' ignored, this wall I can't afford
I'm going to the pen, free room, free ward

For my birthday, buy me a politician
It's a shame that you got to teach yo' children
Everythangs corrupt, everythangs fucked up

It's so hard not to let em know where you are
Tried to get a rent a car
But he laughed when I showed him cash
Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass
Went to Vegas for the weekend
Met a hoe down freakin
Hey bitch, why you sneakin?
Grabbed the paper out her hand
Am I the man on the front page? (Fuck)
Same height, same age (click-click)
Rap gauge, put it down the G-way
Got my hostage suckin sausage on the freeway
She say ""Let's hear the circle K""
Ran inside and made the niggaz all pay
It's like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado
Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle
That's my motto and I gotta warn ya
Before I'm through, I'm going back to California

Set the poise, so I can infiltrate

Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep

I'm up in D. C. With strike number three
Clownin, made a little stock to get a little c***
Now I got niggaz bangin and lootin rock
I'm going back to Cali where it's bound with my strikes
Don't give a fuck who's on the? Marin or the mic

Looking like he wanna rob me (Fuck)

Niggaz are in a state of emergency
The death side: a mirror damage of where we are today
The life side: a vision of where we need to go
So sign your death certificate

Fuck all y'all


[at the funeral]

Lisa got him
- Allright, on three. One, two... threeee.
Get all folks together, walk this way.
Can't believe it though. The homeboy... Hey, open that door
- Open it
Allright
- 'Right

[gospel music starts playing]
...
We've come together by God's demand
Whether it be for life, or death
Well, this morning, it's over the mourning of one of our little brothers
This brother was a good brother
He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble
But it's one thing...
It's one thing!
It's one thing...

He was the wrong nigga to fuck with!"
Ice Cube,Gangsta Fairytale 2,/i/ice+cube/gangsta+fairytale+2_20066674.html,"Intro: Little Russ

Hey motherfuckin Cube, what the fuck wrong with you?
You didn't kick the rest of that Gangsta Fairytale shit
Why don't you kick it one good time
Niggaz on the playground wanna know what's happenin
You left em hangin man, what the fuck?

Verse One: Ice Cube

Little Boy Blue is outta Folsome
Now them three little pigs gotta roast him
Drivin down Sesame Street and I bet
That little motherfucker's out fuckin Smurfette
Ain't saw the wolf yet, but it's no doubt
They'll catch his ass slippin at his grandma house
They got the Mac-10 pointed out the coop
Cause they gotta follow they nose like Fruit Loops
Peeped out Little Miss Muffet on her tuffet eatin grits
She saw the Mac-10 and the bitch had the s***s
Ran into her house, called up her crew
Cause Red Riding Hood wants to kill Little Boy Blue
And the wolf too, what is Mister Rogers doing?
Moved out his Jordan, bought him a Ewing
Him, Little Boy Blue and the wolf in the cellar
Planning on gettin Cinderella
Cause Cinderella still works for the pigs
Through with the dwarfs, fuckin Bebe's kids
Now Snow White got the horny ass fever
Fuckin the Beauty's Beast like Jungle Fever
Now the word's on the street
When the crews meet
You better make some fuckin room
Cause it's on with the pigs and them other nigs
When the cow jump over the moon, everybody jump

Verse Two

Now Little Boy Blue is up front
With the nine millimeter, ready for the hunt
Little Red Riding Hood caught his ass slippin
Drew down on the boy cause the bitch is steady trippin
About to get loose with the deuce deuce
That's when the boy said, ""What about the gang truce?""
The little hoe had no words
The wolf came around and the bitch got served
Three little pigs bought wigs
Dressed like sheep, Cinderella is Little Bo Peep
Tryin to creep, on the crew
The wolf, the Rogers, the Blue, they through
Cause the pigs did the buck buck bang, ping
Now you hear the fat lady sing
Cinderella, ran like a bitch
To the pay phone cause the bitch is still a snitch
Now the pigs are caught by the pigs and taken
In the pen to get fried like bacon
You still can't trust no hoe
And Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories, should go

Outro: Little Russ

Yeah Cube, man that shit was dope nigga
You all that and a bowl of grits
Nigga that shit was on props, nigga!
Yeah that's how you kick that shit for the ninety-deuce, nigga
What's happenin nigga?!
Yeah nigga that's Gangsta Fairytale part 2 nigga
All you trick-ass niggaz can't fuck with it"

If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy
All my niggaz that's wit me
All my bitches are picky
To ride around that's right on time
Bitch you know it's tricky
Take a hit of the sticky
Everybody get tipsy

I'm a gangsta rap teacher, nigga you better know it
It's the don gotti Jr. Slash motherfuckin' poet
Sit back and take notes while I spin like 100 spokes
My flow is razor sharp I'm comin' straight for ya throat
With that west coast gang bang
Watch him when his chain hang
East coast down south
Niggaz do the same thang
Throw up ya dubs like wutang who bang
Harder than that nigga barrellin' thru ya hood wit two chains
Swangin' like he's nuts, cuz he don't give a fuck
I know nigga that ain't bangin' in no khaki's or some chucks
It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this

Ice Cube,Ghetto Bird,/i/ice+cube/ghetto+bird_20066662.html,"Verse One:

Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood is up to no good.
You think all the girls around here are trickin
Up there lookin like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say
""I'm going down, mayday, mayday.""  I'm gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
""So fly like an eagle.""
But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make it's heard
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

[""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird"" (2x)]

Verse Two:

Now..
My homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the four next
Now the four I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didn't see it whippin' in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em.""
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a you, here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious
You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming
Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup
Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my ten-four
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
'cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird

""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh...
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse. ""

Verse Three:

Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the B. M.?
See, I didn't want to gank you
But don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get yo the hood, and you might guess
That a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""
I bust me a left from Rubellon.  Park
The 735 and I'm bailin
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man,
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I close the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two A. M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird

""Which way is he going now?""
""Ok, now.. Now he's.. He's actually southbound.. On a service street..
And, uh... Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure
Out which service srteet he suddelny turned off on.  Uh, the sherriffs
Are.. Are... Well I know that... Sherriffs ground units got thrown off""

When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm down for my set I'm a vet
Smokin' on a wet cigarette
(who these niggas think they are)
(wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar)
I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs
'cause these westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslve us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
('cause sometimes I feel like a nut don't give a fuck when I open ya up)
Hot rocks fly from the back seat and
Busta ass niggas run like a track meet
An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' than a little (what)
Killer king is the hospital
Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that
I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning takin' out the trash
Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)
Tryin' be ghetto stars they said:
Are you from the westside is it so?

As I enter I. C. You.
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to
Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don't work it don't even hurt (damn)
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube

Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang hospital for a crippal now I'm drinkin' rippal
Same corner same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hoodrat hoes I'm fired
They mad 'cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody wanna put they dope on me
Sayin' I won't get searched by the lapd
I'm sitting on a doorway duece five
Dependin on that to keep my ass alive
I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six
My fuckin legs, lookin like tooth picks
Some times I can't deal got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine
Just to maintain nutin' to gain nutin' to lose
And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom
Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold

There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet

""Yo, man, let me tell you somethin'

Your daughter was a nice girl, now she is a s***
A queen treatin' niggaz just like King Tut
Gobblin' up nuts, sorta like a humming bird
Suckin' up the Lench Mob crew and I'm comin' third

Used to get straight A's, now she just skippin' class
Oh, my, do I like to grip the hips and ass
Only seventeen, with a lot of practice
On black boys jimmies and white boy's cactus

Sorry, sorry sir, but I gotta be brief
A lotta niggaz like bustin' nuts in her teeth
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic
That don't mean shit, 'cuz she's givin' up the ass quick

Quicker than you can say, ""Candy""
The bitch is on my snicker and oh man
She can take on three men built like He Men
Her little bitty twat got gallons of semen

Fourteen niggaz in line ready to bang yo'
Pride and joy, I mean daddy's little angel
Tell the little bitch to bring her ass out the house
'Cuz your daughter's known, for givin' up the nappy dug out

I got a big old ding a ling and if that bitch remains
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out

I got a big old ding a ling, and if that bitch remains
I'm gonna do my thing with your daughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out

With that old god damn bullshit, you girlie ass motherfucker
You better get out of here witcho' fine ass
Man, you're a little fine motherfucker""

Mister, mister, before you make me go
I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad
Get her all alone and out comes the kneepads

I know she is a minor and it is illegal
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio
And if you decide to call rape
We got the little hooker on tape, now

Tell the fuckin' s*** to please hurry up
And wear that dress that's tight on her butt
So I can finger fuck on the way to the bed
Been in so many rooms, she got a dot on her forehead

Face turnin' red from grabbin' them ankles
Fuck and get up is how I do them stank hoes
You should hear how she sounds with a c***
And her boots get knocked, from here to Czechoslovakia

Two are on top, one on the bottom
First nigga got the boots, man, you shoulda shot him
'Cuz after I got 'em it was over
Now niggaz get lucky like a four leaf clover

On daddy's little girl
She keeps nuts in her mouth like the bitch was a squirrel
So tell Cheryl to bring her ass home
'Cuz the line at my house is gettin' long, ay

I got a big old ding a ling and if that bitch remains

What'cha doin', boy? Turn in that blood clot
Buck shots, they fly through drug spot
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot
Clean cop, clean cop, fuckin' with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Mothafucka tried to blow me out me Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop 'em down when these bitches try to lock me down
Hit the ground hit the turf
Warp the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse that a make yo ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West Coast war lord blacker than the Black Knight
Fuck a black and white when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop filling out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sista off course
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course

Ain't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops
And my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox
Hold up, nigga, I'm a rider
You's a roll-up, yep the controller
Make me mad that's when I get swole up
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs knock off the rust
Throw my hands up you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try to get aggressive nigga off the porch

Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?
Hell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig'll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

On a friday, the get high day
Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade
Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?
A sight to behold, break the mold

Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought

Told the truth and we lie

And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me

They hate when you got a dime piece
And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one
When I'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh

Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this

But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--

Would you stay down like Hillary?
Even if you thought about killin' me?

Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court
On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out
Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex

Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni
But fuck the world don't aks me for shit
Unless you my boo, and I'm fuckin' you

But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal
First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir)
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella
Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's [?]
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep
He said, yo niggaz we should flip it like this
Cause them _Boyz N the Hood_ like the gangsta shit
I put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real

I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)

Them niggaz on tour and they comin our way
Lil' Eminem is still tucked away
In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape
Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other niggaz got raped
Same niggaz turned around and said fuck me
No fuck you cause I'm down with Chuck D
And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, nigga it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang

I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey

From _Boyz N the Hood_, to _XXX 2_
Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say ""We love you Cube!""
I wanna take time to say I love you too
I love all my fans cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some fuckin play toy
A lot of niggaz say I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody fuck wit'chu
Cause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black & blue
And how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see her
White folks worry 'bout them fuckin misdemeanor
While black people dyin in that God damn arena
Just because I'm actin nigga never stop rappin
It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin
Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket

Listen to the preacherman
But are you talkin' to me
I can't hear you with a mouth full of pig's feet
If I should need the swine flesh
Your body is a mess, but you're blessed
With a father, son, spirit and the holy ghost
But my whole neigborhood is comatose
Lookin' for survival
The devil made you a slave and he gave you a bible
400 years gettin' our ass kicked
By so-called christians and catholics
But I watch 'em burn in a fire
See I'm a g, that's why I ain't in your choir
Cause I see, cause I know
The church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
Get the devil to a 187
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven

Verse two:

You're waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
Clown, take a look around
Just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
A beast in sheep's clothing
But I'm rollin' with that knowledge of self
Cause heaven ain't just wealth
So mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe
Do I have to wait outside?
White man, please take another look
Cause we couldn't be readin' out of the same book
Cause youse a crook and I'm a brother
King james had s** with his mother
Is that your edition? Is that your religion?
Black man, you gotta make a desicion
Cause God is comin' on day number seven
And he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven

Verse three:

The same white man that threw me in the slammer
He bombed the church in alabama
So if I c*** the hammer, God won't mind
If I have to kill the human swine
Cause God is a killer from the start
Why you think noah had to build his ark
And God is a man from his feet to his hair
That's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer
I just stare at the church man
Spendin' more money on the church band
But elijah's got a plan
Got the white man screamin': 'damn that farrakhan! '
Cause one day these babies are uprise
Much more than bowties and bean pies
Kickin' knowledge at 7-11
And they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven"

My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go

[Ice Cube, Verse 2]

Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' mothafucka just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit

[Chorus ]

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come

Yo, I wanna get high
I wanna get high

Walking through campus with my backpack
Bailin' to orientation
So I can change the nation
See many faces but none of 'em mirror me
Show my I'd to the punk ass security
Step on the quad lookin' for the track squad
Walked by a bitch who think she's god
Passing me a flyer talkin' 'bout the messiah
She wanna take me higher
Keep your rhetoric in the heavens
Look and see a bro' with a fro like michael evans
Done spent 6 years in the college
Always telling me to question the knowledge
Sittin' in the black hole with the black stroll
And not even one cave bitch in our click
Sayin' fuck professor fitz
I come from the land of the bloods and the crips (what's up nigga)
Don't like scholarships because they hurt me
Nothin' but a slave to the university
That's why ya see me on the track field run by ya
Caught by a liar who wanna take me higher

Chorus

Shit, he wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me, shit shit
I wanna get high so high
Chocolate thai

Verse 2:

I wanna take flight ya goddamn right
It's a party every fucking night
Been there for about 6 weeks
Walked by the freaks
Look, black greeks
How the fuck ya figure
I dig ya me bein' from niggafied nigga
White boy in the room with me
Who never saw bet what the fuck
He's about to erupt and turn red
Start hangin' with the muthafuckin' skinheads
'cause he can't deal with the overkill
College ain't nothin' but niggerville
And he regret that his school is filled
With niggers jews and wetbacks
Plus chinks now he drinks
Hour after hour screaming white power
Motherfucker want me to call him sire
He wanna take me higher

Chorus

Shit he wanna take me higher
Shit wait until they get a load of me
Shit shit shit

Verse 3:

A girl gets date raped just like that
At a frat now she chase the cat
Feminist saying women is god's gift
Do you need a lift can I take a sniff
Do I sound sexist cause I'm chasin'
After deja she from texas?
Down to kick the asses of the fascists
Who wanna put me in the oven and burn me to ashes
But I'm not burnin' the world keeps turnin'
And nobody learnin'
'cause college is full of shit
Teachin' me to memorize nothin' but the lies
Chillin' at a rally for peace
The beast from white power up in the tower
With the m-1 gun and a scope on dope
Thinkin' he's the great white hope
Motherfucker levels off
He wanna see me 6 feet deep shoveled off
Cause columbus university is nothing but a empire
Who wanna take me higher

Chorus:

Shit they wanna take me higher
Wait until they get a load of me
Shit they wanna take me higher
They wanna take me higher
Unh damn they wanna take me higher
Damn wait until they get a load of me
Damn unh they wanna take me they wanna take me

Man I aint gon be shit in the morning after drinking that uh...

(Ice Cube)
If I can sell you the american dream, I can sell you anything

[Verse 1-Ice Cube]
I got to get out, I'm getting put out of my house
I got to pack up, my refrigerator and couch
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L. A. P. D. Will smoke me out
This adjustable rate, it choke me out
They gave me a loan and I had no clout
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Call my momma and my aunt,
Y'all should re-finance,
I let them dance with the devil,
Dig they own grave and I gave them the shovel
Fuck, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house
Is this the american dream, or the american scheme?
That got me walking these american streets?
It's kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,
Cuz you help your grandmama move furniture

(Pause) if I can sell you the american dream, I can sell you anything,

Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package
I can give a fuck about a dow Jones average
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like the son of Sam
I'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand
Imma feel like superman,
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man
It's the revenge of the lambs:
""big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams""
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance
Walk in to his office, took the 9 out my pants
You're not a man, you're a servant
Then I prayed to God and let the 9 get to work

[Chorus](Ice Cube)
I better get to workin'
You know I heard they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping 'em
You know I heard they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping 'em

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

[Verse 2- Ice Cube]
Uh, drug dealer M. D
Doctor feel good, give you what you need
In California, prescribe that weed
Oxycontin and Codeine
Turn your grandmama into a fiend
I see the sign, not at first, it ain't free
I know you bout to die, but let me see your I. D
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest
We can't save your life until you get some insurance
Your premium is paid, at that assurance
I hope you got endurance,
They got me on hold and I'm under the influence
Nurse high as a kite,
In charge with my life,
And everything is lost,
Without blue cross

[Chorus](Ice Cube)
You know I heard they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping 'em

You know I heard they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping 'em

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

Whatever you need, we got it for cheap right here baby
This America, it ain't gon' cost ya nothin...

Horny little devil, you gotta back up
Horny little devil, you can't bust a nut

Lookin' at my girlfriend's black skin
You wanna jump in but she don't like white men
So don't throw that work you fuckin' jerk
Or get your punk devil ass hurt, motherfucker

She ain't with the pale face
'Cause y'all fuck at a snail's pace
And you might get sprayed with mace from the ebony
So when she's doin' her job you better let her be

Don't try to pinch the gluterus
Thinkin' that you're about to knock out the uterus
'Cause she'll tell you to kiss her ass quick
And where I'm from, devils get their ass kicked

Mr. Sexual Harassment
Askin' for a blow and when the answer is, ""Fuck, no""
Looks like you wanna terminate
But that's when I go psycho like Norman Bates

I wanna kill the devil for talkin' shit
'Cause he can't get a taste of the chocolate
African breast 'cause white bitches
Have no butt and no chest

Black women have bodies like goddesses
Sorta like Venus but put away your penis
'Cause the devil is a savage motherfucker
That's why I'm lighter than the average brother

'Cause you raped our women and we felt it
But it'll never happen again if I can help it

Horny little devil must be a F A G
Tryin' to fuck me out my land and my manhood
Have me broke eatin' spam and canned goods

Lockin' down on my neighborhoods
Treat me less than a man 'cause right now you got the upper hand
But my ass is a virgin, you might have fucked the Indians
But you can't surgeon me

And when I'm on top, I won't be fuckin' ya
I'd rather put a buck in ya
'Cause I hate the devil with a passion
And when I see the whites of his eyes I start blastin'

Dig a hole and throw his ass in
And I won't be happy 'til I'm down to my last ten
Get his fuckin' pitchfork
Tie him up and then feed the bitch pork

Little devil can't fuck me out my pay
'Cause horny little devil true niggaz aren't gay
And you can't play with my Yo-Yo
And definitely you can't play with me, you fuckin' homo

'Cause we'll blow your head off
And turn that white sheet into a red cloth
Plus when they're all dead
I can cut that jheri juice and get a bald head

Then let it nap up
Go down to the corner store and beat the Jap up
Clean all the crap up out my city
Now the whole block look shitty

Put his dick on a wood block
Swing, swing, swing, and chop, chop, chop
Now who's the next to nut
Color me bad but you can't s** me up

So don't even try to put your dick on a die
'Cause this is what, why in 1991and I'ma get my gun
Put an end to the devil
So get a fuckin' shovel

I'm so horny

Ice Cube,How To Survive In South Central,/i/ice+cube/how+to+survive+in+south+central_20066692.html,"""and now, the wonderous world of..""
""hey, come to los angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement.. ""
""hey bone, hey nigga where you at though? ""
""hello, my name is elaine --
And I'll be your tour guide through south central los angeles""

[ice cube]
How to survive in south central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In south central, yeah, that's how you survive

""hi this is elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in south central los angeles,
Or is somebody taking your things?  Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again. ""
""this is los angeles."" ""this is los angeles.""

[ice cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggaz get got
In either L. A., compton or watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
And you won't survive in south central

""now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on tv.
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
Punk motherfucker! ""

And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to dj chilly chill
Sir jinx, aiyyo cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in south central
God damnit!

[ice cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
Cause south central L. A., is one big yearn
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L. A. Heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in south central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
You tramp-ass hoes?  You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
You know what time it is. South central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip God damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I wanna send a shout-out to e-dog, the engineer,
Puttin his two cents in..

Fuck that, another West Coast banger
Who gives a fuck if they play it in Virginia
Imma play it on Banker, play it on Western
All of bad ass will make your head turn
Motherfuckers wanna take our style
And run that shit 3000 miles
Then, rub your shit all in our face
This war show all at our place, damn
Can a nigga get a lil ol taste
Of some of that shine, it look like mine

[Chorus:]
Doin my own (own) thing (thing)
And if you got a problem with that
Then the nina go bang (bang) bang (bang)
And I be everywhere on the map but
I rep that West (9x)
(Repeat)

[Outro:]
Yall know what it is
Is this too West Coast for you motherfuckers?
So what, sanctioned by the ogs of America
The Grand Wizard is a certified G
That mean genius bitch
That mean genius, bitch"

Than most niggers do in their whole lifetime. ""

[Cube] Huh-huh, huh-Hah..
""I'm comin!"" [repeat 3X]
[Cube] I'm comin!

[Verse One]
I wanna kill him, cause he tried to play me like the trick
But you see, I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
I got the A to the motherfuckin K, and it's ready to rip
Slapped in my banana clip
And I'm lookin.. (lookin..)
Is he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?
It seems like he got the whole country behind him
So it's sort of hard to find him
But when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth
Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
And that shit ain't fly
So now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by
And when you hear this shit,
It make the world say ""DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.""

""Do the niggaz run this moth-er-fuck-er?"" [repeat 2X]

[door knocking]
""Momma!!  Some man at the front do'!""
""Sit yo' ass down.""
""Uhh hi.. I have reason to believe that someone in this household
Has just turned eighteen, am I correct? ""

[Verse Two]
Here's why I wanna kill the punk
Cause he tried to take a motherfuckin chunk of the funk
He came to my house, I let 'em bail in
Cause he said he was down with the L. M.
He gave up a little dap
Then turned around, and pulled out a gat
I knew it was a caper
I said, ""Please don't kill my mother,"" so he raped her
Tied me up, took me outside
And I was thrown in a big truck
And it was packed like sardines
Full of niggaz, who fell for the same scheme
Took us to a place and made us work
All day and we couldn't have shit to say
Broke up the families forever
And to this day black folks can't stick together
And it's odd..
Broke us down, made us pray - to his God
And when I think about it,
It make me say ""DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.""

""I'm comin!"" [repeat 3X]

[Verse Three]
Now in ninety-one, he wanna tax me
I remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me
And hang me by a rope til my neck snapped
Now the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap
And put me under dirt or concrete
But God, can see through a white sheet
Cause you the devil in drag
You can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag
Try to give me the H-I-V
So I can stop makin babies like me
And you're givin dope to my people chump
Just wait til we get over that hump
Cause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast
Can't bury rap, like you buried jazz
Cause we stopped bein whores, stop doin floors
So bitch you can fight your own wars
So if you see a man in red white and blue
Gettin janked by the Lench Mob crew
It's a man who deserves to buckle
I wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!

Tried it again and I failed to grasp

Light brown and a fly hair-do
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her

I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like rain dance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the comfort inn
Tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said will you call me

[shit..]
[Yo..]
Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which court, are y'all playin basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking brothers everyway like M. J.
I can't believe, today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a niggaz direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! Mtv Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
And now I am yelling dominoes
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L. A.
Today was a good day

Left my niggaz house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A. K.
I got to say it was a good day.

Hey wait, wait a minute fool
Stop the shit
What the fuck am I thinking about?"

They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...

(yo-yo)
First of all let me tell you my name it's yo-yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, yo-yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

This is a man's world thank you very much

But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch



(ice cube)
Ah miss yo-yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is ice cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

(yo-yo)
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

But you don't know how funky that I can get

Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

But I don't party and shake my butt
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircurs
And it'll drive you nuts
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch

Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin
And it sounds so sweet
Ice cube and the lench mob, is jackin for beats

Verse three:

Ice cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it
Locate a dope break, and then I break it
And give it that gangsta lean
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass
I make punk suckers run and duck because
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm audi
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me
But I know, none of y'all can get with me
So you think you're protected
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove

I'm sick of these rap niggas lyin' 'bout they rich (what?)
Lyin' 'bout they bitch (what?)
Lyin' 'bout they dick (what?)
I'm sick of these rap niggas lyin' 'bout they hits (huh?)
Lyin' 'bout they whips (huh?)

Illuminaughty, bitch hoes in they body
We the riders, we push like mahz-er-aties
Do karatees, on hatters, and you hotties
Fuck the party, come on, my niggas focus
We the richest, pretend that we the brokest
Niggas notice, as soon as you're checking quotas
We the coldest, so go and tell the rollers (biotch!)

[Verse Four Gangsta]
Who dat? Next out the game, in blue kahks
Gangsta's the name, niggas wonderin' how I do that
By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way
Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way
I'm on grates when I'm grindin'
I'm on stakes when I'm dinnin'
And on sunday's on the wine
Is you can't calm the savage beast (never)
And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)
Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for
We got the fish scale texture (fish scale)
Now if you cook it yourself you get extras
Dub that shit to death with this dub thang
Only a few niggas left with this love mang
So we cop together (yeah), put it in the beeker
Rock together (uhh), claim blocks together
And fuck c*** together, nigga (brrrph!)

[Ice Cube Chorus X2]
Niggas want that gutter shit
Fuck that other shit, that play it for your mother shit
Ain't the rugged shit

[Squeek Rule]

[Verse Five Squeek Rule]
Look in my eyes
I see the dollar sign dogg, and my dick start to rise
Got to handle money, got to stack the money (tell 'em)
Buzzin' like a bee 'cause I crave for the honey
Million dollar tickets make bitches look wicked
So you innocent hoes, ain't got to like ta kick it
I know you knows (uhh), 'cause now my decimals (yep)
Done fiend for the green, keep you itchin' in your panty hose
Your eyes full of gleem (brrrmmph!)
You wanna get on my team, and live my dream
Captain of the ship is what I'm boastin'
Hit the three wheel motion, I'm the shit when I'm coastin' (uh huh)
Down the boulevard, flossin' hard
Lights hit the chrome, don't go lick 'em like a movie star
Money makes me a savage (what it do?)
Shit, I brake down the world for the cabbage (Squeek Rule)

[Bridge Ice Cube]

Uh-huh, understand this
I don't give a fuck about what y'all talkin about
I ain't tryin to hear none of that shit
Nigga I'ma do what I wanna do
When I wanna do it, how I wanna do it
And you better hope I don't do it to you
Now, I don't care what momma got to say
I don't care what grandmomma got to say
Nigga I'm grown
Let me tell you a lil' somethin about me

I was born not to give a fuck, wanna drink, get your cup
Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up
Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up
My own momma can't keep me from loc'n up
One ear out the other, one man out to smother
The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother
Fuck you undercovers and you dirty motherfuckers
In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers
Club hop, bar hop, car shop, nail shop
To the mall, spend it all, why the hell not
What bills, what rent, don't know what's spent
Why you care, do you work for the government?

[Chorus:]
Fuck it homey, I'ma laugh now and cry later
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later
All you players you can laugh now and cry later
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later

[Ice Cube]
See I'm a product of this urban decay
A nigga dyin for tomorrow, but live for today
A nigga lie steal and borrow, and cheating's okay
Don't you tell these motherfuckers that my name is O'Shea
Cause I'ma fuck up my baby's credit, let him regret it
7 months old he's already got a jail record
I'm the one to blame, put it in my momma name
She's a drama queen, but I got the bling bling
I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings
I need you all to show up at my hearings
Tell the judge I'm a nice nigga, good nigga
And I'ma play the sad face when he look nigga

[Chorus:]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
""The number you are calling was lost, and cannot be called back""
""Your last call return service""

[Ice Cube]
It's fucked up, that y'all won't accept my calls
Tell momma, at least she can send some drawers
These walls, make y'all forget about me
I'm comin home, in 2033
But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent
What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate
She start lyin to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin
Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin
Bun in the oven, it belong to my cousin
Got the nerve, to tell me that you really love me
(What?) I'ma kill her ass when a nigga make parole
Hit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old

[Chorus:]

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Man, it ain't right man
Y'know y'all ain't doin me right man
A nigga tryin to do right man
Y'know I'm tryin to change my life man, y'know?
I done found the Lord while I'm in here, y'know?
I I'm tryin to do right now, I mean
Y'know I'm sorry for everythang
That I, I I mean y'know
That's fucked up how y'all doin me man
Y'all niggaz could at least send me somethin

Little locs are harder then the O-G's 
You fall to the ground and beg please

Sendin' more kites than Benjamin Franklin 
20 years old but ya still a veteran 
Won't touch down til we're livin' like the Jetsons 
Proud of ya self, because ya done done it 
Gotcha 22's and your name on your stomach 
Never even think about a woman to fuck 
Rather stand in line or bust the ass of a young buck 
Got stuck, now you're bleedin'
Hospital ward, is got your reading 
Learn about the knowledge of self ya see 
That ya mad enough to go and stick the death to these 
See, it ain't about bein hard 
But that's what'cha tell the little homies in the yard 
Ya already done did 10 
And wish you could start all over again 
Brand new inmates and who do ya see 
Your baby brother in shackles, a fool, a lil' ass gee

You can lick me up and down till i yell stop!

I gots ta make a livin, i out ta get mo;
Money, and got more nuts for ya honey; so

Don't sweat 'em, just let 'em play that hardcore
Role; we still cool, but just make it smooth...

[Ice Cube]
You know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How i keep from goin under, i'm chocolate thunder;
Ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin
And i blend with the tracks, see i'm black
K-dee is the mack; matter fact
Niggas hit me up with the c's and b's
But you don't wanna fuck wit these
Cos i'll put 'em on ya
And we'll have to wake ya mothafuckin ass up with ammonia
Cos hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop
Devoid of pop; and if i drop another smooth hit
It'll still be hard, cos i helped start this shit;

We in a fight for our lives
And the trick thing about it
I don't know if we can win
And what's sad? I don't thing we wanna win

[Verse 1- Ice Cube]
Can you help me? A n-gga need a job
I'm desperate, for some corn on the cob
I'm helpless, will I have to steal and rob?
No black? Dinner so I got to ask bob
Bob got a job but it's done by a robot
No lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
More than a human being and it's European,
Ran by a Korean, American,
So there I am, surrounded by aluminum
There's no way you can run,
There's no way you can be,
It's just and me, versus modern day machinery

[Chorus - Ice Cube] x2
It's man vs machine baby
My head's in the guillotine baby
It might take it off clean baby
Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[Verse 2 - Ice Cube]
I'm a fly caught in the web
A fish stuck in the internet
Don't they know I'm a deathly catch?
Eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
So what can I say to you?
I'm highly relatable and biodegradable
I thought we was unfadeable
Slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
I don't need you to f-ck 24/7
I guess that computer love
I don't need you to love
Human contact ain't what it used to was

[Chorus - Ice Cube] x2
It's man vs machine baby
My head's in the guillotine baby
It might take it off clean baby
Automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

It need to be investigated
When people are eliminated
What we supposed to do when it's time to feed all the babies?

[Verse One]
Here's another topic I'm addressin
So learn a quick lesson, about your Smith and Wesson
Sit your ass back and comprehend
As I let you know about man's best friend
Now remember: it used to be a dog like Lassie
But now in ninety-one it's a gun if you asked me
Just like a jimmy hat's used for protection
I use my nine when suckers start to flexin
Cause if you run up and try to play mine
I'd rather have a ak than a fuckin canine
Cause if you shot your gun, and my dog tried to fetch her
Me and the dog's goin out on a stretcher
And I ain't with that, so I gotta get that
Big black gat, aim and I hit that
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den
Nowadays.. A gat is man's best friend

[Chorus + Cube saying ""Man's best friend"" after *3 first time]

[Verse Two]
Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack
Just in case the little punks try to jack
I can't put a motherfuckin pitbull
Under a coat, in the small of my back
So I gotta take my beretta, and I betcha
It'll probably work, a 100 percent better
Cause it'll keep me out of danger
With sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber
So this goes to all y'all intruders
Beware of the owner, cause the owner is a shooter
I don't just wanna give your ass rabies
I'd rather have your ass pushing up daisies
And I can't do that with Benji,
Rin Tin Tin, or Spuds Mckenzie
Forget about a dog fool, he'll shit in the den
Nowadays, a gat is man's best friend

""Just don't let me see you shoot no dogs!""
""Hey, I got shots fired here, send me another unit""

Over thirty, white, male, middle class""  [Peter Jennings]

Motherfucker, you'd better break yourself...

[ice cube]
My skin is my sin, look at my complexion
Section 8, erection great
Balls like ru paul and a big fat plank
Get you higher than a spike lee joint
See I'm a chicken hawk and I'm hunting chicken and watermelon
It ain't nothing but hard time bailing
Just got a misdomener
Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as sarafina
Get the hell out somolia, we didn't call y'all
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all
Fuck reggie denton and jimmy (johnny) cochran
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him
I plead guilty your honor
Cause I dissed the pope more times than sinead o'connor
Huh huh, cool, like butthead and beavis
Truer than the mack but I'm downer than he is
And that police chief named willie
Can take his motherfucking ass back to philly
Dropped a bomb on a crew named ""move""
Years ago, here's a hoe
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm khadafi
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy
They want to give me ten in the pen cause I'm smelling like hen
My skin is my sin

My s-k-i-n is my s-i-n (""burning our black skin"") (repeat 2x)

[ice cube]
I get around like tupac, just bought a new glock
And I want what you got
So please give it up so I can live it up
Just like the rich but I still eat grits
I don't know karate
But I can still beat the dog shit out of nazis
You claim you want to put in work
Plotting to blow up a church
See you devils are all the same
You'll gun down a congregation in jesus' name
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep
Lamb of god, and it's odd
That allah is a man that don't need a tan
And you can't stand when I talk like that
And why do black men have to walk like that?
Cause we swing low like a chariot
And now I got harriet all on my dick
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10
My skin is my sin

My s-k-i-n is my s-i-n (""burning our black skin"") (repeat 2x)

[w.c.]
Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?
Standing like a g pissing on america's flag
Dub c, the nigga from westside
Westide maad circle bailing with a double barrel
Cause uh, my skin is my sin
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on jesus
I'm calling mad dog for the 9 millimeters
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest
And a bitch by the name of america's on it
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers
And the indians took my motherfucking religion
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?
Like jim kelly said, ""you try to set me up? "" shit...
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?
Like pepsi, niggas got a new generation
And we don't want your american education
Ain't no brain washing this way
Fuck america, tom meztger, and kkk
And to the cracker named j.b. stoner
Don't let me catch you on no corners
I see you on tv talking more shit
But just like your punk-ass anscestors, you's a bitch
You's a bitch if I ever saw one
Grand wizard bring your ass on imperial so we can get physical
And watch God show and prove
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules
So run devil run, you's to best start running
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming
And ain't no way you gon' win
Cause I come from a tribe of o.g.'s and my skin is my sin

My s-k-i-n is my s-i-n (""burning our black skin"") (repeat 2x)"

This is the final boarding call for flight 1259
Departing from los angeles, final destination to st. louis
Thank you

[ice cube]
Damn g, the spot's gettin hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggaz through a microscope
In l.a. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to st. louis
That's cool, cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty
Cause where we stayin, niggaz look shady
But they can't fade south central
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental
Checkin out every block close
Seein which one will clock the most
Yeah this is the one no doubt
Bust a u bone, and let's clear these niggaz out

Ay ay man, whassup nigga?
Yo, well this lench mob nigga!
*gun shots*

Now clearin em out meant casualties
Still had the l.a. mentality
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a driveby in missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slangin in the valley
Triple the profit makin more than I did in cali
Breakin off rocks like barney rubble
Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
Nineteen-ninety-one tony montana
Now the shit's like a war
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before
Punks whirl when the gat bust
Four jheri curl niggaz kickin up dust
And some of them are even lookin up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss
Giving up much love
Dyin for a street, that they ain't even heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on

[tv announcer]
Top of the news tonight, gangs from south central
Los angeles which are known for their driveby shootings
Have migrated into east st. louis
Leaving three dead and two others injured
No arrests have been made
Police say this is a nationwide trend
With similar incidents occuring in texas, michigan, and oklahoma
(female voice repeating in background:
""if it can happen here, it can happen anywhere"")

[ice cube]
Boom, my homie got shot he's a goner black
St. louis niggaz want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggaz still can't stick together
Fuckin police got the four-one-one
That l.a. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinkin, bout the boys
Feudin, like the hatfields and mccoys
Now the shit's gettin tricky
Cause now they lookin for the colors and the khakis
Damn, the spot's gettin hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin in seattle
But the narcs, raid about six in the morning
Try to catch a nigga while he's yawnin
Put his glock to my chest as I paused
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryin to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the crips and bloods by hand g
Plus the black guerilla family
And the white pride don't like northside
And it's a riot if any more niggaz die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
Cause look at the motherfuckin years that I'm facin
I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up
My life is fucked"

We the worsest, all purpose
You want murderers?
Well you Serve us, hattin' motherfuckers with curb dust
You heard us, don't shit make us nervous
Not even when these fuckin' feds try to serve us
Mention me, when you write it in your history
As a niggaare with the key to the mistery
Grand motta ain word don't mean shit to me
Who gives a fuck what they think, and what they see
Live how I got to live
Give what I got to give
Teach my kids positive, as well as the negative
Hope to raise better kids
The world needs a seditive, pray to god that we let him live

--'cause you bad guy!--I'm the nigga of the century

(verse two)  {1: 32}
A nigga told me to keep hope alive
Survive, and 95 'ill get you paradise
So I tried, nigga had to swallow his pride
But look into my eyes, I'm too wise to cook fries
Twelveth grade graduation, summer vacation
Mama said get the facin' on them applications
Didn't know back then, I was too young
Public school made me dumb as a motherfucker
What should I do in my life
Reverend Price, do you got some advice
Before I roll the dice
A nigga don't wanna shoot craps, 'cause it ain't all fun and games
When you tryin' to get that money mang
Gangbang, maintain or slang cane
T. V. Got a nigga where he can't use his brain
What the fuck you talkin' bout, choose or loose
Bitch I don't know the motherfuckin' rules! (for real)

Who am I when it's do or die
You can see a man's sould thru the human eye
Can't spend all your lifetime gettin' high
'cause you and I got to do, for you and I
Acktin' wild as a jevenile
Now my whole life depends on the outcome of a trial
Wait-pow! These people ain't playin' now
Got to bring 85 percent of the time now
Fuck that, rather roll with the ruff pack
In the jet black, listenin' to ruff rap
See it's quite simple, you bitches ass niggas don't know
What I've been thru, the weather's presedential
The warfare's mental, I sell my soul to the lord
For the perfect instrumental
And the number two pencil
And all the hussle found in chromasones of my kinfolk

And kept on stompin',
When y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta compton.
Livin' with the whites, one big house,

Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls,
'cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers.
Gang-banged by your manager, fella,
Gettin' money out your ass, like a mothafuckin' ready teller.
Givin' up the dollar bills,
Now they got the villain with a purse and high-heels.
So don't believe what ren say,
'cause he's goin' out like kunte kinte,
But I got a whip for ya toby;
Used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me.
It's a case of divide-and-conquer,
'cause you let a jew break up my crew.
House nigga gotta run and hide,
Yellin' compton, but you moved to riverside.
So don't front, mc ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a b 2-10.
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke.
Let you on the scene to back up the verse team.
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart,
And they rippin' your asshole apart.
By takin' your green, oh yeah,
The villain does get fucked with no vaseline.

[refrain scratched]

I never have dinner with the president.
I never have dinner with the president.
I never have dinner with the president.
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant.
Now I think you a snitch,
Throw a house nigga in a ditch.
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys.
You little maggot; eazy e turned faggot.
With your manager, fella,
Fuckin' mc ren, dr. dre, and yella.
But if they were smart as me,
Eazy e would be hangin' from a tree.
With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline.
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on...
Till that jheri curl is gone.
On a permanent vacation, off the massa plantation.
Heard you both got the same bank account,
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple.
'cause you can't be the nigga 4 life crew
With a white jew tellin' you what to do.
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the silence of the lambs.
With a midget who's a punk too,
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you.
Eric wright, punk, always into somethin', gettin' fucked at night.
By mista shitpacker, bend over for the gotdamn cracker, no vaseline..."

To all the non-believers (Non-believers, non-believers, non-believers)
(Non-believers, non-believers, non-believers, non-believers)

[Verse 1]
I make a non-believer say, ""Oh my God""
Ain't nothin' too incredible for the Wizard of Oz
Ain't nothin' too regretable for me to lose no sleep
These the cards I was dealt, bitch, read 'em and weep
It's that West side rollin, pussies get swollen
Knockin' niggas down in the pen, I'm bowlin'
Controllin' everything I'm holdin'
I made a promise to myself
I'ma keep it gangsta always even in the hallways of corporate America, break down the barrier
Self-made, Koolaid, fuck what you say
Fuck what he say, pimpin' ain't easy
Don Mega put a dagger in your swagger
Rollin' zones, tell Mick Jagger
Fuck the chit-chatter
I got a bladder full of red cup liquor, yes, my nigga
Drinkin' out the pitcher, I turn water into wine like scripture
Make a toast, every dose is a overdose
And that ghost'll make your ass do the holy ghost

[Chorus]
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
We got some non-believers out there
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
They got to bow down when they need us

[Verse 2]
Boo, I pop up like a phantom
And niggas got to take the ass whoopin' that I hand 'em
Yup, the guys call me Samson, I'm dangerous with a Samsung
Call my niggas at random and they quick to make ugly outta handsome
Old rappers, I fuck up your grandson
New rappers, meet Charlie Manson
I brainwash your damn son, yup, he'll leave the house with a handgun
But if he ran into Zimmerman, pull it out homie, you ain't got to run
It's a cold, cold world for all these non-believers and underachievers
These fake ass bitches and divas
Where the fuck will they go when they leave us?

[Chorus]
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
We got some non-believers out there
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
They got to bow down when they need us

[Verse 3]
Don't get hogtied fuckin' with the raw hide
My four-five make the law hide
For life, gangsta for life
Think about your wife 'fore you play with your life
It's that rattlesnake from the battle state, trick
That python with the mic on, bitch
Palm trees are like napalm, grimy
In my hood he like Treyvon, try me
I'm walkin' home with my Skittles
The neighborhood watch first house to get riddled
Bust, leave bullets in your pillow
You fuckin' hero, don't make that bitch a widow
This gon' hurt just a little
White people, stop sayin' ""ghetto""
It's like the pot callin' the kettle
Damn, you the reason why we ghetto

We got some non-believers out there
Make believers outta non-believers
Make believers out the overseers
Make 'em bow down when they need us
They got to bow down when they need us

Havin' faith is believin' in somethin' you have yet to see
You got to believe in somethin', homie

Everytime you walk by you get my inspection
And all you gotta do now is make your selection
And it wont be hard to win this election

We got it all what you thought not at all
If you sicker then shit then take a Tylenol

I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - ""who is it? ""
It's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggers in the parking lot
She said fuck em, cause they get sparked alot
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table
Her brother walked in he's into gangbangin
Cause he walked up and said ""what set you claimin""
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of good times
I hate to feel bad but I'm in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage mossberg
The nigga said ""yo, what's for sale""
And the bitch came out with a bag of ya-yo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said bitch I didn't know this was a crack house
I got my coat and suddenly...
(police breaking into house annoucing themselves)
The cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed to my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet no slap jumped back
Stomped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to wrap me up, slap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said get out my face I musta had a grudge
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the patty wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects!"

I'm free, bombin on the first thing I see
And guess who walk in, with a nine, and a grin
It's the baby daddy he ain't playin, *gunshots*
He started layin everybody down, about face with a frown
I'm runnin to the bedroom, I lock the do'
And grab the phone, the bitch phone ain't turned on
I think I'm gone, that's when I hear a soft knock
It's the girl from two-ten, with her number, and a glock

You still fuckin with them faggets
We turn haters into maggets
Oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash
You broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me
Constantly, put the hustle down
With four or five niggas that's musclebound
Send your head to the taxidermist
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos
You got to earn this, you can't take it
Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit
Who is it, the exquisite, don mega
Walkin with my entourage, I think I'm betta, makin chedda
You see me sag in my jag, with the rag recognize the flag
You betta get back, everybody wanna do it like me
I got it made, been makin rap money since the tenth grade
(ch-ching)
(since the tenth grade)

Chorus

Verse 3: mr. Short khop
I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit
Uncandid, it's the young bandit
Fresh out the trenches, the wood works
City of the? Tempeon? , where the hoods lurk
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
>from shattered glass, down the pig locks
Want tips by the clock
You niggas scramblin for fouyan
And settle for crumbs and croutans
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin me, the army full honary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and saturns livin jenky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey
After ben frankeys, with the big skullen eyes
You niggas bound and nullified
Sit back and mine stack it multiply

This hardcore shit will make your home girl strip
Make you wanna take a sip of that red cup,
Guess what, rest up, don't give a fuck
Never did, small shit is irrelevant
Heaven knows only live for the hell of it
Know the elephant, hate anything celibate
Don't really give a damn, what I tell a bitch
Home going to the moon might see you soon
Try to get that outlaw out the saloon
Hear the click clack first then you hear the boom
Get the fuck off my clap, mushroom
Get out my face before I drop you

Grab ahold

If you wink, i'll make you ich think
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter
Shotgun enima, this ain't no cinema
All praises due to the creator

True, inventor of the double-you
What choo wanna do, I got the red and the blue
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
Record company death traps settin' decoys
Just to pimp young b-boys
With a cup full of yak, studio contact
Maniac with a contract
Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in

Pass through the W. S. (neighbor-hood)
Knowin I can do my best in Westwood
Cut off by a white bm, driven by a yuppie
He sticks up his finger like, ""Fuck me""
Now I gotta to follow him home, with my chrome
Send him to the Twilight zone, it's on
Niggaz say I'm gone cause I'm fuckin with the rich
(say what?) but they all full of bitch (yeah)
Don't need a snitch, so I'm rollin solo
In a straight bucket, no it ain't a low-low
He pulls up to a seven bedroom, eight bath
Oh yeah! He's got to feel the wrath
Pistola to the neck, devil turn off the Westec(?)
And when you're rollin have mo' respect (bitch)
Tied his ass up and took everything I could

Makin scared devils, move from my city
With the strong-arm, fuck the long arm of the law

Had to clock her with the handle, cause
Your husband's a thief with an S&L scandal
Don't feel bad if you're stuck up, ahhhh
Nobody move, nobody get - shut the fuck up!
I'm nervous, quick to serve this
Heat in yo' meat, make your blood skeet
A nigga just tryin to get on his feet
So hurry up rich bitch, before I twitch

The mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us

Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But self-destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the lench mob

To be down with the mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing

After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she wanna try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching

But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job

Pyroclastic flow, this is Pompeii
Whoever in the way, turn you into clay
Call me out my name and that's a hurricane
I'll send the wind and the water and the pouring rain
I am boring, mane, I am snoring, mane
I'm the pain that's wearing off the Novacane
I'm the weight you gained, I make your titties hang
I'm the crowded train that just hit the mane

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla"

Bulletin and we will return this motherfucker to ya as soon as the National
Guard move in.

Verse 1:

The cops wanna catch the nigga that won't fetch
But I'll blast ya, never call ya master
Who is that kickin up shit much faster?
Rollin on a scooter, you know I might do ya
See a black clock and my buckshots run right thru ya
I never knew ya
Cos I'm not a trick
You can suck the biggity-dick, I'm not the piggity-pig
I get away quickity-quick
On the plane to South Central
Never get played by the monkey wrench ho
Staedy mobbin I'm just like Robin Hood
Up to no good, so many bitches on my wood
To the right of me and to the left of me
Bitch, I got so much game I need a referee
Throw a penalty of ass interference
Damn, y'all over me, so bitch get on the bitch
Here comes the cops so I better hit the fence
Better run fast cos the dobermans pinch
And I won't play mine in the daytime
Goddamn, here comes the canine
Four legged copper that wants to use Ice Cube as a whopper
But who's the first nigga to outrun a chopper?
No lie say hi to the bad guy

Interlude: (*Cube talkin with officer*)

Fuck! (Hey guys, where ya headed?)

Verse 2:

See one-time, hit em up

People think Ice Cube roll with the gangs
Cos I'm in a coupe de sittin on thangs
Ain't gotta tell me twice about the jack
See a got a 9 in my lap ta take care of that
Caps get peeled on the regular
Cos niggas try to get me for my cellular
Knick knack paddy wack, the mack daddy's back
Kidnappin hos like the Patty Hurst jack
Have the white ho, where the fo'-fo'?
Go rob a liquor store, they can't blame it on a nigga row
Bring the money to the rooster
Had the bitch and the Mob bein the booster
Damn, can't stand when the bitch get sent to sample *?bran?*
And come back up man
You wanna point the finger at me cos the OG

Humpin, jumpin, had the place jumpin

Come to the boss if you need some herd
White collar boy, if you check my shit
Get on my sun, get likely burn

Putting the rap game on the lurp
Fuck with them and I will revert
Back to the old days, back to the old ways
Back to the Ak's fucking up doorways

Try to play chicken with a fucking rooster
Don't you worry, I'm not the shooter

Wha? Being heads to the 90'
Don't act like you don't know where to find me
Now, if you wanna get by me
Look at all the grinding,

Sittin in the back, of the studio
Tryin to write a nigga rap
It's the muppet show, most niggas need a&r(a&r)
To tell them how to fuck a hoe
Ice Cube, true mc, write everything I say, even back in the day
Imma spit it, how i feel it, fuck a gimmick
You can keep your catchy lines, imma 'bout to write a rhyme
If you got backpack, tryin act black
Think you know the culture, you'z a fuckin vulture
You never a approached the mic
You dress like a dike, sayin what you don't like
Who deserves five mics, who deserves two
But the nigga wit two still can serve you
This West Coast, flow is different in the East
But in ain't no different in the streets

Chorus:
Im spittin pollaseeds
I crack'em one by one cause i don't want to be greedy
Cause the salt might make it so
Im spittin pollaseeds
I crack'em one by one cause i don't want to be greedy
Cause, these niggas is salty
Will make you choke ohh oh
You miggas got me fucked up

Ice Cube:
I'm spittin pollaseeds on the portch, with the torch
In case these niggas come around to see the porche
When i branish, motherfuckers vanish
They don't understand like a nigga speak in spanish
No comprende, me no speak no enlgehh
Here a fuck(smack)Now yo ass feelin' tingle
Now you doin shit like Darrel Stingleeh
Don't get stung by the motherfuckin sting ray
Keep it movin niggas, y'all better king me
Put your rap careers on ebay
Crazy toons is the motherfuckin dj
Baby drop to your knees, he deserves a bj
I got a big brother, nicknamed cj
When you see him in the hood take it eazy
If you a breezehh, take him to the heezehh
Do him like Halley Barry did Michael Eleehh

Chorus

WC:
I ain't playin
I got pulled over by the police
And i had some pollaseeds in my hand
The police pulled me over and said
Twenty-Seventeen, we got a young black nigga over here
Age eighteen, look like he thirty-five
Look like he drinkin a henesee, and smoke every night
I need back up
Nigga might have a twenty-two with duck tape on the handle

Wit the twista
Hit ya, it's the chippa
Pistol grip, scip scippa, ready to finger rear view mirror
Ready to bust wit my bandanna bumpin oldies

Now - every day I think about my color
And all the crazy shit we do to one another
I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cuz brother
Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother
If not, we gon' pull these triggers
Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz

Bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness

Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you
I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you
But check it out I understand what you goin through

You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got

Here comes another rapper with a song about hope
All you wanna hear is a song about dope
And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope
But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap
No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note
Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
And some of our people used to hang from trees
Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is deez
So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right
Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke
I'm the sunlight, too bright to look
When it's all said and done I should write the book
You too cool for school, too old to know?
Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow
I understand, it ain't no love lost
But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus

You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got

I was born in the mud but I came out clean
That's 'til the government tried to intervene
Tried to lock me up when I was only 19
Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream
I make shit raw that piss off the law
If you want some fake shit turn this off
If you want some realness I know you can feel this
Maybe we can heal this just like an illness
Black on black, I got'cho back
People don't think that we know how to act
Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
And the cia, won't take it back
Never on top, always on the bottom
Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham
Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten
Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em

But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall

And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The hoe said 'pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash? '

We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work

Hold the rollers, the king of the Trill

Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like Farhrenheit 9/11

I'ma speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ca get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried

Shit, that's a license to kill niggaz

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's

All spectators can say is, ""This lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggaz pussy as the Moulan Rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'Cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a G when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the Egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dazzle 'em, like the alderman, Billy Dee in Mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest The Almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives Alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? For what? They screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of Kalan Gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mamma say mamma sa mu makasa, fly to Cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggaz who ill
'Cause y'all niggaz are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to Mr. Bad Guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make Nas mad just in case cross

Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50

Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit

I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'Lacs
Give niggaz flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggaz get out and vanish like Star Treks

Don't 'cha get shot, 'cha fuckin' bloodclot

Shit is hot, baby, if your ass can't take it
Get the fuck out or get butt naked

Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat and his woman can't cook?
Nigga, I shook
Just my luck, fuck a potluck
B-B-Bitch better know how to fuck a duck up
Baby, wake up and hook my steak up
I don't give a fuck about your make-up
Don't come in here with no Wolfgang Puck
Hockey puck tastin' ass shit that suck
People know that my herbs and spices give niggas the itis with no gingivitis
Bite us
They think they gettin' they Wendy's but they gettin' is sugar diabetes
These Twinkies, got 'em wrapped around my pinkies
Cream fillin' comes out when I kill 'em
The cookie monster is up in the buildin'
Willy Wonka, I treat 'em like my children
My favorite

Ya know? That shit that they grow out in Humbolt
Ya know? They wanna call me the colonel
That nigga dead, this shit eternal
Ya know? Take a look in my cookbook
Everything I do is a good look
Don't mistake my notepad for the Good Book
The nerve of 'em, turn on my oven
Motherfucker so full, think I drug 'em
Hand on they stomach, can't stop rubbin'
Fatten ya up and if ya herky jerky
Carve your ass up in that turkey jerkey
Serve you on a platter with side of clam chowder
My hot sauce ain't just hot, it's gunpowder
Aunt Jemima but my fuckin' syrup
I make a chef take his ass back to Europe

Get the people on the phone, tell the jumble
Spit fluid and swear he didn't do it

She say she had the hoe cookin deep dish
She say Martha fuckin cook fish and eat fish

When my story is over and my song is done
I know the streets will shed tears for me

[Verse 1]
All I get is motherfuckin' love in these streets
To most of these tricks I'm a motherfuckin' treat
What's beef? I ain't got no beef
See all that bitchin'? It taste like chicken
And all these chickens? They get plucked
And nobody wants to see the volcano erupt
I'm down with Daz 'cause everythang is Kurupt
I'm celebrated every time I pull up
You hella hated, every time you look up
I'm elevated to rapper's deluxe
They love me, dawg, 'cause I'm one of a kind
This is God's plan, homie, it ain't mine
See, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'
It's all about climbin' a hill full of diamonds
I know that you feel it, I know that you felt it
'Cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it

All I got is mother fuckers tellin' me I'm the greatest
All I got is those fly ass suits and gators
Nobody servin' Cube but maids and waiters
Nobody tryin' to take my life
All these bitches tryna do is replace my wife
But you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with Ice
Like Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice
Now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly
Niggas might not like me but they still love me
Niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle
'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle
Now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop
Anything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible

Fuck a funeral home and a casket
Fuck a funeral song and a procession
Keep God on your dome and count your blessings
Keep the hood in your heart but Heaven on your mind
Shake 'em up and roll seven every time
Pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up
Every time you see me got a different color cup
This ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'
It's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'
It's all about givin', about stayin' driven
It ain't about you, it's about these children
So when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'
Will somebody in here bump George Clinton?
Will somebody in here hug my fam?
Don't worry about me, you know where I am

Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad
All we get is vomit, come like a comet

Only you can do it, Imma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it
America used to shoot like reptiles
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now
They wanna run us in the ground
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may

Peace. Haha don't make me laugh!
All I hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots won't cease
Every cop killin' goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
'cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...

Verse two:

You wanna free africa, I stare at yuh
'cause we ain't got it too good in america
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went  to the temple
Was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with sweat I had the layback
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I start the five point o
There they go - drive real slow
I yelled out 'ice cube sucka'
Shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers
I told you last album, when I got a sawed off, bodies are hard off
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me it's just another tale from the darkside...

Verse three: chuck d

Standing in the middle of war
The middle we flex
When we die, they won't make check
Ebony can't see to the darkside
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Same applies with a phd
Who'z black - don't wanna role - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin'?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder what's under my waist

To the brother that rolls the herb
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap
Now who's the mack?
Who's the hoe?
Who's the trick?
I got many, many styles won't you take a pick
But don't be alarmed
When I trip and stumble and fumble
And drop the (rewind)
Drop the bomb

I'm solo, you ask how I'm living
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon
With the l, the e, the n, the c, the h,
The m, the o, the b, the great
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha
It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers
And if you try to upset the pot son
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun
I make the beats, I make the breaks
I make the rhymes that make you shake
Make you find
Ice cube never caught in the middle
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little
And still never hesitate to stutter step
Or bust a repitition on the mic
Still dissing all the hype
From left to right
How many left to fight?
So what that lench mob like?"

Greed, Khop (The curse, the curse)

Do the math baby, do the math (Ch-ching)
Do the math baby, do the math (Ch-ching)

Do the math baby (The curse, the curse)
Do the math baby (The curse, the curse)
It's the curse of money, once you get it, fool you got it
Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements
Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it
Till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with
Their fantasies of a life stress-free
Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys
But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains
Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants
Soon they realise, I don't invest in hoes
The decibals, gold diggers goin for the testicles
Sometimes it's like hell on earth
When everybody tryin to get your ass for all your worth
(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby
It's the curse

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby
(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby
(The curse, the curse) Do the math

When you hot, they think you got more than you got
When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop
I just laugh, the curse everybody wanna have

Before you sell your soul better do the math
I start to scream shit like ""May day, may day""
Cos motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day
And like I said, it's the curse of money
They start laughin at your jokes when they ain't that funny (Ha ha ha)
See this ass kissin yes man
Shakin hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an
Fuck every phony ass nigga round me
Stick a shaft up your ass like Richie Roundtree (Yea yea!)
Got to have some gas money if you goin
If not who you fuckin? Who you flowin? Who you owin?
Not even hard rhymes that's describin these hard times
In '98 don't shit come free

To relax I smoke a stick, the shit make me sick
Gotta gang of new homies, and relatives on my dick
No time for drama, busters get sprayed
Bitches wanna get layed, and everybody need their bills paid (Everybody)
Motherfuckers, sweat me like a spy
They wanna kick it cos I, got the curse of mulah
Make me wanna start scrappin and look at me to make it happen
What the fuck was they doin before Mack 10 was rappin?!? Tell me
When I'm rushed by gold diggers everytime I get bigger? (Ch-ching)
(What the fuck?) how can I remain a man of seven figures
Like David Banner, when I tweak I turn green
And everytime I'm seen it's like people start to fiend

It's the curse

In Eastside Oakland all the way to Brook-lyn
And they love my shitty drawers, what you smokin?
Think you got the balls, nigga I'm a Trojan
Catchin all that just like a prophylac'
Don't reproduce, that bullshit is whack
Flavor Flav with a white bitch that is whack
Got to put the nigga back in my Cadillac
Take him to the hood, where it's action packed
Let him know that the target's still on his back
It's a hustle called capitalism
Got my niggaz in prison, all stuck in the system yeah

Motherfuckin devils, get straight racist

Concrete slave ships, never move

Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you
Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool
You wanna know the crime of the century
A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary
Black man, you never been friend of me
Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?
The ghe-tto is a trap
Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at
Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map
Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back

But when I reached the finish line, young black male!
One cell made two, and two cells made fo'
And so on, so now I'm a embryo

Chillin, with my mother to guide me
And nuttin but a stomach to hide me

Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you
Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral
Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause

Tomorrow~! That shit never come
I know it sounds strange but today is never done
I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1
While y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons
Up on my feet at the break of the sun
President of the Gangster Na-tion
We don't go to war, we go to the store
We rob from the rich, and give to the poor
Hip-Hop, oh what a bore
Lettin college motherfuckers run the front door
(Fuck that! ) Let's take it back to the streets
Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat
The nerve of them, I never heard of dem
Askin me about, my urban spins
And if I got about, a thousand of them
I'm a crate MC, accordin to them
Fuck that!

My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth
I don't need nobody comin in my territory
Tryin to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin sob stories

Take a good look at my motherfuckin jacker
About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out
Comin in my hood with his hand out

So what really goes on
Nothing but a come-up, but ain't that a bitch
They hate to see a young nigga rich
But I refuse to switch even though
Cause I can't move to the snow
Cause soon as y'all get some dough
Ya wanna put a white bitch on your elbow
Moving out your neighborhood
But I walk through the ghetto and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on me
But you, you wanna be white and corny
Living way out
""nigger go home"" spray-painted on your house
Trying to be white or a jew
But ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out
Stop being an uncle tom, you little sell-out
House nigga scum
Give something back to the place where you made it from
Before you end up broke
Fuck around and get your ghetto pass revoked
I ain't saying no names, you know who you are
You little punk, be true to the game

Break

When you first start rhyming
It started off slow and then you start climbing
But it wasn't fast enough I guess
So you gave your other style a test
You was hardcore hip-hop
Now look at yourself, boy you done flip-flopped
Giving our music away to the mainstream
Don't you know they ain't down with the team
They just sent they boss over
Put a bug in your ear and now you crossed over
On mtv but they don't care
They'll have a new nigga next year
You out in the cold
No more white fans and no more soul
And you might have a heart attack
When you find out the black folks don't want you back
And you know what's worse?
You was just like the nigga in the first verse
Stop selling out your race
And wipe that stupid-ass smile off your face
Niggas always gotta show they teeth
Now I'm a be brief
Be true to the game

Break

A message to the oreo cookie
Find a mirror and take a look, g
Do you like what you see?
But you're quick to point the finger at me
You wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
Black man can't be no yuppie
You put on your suit and tie and your big clothes
You don't associate with the negroes
You wanna be just like jack
But jack is calling you a nigga behind your back
So back off genius
I don't need you to correct my broken english
You know that's right
You ain't white
So stop holding your ass tight
Cause you can't pass
So why you keep trying to pass?
With your black ass
Mister big
But in reality, you're shorter than a midge
You only got yourself to blame
Get a grip, oreo and be true to the game

Be true to the game!"

What you're missing
Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation
Nowhere in the nation
Program directors and dj's ignored me
Cause I simply said fuck top forty
And top thirty top twenty and top ten
Until you put more hip-hop in
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the c
And go and dis me in a magazine
How could you figure the brother could dig ya
Dj face down in the river
No it's not a threat but a promise
I'm as
Crazy as they come see
Mama didn't love me
All I got is my nine
And to calm the savage beast here's the alpine



Tune in to the radio listen for a minute
Yo g stick a fucking tape in it
Cause all the radio do is gangle
That r&b love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from

So, yo, suck a nigga dick
Or make a nigga rich or somethin', bitch

See, I come from the place known as the South Park Zone
Talkin' shit, ain't into clickin' take your punk ass home
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll chuck
Hit you in the chest with a motherfuckin' tec and watch you jump

So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die
Look deep into the eyes of a killer smokin', fry
One nigga you can't fuck wit
'Cause I'm a born killer with the mind of a lunatic

So bring in body bags when I start bangin'
'Cause I'm leavin' motherfuckers laid out with they brains hangin'
Straight gettin' down for mine
And I'll fuck up a bitch 'cause I don't mind dyin'

So feel me, drill me put a bullet in my head
But yo, you can't kill me 'cause I'm already dead
Scarface goin' psycho, yeah
Play pussy, get fucked and take two to your head

I'm Bushwick Bill but call me Chuckie
5th ward hard bitch, play hero and buck me
'Cause I'm known to pull your skull out
Grip a motherfucker by his neck and gouge his fuckin' eyes out

I'm insane by a long shot, hey
Chuckwick Bill a.k.a Charles Libre
A short nigga with some long nuts
Drop you dead in your bed, now I'm ready for a long fuck

Necromance that ass for a minute
And split that motherfuckin' clique when I'm finished
You punk bitches be retreatin'
Freddy and Jason runnin' home with their mouths bleedin'

So welcome to the slaughterhouse trance
5th ward Texas Chuckie's concentration camp
You punk motherfuckers fled
And those who didn't make it got two to the fuckin' head

Buck him down, buck him down, come again
Two to the chin, Ice Cube'll blast they ass 'til the end
With my pistol, runnin' from da lench mob
Is how you survive in south central

Kick the instrumental, run and get your bigger crew
'Cause it's judgment day and Ice Cube is terminigga 2
Pow, pow, buck, buck, pow, buck
Your name is Stucky Mack, now you realize that you're fucked

Two to the brain, I leave a migraine
Have you coolin' like a vegetable but you're not edible
It's the incredible, buck your ass from head to toe
Audi 5000, don't wait for the feds to show

'Cause they'll have me go up, up the river
Where the white boys'll try to make a nigga
Walk, walk the plank, got the shank, hide the tape
Around the handle, gotta let 'em know what I stand for

In the chow line, now is the time
See the trustee, walk up from behind
Real quick, shank, shank, leave his ass red
Motherfucker dead from two to the head

See where I come from the crime rate only rises
The murderers disguise in all ages shapes and sizes
Bitches picked up and dicked up, niggaz they gettin' stuck up
Give up what you got or get your ass shut the fuck up

Run 'em down and gun 'em down, yeah, that's how we do it
Niggaz get killed and then filled with embalmin' fluid
Step to the niggaz that I'm checkin', pull out the tec
And I reckon you'll get murdered in a second

Bang with the nine, boom with the pow
Motherfuckers are fallin' and crawlin' on the ground
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty
Inside the parties even the hotties get turned to bodies

Now I heard, they got other places that's similar
But I represent, New York, you fuck around, I'm killin' ya
A whole block of cops patrollin' when I'm rollin'
And if my pockets are swollen, you know, somebody sick I've stolen

Yeah, you niggaz get ripped when my clip goes in the
S M I T H W E double S O N or the reliable revolver
And like I said before, it's the motherfuckin' problem solver

So bring it on nigga, get brave
It's plenty motherfuckers gettin' sent to early graves
'Cause when a nigga gets fed
Then all you motherfuckers get two to the fuckin' head"

Ice Cube,Us,/i/ice+cube/us_20066656.html,"Verse one:

Could you tell me who released our animal instinct?
Got the white man sittin' there tickled pink.
Laughin' at us on the avenue
Bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
We can't enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous... Of each other's wealth
Commin' up is just in me
But the black community is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look up the street I see all the japs grabbin'
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood
Build a store, and sell their goods
To the county of sips [?]
You know us po niggas: nappy hair and big lips?
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect uncle sam to help us out?
We ain't nothin' but porchmonkeys
To the average bigot, redneck honky
You say comin' up is a must
But before we can come up, take a look at us

Verse two:

And all y'all dope-dealers...
Your as bad as the po-lice- cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin' dope
But you ain't built us a supermarket
So when can spend our money with the blacks
Too busy buyin' gold an' caddilacs
That's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
Exploitin' us like the caucasians did
For 400 years - I got 400 tears- for 400 peers
Died last year from gang-related crimes
That's why I got gang-related rhymes
But when I do a show ta kick some facts
Us blacks don't know how ta act
Sometimes I believe the hype, man
We're messin' up ourselves and blame the white man
But don't point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon hip-hop won't be so nice
No ice cube, just vannilla ice
And y'all sit and scream and cus
But there's no one ta blame- but us

Verse three:

Us... Will always sing the blues
'cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
But if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
""cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'
Just like a beast
But I'm the first nigga ta holler out {peace, black man}
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hog-mogs an' chitlin's
Bet my money on the dice and the horses
Jobless, so I'm a hope for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
Wit' a picture of a blue-eyed jesus
They used to call me negro
After all this time I'm still bustin up the chiffarobe
No respect and didn't know it
And I'm havin' more babies than I really can afford
In jail 'cause I can't pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us, but y'all think it's dumb of me
To put a mirror to ya face, but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about..."

Artillery, thoughts of killin me is just a fantasy
The man in me is ready for war, like Holyfield/Tyson iv
A gang against you niggaz on the shore
Either or, your whole family is on the floor
Windows breakin all around em, you can't climb this mountain
I'm at the fountain, with my troops
I start screamin at em like Patton, we gattin at you fools!

Chorus

Verse Two: Ice Cube

Negotiate... Strategy is the key!
I hope they ain't... Exclusively after me!
Cause if they are... We gots to be who we be!
And make a star... Out of a head enemy!
The papers said... That he died tragically!
They found his head... With no legs and bo-dy!
We made a pledge... To the Dub-S-C!
Bloodshed... If they got no love for peace!
Sing it!

Chorus

Verse Three: Ice Cube

I'd rather break bread than uhh, break your head
Break your legs, have em broken, I ain't no joke
Don't provoke, the gun smoke from the highest slope
Eternal peace, for my peoples and my folks
My crips and my bloods, criminals and my thugs
Just show a nigga love when I'm rollin on them dubs
Just, give a nigga hugs, we can ride on this piece
Westside for Life but still down with the East
Sing it!

Chorus 2X

After the haters attempt to blow up his car
We find our hero, Ice Cube, on the ground
Bruised, but not beaten
He pulls out his cell phone.. With the chip!
And begins to dial Mack One-Oh
Who's faded and rolling through Inglewood
With Mr. Short khop
Words.. Are spoken"

(Peace  quiet and good order will be maintained in our city to the best of
our ability. Riots  melees and disturbances of the peace are against the
interests of all our people and therefore cannot be permitted)
(The jury found that they were all not guilty  not guilty....)
(We've been told that all along Crenshaw Boulevard that there's a series of
fires. A lot of looting is going on. A disaster area obviously)
(The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty...)
Make it rough
(A lot of activity continues here in this....) Make it rough
(We have sporadic fires throughout the city of Los Angeles)

Verse 1:

Not guilty the filthy devils tried ta kill me
When the news get to the hood then niggas will be
hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Vaugn, wicked, Lawrence Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin throat and I smile
Go to Simi Valley and surely
somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?"" (Who is Ice Cube?)
""Can I talk to the grand wizard?"" then boom
Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero
Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Coon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him witta broom
Stick prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK40 dick
Two dazed niggas layin in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up

Make it rough

Verse 2:

I gotta Mac10 for Officer Wynd
Damn, his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
in a casket, crew cut faggot
Now he ain't nothin but food for the maggots
Lunch, punch, Hawaiin lyin
Niggas ain't buyin
ya story bore me
Taerin up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a lap-top computer
I told you all what happened and you heard it, read it
but all you could call me was anti-Semitic
Regret it-nope, said it-yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step
Niggas had to break you off somethin, give Bush a push
But your National Guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me cos you know what?
We woulda teared this muthafucka up

Huh, make it rough!
Huh Muggs, make it rough!

Verse 3:

It's on, gone with the wind and I know white men can't dunk
Now I'm stealin blunts
And it came from Betty Crocker, overweight and blacker
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers
Steal, muthafuck Fire Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail
I smelt smoke, got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out
In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, I ???? Surplus got the heaters
Meet us so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot
Ready for Darryl and like Beretta wouldn't say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
But I'm rollin so that's a fucked up slogan
The Hogan's Heroes spotted the gorilla by the Sizzler
Hittin up police killer
The super duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up so what the fuck!?!

Huh, make it rough!
Yo Muggs, make it rough
Huh, make it rough
Enough

Walkin' with the shadow of death through the land
Of the skankless, south central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggaz is drug through the mud

And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin' through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin' it up, so motherfucker west up

It's gun ho mack one, oh please, you can't fuck wit deez

Nigga, thought you knew how we do it
Ain't a damn thing changed, always on them thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck

Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers hootchie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest bolas on the block for sale

Inglewood city, the throne I call home

To bail through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this west up for life

Now I got ta show you how the west coast rocks
No razor blades in my mouth, just a glock
And I'm hittin' you up, with that W S
The sun rises in the east but it sets in the west

No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin' mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggaz got the robe reindeer and a sleigh

We don't call it five, oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life in the sunshine
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the west was won?

Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the east, we can be brothers but when you come to L. A.
Watch your motherfuckin' colors west up, nigga

Give it up, give it up like the nigga James Brown
Me and my niggaz are puttin' it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggaz caught slippin' is left with they brains drippin'

City of the angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
So let the five-twenty slide
And put it down from the west side

Front back, side to side
We be givin' it up till the day we die

Ice Cube,What Can I Do?,/i/ice+cube/what+can+i+do_20066667.html,"Intro: [sampled announcer]

In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing.

Verse One:

Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelveth
'cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
Now I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5
'89s the number, another summer
Police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder
Now I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new

Damn, what can I do?

Today...

Verse Two:

Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome
Police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy 'cause I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?

Today...

Verse Three:

Phucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-for
Back in la, and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the lb
What you tell me?
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
'cause, they sent in the troops
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas shit in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflashion
No college degree, just a dumb ass G
(Yeah you nigga, who me?)
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony?  Yes
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to Mcdonalds may I please help you?
Shit, what can I do?

Today...

Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke

Fucked around and broke my pager
Then they hit a nigga with the tazer
The motherfucking pigs were tryin to hurt me
I fell to the floor and yelled lord have mercy
Then they hit me in the face ya'll
But to them it ain't nuttin but (a friendly game of base ball)
Crowd stood around I said goddamn ya
Who got the camera

Repeat Chorus

Verse 3

I knew when I saw that deputy smirkin'
That they were gonna put some work in
Mr. law had to hit me in the jaw
Cause I called them faggots with guns and badges
They played rat-a-tat-tat on me head
But if I had the gatty-gat-gat they'd be dead
A victim of a big fat 187
And little devils don't go to heaven
Last night there were eleven but they were'nt scarin me
So they tried the flashlight therapy
I looked at the black one and called him a traitor
I don't give a fuck if you got a beta
Just take my fuckin picture
So I can go downtown and bitch and pitch ya (?)
The one that called me a spook
His name is officer David Duke
If the crowd weren't around they would've shot me
Tried to play me out like my name was rodney
Fuckin police gettin badder
But if I had a camera the shit wouldn't matter
(bitch), uh who got my nine, who got my nine
Ya'll done did it this time, uh
Who the fuck got my nine"

Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Straight gangsta mack
Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap?
Rolling in a fucked up Lincoln
Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking
Into that leopard interior
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior
As she's selling more butt
To his tongue  get a dumb bitch sprung
Don't even get a cut of the money
And he know the play
And hope to od that he don't find a runaway
His name is Sonny
He'll have your ass in and out of every car
That's looking to become a star
With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk
You don't like it but you still call him hunk
You wanna leave but Sonny started talking fast
And it make you wanna go and sell more ass
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?
Who's the mack?

Give you a sad story and you give him cash?
It is that fool that wanna pump the gas
Quick to say I'm down on my luck
He starts macking and macking and you sucking
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way
Then you see his sorry ass the next day
Are you the one getting played like a sucka?
Or do you say, ""Get a job, motherfucker""?
Every day, the story gets better
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater
He claims he wants to get something to eat
But every day you find yourself getting beat
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways
And almost get his ass hit for the crack
'cause he's in a daze
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack?

Who's the Mack?
Have you ever been in a hot tub?
Is it that nigga in that club asking
I know the game so I watch it unfold
When i see the boy pinned to your earlobe
When he tell you that he can go buck wild
He's talking shit and you crack a smile
For a girl like you and make it feel good
You know it's drama but it sound real good
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging
The pussy so he can keep bragging
He say, ""I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?""
You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over
The pussy so he can keep bragging
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover
Who's the Mack?
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back
Now ask yourself
Macking is the game and everybody's playing
And as long as you believe what they saying
Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay
They are gonna get all the play
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a
Mack in my own right
When it comes to rhyme and rap
'cause all i do is kick facts
Unlike Iceberg Slimm
And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P.
I'm just a straight up N I double G A
No, I'm not going out that way
And you did the shit like real smooth
Next time U get over on a fool
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts
And ask yourself
Who's the Mack?

Why the fuck you wanna murder me?
Your punk ass never heard of me
I never did nohin to your family
Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly
You wanna take the life God handed yo me
Send it back to him coz you ain't a fan of me
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me
That's an animal,
A fucking cannibal
I'm Duranimo(?) and Hannibal
We international Gangsta bull
I'm bull and Barcelona, with a Carona
You a fake ass ni**er, where's ya owner?
I'ma real live man, you a persona
Now I'm a gonner, call ma momma, in the corner
Mister gun man, your plan is working
Coz ni**ers is dying and mommas is hurting

[Chorus:]

Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree
Now
Sent by G. O. D
To say the word you and me [?]
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin'
The life you wastin'

[Verse 2:]
I was made by the one and only G. O. D
To take my life to the T. O. P
Now here comes a motherfuckin' D. O. G
Who ain't happy til a ni**er is R.I.P
Tryin' to be som'in' you saw on bet
Either T. I. P or B. I. G
I don't give a fuck what you saw on tv
But a 187 don't make a O. G.

I'm a O. G
Never had to fake it
God gave me this, how you goin take it
What you goin tell 'em, when you get to Heaven
When he asks you why did you send back his present.
Who the fuck are you, you motherfucking peasent
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing.
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes
Ni**er, hell on earth is being stuck in the 80's

Why you wanna murder me?

Before you shoot me man think about it
Let's go have a drink about it
Before you make a stink about it
Man let's talk about it
Maybe we can walk about it.
But just don't be a coward
And take my life because you got the power
Of the white man's gun powder
Coz you might face a gun tower.
And time never run out,
They take the fun out, til your life run out.
So don't pull your gun out,
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house.
It's better than the big house,
Less four-five some woman we can dig out,
Find a place we can dig out,
Party all night til the owner say ""get out:

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ol saying
Bush run shit like Sadaam Hussien
I c*** and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in pelican's bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison
Who's the animal that invented lower living
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons
Thank god for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz

It's boyz in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood (For real)
Cause when niggaz get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by five-oh
Grandmama came to court with her bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel (Fuck)
I just came unraveled
Socked the D. A. Before I got gaffled
Owned by C. A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
(Damn) I can't take the pressure
Pulled the for-for up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggaz what the fuckin boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs
While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]
Play ya and I'll slay ya

Ready to buck buck buck and it's a must
To duck duck duck before I bust
Lookin for the one that did it
But like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills
Sittin at the pad just chillin
Cos Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal
Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that test tube baby
Kick it cos I get wicked

Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison
Come my way and get served
Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin
Never seen with a happy grin
Show the fat foul cos I'm down
Take a look around
And all you see is big black boots steppin
Use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
Label this nigga, tape with the sticker
Kickin out girls that's nicety
Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T

Who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett
Dig it cos I get wicked

People wanna know how come
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

And we might just see a sequel
Cos police got equal pay
A haza is a pig that don't fly straight
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this
Cos now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist

Bring the yellow tape

What do you see me when you see me?
A G in disguise

Been hypnotized since '85 with gansta shit
All you niggas get live and represent my click
Got bits and pieces on my mind, comin' together like lettuce
Dear God protect us 'cause we're mobbin' like 'Goodfellas'

Alias Carleone, maybe the war is on
Prone to let my daughter live rich before she's grown
If I murdered Capone, would you consider me a villain?
Chillin' with millionaires, ex-killers and set-trippers

My murderous complex begin to hit 'cha
Strip you worse than the New Jersey drive niggas
'Cause I'm in a rush to bust straps like Mack-10's

Had to catch a flight, it's only right
Stepped off the plane, Mean Green and Tony Draper

Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta click

Bring your killa chrome 'cause we headed to the Terrordome

When I was with you all you ever do was bitch
Talk shit, but you could suck dick
So I didn't sweat all the fussin' and cussin'

I would stress and strain to mantain
And didn't need to hear your motherfucking ass complain

Couldn't resist the Rolex on his wrist
I kept on writing my raps with profanity

You tried to diss this, now you missed this

No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it

Ice Cube,You Can't Fade Me,/i/ice+cube/you+cant+fade+me_20066637.html,"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
What's the date and time it don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homie's impala
She said what's up yeah what's the deal
Check the hairdo of course it ain't real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long, well about seven months
Oh how time flies when you're having fun
She said yeah but the damage is done
Where you been, on a little vacation
Oh by the way congratulations
Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue
Then she said the lucky man is you
I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
She said yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said damn are you sure it's mine
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said that day no I wasn't whoring
Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was ice cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw cause then I'd really get faded
That's murder one cause it was premeditated
So what I'm a do
I don't have a clue
How many months left damn only two
I'm gettin faded

No cigar, g
Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded

It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord God forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to albuquerque
I dropped her off man and I'm knowing
That I'm a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit shit
I'm gettin faded

Ay yo you know what time it is

Nine months later she's ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know ice cube can't be having that g
I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger
Jd and jinx and t-bone won't let up they won't shut up
I'm gettin fed up bitch
Cause I know you're tryin to break me
But if I find out your tryin to fake me
I'm a buff that duff for a hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live?
After that I should've got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the hoe who laid me
Excuse me bitch it's a switch
You can't fade me

Naw baby not this way
Yo you ain't playing ice cube out like no booger
I don't fall for the okey-doke
And before I fall for the okey-doke
I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
Yeah baby you can't fade me
Naw unfadable baby"

Gettin six on artillery  you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Runnin from Lennox  up at Venice

But that ain't poppin, ain't no stoppin
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
Fo'-hoppin, ass droppin, Coupe Deville
My truth can, I'll - fool I got skills

With ""Mo' Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Everything is great, slow down for the dip

Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin

And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to fi nd my heart is beating

Oh you tell me to hold on

And what was right is wrong

And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow
You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on

It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins

We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes

Only at first did it have it's appeal 
But now you can’t tell the false from the real 

Who can you trust?

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold 
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands 
Water to wine and the finest of sands 
When all that you have’s turnin’ stale and it’s cold 
Oh, you no longer fear when your heart’s turned to gold 

Who can you trust?

I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

And you love and you love
You got a history list and the rest is above
And if you've won, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you've won, then you can't relate to me

Come with me and we will run away

The things you say are never right,
The sins of all the world lie on your head

So when you see me look the other way
Cause -ohoh- lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say ""come with me...""

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
In a sin, considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take a seat it's glittering, I shake you in, I shake my body

Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home I think he died

The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

So when you see me look the other way
Cause lately all I do is say
These the plans I make believe all come with me

Oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe
Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me"

Do I have to run and hide? (oh oh oh oh)

Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I'm here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,

We never quite thought we could loose it all
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
An empire's falling just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away"

She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Every single time

No, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop

Prays on her knees when the towers fall
To a God she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs blow (Ooh)
She said, ""How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?""
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I thank you for the day when everything will be okay

I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
I've been shaken, waking in the night light
I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

Like a hunter waiting for the season
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been living, but I was never breathing

Take my hands through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down (Oooouuuhh)
I'm just a sucker for pain

Take me next to the sun
And let me watch myself burn, it makes me feel I'm on one
Guillotine with a razor blade 'cause usual blades don't cut it
And it's just often way too mundane
French kissing and fellatio with vipers
Right after eat the feces out of my nephew's diapers
Then down it with some red juice off my bitch's snatch
While my fingers are stuck inside of a tortoise's ass
I'll sure be having the time of my life
Improving my freestyle as I'd never have to write
Might piss a dragon off for fun
'Cause I like the smell of my own flesh when it's roasted

I torture you
Take my hands through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down (Oooouuuhh)
I'm just a sucker for pain

And every time that I'm asked to walk on eggshells
I'd replace them with layers of thorns and nails
Hell's probably gonna be raised 
By the time I'm done with this verse 
Literally and metaphorically
Well like a bitch begging to be fucked
I plead that I get drowned, that's my idea of
Getting my head wet, I do bath in toxins and
I wipe 'em off with Poison Ivy, yup!
Misery loves company
That's why I prefer to be in pain alone
Hurt me, it gives pleasure to me
My dick for a KIEL B ASA's probably
Cooking on your stove at home 'cause intercourse hurt me

I torture you
Take my hands through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down (Oooouuuhh)
I'm just a sucker for pain

Uh, and if pain was a dick
I swear I wouldn't hesitate to suck that shit
Might be weird to the untrained mind
But if you love the shit the way I do
You'll be next in line
And how much more can I express myself?
Just don't fuck with my source of happiness
I'm helpless so I talk to the world, moon, and the stars
Hear my voice and set me up
For more pain
I've been dreaming of this err'day 
And having wet dreams over it
For more pain
I've been living for the feeling
I might drink from the fountain of youth for it
For more pain
I quit hurting others so only I can get to feel the pain
It's greed
For more Pain
I've been rolling in the deep of boiling oil
And smiling hard
I'm dysfunctional

For more pain
Got me begging begging begging begging
For more pain
I've been begging begging begging begging
For more pain
Got me begging begging begging begging
For more pain
I've been begging"

Above the best, and prove yourself,

Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box

I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee

Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod

Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end of my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways at the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

I don’t want to do it just to do it for you

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show

To ferry me over my love and I

Of happy hours I spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like the melting snow
But I'll spend my days in endless roaving
Soft as the grass I'm sure my bed is free
Oh to be back now in Carrickfergus
On that long mountain road down to the sea

Now in Kilkenny it is reported
They've marble stones as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her

A handsome rover from town to town
And I'm sick now my days are over
Come all you young men and lay me down (Repeat)"

The day that I first saw the light
I looked down the street on that very frist morn
And gave a great crow of delight
Now most newborn babies appear in a huff
And start with a sorrowful squall

And a cailin shyly glancing
Just like our dads and mothers did

Now my heart is sad and weary
Still in dreams I see my Mary
With her golden tresses flying
On her cheeks a rosy glow
In her joy I heard her singing
With Bill Halpin's fiddleringing
As he played the Stack of Barley
Down in Kerry long ago
We go down to Mary's dairy
And her feet so light and airy
At the churn we take our turn
Till the butter would overflow
To the kitchen we'd retire
And pick out the biggest fire
Just to tell us fairy stories
Of Kerry long ago
Then we'd stroll home in the moonlight
And our cailin's waists we'd hug tight
Just to save them from the fairies
In the raheen down below
Then we'd say goodnight and kiss them
We'd go home and pray God bless them

Along the enchanted way
And said let grief be a fallen leaf
At the dawning of the day

On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passion's pledge
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh I loved too much and by such by such
Is happiness thrown away

I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret signs
Known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint I did not stint
I gave her poems to say
With her own name there
And her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
That I had loved not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay
He'll lose his wings at the dawn of day"

Well the old church bells did ring
The old church choir did sing
They all turned out to bid farewell
To my brother Sylvest

Irish Music,The Black Velvet Band,/i/irish+music/the+black+velvet+band_20798405.html,"In a neat little town they call Belfast
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many's an hour's sweet happiness
I've spent in that neat little town
A sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from my friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

[Chorus:]
Her eyes they shone like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll down Broadway
And meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
Come a traipsing along the highway
She was both fair and handsome
Her neck it was just like a swan
And her hair it hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band

[Chorus:]

I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well I knew she meant the undoing of him
With a look in her rovish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very next thing that I said was
Bad cess to the black velvet band

[Chorus:]

Before the judge and the jury
Next morning I had to appear
The judge he says to me young man
Your case it is proven clear
We'll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

[Chorus:]

So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
They'll feed you with strong drinks me lads
Till you are unable to stand
And the very first thing that you know is
You've landed in Van Dieman's Land

With memories so glorious and grand
Where nature has lavished it's bounty
It's the orchard of Ireland's green land
I love it's cathedral and city
Was founded by Patrick so true
And it bears in the heart of it's bosom
The ashes of Brian Boru
It's my own Irish home
Far across the foam
And though I've often left it
In foreign lands to roam
No matter where I wander
Through cities near or far
Sure me heart is at home in old Ireland
In the county of Armagh

I travelled that part of the county
Through Newport, Forkhill, Crossmaglenn
Around by the gap of Mount Norris
Then home by Blackwater again
Where the girls are so gay and so hearty
None fairer in Eireann go brath
Ah but where are the boys that can court them
Like the boys from the County Armagh

It's my own Irish home
Far across the foam
And though I've often left it
In foreign lands to roam
No matter where I wander
Through cities near or far
Sure me heart is at home in old Ireland
In the county of Armagh"

Faraway o'er the mountain, faraway o'er the foam
But of all the fine places that I've ever seen
Sure there's none can compare
With the cliffs of Dooneen
Take a view o'er the mountains
Fine sights you'll see there
You'll see the high rocky mountains
On the west coast of Clare
Oh the town of Kilkeen and Kilrush can be seen
From the high rocky slopes
Of the cliffs of Dooneen

It's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day
Watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay
The hare and lofty pheasant are quite plain to be seen
Building homes for their young
Round the cliffs of Dooneen

Fare thee well to Dooneen
Fare thee well for a while
And to all the fine people I'm leaving behind
To the streams and the meadows
Where late I have been
And the high rocky slopes
Round the cliffs of Dooneen"

Spent the evening getting' locked
In the Ace O' Hearts
Where the high stools were engaging
Over the Butt Bridge down by the dock
The boat she sailed at five o' clock
""Hurry on lads"" says Whack
Or before we're there we'll all be back
Sayin' carry him if you can
Oh the craic was ninety in the Isle of Man

Before we reached the Alexander Base
A ding dong we did surely raise
In the bar of the boat we had great sport
As the ship she sailed out from the port
Landed up in the Douglas Head
Enquiring for a vacant bed
To the dining room soon were shown by
A decent woman from up the road
Sayin' ""Ate that if you can""
Oh the craic was ninety in the Isle of Man

Next morning went for a ramble round
To see the sights of Douglas Town
All went for a might session
In a pub they called Dick Darbies
All got drunk by half past three
To sober up went swimming in the sea
Then back to the digs for a spruce up
While waiting for the rosie
We all drew up our plan
Oh the craic was ninety in the Isle of Man

That night we went to the Texas Bar
Came back down by horse and car
Met Big Jim and all went in to drink some wine in Yates
The Liverpool girls it was said were all to be met
In the Douglas Head
McShane was there in a tie and shirt
And with the foreign girls he was trying to flirt
Sayin' ""Here girls I'm your man""
Oh the craic was ninety in the Isle of Man

Whacker fancied his good looks
With an Isle of Man woman he was struck
But a Liverpool lad was by her side
And he throwin' the jar into her
Whacker thought he'd take a chance
He asked the quare one out to dance
Around the floor they stepped it out
To Whack it was no bother
Eveyrthing was goin' to plan
Oh the craic was ninety in the Isle of Man

Well the Isle of Man woman fancied Whack
But your man stood there till his mates came back
Whack! They all whacked into Whack
And Whack was landed on his back
The Douglas force arrived as well
Landed up in the Douglas jail
Until that Dublin boat did sail
Deported ever man

So the young might see the morn
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay""

Low, lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
""Nothing matters Mary when you're free
Against the Famine and the Crown
I rebelled they ran me down
Now, you must raise our child with dignity""

By a lonely harbour wall
She watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay

Heroes of renown
The passing tales and glories

The hallowed halls and houses
The haunting children's rhymes
That once was Dublin city
In the rare old times

[Chorus:]
Ring a ring a rosie
As the light declines
I remember Dublin City
In the rare old times

My name it is Sean Dempsey
As Dublin as could be
Born hard and late in Pimlico
In a house that's ceased to be
By trade I was a cooper
Lost out to redundancy
Like my house that fell to progress
My trade's a memory

I courted Peggy Diagnam
As pretty as you please
A gentle child of Mary
From the rebel liberties
I lost her to a student chap
With skin as black as coal
When he took her off to Birmingham
She took away my soul

[Chorus:]

The years have made me bitter
The gargles dims me brain
'Cause Dublin keeps on changing
And nothing stays the same
The Pillar and the Met have gone
The Royal long since pulled down
As the great and unyielding concrete
Makes a city of my town

[Chorus:]

Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey
I can no longer stay
And watch the new glass cages
That spring up along the quay
My mind's too full of memories
Too old to hear new chimes
I'm a part of what was Dublim
In the rare old times

The wife said honey we're loosing money
Because those chickens no eggs would they lay

Then came a rooster into our yard
And he caught them chickens right off their guard
They're laying eggs now like they never used to
Since that rooster came into our yard

We had a moo cow no milk would she give
We had a moo cow no milk would she give
O' the wife said honey we're loosing money (Oh yeah)
Because that moo cow no milk would she give

Then came a rooster into our yard
And caught that moo cow right off her guard

We had an elephant and no tusks would he grow
We had a elephant and no tusks would he grow
The wife said honey we're loosing money (Oh yeah)
Because that elephant no tusks would he grow

Then came a rooster into our yard
And caught that elephant right off his guard
He's laying eggs now out of solid ivory
Since that rooster came into our yard

We had a rooster he was awfully gay
We had a rooster he was funny that way
O' the wife said honey we're loosing money

Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

There is a ship that sails the seas
She sails so deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I'll sink or swim

I leant my back against an oak
Thinking it was the strongest tree
But first it bent and then it broke
And that's the way love treated me

Oh love is handsome and love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's new
But as love grows old then twice as cold
And fades away like morning dew

O' the water is deep
I can't swim o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
Both shall row my love and I"

I counted out his money it made a pretty penny
I put it in my pocket and took it home to jenny

That she never would deceive me
But the devil take those women
For they never can be easy

I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels
And for sure it was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges
And filled them up with water
And she sent for Captain Farrell
To be ready for the slaughter

[Chorus:]

It was early in the morning before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen
And with them Captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol
For she'd taken away my rapier
But I couldn't shoot the water
So a prisoner I was taken

[Chorus:]

If anyone can aid me, 'tis my brother in the army
If I could find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'd come and join me
We'd go rovin' in Kilkenny
I'm sure he'd treat me fairer
Than my own sporting Jenny

Some take delight in fishing or in boating
Some take delight in the carriage wheels a rolling
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courtin' pretty fair maids in the morning
Bright and early

I was blind to the ways that had me caught up in a bind
I was bound by the shackles that were tacklin' my hope
I was livin' like a fool who'd been given much rope

Steady me, steady me 'cause I'm about to freak
Steady me, steady me, it's gettin' kinda deep
But then You crept in, stepped in with a ray of light
One glimpse from the fence and I fell to Your side

Steady me, steady me 'cause I'm about to freak
Steady me, steady me, it's gettin' kinda deep
'Cause one shot of Your grace and my space been changed
To a clear atmosphere, it's a brand new day

'Cause I'm free baby, I'm free
They can't take it away from me
'Cause I'm free baby, I'm free
They can't take it away from me

No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed
No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed

No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed
No more chains holding me, I have been delivered
No more chains holding me, I am free indeed

Iggy Pop,A Machine For Loving,/i/iggy+pop/a+machine+for+loving_20798569.html,"Two weeks after my arrival, Fox died
Just after sunset
I was stretched out on the bed
When he approached
And tried painfully to jump up
He wagged his tail nervously.

Since the beginning
He hadn't touched his bowl once
He had lost a lot of weight
I helped him to settle on my lap
For a few seconds, he looked at me
With a curious mixture of exhaustion and apology
Then, calmed, he closed his eyes
Two minutes later he gave out his last breath.

I buried him inside the residence
At the western extremity of the land
Surrounded by the protective fence
Next to his predecessors
During the night, a rapid transport from the Central City
Dropped off an identical dog
They knew the codes and how to work the barrier
I didn't have to get up to greet them
A small white and ginger mongrel came toward me
Wagging it's tail
I gestured to him
He jumped on the bed and stretched out beside me.

Love is simple to define
But it seldom happens in the series of beings
Through these dogs we pay homage to love
And to it's possibility.

What is a dog but a machine for loving
You introduce him to a human being, 
Giving him the mission to love
And however ugly, perverse, deformed or stupid
This human being might be
The dog loves him.
The dog loves him."

I think the writing is eating up myself
Preventing any togetherness with anyone

How many more?

Nothing more nothing less

Why they're no more than opiates
Always dragging me down
Dash my hopes to the ground

But they must be kidding
Or wishful thinking
Adding fuel to the fire
Of my ambition

I'll make a date
Oh no I won't be late
And why of course he'll be there
He'll promise he'll sweur

But all I ever find
Been spun that same old line
It's happened time and time again before
But these things and more
Widen the score

And it's one up for ambition
I really have a go
You know you've got to hand it to me
I've got a heart of gold
But I'm a wolf in mutton's clothes

Someday my time will come
I'll feel I can't go on
I may not care or even know it's there
But then I'll have my fun

Don't lose your grip
Don't lose ambition"

Put your money away
Because Billy is a runaway

Going to skin him alive

Wants him to join the enterprise
I leave him at the motel
They can talk it all over

Any young black male who walks down the street
Is gonna get stopped by a car full of meat
But the girl with the hair
Flies by in her underwear-

She's done nothing so far to deserve that car
When you live in butt town
You gotta get down
But in butt town I'm learnin'
In butt town I'm earnin'
In butt town I'm turnin'
Into my worst nightmare

I'm tellin' you, it's a motley crew in butt town
Monday you're new, and friday you're through
In butt town
The producer is wily, and owns what he sells
The talent is eager to go straight to hell
Th tits are amazing, and everyone's gazing
At some body part-
That's the nature of art in butt town

All over butt town dreams have a show down
All over butt town values are thrown down
But in butt town I'm learnin'
In butt town I'm earnin'
In butt town I'm turnin'

I'm gonna shake my butt
Shake my butt shake my butt

Paying lip service to the portents
Burning incense at their shrine

Once I found out they never dared
To seize the world and shake it upside down
And every stinking bum should wear a crown

Till all the plates are broken
Cry for love
Until my eyes are soakin'
Yeah cry for love
On every salmon mornig
Cry for love
'cause imitation's boring
Cry for love

Bad tv that insults me freely
Still I know what I'm dyin' to see
[Cry for Love lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]In searching for a meaningful embrace
Sometimes my self-respect took second place

An' I cried for love
I did what my heart told me
Cried for love
Can't stand it
When they scold me
Yeah I cried for love
On every salmon morning
Yeah I cry for love
'cause imitation's boring
Cry for love

Surfers ride for love and wipe out when it hits 'em
Soldiers kill for love and nobody admits it
If you're cryin' for love well, that's ok don't sweat it
If you're cryin' for love then there's still a chance you'll get it

With their necks choking tight
In their collars dead white

Like some cheap devil in disguise
And it's troubling me

Comme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts
Naître les couleurs du jour.
Et qui n’en revient pas.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Dis-moi pour qui j’existerais?
Des passantes endormies dans mes bras
Que je n’aimerais jamais.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Je ne serais qu’un point de plus
Dans ce monde qui vient et qui va,
Je me sentirais perdu,
J’aurais besoin de toi.

Et si tu n’existais pas,
Dis-moi comment j’existerais?
Je pourrais faire semblant d’être moi,
Mais je ne serais pas vrai.

Et si tu n’existais pas,

Le secret de la vie, le pourquoi,
Simplement pour te créer
Et pour te regarder."

She had dreads in her hair and problems and cares
She tried hard not to let 'em show
She was decent and sweet and I was sizin' up the meat
But doubts fell in my mind like snow
And when the shove comes down to love
The facade falls down
And when the bricks fall from the tricks
The facade falls down

It's a sunny afternoon and I'm sitting in my robe
I'm dirty and I'm here alone
There's a story on my table that talks about me
And I want to stuff it down the author's throat
And I'm sleeping with someone new every night
And in the morning politely saying ""bye""

And I'm nowhere and no one
And I only wanna run
And I feel like a hamburger bun
And when you must
Believe or bust
The facade falls down
When you're scared of a brand new care
The facade falls down
I got no reason to believe
I got no reason but I'm new york scumbag tough
And I'll keep on truckin'

So night is falling
And I'm getting' tired
And it's time to get my slippers and books
Got a sweater and glasses
And something that passes
For a way to get by in this world
And I'm getting' tired
Of so many different things
I guess I'm just plain tired
Or maybe too intelligent to believe
In the obvious side of things
And when voice says make a choice
The facade falls down
When your knees start to concede
The facade falls down
When the shove comes down to love
The facade falls down
And when the bricks fall from the tricks
The facade falls down

The facade falls down

The facade falls down

As I pulled in the drive
Wearing leopard skin velvet
And shiny black eyes
""She looks like a sleeper""
Said my wife at the time
She had curls like Delilah
And a smile like the sun
She held my poor corpse
Like she'd never be done
And the caption in my mind said
""This is the one""
But I'm strong and I'm disciplined
And I avoided her for years
'Till one night, as usual
With my heart full of tears
A hand touched my back
And she was standing right there
Then I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury
Whispering
Whispering

Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is
How my life was a desert before she came in
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house
The way she curled up quietly on the couch
I can still see her in my mind that way now
Aah I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her

Well time went by quickly
And her confidence grew
And she wanted this and that
And she wanted those too
And she wouldn't shut up
And one day I just blew up
Now she's in the hospital
For the second time
Maybe she'll die
Maybe I'll cry
Therapists would say
""You're in denial""
But love became inconvenient
Love became a literal drag
Very bad for business
I'd be better off a fag
She's a model de sport
That I can't afford
'Cause I'm a practical American
From the Middle-West
And I can piss on a grave
While welcoming guests
If cold's what I am
I'm cold 'till the end
And I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her
Now I'm gonna continue walking
In the modern world
Which justifies every egotistical perversion
With scientific talk
And new ways to walk
But I'll remember the religion
She became to me
And the other person I could have been
So for now I'll say so long
I gotta go do wrong
I gotta go do wrong
I felt the luxury
I felt the luxury
I felt the luxury

She makes no sudden moves
Chalks it up to stealth

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Faith Vern]
She wants to be your James Bond
She wants to be your James Bond
Well, it's not for a price and it's not to be nice
She wants to be your James Bond
(James Bond)
She wants to be your James Bond
She wants to be your James Bond
She might stand in your way, but still she'll save the day
She wants to be your James Bond

[Verse 2: Iggy Pop]
Nuts melt in her mouth
But not in her hand
No need to figure it out
She just likes M&Ms
Sweet to the taste
Bitter in the gut
'Cause she fills them up
With you know what
She will not be shamed
She will not be blamed
When she confuses a tune
She blames it on you
Screaming, ""You're insane, you're insane""

[Bridge: Iggy Pop]
Didn't make the rules, so don't blame me
Most fools gravitate to vanity
And her sanity is insanity
Driving off while making you feel guilty
(James Bond)

[Chorus: Iggy Pop & Faith Vern]
She wants to be your James Bond
She wants to be your James Bond
She might stand in your way, but still she'll save the day
She wants to be your James Bond
(James Bond)
She wants to be your James Bond
She wants to be your James Bond
She'll become a double agent if you try her patience
So let her be your James Bond
(James Bond)
Let her be your James Bond
Just let her be your James Bond

[Outro: Iggy Pop]
Save the day, baby"

Sometimes they don't know why
But so much good's been misunderstood
In the blink of the eye

Or maybe it's just my life

She rocked her way around L. A

Look away look away

Now he was blond and she was dark
They called him thunder 'cause he had the spark
The dream he dreamed was straight and pure
But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure

Look away look away

They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots
Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots
They live the dreann and they went non-stop
They did' ok 'til the band broke up

Look away look away look away look away

Unfortunately the needle broke
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone
She was sellin something that I was on

Now thunder and me did not part friends
What we did once I wouldn't do again
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon
'til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon

Look away look away

So a few years later thunder died broke
Sable had a baby back at her folks
Me I went straight and serious too
There wasn't much else that I could do

Look away look away

So now that I'm straight I'm settled too

To existence with no song of me

And the hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low
There's a hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low

I built myself a beautiful brick wall
Gets a little higher every day
_? _ ignorance inhabits me
Cause I've already chased my love away

And the hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low
There's a hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low

Take that happy banner off the wall
I don't need to see no smiling face
All I really want's a cup of tea
To feel a warmth inside of me

And the hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low
There's a hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low

There's a hole in my heart
I'm lowdown
There's a hole in my heart
I'm low
There's a hole in my heart
I'm lowdown

But I'll get up and fight back, anyway
You and I aare not huge mainstream stars
But unlike them, we're really what we are

We got main street eyes
Watchin' as the big boys roll by
Under rotten television skies
We got main street eyes

I saw a kitten squashed in the street
I read about a plastic surgeon and his art collection.

We are played for suckers all the time
Phony rock and roll
It's a crime
I don't want to dip myself in trash
I don't want to give myself for cash

We got main street eyes
Tryin' to do what's decent with our lives
Under funny television skies
We got main street eyes

Walkin' around sometimes
I see a tension under the surface
People are just about ready to explode.

So hold me, and trust me
I love you, don't worry.
Keep your main street eyes

Complicated crushed up disappointed squirming angry thrusting stabbing regretting starving greedy human alien being, struggling down the street, up the alley, in the elevator, through the party, to the office, in the bedroom, on your way to the morgue. Bullshitting, lying, doing a good deed or feeling loved barely possible. Aware of insatiable demands of not a society all around you. Chunky frat boys in their shorts, pimps with old semite eyes, s** hoochies of the jungle, sensitive smart alec college graduates, critics fronting franticly in New York city, every body in L. A just plain licking ass or having it licked, irony in place of balls, balls in place of brains, brains in place of soul, where is the soul?, where is the love?, where am i?

The turning heads
The honking horns
Gave proof to her

That love was her game

She loves me, Miss Argentina

She runs free, Miss Argentina
Dripping blood
With lots of style

She loves to stay in bed and watch the movies play
She wants a husband who will worship and obey
The moods that she enjoys like children's
Games and football toys
She laughs without shame

She likes the military and the Rolling Stones
Her little brother has a t-shirt from Ramones
She's shy and sensitive and doesn't know the
Tougher games
But boy can she love

She's easy, Miss Argentina
A masterpiece without a frame
She runs free, Miss Argentina
But Venus is a dangerous game

She saves my spirit with a humanistic light
She's greedy, lazy, and impossible to like
She dresses sexually
And she's afraid of many things
Like being alone

She's back with mother now
She's over twenty-five
I tried to keep her, but she buried me alive
In love and birth and jealousy
And every emotion totally freed
Screaming at once

But she loves me, Miss Argentina
While she hides behind her smile
She runs free, Miss Argentina
Dripping blood with lots of style
She's lovely, Miss Argentina
A masterpiece without a frame

I don't want ""you""
No, not anymore
I've had enough of ""you""
Yeah I'm talking to ""you""
I wanna go to Paraguay
Live in a compound under the trees
With servants and bodyguards who love me
Free of criticism
Free of manners and bores [?]
I wanna be your basic Clyde [?]
Who made good
And went away while he could
To somewhere where people are still human beings
Where they have spirit
You take mother-fucking laptop
Just shove it into your goddamn foul mouth
Down your shit-eating gizzard
You fuckin' phony two-faced, three-timing piece of turd
And I hope you shit it out with all the words in it
And I hope the security services read those words
And pick you up and flay you
For all your evil and poisonous intentions
Cause I'm sick and it's your fault
And I'm gonna go heal myself now

It was a beautiful summer day
The sun was shining
And I found myself surrounded by Latin American and dark women

And as I looked at their ankles,
Their knees and their thighs,
And the curve of their bodies,
Their mysterious eyes
I couldn't help but thinking about their pussies
And I asked myself

Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy prance
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Pussy, pussy walk

Now you know from time to time
My musical group and I have occasion to visit
The high schools, jr. high schools and
Other centers ol learning in this wonderful land of
The united States of America
And when I do, from time to time
I run into the young girls that attend these places
And I see them smiling at me with their young girl clothes
And while I smile back, I never say anything
But inside I'm thinking
Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy love
Can your pussy shove
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy prance
Pussy, pussy walk

And then of course
Now all you men can relate to this
How sometimes you're supposed to go out of the house
And get something done
Like you're supposed to go to the store
And just go get a bottle of milk
Or just go to your job
And do it good and cone back home
But on the way, my God
There's a girl, and there's another girl, and there's another girl

And pretty soon you're surrounded
And your eyes are going one way
And your head is going another way
Ano your nose is going up
And your nose is going down
And you're thinking about that pussy
And it's become a real distraction
And you've gotta ask yourself

Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy prance
Can your pussy love
Can your pussy shove

Pussy walk

Down a river of a useless land
It was such a beautiful day
I heard a witchdoctor say
Ill turn you into a toadstool

I'm looking for the joke with a microscope

A muscle twitch, an auto it swerves
You want to speak you lose your nerve
Infinity throws you a curve
Dumps you in shit you don't deserve

As life roars by you in a blur
Leaves you murmuring a dirty word

A page out of a comic book
A chicken hanging on a hook
A reverie, a babbling brook
A sermonette, a tv. Cook

Shaking my hand at your fake head
A suicide, a certain look

A microphone, a blues guitar
Heaps of feeling near and far
Stupidity a mental scar
Cruel cruelty, oh cruelty
Harboring no inspiration
An alcoholic at the bar
Every insult goes to far

I was pissing on the desert sands,
When the desert whispered to me,
It said, isn't this a shame?
Things will never be the same...
I've learned this gets me so edgy

Now I'm looking for the joke with a microscope

I was a teenaged dinosaur
Stoned and obsolete
I didn't get fucked and I didn't get kissed
I got so fucking pissed

Using my head for an ashtray

I froze her out
Move by move
First I didn't hold her hand
Then I didn't touch her in bed
Then I wasn't tender with her upsets
Then I just told her to go
And still, she didn't go
I had to push.
Now this place is peaceful as a grave
It's dead quiet without her
And her stupid T. V. Shows
And young girl laughing
I was always ashamed she read cosmopolitan
I should have been proud of her
What did she want that was so bad?
She just wanted to believe that someone would
Love her and look after her always
She called me daddy
She called me daddy"

Through an airport corridor
I saw a comely goth girl
With tattos on her form
She gezed up with her pretty white fece
And shone her eyes on me
She shined my shoes and then I knew
That I would spellbound be

Her hair was not the shiniest
Her skin was not like silk
But she had a way of looking
That made me wanna milk
As I sat high above her
Her cleavage I could see
I contemplated both of them
That's how she spellbound me

She wore black on her clothing
And she wore black on her boots
Lt was lollapalooza day
But she didn't iike he groups
I got lost in her pale skin
And wanted to stay down
But I had someone waiting
So I left spellbound

So if you're dark and lovely
And you see me passing by
A smile I'd appreciate
And a little bit of crime
I haven' got a dollar
And I haven't gol a crown
I wander lost across this earlh
I'm just spellbound"

But my very last chance was shot
Now you're ridin' me down like a submarine

Some pocket money and a place to go

Hi hi ho it's a water a day

There's bears in the area and wolves at the door

On my way to an unhappy grave
Hi hi hey it's a water a day

Fussed over r in school
Fed and housed and entertained
Wanting to be cool
Summers in the grass
Winters warm and slow
Until the one thing on my mind was to just
Get up and go

We're the undefeated
We got what they want
We're so bored and spoiled
Life is just a bag of pot
We're the undefeated
Tv in the shade
Girls at all our parties
We have really got it made

There's a real mean world outside
Where many lives are lost
But struggle builds character
And we are growing soft
I don't want to sit and watch no tv show
I want to roam and be challenged
I want to grow and grow

We're the undefeated
We got what they want
We're so fucking spoiled
Life is just a bag of pot
We're the undefeated
Tv in the shade
Girls at all our parties
We have really got it made
What have we made?
A giant jail
A bunch of walls
That's all that we've made

Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down
Yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto

Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

Turn on the late night T. V.

It's meaningless and trivial
And it washes over me
And once again I wonder
Is this all there is for me

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Life seems so pathetic
I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed,
These walls that fallin' on my mind
Hold on for something better
That just drags you trough the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on
And try to take the hurt

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own (X2)"

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Some blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death.

Chorus
The killer's breed or the demon's seed,
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb.

The blind men shout let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time belsen feast... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.

Chorus

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you.
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song,
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.

(harris/smith)

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 acacia avenue meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free
So any time you're down the east end don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it she'll teach you more than you can know

Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness
Can't you see it only brings you sadness
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease

Some day when you're reaching the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

22, the avenue that's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay

Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that you've got
Caress her molest her she always does what you want

You're running away don't you know what you're doing
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags and you're coming with me"

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten me-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high."

Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat
from my brow
But it's not the fear cause
I'd rather go now

Trying to visualize the horrors that
will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die

God let us go now and finish what's
to be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done... On earth

Trying to justify to ourselves the
reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's
no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers"

I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathyzing with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all

And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war

So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading..... Like an old dream

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft conviction chances low

So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading..... Like an old dream

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace

Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves our kids from crime the trend
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it

Iron Maiden,Alexander The Great,/i/iron+maiden/alexander+the+great_20068056.html,"'my son ask for thyself another
Kingdom for that wich I leave
Is too small for thee'
(king philip of macedonia - 339 B. C.)

Near to the east
In a part of ancient greece
In an ancient land called macedonia
Was born a son
To philip of macedon
The legend his name was alexander

At the age of nineteen
He became the macedon king
And he swore to free all of asia minor
By the aegian sea
In 334 B. C.
He utterly beat the armies of persia

Alexander the great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King darius the third
Defeated fled persia
The scythians fell by the river of jaxartes
Then egypt fell to the macedon king as well
And he founded the city called alexandria

By the tigris river
He met king darius again
And crushed him again at the battle of arbela
Entering babylon
And susa treasures he found
Took persepolis the capital of persia

Alexander the great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the great
Became a God 'mongst mortal men

A phrygian king had bound a chariot yoke
And alexander cut the 'gordian knot'
And the legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of asia

Helonism he spread far and wide
The macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for christianity

Marching on marching on

The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to india
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the great
He died of fever in babylon"

Switch the dial and eat the worm.
Take your chances, kill the engine,
Drop your bombs and let it burn.

White flags shot to ribbons,
The truce is black and burned,
Shellshock in the kitchen,
Tables overturned.

Chorus
Back in the village again,
In the village.
I'm back in the village again.

Throwing dice now, rolling loaded,
I see sixes all the way.
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away.

No breaks on the inside,
Paper cats and burning barns,
There's a fox among the chickens,
And a killer in the hounds.

Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn.

Chorus

But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!

Spends her evenings dancing on a pole

And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy

Blood on the world's hands

Another  assassination
The same day a new creation
But what are they coming into
Security of a world that brings...

One day another killing
Somewhere there's someone starving
Another a savage raping
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day it goes on

Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a ceasefire

They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day it could be happening to us

Don't be afraid, you're safe with me,
Safe as any soul could be... Honestly,
Just let yourself go.

Chorus:
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... Oh oh

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing,
You try to hide your deepest sins,
Of all the things that you've done wrong,
And I know where you belong.

Time is always on my side,
Time is always on my side.

Make you an offer you can't refuse,
You've only got your soul to lose...
Eternally... Just let yourself go!

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!"

There's a madman in the corner of
your eye
He likes to pry - into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street
with you and I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is...
He wants to pay you back with guilt...

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery

There's a prophet in the gutter
in the street
He say ""you're damned!"" -
and you believe him...
He's got a vision but it shines out
through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear...
He's felt what love means...
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you - he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery

It's only love that holds the key to
our hearts...
It's only love...

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery

To make your ends as a bloody whore.

(Billy Gibbons)
(Note: Performed at the Marquee club 19. 12. 1985)
(Note: Original by zz Top, on album Rio Grande Mud)

In a flat Forty-One with my strat on the door
we was goin' to the country for what we came for.
I'm sure you've smelled the trees in the air.
The best of motor cruisin's just the joy to get there.

I was approachin' Simonton down by the cotton gin.
There was old man Berkman trying to flag me in.
He asked if I would stay awhile and if I needed gas.
I said, ""No thanks, anyhow I don't drive too fast.""

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
ride my Chevrolet.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
ride my Chevrolet.

I took the road down to Cinco
through that red Brazos River land,
done hit that freeway at sunset.
Now the big city lights are at hand.

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
ride my Chevrolet.
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
ride my Chevrolet."

I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh just to see a smile

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again?

The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on?
When will it ever end?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here

You see the full moon float
You watch the red sun rise
We take these things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying

Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh will we learn someday?

No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, no seed

If he had lived he would have crucified us all
Now he's standing on the last step
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all

Now it burns his hand he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground what did we learn

You're children of the damned

As the waves and ecos of the

Over borders that divide the

No greed and no religion
Just a hunred winged souls

We will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birth

To albions land
Coming home
When I see the runwai lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast

Coming home, far away
As the vapor trails aline
Where I've been tonight
You know I wiil not stay

Carving on the edge of daylight
Till it slips into the void
Waited in the long night dreaming
Till the sun is born again

Strech the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
Speck of dust and cosmic sand

Over borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
Through the dark atlantic
Over mariners stormy waves

We will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birth

To albions land

For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer
They will never know we care
Shall we keep the fires burning
Shall we keep the flames alight
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

And if we do forget them
And the sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again
Shall we dance the dance in sunlight
Shall we drink the wine of peace
Shall our tears be of joy
Shall we keep at bay the beast

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears, Oooohooooo, ohooooooo...

Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquished
Only horror, only pain

No more tears, no more tears

(Original by Jethro Tull on album Aqualung)

Who would be a poor man a beggerman, a thief
If he had a rich man in his hand
Who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth
If he could take it from the money man

Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays the game
She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school

Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play

Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along.
She's a poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song
She's a rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate helps the poor man get along"
Iron Maiden,Dance Of Death,/i/iron+maiden/dance+of+death_10145243.html,"(Gersharris)

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more

I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace

Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals

And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled

I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it

When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead"
Iron Maiden,Deja Vu,/i/iron+maiden/deja+vu_20068060.html,"When you see familiar faces

Could you be wrong?

When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

'cause you know that this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before
Isn't it strange

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next
It feels pre-arranged

'cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal

Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting War for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame.

Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on.
If you're gonna try, just stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

The Frenchman did surmise,
Through earthquakes and starvation,
The warlord will arise.
Terror, Death, Destruction,
Pour from the Eastern Sands,
But the truth of all predictions,
Is always in your hands.

And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace

An end to the strife and the world's misery. But the end never came

An end to the strife and the world's misery. But the end never came
And we're digging the graves. And we're loading the guns for the kill

Can the end be at hand? Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy

Can the end be at hand? Is the face in the sand?

Iron Maiden,Fates Warning,/i/iron+maiden/fates+warning_20068008.html,"Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
And some of us are here just so that we'll die
How come the bullet hits the other guy
Do we have to try and reason why

Be it eavil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away
It is a hand on your shoulder from the lord above
Or the devil himself come to give you a shove

A vulcano errupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in it's way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind"

We live our lives in fever
In a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can
feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream
""Don't touch!""

I remember a time when we
used and abused
And fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that
passion was free
In the heart of the night... Bodies aflame

We live in fever...

I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares till somebody
famous dies...

I remember a time when we
used and abused
And fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that
passion was free
In the heart of the night... Bodies aflame

Now we live, in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key - to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority
gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards
till the day you die..."

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's
Always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
Always there

Have you run your fingers down
The wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's
Watching you

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's
Someone there

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's
Always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's
Always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone"

You're st. George or you're david and you always killed the beast.
Times change very quickly,
And you had to grow up early,
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.

Chorus
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner forgotten by no one.
You llived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honour.

The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.

See the madman in his gaze

Fly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your wings like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Look the old man in his eyes
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings burn to ashes to ashes his grave

But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many

Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain corruption
Bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe
A holy war winner

They fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only God would know
And as he lies in heaven
Or it could be in hell
I feel he's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

Sometimes it seems more like
The blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more famine, death and war
You know religion has a lot to answer for

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is

And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are
Scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins

And all because of it you'd think
That we would learn
But still the body count the city fires burn
Somewhere there's someone dying
In a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man
Tell me why, tell me why

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is

The minds of the men who are on their way home

I'm scarred for life
But it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can I face the torment alone
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light

People say 'don't worry'
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're saying
I am living in my own world
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time

I hear voices in my head
Could I really be going crazy
In the night the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die
When you laugh are you really crying
You're not sure what's real anymore

No pain anymore

I feel that my spirit's broken
I wonder if I've the strength...

more more more

down the road
She heard a sound that made
her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
""I'll take you on a ride

crazy dreams

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend

You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile

In gangland -- murder's up for sale
Dead men -- tell no tales
In gangland -- where jail birds die

Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide?  How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now your alone but alive for how long?

A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail

Dead men -- tell no tales
In gangland -- murder's up for sale

As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time.
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole,
The sands of time for me are running low.

When the priest comes to read me the last rites,
I take a look through the bars at the last sights,
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me.

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror.
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming,
It's not easy to stop from screaming,
But words escape me when I try to speak.

Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying.
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard,
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you"".
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand,
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion.

I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.

I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.

[Chorus *2]

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.

Oh Oh * lots.

My body tingles, I feel so strange,
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well,
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Scared to fall asleep again
Incase the dream begins again

Standing rigid a nightmare's statue
What a dream when will it end
And will I trancend?

Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
Getting me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in to deep

Even though it's reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder it makes me think
There's more to this I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

It can't be all coincedence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spirtualist? well me I'm neither
But wouln't you like to know the thruth
Of what's out there to have the proof
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end, in heaven or in hell

Help me help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me save me from myself
Even within my dreams

There's got to be just more to it than this

Muster the men from all the villages
You'd better get ready to fight with your enemies

Beacons are burning

The battle is nearing

From the red sky of the east. To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us

But that was just a dream. And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream for evermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, come to mourn. All the colors of the dawn
Will this Journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want and I say what I want
And no one can take it away. I know what I want
And I say what I want. And no one can take it away (x2)

But the memory still remains. All those past years not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud

And the heartbeat of the day drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light, that is burning in the night
Then this Journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want and I say what I want
And no one can take it away. I know what I want
And I say what I want. And no one can take it away (x2)

Lights out - We live in a world
Of darkness
No doubt - Everything's up for sale
We sleep - All of the world is burning
We pray - To god for a better deal
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now
Everything's wasted...
Is that all there is?
Can I go now?

Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide

Fight wars - Die in a blaze of glory
Come home - Meat in a plastic sack
Fall down - Better pray to your God
For mercy
So kneel - and help the blade cut clean
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now
Everyone's wasted...
Is that all there is?
Is that it now?

I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams...

A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind

You question your beliefs,
Your inner thoughts, your whole existence
And if there is a God then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong

Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree

When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses doors were open
No had to care those days are gone
Those days are gone

I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When poeple didn't have much money
But didn't seem to care

Aggression that you see everyday
A sick society looks the other way."

The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night.

And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see.

With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.

But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer

I ask myself could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again

There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark

As the wind is blowing treetops
And the swaying rustling leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall
Only God knows

Welcome to ""not alot of people know that, part 5."" Yes, you lot out there, ah you're so
Lucky again! How can you be getting so lucky, my God! Flight of Icarus in those grubby
Dirty by now horribly sticky little fingers and hands and grubby palms, and oh what else is
Grubby, I don't know. Flight Of Icarus, I've Got The Fire! Wooo, I have right now thinking
About this, oh my goodness the memories for this, my very first exotic jaunt over to the
Island of Jersey, followed by a swift little airplane ride 3000 kilometres due... East of
Ah... Well no, no, got that wrong, due west of Watford. My goodness, I go the wrong way
And get to bleedin Russia, it'd be all over. Yes, due west of Watford, 3000 odd bloody
Miles -- forget this kilometre stuff, where do you think you are, bleedin France? No
Thanks very much, I'm right here!
Anyway, Flight of Icarus, doo dee doo! Flight Of Icarus, my first single, released the 11th
Of April 1983, chart position number eleven... Da de de da! Didn't quite get to number ten,
Did it? Anyway, my first record with the band... I starred in the video! Did you see that?
Did you see that handsome geezer with the blue chops? Wasn't half cold out there!
Anyway no! We did this... Ah, fantastic! First trip to Jap... Uh... From Jersey to Nassau to
Do the album, we had five weeks rehearsal in Jersey.... Well, we had two weeks really
Because ended up three weeks partying at the bar. My goodness, we had the only
24-hour bar on the island, and we ah... Funnily enough we managed to cram 25 hours in a
Day, hahaha! So there we are, fifteen days before we're supposed to leave.... Fifteen
Days! We hadn't even written any... Well, the boys had written some.... But we really
Hadn't rehearsed anything cause we was partying to much and having a good time, and
All that good stuff. So there you are, we get this.... Most of the song's written, get to
Jersey, boom!
Oh, by the way, when we first arrived in Jersey, the first place we went to was a place
Called The Traveller's Rest. Dear Tony Wiggins our tour manager, he told us all about this
Place because he checked it out before us. Said ""here look, you've got to come in this
Place before we go"" and that's the first thing we did, got of the plane, picked the
Suitcase up, ""HILLO!"" They said, ""HOWWYOU!"", ""we're fine"", ""Ok you can come through"".
So we go through, get in the cabs... Off we go, Traveller's Rest. Stopped in the
Traveller's Rest. ""You've gotta have a banana daquery"" says Tony Wiggens. Well allright,
Lets have a drop.. Banana juice... We says, banana juice... It's a poof's drink! So, fair
Enough, so there we are sitting at the bar, and there's five poofs sitting at the bar, us!
Hahaha! Drinking these daqueries. Hahaha, no! So, the first one goes down, we thought
""f'king great, nothing to it, lets have another one!"" F'king second one goes down...
Fifteen minutes later we're on our third banana daquery. Now, we're talking serious
Alcohol here but you don't taste it because it's a frozen drink, it's bunged in a blender,
Loads of ice, ton of banana liqueur, na... Banana, lot of lichee, and lots of wizzing around
Of varous parts, and you stick it in a glass and stuff it up with a straw. For about... Three
Of these as I said later, ... Quarter of an hour goes by... Half an hour, we try to stand up
And leave. I mean, it was like, you know, ""Gaaaahh, where we goin?"" Ah, we were gone!
We, we, we spent many a night down in that place, but only after an hour... We did have
A party after we actually recorded Flight of Icarus... We went down to the pub and ah,
Tried to get it and gave up. The next day it weren't happening, but we went after we
Celebrated... We went out and celebrated the first single being recorded.
But just before we did this, recorded the song. Steve said to me, he said, ""don't you
Think we ought to speed it up a bit? "" I said, ""Yeah, I think it should be a bit faster. "" And
Dave and H.... Um, Bruce and H, sorry, had written this song. And they were like very
Adamant about the tempo of this thing, they didn't want it sort of speeding up or
Anything like this. So 'Arry said ""play it a bit faster."" I said ""yes, I'll nuts it up, don't
Worry"" So we get in the studio and rehearsed it, we done it once or twice and it was,
You know, happening. But not so... F'king hell, I'll boost it up a tad... I'll pump it... You
Know. So I'm out there, ""boom do do da do do doom do do da! do do doom..."" you know,
Allright we go... Hah! And ah Bruce, Dave and H going ""aah Nick, what you.. F'king...
What'd you doing? "" You know, I said ""Nothing! "", and I thought to myself, ""Ah there we
Go, the new boy in the band, and they think he's only been in the band f'king two
Months and he's speeding everything up, you know. "" Anyway, as it turned out, it's great,
Wasn't it? It was really a good song.
So, they asked me to do the video. So out we are, and they said, ""look do you want to
Do the video? You can be the old man in it. "" I said, ""Old man? Look here, look here who
Do you think you're talking to... Old man! Give us a break! "" They said, ""well you are,
Aren't ya. "" F'king cheek! Swift kick up the jackseat for that! Ah boof! That gave them
One right up the bum, didn't it? So there I am, I'm out there, they said... I said, allright I'll
Do the video. And they said, yeah but ahhh..... We gotta blue your chops. I said ""what?""
They said, ""we gotta put blue makeup on your face."" I said, ""you can piss off! I ain't
Having none of that! "" They said, ""You f'king will, if you wanna star in the video! "" Neeah!
So there! You wanna do it or not? I thought, ""well.... F'king 'ell, I am the new boy, and I
Should do it really, it'll be a bit fun. "" And it was, it turned out to be the most amazing...
Fun... I tell ya, we really had a good time. Couple of dodgy moments when I was standing
On the edge of this little cliff looking down at the... Or looking out to the ocean. The wind
Was blowing, no the wind. I mean, I was (farting noise) as well, certainly, but
Nevertheless. It was... I was crying a lot of that, sixty... Fifty... Sixty feet down to the
Ocean! F'king great big waves rolling in there, I mean I only needed to fall over and that
Was it! Goodbye, no f'king Icky to help me out with the wings.... C'mon dad, watch this!
Anyway, that leads me on to I've Got The Fire, which is on the b-side as you know, of
Flight Of Icarus. Now, for you boys and girls out there who've been paying attention and
Doing your homework, and buying the first, second, third, and fourth box set of the new
Singles, et cetera, or the old new singles. I've Got The Fire was recorded on the very
Very first Maiden single which was Running Free, now we've already talked about that.
But the boys decided to do it. Steve said, ""I'd like to have the penultimate... Or not the
Penultimate, the definive... De... Definitive version of this, studio version wise, lets do
It again. "" So that's why we bunged that one on the Icarus single.
Now moving on slowly but surely to The Trooper. Now that's a great old.... Oh man,
That's a song to play, man! (hums and drums in the background).... All that, yeah! Gosh!
Bringing back some.... I wanna go out and do it. Based on a charge of the light brigade!
Watch out! My goodness, woah, never has there been so many to fight so few! Or
Whatever, I don't know, that was Winnie, the wrong one. Aces High, that's coming up
Next kids. Yeah, well that's you know, in the next box set if you go out and buy it, you'll
Hear it on the next ""Nicko's uuh, you didn't know... You know not a lot of people knew
That... "" Right? Number six I guess it'll be then. But anyway, yeah, oh I remember.... In....
What was it? What was it? Into the valley of death rode the however many it was, that
Was what I was trying to think of and I got the Winnie quote down the wrong way.
Nevertheless! Yes, great song.
Cross-eyed Mary. Ian Anderson wrote this song, Jethro Tull played it. We recorded it...
The b-side. Did I tell you it was released the 28th of June 1983? Chart position 12? Well if
I told you that once already, f'king too bad! So what! Nyah! See. Had to get that one in.
And as a matter of fact, the Cross-eyed Mary received.... Gosh, I mean, ultimates
Ultimates lots of loads of and indies and outsies of you. S. Airplay, I tell ya, this was one of
The biggest... The song to be played the most on you. S. Airplay from Iron Maiden. Ain't
That funny. It's the best one that they ever played. Well I guess their answer would say
That's f'king life, innit.
Oh by the way, just before I sign off... Because I've gotta go now... You know, there's a
Beer waiting for me down the road in the bar. So I thought I'd better go in and have
Myself a little liquid libation, being I'm half way throught these little box sets here. Did
You hear the one about the queer shepherd? No? Well, he kept mounting goats!

The very first little box set of the re-released singles from Iron Maiden. Well, I've got to
Say this, welcome to Not a lot of people know that, part 1. Cause here, I'm here I'm
About to tell you a few stories now and in the next oooh nine releases of this here box
Sets, over the period of the next ten weeks. Now look here, first of all, my goodness, it's
Ten years almost to the day... My... Ooh little chickadees out there, oh you've got your
Grubby little hands on Running Free, Burning Ambition, oh gosh! The very first single!
Sanctuary, Drifter, and I've Got The Fire, the second singles.. Gosh! The first one was
Released, as I said, almost ten years to the very day on February 8, 1980. Cor, dear!
Here, I'll tell you something, right? You know 'Arry... 'Arry Harris, right, he had a band
Called Gypsy's Kiss.... Yeah it's disgusting isn't it... And you know what that rhymes with
Dontya? Well if you don't, I'm not gonna tell ya anyway so there. He had this song called
Burning Ambition, which I suppose was a real sort of drive for 'Arry then because he was,
You know, full of ambition to get his music out and play it to people, and he had this
Song. And he was in this band Gypsies Kiss, well they were, cause they couldn't handle
This song. And they turned around and said ""'Arry you know look at all these chord
Changes and time changes"", as he's famous for, and I should know... Come on, give us a
Break. So, he took the song to the band and they've gone, ""Oi 'Arry, gypsies kiss off will
Ya, I can't play that! "" And he said, ""Oi, I've had enough of this then, I'm gonna go find
Some people that can, so kiss you and all"". So anyway that's what he did. Not kiss them,
No, he did the other thing, you know, what it rhymes with... Mm off. I'll say he pissed
Off, so there you go. Whatever. Now he went out and he formed a band, and um.. Uuh,
Burning Ambition was actually recorded late in 1979 and originally featured the original
Drummer in fact of.. In fact I think there was one guy before him... But Doug Sampson was
On drums in those days. Dave double tracked on guitars... You know, he double tracked
And all.. He doesn't have to though, does he? You know what I'm saying.
Well, ok, Running Free as well was also the first art work from Riggsy... Riggsy! Now you
Knowi tell people I'm actually from another planet you know cause I'm a bit off the wall,
Well I'll tell you this boy owns the other planet, my goodness! No god bless him, he's a
Diamond guy I love him, what an artist! He first brought Eddie into the first sleeve on this
The Running Free single, and Eddie if you remember rightly was standing in the shadows,
You never really saw him. But uh, oh my goodness, he brought him out didn't he, on the
First album all in his glory and splendour, Eddie comes out and go ""yeeeeh I'm here,"" so
Watch out folks. Well there, what can you say about it, Running Free, it's a song the
Band still to this day plays, it's one of the truly great Iron Maiden songs, I mean not only
Just because it was their first single, but... What a crack.
And now then, well we've gone through that, Burning Ambition we talked about, on the
Other side we got Sanctuary... On the other single rather, we've got Sanctuary, Drifter
Live, and I've Got The Fire, an old Montrose song. Well this... This was the first top-30
Entry actually, it made number 29 and uh, oh you know the boys were really happy it
Was released 23rd of May 1980 cor dearie me, it was a couple within a few months of
One another... You lucky boys and girls! Woah, as I said you've got one every week for
Ten weeks coming out here... Ah, oh well. This was recorded by the way... The live Drifter
And I've Got The Fire, was recorded in the Marquee in April 1980. And that was a good
Year, I've got a good drop of wine at home made in 1980, yeah still got half a bottle left,
It's really good. I've Got The Fire, it's an old Montrose song as I said, and Steve liked it
So he recorded it live, and it used to be a set opener for the band in those days, but on
The back of that they kind of got into the deal of like not recording sort of Iron Maiden
Songs on the b's, this was when the beginnings when b-sides were other people's songs
That the band decided to play.
Anyway around this time, they uh, they didn't get top of the pops... Rotten buggers... But
We all know why, it's the bleedin bbc isn't it? Well you know we'll work out some sort of
Abbreviation for that later on... But anyway they couldn't get on because there was some
Industrial action, you know strikes and all that good stuff, you know what the bbc
Usually like to do...
You! He moved the broom!
Well, is he a labourer? No he f'king well ain't!
Well that's it, we're going on strike. Put your teacups up to your face lads, lets go out to
The canteen and have another drink...
You know, whatever... Well what can you say, what can you say, strikes all around. So
The boys didn't get to play top of the pops -- that's no biggie, you know they never play
The band anyway do they? Poxy bbc... Chrity!
Anyway funnily enough, around this time it the very first gig I ever did with Iron Maiden,
No not actually playing with them like as a band, a full band. I played in a band called
Mckitty, and these guys in Mckitty... A guy called Donnovan Mckitty himself, we did a gig
In Belgium, and it was in fact... Not a lot of people know this... But it was in fact Maiden's
Very first European gig, how about that, and I was there! So there! Hmm! Stuff that up
Your f'king pipe and smoke it! Right! So there you go. I was, I was really privileged to be
There, and that's when I really first met the band, we got on so well and we had such a
Riot.... What can I say?
Anyway, you remember the Sanctuary sleeve, you lot? Yeah... Maggie Thatcher... Weeelll,
Can you believe it, she was there, you know what she was trying to do... Stupid cow...
She was trying to pull down an Iron Maiden poster off the wall. Well, what can you say
About that? Not a lot, believe me! She was... I dunno why they called her the iron
Maiden, do you? Nothing like this.... I know why! Maybe because she's like Eddie!
Hahahaha!
Listen! By the way I've got to tell you this little story real quick, allright, I'm running out
Of time on this one but nevertheless... You remember Eddie, right? Course you remember
Eddie! Well this is the origin of Eddie, right. The band used to have this backdrop which
Featured this theatrical mask and it sort of spat out all this red dye and smoke and all
That gobby stuff and here's poor old Clive sitting under it getting gobbed on every
Night... ""Oy! what's all this?!"", he's going, ""What's all this red st... You know, this shit
Coming over my head, I've had enough of that paint"", eh.... Anything you could find,
Anything they could find they'd sling in it. Anyway, they called him Eddie the Head, see,
And it's after an old East-End joke that goes as follows:
'Ere, Eddie was very unfortunate, he was born without a body. So nevertheless, his
Parents loved him dearly and took him home and placed him on the mantelpiece one day.
Well, his family gave him lots of love and attention and he always got loads of presents
On his birthday kind of... Blowing things, and hats and all that kind of stuff, wow...
Anyway one year he was about 16, and the hospital phoned up Eddie's parents and they
Said to them, they said ""look, due to modern technology and all those good things that
We can do with you know all this stuff nowadays, we are now able to build Eddie a
Body. "" So, with this the parents were soooo excited, they couldn't believe it, and they
Couldn't wait to tell Eddie, I mean this is it, Eddie's gonna have a body! Weeeha!
However, as it was close to his birthday, they decided to tell the doctors to go ahead
And build his body, and then they would surprise him, you know they weren't far away
From his birthday... Well, a good birthday present, so anyway... A few weeks later the big
Day arrived, yes, Eddie's birthday. So his parents goes up to him, and walked up to the
Mantelpiece and ""Hello Eddie, how you doin? This year is gonna to be the best birthday
Yet! Have we got something for you, such a wonderful present! And his mum's going ""Oh
Goodness Eddie we're so pleased! "" And Eddie's going, ""Oh no! "" said Eddie, ""Not another
Fucking hat! ""
Hahahahaha! Oh, I think it's funny! Shit, it is! It's pretty good innit! Anyway, after
This... Anyway, Derek came up with the creature Eddie and the body and that on the
Record covers, and the name was just carried over and the rest is history innit? And
Eddie's out there, yet he's got to have a bit of nookie before long, that's all I can say"
Iron Maiden,Look For The Truth,/i/iron+maiden/look+for+the+truth_20068089.html,"All my dark dreams
Drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men

In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced

Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fear is within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

Oooooooh, oooooooh.....

I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To the shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

Ooooooooh, ooooooooooh....

Here is the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal

These are things you can't reveal

We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man
Infernal sacrifice of hell

Down into the fiery underworld below

We are not worthy in your black
And blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day

Shadow on us all
And all our sins to you we give this day

Others wait their turn
Their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us

We are cast out by our bloody father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world the only one we trust

I've found that I like this living in danger
Living on the edge it makes feel as one
Who cares what's right or wrong,
It's reality
Killing so we survive
Wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide
Gotta get away!

I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality

I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to believe what we've become

Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies

To be lord of the flies

At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo
Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit is forced to yield
There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but doesn't care though
In fact, he doesn't care at all
The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear
If God is in the heavens
How can this happen here?
In His name, they used the weapons
For the massacre
There is a point below zero
Where the sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead in the sand"

he got a bollocking, because you, you know, you dunno what the fuck he's goin' on
about, but he didn't really deserve it. All he's trying to do is relay a message from me to
you, right? And he went the wrong way about it, okay?
Nicko: Yeh, he did go the wrong way about it.
Steve: Well then.
Nicko: Well I'm, I, I, I, I tell you what, I mean it ain't gonna happen again.
Bruce: I don't see where you get steamed, I mean, if the truss was gonna...
Nicko: Why I got steamed up Bruce is because he fucked me right up. And I knew there
was a problem, I still didn't know what it was even after he...I, I fucked! I fucking fucked
up!
Steve: I know that. Look, it's like...
Nicko: ...and I stopped, and it was like ""oh, for fuck's sake!"" Come on kids, and I'm
looking around... what is he trying to tell me? What's the problem?
Steve: Can't you understand? Can't you understand if I'm trying to get a fucking
message through to ya, right?...I'd have still...it'd a been a lot worse. If I, if I had to go
me gear done...as it happens, (snaps his fingers) just in the nick of the time I got it
done. If I...
Nicko: Yeah, I still didn't get the message.
Steve: I know you didn't. But what we're saying, it didn't... whatever happens if I got
him trying to get a fuckin' message to ya. Y'know what I mean?
Nicko: Sure Steve, but the fact is that the guy was not handling it the right way.
Steve: You don't think of things like that Nick.
Nicko: But that's diff... look...
Steve: I bollocked...I was shouting at ya, ""look, my gear's gone down"".
Nicko: It's me that fucked-up.
Steve: Listen...
Nicko: I'm the one out there all on me own...
Steve: I know.
Nicko: ...I'm doing a drum solo. And I've got fuckin' talkin' to...
Steve: No I'm the one, I'm only one 'a thinking, I've got fucking like a minute to go
before m..., to get this fucking gear right.
Bruce: Yeah, but if somebody gives a message to me...
Steve: No?
Bruce: ...I mean, it doesn't matter who it is, I mean, the message gets through.
Nicko: Bruce, it's different...
Steve: It's a different situation.
Nicko: ...it's different for you. You're not standing there all on your fucking own having a
somebody try to get your attention and talk to you. I'm playin' a drum solo, and the
guy's standing a yard, or two yards behind my drum riser goin'...
Steve: Yeah, all I'm trying a...
Nicko: ...""fucking anga-yangna-baba""...""wha?""...""BABA-BABA-BABA!""...""WHAAAA???...""
the fuck! Uhhhhh! By the time I've got that far, I'm fuckin totally fucked. Because I'm
p..., I'm not paying attention to my gig...

Nicko: ...I'm paying attention to what he's trying to tell me.
Bruce: Yeah, but nobody woulda noticed.
Steve: I complete...
Nicko: I noticed!
Steve: I completely understand that.
Nicko: Fucked me right up.
Steve: But he, he was only doing what I told him to do, and that was get a message to
you. Now that the fucking heat of the moment and just, everything on hand... he don't
think to fucking tell Bill, he wants to get the message to you, not to fucking Bill, so he
don't think of that, he just tries to get the message to you, right? So, he don't fucking
deserve to get a bollocking for that, I mean, alright he got one I know... not sayin that.
But I just don't, you know...

Nicko: Cunt was standin' behind, I was sittin' down.
Steve: Yeah...
Nicko: ...""bada-bada-ba""

Bruce: It wasn't deliberate.
Steve: He made a mistake...
Nicko: Now, I know it ain't deliberate.
Steve: ...for fuck's sake.
Nicko: I didn't know that at the time, right? I still didn't know that Steve had a problem
with his bass...
Steve: That's what I'm saying.
Nicko: ...luckily enough, by the time I finished the poxy solo, he had his bass working
again.
Steve: It was all that fucking grief...
Bruce: All it takes is the guy...
Nicko: The grief was, because I bollocked him up, and I happened to tell ya, and you go
""don't bollock him, go out and apologize,"" right. Fuck him, I'm gonna go and apologize to
him.
Bruce: Well all you gotta do...
Nicko: It's not for me to apologize. I bollocked him 'cause he fucked me up. Right there,
he fucked me up. He was wrong.
Bruce: All you gotta do...no he wasn't wrong.
Nicko: He was.
Steve: He wasn't wrong.
Nicko: He did not handle it...he's not even fucking communicating, right?
Steve: Aw! I don' wanna fuckin argue about this, it's fucking stupid... I think you're really
out of order, I think...honestly.
Nicko: No bollocks! Oh I am not out of order.
Steve: You are. You're attitude is out of order.
Nicko: He...no it ain't.
Steve: It is.
Nicko: No it ain't. The guy fucked me up.
Steve: I know he did...
Nicko: Well then that's out of order...
Steve: ...He didn't mean to.
Nicko: LOOK, I'M NOT SAYIN HE FUCKIN' MEANT TO 'ARRY!!! The fact is that he was a
dumbkopf, 'cause he don't know how to fuckin communicate with me onstage...
Bruce: But he's not a dumbkopf.
Nicko: Aww!
Steve: He's not fuckin' stupid.
Nicko: Well, he fuckin' certainly did a good job out there this afternoon, didn't he?
Steve: He made a mistake, because I...
Nicko: What do you mean ""He made a mistake""?
Steve: Because I...
Nicko: You sent him. How could he make a mistake?
Steve: That's right.
Nicko: How did he make a mistake?
Steve: Well, he made the mistake by not sending Bill first, right?
Nicko: Well, well he made a mistake, right?
Steve: Yeah.
Nicko: Well, why?...
Bruce: There's a difference between making a mistake...
Steve: Well that's what I'm saying.
Bruce: ...and a difference between making a human error...
Nicko: Right, so he made a mistake, right?
Steve: Yeah!
Nicko: And I'm griefed up cause he fuckin' made me make a mistake. Now that he... now
I can understand what he was talking about after the fact... it remains to be seen, he
was on a mission from you.
Steve: Aw, I'm not gonna argue about it.
Nicko: Right? Fuck my old boots, it just... I can't hack... I can't handle that situation
when people think some can't make me grief, and it's important to me to get a message
like that...fucking hell! How can I get some... get, get... when I also fucked as well... I
would'na minded if I'd have gotten what it was happening straight. Like, on the end ""all
right, 'Arris got his bass fucked, right I'll carry on and do something else"", then that's
fine, if I didn't fuck-up... but he made me fuck. It totally threw me right out, and he
wasn't...
Steve: I know it did.
Nicko: ...He didn't know how to talk to me about it. And, and I've, I've told him ""don't do
that again.""
Steve: Because, see, it's not, it's not, it's not fair relaying a message to people. He was
just...
Nicko: And he never turned 'round.
Steve: ...look, it coulda been anybody. It was just that he was the first one on hand.
Nicko: 'Arry.
Steve: He was just standing there.
Nicko: He never turned around, he never even turned around afterwards and said ""Listen,
did you?...I'm sorry, but you didn't understand what I was saying right?""
Steve: Well why should he?
Nicko: Well then, then, then because...
Steve: He got a fuckin' bollocking.
Nicko: ...He woulda stood up for himself because he knows he was gotten a bollocking
wrong, because he was on a mission from you.
Steve: He was probably...
Bruce: No.
Steve: He was probably fuckin upset...
Bruce: He's probably a bit upset.
Steve: ...because you gave him a fucking bollocking.
Nicko: Well, rightly.
Steve: You gave him up for...as far as he's con...
Bruce: No, not rightly.
Nicko: Rightly, yeah.
Steve: But no, it's not rightly.
Bruce: No!
Nicko: I told him ""DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN!""
Steve: No.
Bruce: That's crazy.
Steve: But what?...
Bruce: What happens if the lighting truss is gonna fall down on your head? Does he
go?...
Nicko: Well then somebody drags me out of the fuckin' way, or else I'm dead, right?
Bruce: Yeah, but don't... I mean... you know.
Steve: I think your attitude is totally fucking out of order.
Nicko: No it ain't. No it ain't.
Steve: Yes it is.
Nicko: No it ain't. If I'd have known... now I'm the fuckin' cunt all of a sudden.
Steve: No, you're not the cunt.
Bruce: You're not a cunt.
Nicko: Because I told him he was out of order, and I didn't know he was on a mission
from you to tell me that his bass, your bass was FUCKED!
Steve: I know you didn't.
Bruce: All you've got to do Nicko, is just go to the guy and say...
Steve: You didn't know, and he didn't know, alright?
Bruce: ""Sorry about, sorry about shouting. It was a misunderstanding. But in future, tell
Bill"" that's all you gotta say.
Nicko: No. No.
Bruce: And that way, he's a fuckin' proud geezer...
Steve: What's, what's the matter with ya?
Bruce: He goes...
Nicko: Look...
Steve: 'Cause if this is some sorta pride thing or what?
Nicko: I bollocked him... no it ain't pride. It's, it's not fuckin' pride.
Steve: Well what's the matter with ya?
Bruce: It is pride.
Nicko: Oh bollocks!
Steve: What's the matter with ya?
Nicko: The guy was wrong to have been fuckin' there to do what he done.
Steve: I know. All I'm, all I'm gonna say is that when you're going up tomorrow...
Bruce: No it isn't wrong. What's he supposed to do? Turn around...
Steve: ...this is a different attitude, 'cause this is fucking stupid.
Nicko: I told him straight out not to do it again.
Bruce: What's he supposed to do? What's he?...
Nicko: I'm not gonna go out and apologize for saying that to him...
Bruce: He's NOT!
Nicko: ...He was outta fuckin' order.
Bruce: He's not out of order.
Bruce: what happens...
Nicko: Bruce.
Bruce: ...if I fucking go and tell somebody to do something, he goes ""No, fuck off! I'm
not gonna do that.""
Nicko: Listen, Bruce...
Bruce: Then he's out of order.
Nicko: Bruce...
Bruce: But he goes and tells him to go and do something...
Nicko: ...I'm not concerned with, with, with, with, with other people that can't fucking
talk to me on stage, who don't know how to fucking communicate with me...

You tell me what is certain
But I'll tell you what is true
You tell me that is honesty
When all around is death and cruelty

The making of a man is fire
By giving in to our desires
Within the truth that lies
Within the only thing

Mother Of Mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother Of Mercy
Taking my last breath of fire

Mother Of Mercy
Angel of pain
Mother Of Mercy
Taking my last breath

Some say you are a lost cause
Some say you're a Saint
Just being here's an act of
Sufering and restraint

Walk down the long dark road
To ruin panic not
I'll die a lonely death of that
I'm certain of

Rivers flow with blood
There's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend
There's anyone left alive

Sick of all the killing
And the reek of death
Will God tell me
What religion is to man

I don't hold with bad religion
Understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it
I just don't hold at all you know it

You say you are a holy man
But what is it you do
From where I stand is nothing
But a hollow man I see

Mother Of Mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother Of Mercy
Taking my last breath of fire

Mother Of Mercy
Angel of pain
Mother Of Mercy
Taking my last breath

I'm just a lonely soldier fighting
In a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting
Who it is or what I'm fighting for

Though it was for money
Make my fortune now I'm not
So sure
Seem to just have lost my way"

Turning the tides of history

The anger the grief
Can you be happy

Iron Maiden,Murders In The Rue Morgue,/i/iron+maiden/murders+in+the+rue+morgue_20068000.html,"I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night.
I was strolling through the streets of paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain.
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side.

Murders in the rue morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murders in the rue morgue
Run before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
At last there's someone heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all.
But I must have got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak french so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away.

Murders in the rue morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murders in the rue morgue
Am I ever gonna be free.

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.
All france is looking for me.
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to italy.

Murders in the rue morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murders in the rue morgue
I'm never going home.

Well I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'cause I know I show the signs of...

Murders in the rue morgue
Running from the gendarmes
Murders in the rue morgue
Running from the arms of the law

Murders in the rue morgue
Running from the gendarmes
Murders in the rue morgue
Am I ever gonna be free

It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
It'd get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before.

Murders in the rue morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the rue morgue
I'm never going home."

Just another chance for me

A hurried time no disgrace

And wishing all my life away

Time is up it couldn't last

Someday maybe I'll wait till then

No more lies...

Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet

So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you

Eventful past is everclear

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood filled trench
Kill time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
It's crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die at Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbwire
Running straight at cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away. From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away. But the war, no chance to live again
Home, far away. From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away. But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale"

Where the man still stands

When the land was swamp and caves where home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam

Then the tribes they came to steal the fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a viscious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone

So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat

Drawn by quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man"

So tired

And was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name.
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me.
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves.
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground.
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me we can start the rain.
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away.
You tell me we can start the rain.
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears....

And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me.
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves.
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives.
They are sealed and now far away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change.
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away.
You tell me we can start the rain.
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears....

You're wearing everybody out

You're wearing me out

Come on
Reach out
And let somebody in your life

Don't get me wrong
You always apologize
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime

You just don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside

Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.

Tears for rememberance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire."
Iron Maiden,Revelations,/i/iron+maiden/revelations_20068033.html,"O God of earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our peolple drift and die
The walls of gold entombe us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
But take away our pride
(G. K. Chesterton: english hymnal)

Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man - the smile on his lips

The light of the blind you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The eyes of the nile are opening - you'll see

She came to me with a serpents kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the dawn

The light of the blind you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The eyes of the nile are opening - you'll see

Bind all of us together
Ablaze of hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you"
Iron Maiden,Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,/i/iron+maiden/rime+of+the+ancient+mariner_20068045.html,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in god's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.

The albatross begins with it's vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

'Day after day, day after day,
we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.'

There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.

See... onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two.

Death and she life in death,
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

'One after one by the star dogged moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his facce with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one.'

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifelesss in their eyes

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go fromhe long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,
Penance of life will fall onto him.

And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins.

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach god's word by his own example
That we must love all things thaat God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on."

Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in

The road to hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again
The road to hell is full of good intentions
Get on the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets

Brave new world of secret fantasy
That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp
Close enough to thrill, the danger of the kill
Price for failure of your will

Father, forgive us our sins
'Cause we're all the junkies who never can win

The road to hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again

He went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, isn't he. He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and I lifted up he couldn't reach it... He was shitting himself. He was just going by the at the end of the boots. He said ""I'm fucking going, I'm going! Just lower the fucking forklift quick!"" And he grabbed hold of it, so I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it. Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!

The merchantmen lay in their bed

In the oily sea-the killing ground
His knuckles white his eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care

Runing silent,runing deep,we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep,a merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies awaiting,for all of you below
Running silent,running deep,sink into your silent sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when?
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver-men will die
A cast of millions-a part to play
Killer? victim? or fool for a day
Obeying an order-men have to die
Us or them - a well rehearsed lie

The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to davy jones

Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains

Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game

Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Woman and children, a cowards attack

Run to the hills - run for your lives
Run to the hills - run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game

Raping the woman and wasting the man

Enslaving the young and destroying the old

I try to calm my fear
Just hoping, any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from Satellite
As my life flashes
Right in front of me

Try again, must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time
Not much time, hear my call
Please get through, I am here

I'm stranded in space
I'm lost with a trace
I haven't a chance of getting away

Too close to the Sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me
Or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait
'Til my time comes

I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back
Some time afresh

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier

To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing

Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it
All over again

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
And tell them that one last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier

There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to
Read them to me

Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them
In case they might find

I have no regrets

And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife
The days are passing slowly, since you've gone
Your memories are all I have
I sit here waiting but you'll never show
Without you I can't carry on

You said you'd always love me, all of my life
And then you said your last goodbye
Why the sudden change, why all the lies,
I should have seen it in your eyes
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain
The silent emptiness of one sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone..."

Rugby and cricket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy

Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels

A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in L. A.
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker
And he always cheats when he deals

I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
I came into contact with it.
I was phenomenally strong.
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,
Is what makes the world rotate.
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield
But I don't live there anymore.
I live in Los Angeles.

To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed

Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast

Sensing the change in the tide again
Caught by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming

Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...

They'll be saying their prayers
When the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes
They'll be coming to claim,
Take your soul away

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose...
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed

Ship of white light in the sky,
Nobody there to reason why.
Here I am, I'm not really there,
Smiling faces ever so rare.
A let's walk in deepest space,
Living here just isn't the place.

Stalks of light come from the ground,
When I cry there isn't a sound.
All my feelings cannot be held,
I'm happy in my new strange world.
Shades of green grasses twine,
Girls drinking plasma wine.
A look at love, a dream unfolds,
Living here, you'll never grow old.

Don't you hear me call? Ooh"
Iron Maiden,Stranger In A Strange Land,/i/iron+maiden/stranger+in+a+strange+land_20068063.html,"(Smith)

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and
Nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home
Discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Chorus:
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Chorus:
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home"

You killed your first man at 13,
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel.

Through earth and water, fire and wind,
You came at last-nothing was the end,
I'll make a cut by fire and stones,
Take you and your blade and break you both in two
Break you both in two.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel.
And it's rolling still."

To the glow of dresden - blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight - yeah|
Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodthirst
No radar lock on - skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Chorus

Climb into the sky never wonder why - tailgunner
You're a tailgunner

Nail that fokker kill that son.
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun

Tail end charlie in the boiling sky
The enola gay was my last try
Now that this tailgunner's gone
No more bombers (just one big bomb)

He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There’s something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Who motivates the motivator
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all ok
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down

Oh

Iron Maiden,The Aftermath,/i/iron+maiden/the+aftermath_20068093.html,"Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled
War horse and war machine

Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for
Is it worth the pain is it worth dying for
Who will take the blame
Why did they make a war
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all

Once a ploughman hitched his team
Here he sowed his little dream
Now bodies arms and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades dead or dying lie
I'm left alone asking why

In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for
Is it worth the pain is it worth dying for
Who will take the blame
Why did they make a war
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all

After the was,What does a soldier become

After the war when no one has won
I'm just a soldier

Out of your hands now
So how do you feel
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you feel lucky
Or do you feel scared
Take what luck brings
And be Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
What will the next day bring

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter
So why don't you answer
So why did you send
An angel to mend

Best make decisions
Before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose
But so much to gain
A little danger
It goes without saying
But what do you care
You're gonna go in the end
Gate open to heaven

Is ready and waytnig
Or straight down to hell
Can go there as well

I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
Sowhy don't you go
Just leave well alone

Don't you think I'm a savior
Don't you think I could save you
Don't you think I could save your life

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned
But still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take
Decisions to make

Arrive at the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait
It may be too late"

When the room goes cold tell me
You can feel me
.......... Cause I'm here

Here I am, can you see me
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to only in my
Dreams... Before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
Cause you can count your
Real true friends on one hand

.......... Through life

There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you
.......... Thought not

Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
.......... So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
.......... Right now

In a room full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
.......... Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
.......... It's true

You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
.......... It does

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what
Happens when we die
.......... Wouldn't it?

There are some who are wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some that must
Have lived before
.......... Don't you?

As for me, well I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not an
Open and shut case

Extrasensory Perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on and travel through
Space and time?

You know I feel so elated
Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
.......... To fill you in

You don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
... It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your ""friends""
Might say
We'll meet up again someplace
Some way
.......... One day"

With extreme prejudice
The route is dangerous
And your progress may be slow

On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I make no sound

Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again

Being at the wrong place
And the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime

I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name

Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack

Ever moving onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun

I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name

Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never
Be the same

But if I ever prove
My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay

I am a fugitive being hunted down
Like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear
My name"
Iron Maiden,The Legacy,/i/iron+maiden/the+legacy_20496810.html,"[Intro]
Tell you a thing that you ought to know
Two minutes of your time, then on you go
Tell tale of the men all dressed in black
That most of them, not coming back
Sent off to war to play little games
And on their return, can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
How many get well?
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

[Verse 1]
You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table?
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools?
And to think that we thought you the answer

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed, I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense, I can really see it clearly now

[Verse 2]
Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome

[Pre-Chorus]
You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along, your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now?
Only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to Hell as well

[Chorus]
Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least
Take the world to better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy you now will leave

[Solo]

[Outro]
We seemed destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, while there's hope
That man won't self-destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands?
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know;
""Fight fire with fire, life is cheap""
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care?
They benefit from death and pain and despair"

And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more 'til the
Sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take
Determination
Makes you run, never stop
Got to win, got to run 'til you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over half way there
But the miles they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream
Not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer but do
You want the glory that goes
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner"

In the ships gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide throw evil to it's fate

All summers long the drills to build the machine
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach

Overlord, your master not your god
The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who sent them here

The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death enter hell's gate

Sliding we go, only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire,
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red,
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through

How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through

The rising dead, faces bloated torn
They are relieved, the living wait their turn
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name
You still go on, to hell and back again

Valhalla waits, Valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil
Blood and sand, we will prevail

Sliding we go, only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire,
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red,
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

Moving up along the mountain side
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride

As he journeys across mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty around him
Feeling empty inside

He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

He's searching for the answer now
Is something that he's managed to avoid up until now
Looking for the conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner or later

Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strife for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give him now
His life and time is the only things that he has

Life is, is not a rehearsal
Only has this the one chance to get it right
Living really is only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
With all the pain of lying too early in the grave

Destiny, no good to hide away
Hear us now, we'll be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Hear us now, we'll be his saving grace

Just to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but he's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is impossible to change such a lot

He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day that goes by
He regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says an eye for an eye

In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgments that will haunt him 'till his grave
No-one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Hear us now, we'll be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Hear us now, we'll be his saving grace

Destiny, no good to hide away
Hear us now, we'll be his only way
Understand, no place to run away
Hear us now, we'll be his saving grace

Let him who hath understanding recon the number of the beast
For it is a human number

I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw in my own dreams were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

Yeah... !

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or some kind of hell

666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire were spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry hand held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done

666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the lord
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize... Can't avoid their eyes

Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one that is cursed

At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change


I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white

As I plunge on into certain death

Ooooooooh

The horse he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The scream of pain as my comrades fall

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below

Clutching their riches as they died.

Iron Maiden,Twilight Zone,/i/iron+maiden/twilight+zone_20330736.html,"She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,
Because you see I can't take no shape or form.
It's been three long years since I've been gone.

I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry,
I'll never know the reason why I had to go.

I'm crying,
Deep inside me,
Can't you see me?
Can't you see me?

I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.
I feel so tempted to bring her over to see,
Just what it's like to be hanging on the other side.
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.

I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the Twilight Zone.

I'm crying,
Deep inside me,
Can't you hear me?
Can't you see me?"
Iron Maiden,Virus,/i/iron+maiden/virus_20335525.html,"(Harrisgersmurraybayley)
There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarrey
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering... At life's disarrey

When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealuosy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies

And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

Without a conscience they destroy
And that's thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds

They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

The rats in the cellar you know who you are...
Or do you?

Watching beginnings of social decay........"
Iron Maiden,Wasted Years,/i/iron+maiden/wasted+years_20068065.html,"(Smith) 5:06

From the coast of gold, across the seven seas,
I'm travelling on, far and wide,
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself,
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else.

I close my eyes, and think of home,
Another city goes by, in the night,
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it til it's gone away,
And my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day.

Chorus:
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up... make your stand,
And realise you're living in the golden years.

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind,
Can't ease this pain, so easily,
When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another day,
And it makes me wanna cry, and throw my hands up to the sky.

Chorus:
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up... make your stand,
And realise you're living in the golden years."

Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days, of sunrise, to sunset
Of sunrise to sunset

Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sister, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights

Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time

Sands are flowing and the lines
Are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the
Desperate cry that tears the night

Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights(x3)"
Iron Maiden,We Kill Everything,/i/iron+maiden/we+kill+everything_20496802.html,"In the hulking halls of hatred where the Master makes his throne
Within the ""ass""-teroid belt where his body floats alone
His mind begins to wander
The worm begins to turn
All life he must now squander
The universe must burn
He plans eternal war, as the eternal way
But there is a force - which he must now obey
Time and the events within, chronicles of hate and sin
Everything, it has a start, but the end is always the best part
Our quest - to find the broken bits
Put them back and make them fit
And once that we have read the end
The tablet will blow up again (x4)
And we'll kill everything (x3)
Including ourselves
Summoning the Master
Call his form most vile
Champing mass of questing flesh
Protoplasmic pile
Ancient hunger, never filled
Until the universe is killed
The endless host of merging soul
Sucked into the feeding hole
Guts and giblets cascade down
Rectal midgets, flattened ground
Please pay attention to the plot
As I kick out this monster's snot
Splitting skulls and raking ribs,
Trephinated drainage sieve
Protruding mass of reeking bile
Which forms infected booger pile
Assemble now the tablet
Hope that it's not Braille
Bring forth now the Master
So we can end this tale
And we'll kill everything (x3)
Especially ourselves
Transmogrify your plasmic swarm
Evaporate before time's storm
And dedicate your life to porn
And dedicate your life to porn
You think that life has a reason?
You think your god has a soul?
I bare my bum to the heavens
I think a head is a hole.
And we'll kill everything (x3)
Including ourselves"

The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool?

Trying to break away from running
with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've
gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior when
you're one of the crowd
But it's over, just look at you now...

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out
with your mates
It's like a different person goes through
those gates
And the game begins
the adrenalin's high
Feel the tension maybe someone
will die...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
that way anymore

You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not
easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just
living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just wanting to be part
just wanting to belong...

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
that way anymore

Some of the things that you've done
you feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game... Isn't it?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on Monday?

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't
That way anymore

Iron Maiden,When The Wild Wind Blows,/i/iron+maiden/when+the+wild+wind+blows_21086970.html,"Have you heard what they said on the news today
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
Wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today
Have you heard what they said about us all
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired; that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face
Saying Grace

Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
There in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and wait

Can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T. V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite, all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T. V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other
The tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows"

Into the stars tonight
A little speck of light
Seems twice the size tonight
The Calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the Time?

Now I can't believe it's true
And I don't know what to do
For the hundredth time
I check the declination

Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no errors in the calculations

Now it's happened take no other view
Collision course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do

When Two Worlds collide
The anger and the pain
Of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide

When Two Worlds Collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's No place to hide
When Two Worlds collide"

Of engines roar in the night

Are waiting to drop from the sky

The blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare

They're closing in the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day

The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete the make to escape
Away from the eagles nest

They dared to go where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare"

I couldn't find a way to break away the hell

Whose love is tough and gentle; a man whose word is sure.

He doesn't need authorities to reason Him away;
He doesn't need an army to guarantee a win;
He just needs a Few Good Men.

Men full of Compassion, who Laugh and Love and Cry-
Men who'll face Eternity and aren't afraid to die-
Men who'll fight for Freedom and Honor once again-

Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love

Some men are like me; they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a thing called love

As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world was blessed with the thing called love

Breathed His last?

Had forsaken him?
Turned his back on his son
Despising our sin.

To his son and he said...

Has a hold on you
No more death's sting
No more suffering

And the tomb began to shake,
And like lightning
From Heaven the stone was rolled away.
And as dead man
The guards they all stood there in fright
As the power of love
Displayed it's might
Then suddenly a melody
Filled the air
Riding wings of wind,
It was everywhere
The words all creation
Had been longing to hear
The sweet sound of victory,
So loud and clear.

Arise, my love.
Arise, my love.
The grave no longer has a hold on you.
No more death's sting
No more suffering

Death, where is your sting?

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep"

It's the opposite of politics, 
Power or prestige; 
It's about a simple message, 
And whether we believe.

Chorus:
It's still the cross, 
It's still the blood of Calvary; 
That cleanses sins, 
And sets the captives free.
It's still the name, 
The name of Jesus, 
That has power to save the lost; 
It's still the cross.

We can water down theology, 
And preach a word to suit our needs; 
We can justify sweet subtle lies, 
That are wrapped in noble deeds; 

We can alter our convictions, 
To adapt to social whims; 
But we cannot change the gospel, 
Or the truth contained within.

Chorus

Though some may say it's man's religion, 
Or ancient history; 
The cross of Jesus still remains, 
The price for sin that sets us free.

Just let His light come shining through

Love can make it happen
There's no end to what His love can do
What can turn His light on in the dark
Love can make it happen
Open up and let His love flow through

Maybe we could save the entire world
If we pick up love and put religious
Weapons down
Cause sometimes we get so wrapped up in
Tradition, restriction,, divisions
They abound
Is there any love to be found
We can save a dying world today
If we humble ourselves and pray
We can make a way

The cares of life are pressing in
All through the day,
They try to steal my faith
With words that hurt and deeds that block my way

Ah, but that's when I remind myself who's child that I am
And inside me there is strength to overcome
And then I speak His name and the tension breaks
And His love flows as a song to my heart

Chorus
Whenever I speak His name, I call upon His name
And all the burdens of my heart... They roll away,
I just breathe His name... I call upon His name
And all the cares of this world... They roll away
If God is for me, who can be against me?
Whom shall I fear with God on my side?
You see, Jesus and me, we are a majority...
And no matter how big the mountain, it'll have to leave,

Oh, so why should I be troubled and have anxiety,
And let life's little problems bother me?
Because He lives, I have His strength... And because He is that assures my victory!

When life is much more than one heart can take,
There is someone who protects me.

Living under your wings of love,
Safe in the arms of the mighty God,

Safe in the arms of the mighty God.

Oh,
Oh, ooh.

Captive, by choice, of the strength that surrounds me - I just can't walk away,
I hear your voice say how much you love me, how you want me to stay,
Warmed by the breath of your Spirit, I rest my head on your pillow,
Covered where nothing can harm me.

Living under your wings of love, (living under)

Well it's a great, great mornin'

And you're thrilled at every sight
And the saints are always smiling sayin', ""How do you do?""
Oh it's a great, great mornin'
You're first day in Heaven,
When you realize your worryin' day are through.
You'll be glad you were not idol,
Took time to read your Bible,
It's a great mornin' for you.

I had a dream, I must confess, I hated to awake.
He dreamt he was an angel at the great pearly gates.
Saint Peter said, ""Well hello there, where have you been?
We've got your mansion ready so come right in. ""
And then he rang for an angel to act as a guide.
He spread his wings a time or two and learned how to fly.

Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her fingers so softly
And then my Mary wake to love and love again

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share,
We share together

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share"

When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.
Ooh-ooh-ooh
When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.
When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.
When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever, ever shine again when I'm over you."

The flame of her faith
The love that would never drift away
Where did they go Lord, where did they go?
You know somehow forever
Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go Lord, where did they go
You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well but Lord she just walked off all alone
But all that is within me is the bitter just ending
And bewildered because her love is gone
Oh the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go"

Supreme Godhead, gutter like poverty
Righteous man is one of forty six parts prophecy
It’s Episcopal orbit like the hypotheses
It’s metaphysics and borders on the philosophy
Another song of yours is just another disaster
Another verse of mine is just another cadaver
You could call it a Genesis of another chapter
You could call it the venom that’s from the troubled rapper
The same rapper that was known for just smashing’ your face in
Who is God? What’s material manifestation?
I’m indestructible, my actions are that those of a Mason
Yamasee Native American tribe of relations
The judge shoot a book at me, I take it and blood
The rook move horizontally, basically drugs
A nation of intellectuals, a nation of thugs

Living in a world where dictatorship is obvious (Word)
National resources running out for the populous
Murder doesn’t need a lobbyist or an ambassador
Ask the survivors of the Mỹ Lai massacre (Damn!)

Kill you for the gold like Colonel Gaddafi characters
You bath salt sniffin’ zombies fuckin' a stranger (hahaha)
Navajo skin walkers, nigga, I’m a face changer
Surgically remove your heart, bury it at Wounded Knee
A microcosm of the graveyard that Earth is soon to be (Yeah!)

I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fighting over heaven, heaven, heaven
It's real

[Verse 1: stic.man]
America's nightmare; young, black, and just don't give a fuck
Run up in the courtroom and wet 'em up
Got nothing to lose but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
It's war time, everything is fair, no fear
When they say the homie murdered the judge, I don't care
Fuck 'em, he deserved it, long as the homie get away
And don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it
We rootin' for the villain in black
Pourin' out Absolut, salute, niggas is shootin' back
In self defense we bang the pistol like
Larry Davis or Brian Nichols
Every pig, every public official, the boomerang
Is coming back to get you, you reap what you sow
The system you created created a monster
And now you scared cause it's coming back to haunt you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: M-1]
Since we gonna take the blame, I'm a rep my name to get my aim right
Let's have an overthrow and after party in the same night
Same height as Huey, same muscle build as Malcolm
With the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Don't take this as a warning, just another nigga rappin'
Fuck the way we organizing, fuck the training and the grapplin'
And fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smack them
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
Cause we bangin' on the system, G'd up, fuck the factions
And if you didn't know, the G was for George Jackson
And long live his warrior spirit packin' the Magnum
Watching over the soldiers, knowin' niggas be blackin'
When we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'
Till then, inside the blood of my eye, you see the dragon

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I'm like the birth of baby Mohammed, the movement I started
Can spar with the hardest, the martyr regarded as Spartacus-hearted
It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
When you're a target in an Afghan Tutoberg Forest
Close quarters combat over corrupted elections
Bilderberg is like cancer, it grows an infection
Nepotism is the gold and the conductor's connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military ain't there for the people's protection
They're just there to protect an investment
That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are infested with those tired of protestin'
Traumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons
9/11 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
That no matter what you think, occupation is not victory

Nigeria, Palestine

Immortal Technique,Beef & Broccoli,/i/immortal+technique/beef+broccoli_20576769.html,"Look, let me make something
Abundantly clear for people
Who are sober after activities
They feel like they gotta comment on mine.
First of all being a vegetarian should
Never be associated with being
A revolutionary or being open-minded.
That's a dietary choice.
If someone wants to proliferate the
Type of ignorance we're supposed to
Be fighting by thinking that,
You're just fucking yourself.
I don't go around promoting
Beef and pultry shoving it in
People's faces.
I don't castigate people for not
Eating steak sandwiches;
And I would never diss someone
For being a fucking broccoli-head,
Or living off of radishes,
Or eating grass or tofu.
I like a lot of vegan cuisine.
But the illogicality of expecting
Everyone to adopt their particular
Idea of what being healthy is
Is just preposterous.
I've seen some of you herbivores;
And if you want to argue health,
Y'all need to eat some kind of supplement
Because some of y'all are so skinny
That it's disgusting; looking like the
Only hip-hop motherfuckers on schindler's list.
Being a malnutrition-ass got nothing to do
With being revolutionary or being on-point.
I'll be damned if I let somebody else push
Their agenda on me. You know I don't eat pork,
Not because I'm a muslim, I just don't
Really like it, but I really will
Fuck a bird up. And fish is good
When that shit is fresh. It's like my nigga
Vast Aire from Can Ox said. If you don't like
The smell of burning meat, well then get
The fuck off the planet. You know I don't
Criticize people for eating moss,
Then don't open your fucking mouth
About my food, man. I like beef
And broccoli motherfucker. Mind
Your god-damn business. Matter of fact...
You know what? I'm out. I feel like some
Arroco pollo, a banana daiquiri, and
A motherfucking bistec aponado."

I'm mars ultor, the avenger, the god of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in god at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the gin type
That'll make you hate the way that allah made you to live life
Like hindu, niggas, who be bleaching their skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skin wear wolves will rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you
Barbarian funeral, nigger, you wanna know?
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow

[Verse 2: styles p]
Cut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head
Immortal and ghost coming, code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior, warlord, pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword and get shit sawed off
You don't need an axe in it
And I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate
The wolverine, the sabre tooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking 
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him

How'd you wanna die? make your own suggestion
Now talk to the lord and make your own confession

Put the motherfucking spell on you like 
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
We need to be godly to know allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me, like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in dadhichi and stab wounds
I'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors

And covered in leeches
The dirty water that preaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The patriot act attract you to the type that you love
They try to frame you
And say you was trying to sell drugs
They throw a federal indictment on niggas
To show you love
This shit is run by fake christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions and look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen but they don't really tell you their mission
They funded Al Qaeda, and now they blame the muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactition
They gave him billions of dollars and funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11 that's just scratching the surface.

They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam

I wouldn't fight for racist churches in the south my nigga
Id be fighting to keep the occupation out my nigga
You ever clocked someone who talk shit or look at you wrong

And of course saddam hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit after ronald regans election
Mercinary contractors fight in a new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror

Trying to distract the fact that they engineering the crack

Shaping the nation, like the blueprint of a mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So I'm Focused on my Economic Situation
I'm Like the little kids on T. V. That dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggaz drop signs but they don't know the math
'cus their mind is narrower than the righteous path
It's funny how 'on the block' niggaz will kill you for cash
But never raise their gun and cry out ""Freedom at last.""
The cold war is over, but the world is still gettin colder
Atlas walking through the projects with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then the general, would decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personality split
Like the black panthers, into the bloods and the crips
They said I'd never be shit, but now I sit and reminice
Like Yeshua, Ben Yousef flippin through Genesis
Ignorance is venemous, and it murders the soul
Spreading like A virus running rampant, out of control

How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?

Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle
Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin cracks in a duffle
Upstate behind steel gates, attacked in the scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils, hacked to your muscle

But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And it's the lawyers, not the inmates scheming to fuck you
Trying to fight the system from inside, eventually corrupts you
But that's what you get when you put a corporation above you
And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die, you find yourself cursing their ghost
But you make success, nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take
Since Prehistoric Vertibrates, crawled out of the lakes
And that's the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice
'cus even though we survived through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of the people that hate us
But I'ma make it regardless of these trumped up charges
And semi-automatic barrages, that empty the cartridge
Post-Tramatically scar kids that try to be brave
'cus niggaz backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility; Addicted to greed
Beating their girl purposefully losing a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to recieve

Why we got jamaicans hating on hatians?

Mexicans and blacks kill each other: straight hating
While the government profits from prison population

You gotta recognize another g at the enemy

If we running from the streets we should really end war

I think patrick said it best: give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claimi innocence
You say you're victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Pacify your citizenry with success
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only good when applied universally
Certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Heard you need putting fear inside your heart
Make you burn qu'rans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart

Devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which involved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said ""Let there be light"", I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason that the earth is only 5 billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold

I'll cut you and bless your festering wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall

Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever percieve
A European virus, mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men

Gambling with a bunch of fakes and liars
Real talk cos the real New York is the pain and the suffering of lost love
Staring off into the distance of the mist in the club
Depression and emptiness that lead to suicide
And the struggle inside yourself that keeps you alive
Surviving medicated, stalked by sobriety
The life you live now, tortured by memories violently
I pray inside of me that one day you can be forgiven
For murdering the beautiful world in we used to live in

[Repeat: x2]
Crimes of the heart

[Verse 2]
Love doesn't need a complicated metaphor
And sometimes, nothing even needs to be said at all
Sometimes the person you with is not your one and only
And you just fuck with them 'cause you afraid to be lonely
And when you come back, it's too late
So you overcompensate like victims of rape for the self hate
Lost in the affection of strangers around you
Instead of the only person who ever gave a fuck about you
Thought you were happy, so you didn't come check me
But then when he cheated or treated you incorrectly
You conveniently realized that you could never forget me
And tried to crawl back in my life, unexpectedly
These are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous
And leave a trail of broken hearts on they way to enlightenment
But I can't give in to hatred and pass judgment
Even towards every illusion I've been in love with
Cause the heart that betrays itself willingly
Is like a nation that trades freedom for stability
It's so seductive to be cold and corrupted
And isolated, trying to be an independent republic
But liberty, to be loved on the surface is worthless
The sacrifice of revolution with no purpose
Take it from a criminal searching for his redemption
Cursing the god, desperately trying to get his attention

[Repeat: x2]
Crimes of the heart

[Repeat: x2]
Round we go more cause
Climbing through the endless night
Looking for the shining light
Who's it gonna be 
Who walked inline with me tonight

[Repeated]
Endless night"
Immortal Technique,Crossing The Boundary,/i/immortal+technique/crossing+the+boundary_20176181.html,"[Verse 1]
I never make songs to disrespect woman
Or to judge people about the way that they're living
But the way I am is based on the life I was given
Like them white boys; +Losing My Religion+
I used to be a christian and a political pawn
The bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
Next thing you know you telling me 'bout making a song
Come in the studio, and tell me that I'm making it wrong
Pissed off 'cause reality is making us strong
Like the ghost of Timothy Mc Veigh making a bomb
'ey yo Marvin Gaye, what the fuck is going on
These rap niggas made propaganda out of your song
But it's the gong show, amature night at the apollo
My dick is like my music, but harder to swallow
So children follow me, like the pied piper
And sing the chorus in the air, with your blood in your lighter
(sing that shit nigga, right now)

[Chorus X 2]
You played yourself thinking your down with me
I end your life nigga, don't fuck around with me
And if you kids can't listen, then your bound to see
The way you get shot for crossing the boundary

[Verse 2]
The second verse is worse than the first and disrespects
Scripted specifically to keep people in check
Harlem to Boston, real niggas spit with me
But Landspeed, you ain't fucking shit to me
And underground labels know that I don't trust you
Your only independent till your major, so fuck you
And if your pissed off 'cause you think that I dissed you
I rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue
+Dance With The Devil+ remember that your not on my level
Stupid your not ready, I won Disypher, Bragging Rights from Rocksteady
And practically every battle that they got in New York
And I still murder rappers on the street for sport
Doctor Guillotine cutting you short little man
But you don't give me props 'cause I never won at Scribble Jam
Well fuck you, I hope somebody you love dies, so fuck your crew
And fuck your family too, Technique said it bitch
What the fuck you gonna do

[Chorus X 2]

(Yeah, Wrap it up on these niggaz, wrap it up, Yeah)

Immortal Technique insinerate degenerate fags
Burn Trent Lott, wrapped in his confederate flag
I got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
So put the African slave jewelery in the bag
Motherfuckers tell me, that a diamond is forever
But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Mekka evers?
House niggas get your head severed trying to be thug
You don't concern me, You trying to hurt the people you love
Word of Mouth is I'm in the club being sneaky
I'm like the body snatchers and your girl as getting sleepy
I'll murder you indiscreetly, right at the source
Like the roman Legion and and it stabbed Christ on the cross
This is about you tho, it ain't about Jesus
And you shouldn't fucking talk about telekenesis
Nigga please, moving shit with your mind
Try moving ya moms out the projects with your rhymes
And next time, I'm coming after 'cual quiera' profanity
Fucking 'carajo maldita mierda'
Roll up 'de hierva, i pasala, para la isquierda'
Put the price up to listen to me pop shit
'cause I got Martha Steward giving me stock tips
Underground money with honeys up in the whip
Bangbus.com, nigga fucking your bitch

Yeah, played yourself nigga
Fuck all ya, you don't know shit about me
Why open ya mouth and discuss who the fuck I am
I thought I told ya niggaz on volume one, I wasn't fucking around
You just slept, 'cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era
When niggaz would buy anything on the shelf
But those days are through, and you are through with them"
Immortal Technique,Dance With The Devil,/i/immortal+technique/dance+with+the+devil_20184349.html,"[Verse:]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern, was making a million
Being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
He used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but forever year she was sober
Her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I don't project my insurecurities on other people
He feeded for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble minded young man with infinite potetial
The product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed

[Hook:]
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offences
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked at new in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

[Verse 2:]
So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
To get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit, up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love
They told him a motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die
Standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him, before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men, up in the cife
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them friday night at a quarter to three

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy oaked her up and grapped the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw
Them dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness for what she'd gone through
And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

(Sample from ""Survival of the Fittest"" by Mobb Deep)
I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back

[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had succesfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause god wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death take you to a better place but I doubt it
After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
Infact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black, colour is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of gods children and fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever"
Immortal Technique,Dominant Species,/i/immortal+technique/dominant+species_20183442.html,"[Intro:]
Yo, in a hundred years form now
Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead
So it's inconsequential really
All the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
It's more important what, what your ready to build
What you're ready to pass down to your children
What you're ready to create
You better fucking remember that
When you challenge a mother fucker like me
Remember, I'm the dominant species

[Verse:]
I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic
Erotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war, and every day's a battle to me
I'm on the brink of insanity, between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spitting out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupidity's not allowed by me
'cause I don't got time to play
I'm the black whole lyricist that'll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
I'm the Technique and your nobody so what you trying to say
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
1. 8 billion tons per square inch confinement

[Chorus:]
Yo, yo, yo, I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet

[Verse 2:]
Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite like possibilities
But you don't have the capability like infertility
'cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like trying to contradict the theory of relativity
When I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me like the bitch in Misery
But break out like father running form responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility, with brutal instinct
I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync
And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car
I she'd light with more magnitude than all of the stars
My breyon talk pick thick
So don't ever talk shit
And remember something nigga, while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without it's head but you can't

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggaz are too stupid to understand it like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite
I'll make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic with anything but success
When I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with coprocessor coma type sickness
My style is like a ten year old child with a slit wrist, too much reality
For the fucking hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spick fist
So you can get dissed
Even if you're locally gold, vocally bold, or globally
Multi-platinum sold
I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm giving you chills
I drop knowledge while these mother fuckers clumsily spill
And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrically apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet"

You fuckin' with a minneapolis somalian
When I go home the world I use to know is gone and I will live on my own
For what shall it prosper the rapper with creative control to sign a deal
With the devil and lose his soul my still born first expression is cold
Like the faces of slave masters on a pay-by phone subliminal racial
Supremacy chokin' me quick like the bedtime stories of joseph smith lich
Mob gunnin' for me tryna murder my seeds is shorty put up in denial in a
Basket of reeves and now I stare in to the future with a spiritual
Flashlight wondering who the fuck was me in a past-life bad diet fuck more
Die a young fast life same as a crash flight that took off when the music
Died on your last night tell em' the truth and they call you a traitor talk
To em' honestly and they call you a hater losin' my composure cause the
Message is urgent talkin' reckless drunk on the mic like larry merchant
Cursin' at the conservants who marryin' demons who rush their wings against
The air to the reason they heave in with nothin' left to believe in even a
Reason from livin' that was forgiven by god and our religion envision jesus
Risen from the dead like horus in the baptist church shakin' off the rigor
Mortis the borders should be illegal instead of the people that were here

Unrealistic that were born nobel but turned socially autistic we resisted

Fuck a record deal, I want development land
With my benevolent clan
And that's the reason that I only trust my fame
40, 000 records sold, 400 grand
Fuck a middle man, I won't pay anyone else
I'll bootleg it and sell it to the streets my self
I'd rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
And because of this executives try to diss me
Racism frozen in time like Walt Disney
And now they say they wanna get me signed to the majors

A slave that was destined to own his masters

No corporate sponsor telling me what to do
Asking me to tone it down during the interview
Tryin' to minimize the issue, but I'm keeping it large
I love the place that I live, but I hate the people in charge
Speakin is hard when you got strings attached
So I'm a say it for you 'cause I ain't got none o' that

Look at our crucified people

[Verse 2:]
It's like Cambodia the killing fields uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serving the infantry
The odds are stacked against us like a casino
Think about it, most of the army is black and latino
And if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid mother fucker out on the curb
Trying to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you can't read history at an illiterate stage
And you can't raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage
I give niggaz the truth, cause they pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But I'm sick of feeling impotent watching the world burn
In the era of apocalypse waiting my turn
I'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future
And if your in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya
Up root ya with the evil that grows in my people
Making them deceitful, cannibalistic and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust

A rebel born from verbal holocaust
Dirty and never try to cleanse to get the drama off
The swiftest stealth assassin snipe you
From balcony shots of terrorist position
Professional from the opera box
Rhyme documents infamous like the
Bill of Rights, illa tight, having niggas
Open like the thrill of dykes Jean Grae,
Yakuza, mass murderer, friends who got
The dirt on her, foes who never heard of her
Wild style, my mouth gone to train up, i spit
Krolyon in five colors, when i speak i spray my

Splash your remains and brains out on the street
Like Henny and Juice, noose your neck and loosen
Your spine from back, shift your spleen, rip til it's
Just obscene, from down town swinging in New York
Illest who rip it ever, flow like a river fuck a girl
Like a nigga what?

I've been through Hell and back, scars swell
On my back, i spit bars, ya'll spit repetitive
Raps, i'm a street dude, who decided to rhyme
With lines that'll crack the disc between your mind
And your spine, that's why, ya'll wanna bite my design
And that's why, usually i hold the mic like a nine
Pistol whip you on the side of your eye, watch it
Pop out, we knock out cats, and light the floors when
They rocks out, shocked out, like you driving in
A lightning storm, with the top down, we got
This locked down, like convicts on the run
Getting chopped down, we four times,
Gaining yards in the whole line, see me
And Tech we steadily building, and we about
To blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building,
And all them niggas get mad when we step in
The building, 'cause we make the crowd jump,
And hit they heads on the ceiling, what?

I spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia,
Bury competition like Mesopotamia, eminating
Radiation, pissing liquid uranium, i bring the rock

Split your cranium with perfect symmetry lyrically
If your not the illest, then you don't deserve to
Spit with me, OBS obliverating bastards
Sacreligiously, i sacrifice niggas who
Talk shit ritualisticly, meticulously making
All my rivals suicidal like white suburban
Kids on acid reading the Satanic Bible
My arrival is genocidal, like Christopher
Columbus, exterminating races of whack

I'll make the place open gondela
These racist cops wanna lock me longer then

And now these parasites wanna prosenna my asscap
Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
But here's a quotable for every single record exec
Get your fucking hands out my pocket nigga like Malcolm X
But this ain't a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie
And I'm not that type of cat, you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse to heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams
No ones as good as good as me, they just got better marketing schemes
I leave ya to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
'cause you got jealousy in ya voice like star scream
And that's the primary reason that I hate ya faggots
I've been nice since niggaz got killed over 8-ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker
I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker
And murder counter revolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and force feed his kids mercury

Offered me a deal and a blanket full of small pocks

And fuck packing grams nigga, learn to speak and behave

Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a six block eight cell alive in the grave
I was made by revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club toast the truth, reach for the classes
I burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casket, columbian fashion
Intoxicated of the flow like thugs passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blastin'
Your better off asking Ariel Sharon for compasion
Your better off banging for twenty points for a label
Your better off battling cancer under telephone cabels
Technique chemically unstable, set to explode
Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in codes
So if your message ain't shit, fuck the records you sold
'cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground in general and rose to the limit
Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick

Yea... Yea... Ay yo
The things I've seen in life will make you choke by suprise
Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes
Provoking my demise, I'll leave your spirit broken inside
Like the feeling of 50 million people hoping you'd die
And niggaz wonder why my heart is filled of hatred an anger
Cause some bitch killed my first born son with a coat hanger
I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty was cold
Crippled and worthless, so I thought that it could never be sold
My mother told me that placing my faith in God was the answer
But then I hated God cause he gave my mother cancer
Killing us slow like the Feds did to the Blank Panthers
The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion
Carefully hidden, woven into the holidays of a Christian
I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me
And this is prophecy, the words that I speak from my lungs
The severed head of John the Baptist speaking in tongues
Like ""Che Guevara"" my soliloquies speak to a gun
Paint in slow motion like trees that reach for the sun
Nigga the preaching is done cause I don't got a dj
Like Reverond Run, I curse the life of any man who kills
Benevolent ones, I never asked to be the messenger
But I was chosen to speak the words of every African slave
Dumped in the ocean, stolen by America
Tortured, buried, and frozen written out of the history books
Your children are holding, internally bleeding, cold blooded
Stripped of emotion, I go through the motions, but there's no
Life in my eyes, it's like I'm hooked up to a respirator
Waiting to die, hooked up to the fucking chair
Waiting to fry, sooth an electrocution currently used
In my execution, producing thoughts at the speed of light
Burning confusion, I'm loosing my sight, breathing is tight
The evening is white, I made my peace with the Lord and now I
Stand on his right..

[Hook:]
Death is a another part of life..
These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
Dying on the inside, internally bleeding
Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning
These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
Dying on the inside, internally bleeding
Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning"

Them people, law enforcement, if you want to call them that
Were here and they were shaking in their shoes. They were physically
Shaking, scared to death. Because certain people, said I'm a radical
I'm a wild man, I got a gun under every arm, if you say anything
I'll shoot you. If the people find out how they've been
Ripped off, and enslaved, they will revolt with the blood
Running in the sheets

Yo, Ticket to ride, the white crime, highway
Bring all the guns, the funds will come my way
Whether we deliverin' high grade
To the people in the pit of the tri-state
Or dabble in the hood like fly weights
Lock and load in the range with rock the globe
Made any aim possible
Til the leadbelly lost control
In the hold of the paper that fold
At one time was related to gold
Made many men lose their soul
To the price of the dice that roll
How can a light so bright make a man so cold?
So another man's plans unfold
Can you really see the truth til it happens to you
Its so severe what the hopeless will do

Ain't no pickin' your position to beginning your life
Not every man want to stand by his kids and his wife
Too many lost kids in the night
Hand on heat, grippin' it tight
Any man want beef could get it right
Followed by enough flame to put a permanent end
To the learning of men
Class session, too many the blast the last lesson
Often taught like the wars that are often fought
As old as mankind
Now outta his damn mind
Stand on the gunpowder landmine
Ready to blow at any second
I'm checking for the signs of the end
Of all-time, I figure it's on time, my last thoughts forming the rhyme

Got me running through the streets
That reek of the dead, it's more food to the wealthy
My niggaz on welfare, nobody givin' up healthcare
Nothing but heat, how you gonna tell me it ain't hell here?
George Bush having a swell year
Swingin' the gat, ready to clap, anything on the map
You done seen what they bring to Iraq
Now bring it back to the source, land of the physical force
Land of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun!

This is the place where the cops rush in the building
Paramilitary death squads murder your children
Empty shell of a man rippin' shots in the air
Soldiers dying out there, but nobody cares
Prepare for the future but make note of the past
Or be condemned to live it again and get blast
Class warfare kept outta the news
Replaced by a corporation's political views
Cause this is where the guns are manufactured and sold
The land that was stolen stripped of all of it's gold
Old timers on the death bed speakin' the wisdom
Immigrants crucified by conservative Christians
Now we all got freedom to die in the street
But the difference is more of us die in a week
Than they die in a year I made it clear
Where I stand when the line is drawn
But now the line is gone
And nigga anything goes
The land where the guns don't let anything grow
And what the fuck you niggaz know about living in hell
You not built like me you never lived in a cell
You never gambled with your soul
Fuck the ice on your hand, gun in your palm
But you got a niggaz life in your hand
Young man, just remember that slicing a gram
Is a bloody game, like throwin' mice in a fan
My words flow like the rivers that's west of Iran
The fertile crescent moon, with the star in the middle
I reveal the depth of history's scars when I scribble
I gave you the world, and I ain't even charged you a little
The martyr is crippled
The prophets are dead and buried, but the message is simple
And it's not written down in holy books as a riddle

Now we running through the streets, starvin'
On that guerilla warfare
My people stuck in a guerilla warfare
Innocent children screamin' in tears
You actin' like the army ain't put hell here
Military industry havin' a swell year
Swinging a gat while lying in heaven
Living off a blank check after 9/11
But I'm have the truth brought back to the source
Fight for my land with physical force
Speak through music, the subliminal course
I need a tech and a clip, fuck a jag and a Porsche

They told me I would never make it, I would never achieve it
Reality is nurishment, but people don't believe it
I guess it's hard to stomach the truth like a bulimick
Its a dirty game and nobody is willing to clean it
But this is for the paralygics, people dreamin' of runnin'
Ladies married to men who don't please 'em, dreamin' of comin'
Urbanly murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin'
Some cowards on the internet didn't think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person, 'cause they stuck in a shell
And couldn't understand the pain of being stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go, if you not a christian
It's the failure of your lifes greatest ambition
It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I don't see the difference in between the raw and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
I'm just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanity is gone, smoked up in a gravity bong
By a democrat republican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique, you never heard me preachin' a song
I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since life is a gamble like the crabstables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages

[Verse 2:]
I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our peoples history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept us secret
This is the exodus like the black jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based wit the music I make
Brought the truth to your face with the style I run wit
Like the navy missile that shot down flight eighthundred
I'm like the africans who came here before Colombus
And from the 15hundreds until after the model
I watch Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see the Spaniards never left despues de Colon
And if you don't believe me, you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscast, all of them white
It's like a part tide with 10 percent ruling the rest
That type of stress 'll make me put the fucking tool to your chest
Step in my way nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I burn slow like (a) pissing drunk with gonnorrhea
I'll do a freak show in North Korea, burning the flag
While Jay Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Try to confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:
Capitalism en democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But that will never be me, 'cause I am leavin' the past
Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash
Unbreakable Technique leavin' the plane crash
I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality, instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condecending advice
'cause I am the only motherfucker that could change my life

[Ending]
Some people think I won't make it
But I know that I will
Escape the emptiness
'cause that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill
I made y'all believe that it last
You can make the future
But it starts with leaving the past"

All the commercials, or scarface in a jacuzzi
But now I'm living it, damn I shoulda never took that first cigarette

(I made a mistake)

I fucked up, like your girl was riding on top of me
I shoulda took her to trial, and never copped a plea
But this ain't a Christian nation, motherfucker please
America never taught me to turn the other cheek
Cause I'm from Harlem, the north of Manhattan,
We knock niggas out, and make 'em bounce like Ricky Hatton
But wildin' on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border

I knew she was a virgin when I first met her
Rockin' stocking, popping out of the Catholic school sweater
Mom told me she could do better than a criminal
Seventeen year old psychotic trying to be lyrical
I never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life
But I was careless instead of treating her right
I seen her again at some club, stripping
And wondered if I could have made her life different

I joined the army looking for money to go to college
But they didn't pay me a quarter of what they fucking promised
Extended my tour, treated me like a sucker

Don't give me speeches on how you respect and you love me
But no body armor in a lightly armored Humvee
My family's lonely, and you want me to re-enlist for thirty grand homie?
No

When I was young I got signed to a record label
The deal looked so good when it was on the table
It paid for my cable, cribs, cars and jewelry, the studios, the women
There's nothing they wouldn't do for me
Except stop screwing me for publishing the royalties
How the fuck are you my dog when there's no loyalty
Word to the street, I shoulda gone independent like Immortal Technique

Others try to block the memories and just delete them
But I keep them as a reminder they not killing me
And I thank God for teaching me humility
Son remember when you fight to be free
You see things how they are, and not how you like 'em to be
'Cause even when the world is falling on top of me
Pessimism is an emotion, not a philosophy
Knowing what's wrong, doesn't imply that you right

This is if te pones celoso motherfucker is watching me
I don't make threats bitch lo que hablo es prophecy

De verdad, para que toda la gente sepa que no me importa
Cuanta mierda ustedes hablan o cuanta mierda
I still be on my job. Forever, I'll still be here
I'll still be doing my thing. Para siempre. Cojudo
Para siempre. I'll be in anybody's parade
Immortal Technique, se ha acabado la mierda.."
Immortal Technique,No Mercy,/i/immortal+technique/no+mercy_20279268.html,"[Louis Farrakhan talking]
""Brothers and sisters...friends....and I see some enemies.
[Laughter and then applause]
In fact I think we'd be fooling our self's if we had a audience
This large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present.""

[Verse One]
I'm a weapon that fires
Lyrical projectiles with no mercy
I'm cold blooded like reptiles
Touch a pregnant bitch and make her give birth to a dead child
Every time I flex styles
Niggas vacate the premises and become exiles
I manufacture rhymes like textiles of x-files
And lighten juveniles
Living life with no purpose
Organize a army that will make the devil's nervous
Competition is worthless
Like the electoral vote
If you provoke I'll break your motherfucking neck in a yoke
Your better off throwing your shitty life away sniffing coke
Technique will choke you into a spiritual state
And it will take a lake of hydrochloric acid to soften this
I'll fake your parents suicide and kill you in the orphanage
But I inspire ideological metamorphosis
Stop talking shit or I'll make your existence a memory
So you can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
But I'll break the ice if anyone on the planet mentions me
I'll burn a hypocritical flag intentionally
Explosive revolutionary
Chemistry's my destiny


No mercy is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fucking mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you become what you intended to be
And in the future you'll worship those that descended from me

[Verse Two]
When I fight you I won't snipe you
I'll use a HIV infected needle to strike you
As well as anyone that vaguely resembles or looks like you
And just to spite you I'll force your children
At gun point to bite you
And rip a piece off
To start the beef off of the rest of your petty limited life
I'm coming at cha to catch ya by surprising the sight
Nobodies stupid enough to back ya when tactically attack ya
Because my style is nasty like protruding bone fractures
And your a played out dirty pussy devil
Like Margaret Datcher
But technique never get captured inside the rapture
Cause I mastered the art of causing natural disasters
You should learn the difference
In between the students and the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damaging decibels
And even though my starving people are considered expendable
I consecutively escape the racist court puritanical
I spit raw kinetic energy that's immeasurable
Retaliation for perpetration is unendable
Mercy is not extendible
I'll break your fucking brain down into psychological chemicals

[Chorus: 2x]"

Ha ha ha

[Verse:]
I'm obnoxious, motherfucker can't you tell
Run through Little Havannah yelling: 'Viva Fidel'
Jerking off at the sheets when I stay at hotels
Drinking bacardi at aa meetings, smoking a L
I'm broke as hell my attitude is no good
Like working for white people after watching rosewood
So I'm mecenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture nigga, I'm the best of both worlds
Without the hidden camera, and the 12 year old girl
Lets face it, if you're basics, you aren't half the man that I am
I throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
That's your girl, bitch get over here, give me some brain
I'll bust of on her face, and right after the segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, trying to get herself pregnant
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro lifers, that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war, when niggaz know that your pus
A fucking hypocrite draft charger like George Bush
Don't push me nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump of with a rope that's wrapped around your head
Send a dead fetus to my ex on valentines day
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way

[Hook:]
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics
I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
Your eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggaz said hip hop was dead but I've awoken the spirit
We're taking it, back in the day to the golden age
When wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Or burn it off the internet, and bump it outside
Nigga, we keeping it live, we keeping it live
We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside

Yeah nigga

[Verse 2:]
Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A raging alcoholic like the presidents daughters
Disgusting flow like third world country tap water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
'Cause I'm a prank call, cop shot just for kicks
Payback for everytime that they called me a spic
And Puertorican chicks told me that I fuck like I'm loco
And dominican women call me the 'Rompe Toto'
They call me 'Oscioso' I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
How dare you niggaz criticize the way that I spit
You coffee shop revolutionary son of a bitch
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
When niggaz speculate what the fuck 'Pac would say
You don't know shit, about a dead mans perspective
And talking shit will get your neck bone disconnected
Disrespected niggaz don't show no love
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo-thug
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
'Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
I choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you fallen off
And you won't do shit about it, like the church during the holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Daaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
She lonely and she thinks your a phony
I take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
'Cause your like all of the rest man
This ain't a verse it's shit talk at the end of the song
And you can suck a dick if you think I ended it wrong
Fuck you and I'm gone, ha ha ha

Piece to the strong hope, eo dub

One Enterprises, comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper plays my savior while I'm getting down
Pray for my nieghbors as a favor for holding me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the way that it pounds
It's underground, but the blatent vibrations widely found
Facing the nation complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitaing and contemplating the way we paitient
Start motivating and get them playin the shit we sayin
Ain't no delayin in this war that we gettin slayed in
Cause times a waistin while we stand adjacent to abrasions
They fouls are more than flagrant
And so I see the prisons cages while I pound the pavement
Looking for payment saying fuck enslavement
Usin the tools of old ancients
Announcing my engagment to this music that we making
Ain't no faking on tracks, and we ain't never come wack (never!)

It's like

[Immortal Technqique]
Immortal Technique in the trenches with my nigga Akir
Our family surived the genocides so we can be here
And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Living the revolution 'till we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit will return in heavenly form
And wipe the chess board clean, of my enemies pawns
The red don communist threat, burried and gone
So they invented a war, the goverment can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of god is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq, lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soliders that'll never come home
I wrote this for Momia, stuck in a beast
For people who, march in the streets, and struggle for peace
For hood niggaz, born rugged, never rocking Versace
Eddie Ramierez's cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block, and all my niggaz stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker I'll see you in hell
My destiny is to show the world, that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit, for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future, waiting to breathe
People slowly dying hanging on, waiting to leave
Believe when I'm gone, and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with god and one with you and everything else

Yeah..
Revolutionary Volume 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playing this album, and I'm no longer here
And sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corperate controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the anti-thesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with
Try to make songs kissing my ass, recycling my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here man
Thank you for listening, and thank you for supporting independent Hip Hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keeping the truth alive
Goodnight my people.. Goodnight.."
Immortal Technique,Open Your Eyes,/i/immortal+technique/open+your+eyes_21294107.html,"[Repeated in background]
(Open your eyes before you die)

We're here because of you
We're here because you were there
We've arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation
To seek the fulfillment of a promise of America
We were promised a better life in our home countries, 
where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently
Instead the quality remained almost the same 
and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury

Some corporations are more efficient than government, 
but their motivation is not the health or the well being of the people, 
it's only about profit, everything else, their image, 
their human resources, their public relations, 
only exist to protect the reality behind it
Once upon a time, we were told that nationalization would prevent growth 
by limiting competition, 
that our countries were nothing without the companies 
that invested in us and so they privatized everything, 
everything in our country was owned by people 
that had no connection to our culture, 
by those who never had our interests at heart, 
they didn't care about our survival or well being, 
they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, 
by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources
They took everything we built and made it theirs, 
first by creating racism to justify slavery, 
building the capital for capitalism 
and then when they gave us what they call liberty, 
everything we had was still owned by them, 
our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy 
and that we would have freedom, 
but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom
The freedom to take all the wealth generated 
by our work and our land 
and give us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table
Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God

(Open your eyes before you die)
And while some used missionaries and donations to off set this abuse, 
other countries and companies were blatent with their crimes, 
using war, disease and sanctions that killed millions, 
they supported corrupt governments 
that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, 
because their loyalty was to those who enable them, 
enstored them and kept them in power, 
they became the bastard children of American industry, 
kleptocracy, government's of thievery, 
they protected the corporations 
and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits
The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars 
to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, 
execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy 
and even overthrow democratically elected governments 
and so the age of revolution began again, 
they painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the market
But the free market has never been free, 
because the market does not regulate itself, 
it is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image, 
destroy the image and the enemy will die
Such is the same in the rap industry, 
but the major label super powers treat the underground like the 3rd world, 
when they need new assets, 
new honest to prostitute a side and put on a shelf to use their songs
When they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, 
they came to the underground, to the 3rd world, they took our culture, 
our property and our industry and our resources, 
even using our own people to help them exploit us
But behind the mask of efficiency, 
they claimed that we need to succeed, 
they're no better than us, they're economic advertising was always a lie, 
a few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth, 
almost as if it was designed for failure
Opportunity comes at the price of soul and the music, 
so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, 
glittering rented jewelery, the cars, the IMF loans, 
the seeds with suicide genes, 20 year contracts and oil bloody money
Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters, 
they'll stop at nothing to get what they want, 
they paint the 3rd world, underground, as savage and backward, 
but the super powers are no less corrupt, 
they've just learned to disguise it better, 
cause they fix elections too, they embessle tax money, 
they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit, 
and when there's enough at stake, 
history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own president.

You made parole.
What?
Pack your stuff
Da fuck?
And get the fuck outta here
Aye yo man it's bout mothafuckin time man. Aye yo G. Aye yo G son I got my Papers man! I'm out of this mothafucka!)
[Verse:]
I'm outta jail and I'm never goin' back again.
Never sellin' heroin, never sellin' crack again
Don't work for the government, coke packagin'
Don't fire indiscriminate with the mac again
My people are stuck behind glass like a mannequin
They pretend to give a fuck, just like the Vatican
Second chance, fate based, *two faced, samaritins
Every time we come back, they keep on cashin' in
Prison labor, third world sweat shop comparisons
Till we kidnapped the whole fuckin garrison
Yeah, poverty makes people wreckless things,
But corruptions do worse to their bling
Prisons are more over crowded than the rap game
They saw your more likely to go to jail with a black name
Freakonomics that I speak through ebonics are fuck chronics
Little niggers is hooked on chronic, nigga
But if you stage with the D. E. A. As your hype man,
Don't get yourself locked up and blame the white man
We transform gangs and criminal enterprises
Using O-G's as advisers, before they send us to war, after the divide us
But I wont let them use us like Teddy Roosevelt's ruff riders
My movements like a jujitsu kada, so fuck my alma mater

Family wrapped around me, so I never be cold again
Never have to knock a nigga out for the phone again
Prison ain't the place that you find your right of passage in,
It's slavery with nasty food in your abdomen
Middle passage, bottom of the ship, how they pack em in
Perpetrators on some fake shit, sweeter than saccharin,
Niggas sellin' niggas out for two or three Benjamins
But now I'm free, hit the block eating Entenmann's
Beni-Hana in and out, flow for me to enter in
Newspapers pencillin', trying to pay the rent again excon job interveiw Nobody answerin feeling violent from the frustratrationi got pent up in
But now trying to go back to the place I was sent up in
Turn my whole life around, fuck the etablishment
Listenin to hip hop like where the fuck the talent went?
How the fuck dod you replace lyrics with your swaggerin'
I'ma fix that rythmin em with the magnum
I roll up in a caravan, full of north africans
My squad got more soldier niggas than the saracens
Cos just watch when the terrorists attack again
Their reactions gonna be draft is and send us back again

I'm on parole, and I'll never be on crack again,
Fuck this palce baby, I'm comin' home again
Family wrapped their arms around me, so I never be cold again
Never have to knock a nigga out for the phone again

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]
[Host:] I've heard whispers about the financial support
Your government receives from the drug industry.

[Guest:] Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
This money, which is in the billions, is coming from
Your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
Our national product, which is of course cocaine.

[Host:] On one hand, you're saying the United States
Government is spending millions of dollars to
Eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
Same time, we are doing business with the very same
Government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

[Guest:] Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
Characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

[Two Men Speak in Spanish]
(-Hey you over there! Hey you working over there! Keep on working dammit!
-hey Luis how are they going to finish.
-right now
-well hurry up the donkeys, the truck is almost here. Hurry up! Tell em!
-they are going to come right now to pick up the product, hurry up!)

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (Revolution!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Jeso Cristo"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I [sniff]
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people... The only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya... Mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
C'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But cia conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot?
Give me the yay yay like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose [?], chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo',
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room [Said with Loucipher]
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and [?]
Feds will be up in your mouth... Like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and s** acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking]
The story just told is an example of the path that
Drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
Every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
The niggas on your block. So when they point the
Finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. You're the one that's guilty. The
Lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
All you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
Like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
The ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
Is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
Business. This is the American way."

[Intro:]
Big Zoo, uh
Technique, uh
Positive balances, uh, uh

[Verse 1 - Big Zoo]
Pound for pound
I'm the most positive when I bust mine
The Zoo adds on like a plus sign
Addition, that's the key in the ignition
With no pause, I propel to pole position (Vroom!)
Ahead of the pack, light years ahead of the wack
I give a fiend a Good Book, instead of the crack
That's the gold mine, negativity can't hold mine
The black bear's headed for the gold mine (look out, look out)
And then I'm positive as Showtime
I make negative mc's switch styles in no time
They change teams, rhyme about kings and queens
Instead of how they sellin' work to fiends
Then I, switch thugs into soldiers
Those that have given up on God to praise J Hova (Damn!)
The rap Ice Age is over
And positivity protects the Z boulder boulder

[Chorus - Immortal Technique with Big Zoo ad-libs]
Yeah, you know how it goes, positivity, yeah
My opinion is solid ground but your a common hater
Splitting and dividing on numbers like a denominator
Third-eye navigator movements are necessary
Everything you see in videos is secondary
You need positivity like you need respect in jail
Because without balance you'll be making negative record sales
Neg-neg-negative record sales, ziga-zam, Technique, like this

[Verse 2 - Immortal Technique]
I jerk off inside books and give life to words
Leaving concepts stuck together you probably never heard (what?)
I love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed
Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves
Rappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence
But I keep it positive with ultimate dominance
Meditating with Native Americans close to Providence
I speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows
But rumor has it that you getting raped like Lil' Bow Wow
Now listen industry motherfuckers, don't get offended
Remember, that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda
And render contenders dismembered, bend the fabric of time (what? What?)
And put your soul in a blender
You living a lie like thinking Jesus was born in December
Instead of catering to labels, something gotta give
I'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive
I seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks
Because without balance, you don't last more than a minute
This ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage
I rock shows in the ghetto, nigga you stuck in the village
I wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven
But I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97's
So I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow
Moving tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios
[Biggie - Hypnotize sample]

[Chorus:]"
Immortal Technique,Reverse Pimpology,/i/immortal+technique/reverse+pimpology_21294105.html,"Hypocrites, hookers, sex offenders
Ya'll niggas want to be pimps and players?
This ain't 1997 nigga

I'd rather be rich and unhappy, then broke and miserable
Because the game don't give a fuck, if you live at all
And that pitiful, so my position is pivotal
You can hate me all you like, but you worship the principle
I inspire revolution, the government's not invincible
Vietnam to Venezuela, trick knowledge they pimpin' you
All up in the hood, like McDonald's and liquor
Selling aids medicine, well we know you got the cure nigga
You livia conspiracy theory, but hear me
From a business perspective it makes more sense, clearly
'Cuz more over, that's what we go to war over, and numbers don't lie
Unless we do Bush and Gore over
Free markets, make money disingenuously
But I invest in agriculture biochemistry, so a nigga from the hood pussy
What type of crime is that
But execs are like 'you from Harlem where your diamonds at?'
(Stupid nigga)

(It's all part of the game
If you looking for the money or the fame
The players and rules ain't change
You see we're tryin' to leave a name
So we're turnin' out)

This is how pimps get pimped,
And players get played
Rich people get robbed
And broke niggas get paid
New York, London, Chicago, Philly and L.A
Miami, DC, Bemore and out in the bay

(With everything out of the frame
See, we deserve to stake that claim
If we didn't it's a crying a shame
What we're concerned about
Is how to turn it out)

Show me a pretty girl, with the world stuck to her
And I bet you there's a brother that's tired of fucking her
Lots of niggas girls are someone else's one night stand
I probably make some bitches nervous, listening with they man
And if that offends somebody, I'm sorry, fuck you
What you think? 
Revolutionaries don't like to fuck too
You just gotta be wearin' dangerous gouchie
Cover your hair like coofy some rappers think that they live in a movie
Until they get herpes, a clap from a groupie
And I don't need to shout you out
Nigga you know who you be
Look. These people are only players because they got played
And have not let go of that shit since the seventh grade
Yeah you got your heart broke, life sucks doesn't it
But you shouldn't fuck up someone else's life because of it
Someone did your mother like that, that's why your fatherless
Before jail racist cops, that's what the problem is

(The game, gaaammmee
Who's the one to place that blame
We gettin' trapped in a cycle of pain
With a generation headed down the drain
That's how we turn it out)

This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Beautiful women get cheated on
And gangsters sprayed
Jersey, Detroit, Denver, Phoenix, Atlanta, Texas, Vegas, Seattle
And down fucked up Louisiana

(Regardless of the money you're paying

But can't offer your children a thing 
What the hell is going on in your brain
We gonna turn it out)

I'm not a crack rapper
I'm not a back packer
I'm not a whack rapper
Moonlighting as a bad actor
I treat labels like the projects, 'cuz I'm a hater
Go to the Sony building and piss in the elevator
Haters or hustlers, crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album, to reach customers
Every city state, in the country, the hood loves me
Even aborigines in Australia bum me
This ain't underground fans, where all the color are talcum
And who the fuck you think buy Fifty and Jay albums?
Who the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum
Call up any major record label and ask them
But they some devils in disguise in hip hop
That the moment Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock
I hope one my of fans has one of your kids shot
And blame it on acid, Prozac and Slipknot
You a pussy acting hard like bitch cop
I'd drop you do the floor like a reverse wrist lock
Eat your food and shit on you, like a highway pit stop
And make revolutionaries outta kids that used to flip rocks
The government pimped 9/11 to go to Iraq
And history repeats itself, right on track
'Cuz thats a tragedy, and then the comedy begins (why)
Because its funny mother fucker's don't see it come around again

When can we be free (be free)
We only want to live our lives (live our lives)
With our eyes open (open your eyes)
Stupid motherfucker (stupid motherfucker)
(Open your eyes) Open your eyes
Before you die (before you die)"

You too (locked and loading sir)
Remember break that window when that cop comes in
And blow that motherfuckers head off
[multiple gun shots] (Got him)
Yeah load it up again cause these motherfuckers
Are gonna come back for us. (Were ready)
We gotta be prepared in this day and age, we gotta
Be prepared for whatever comes the fuck at us. (Word up)
Cause we are living revolutionarily. (Definitely)
You cannot second guess yourself in these days and times
There gonna throw whatever they can at you and you gotta
Be prepared for it, you gotta be prepared for anything

[Sample of Malcolm X]
""If liberty or dead,
There's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody!"" [crowd cheers]

[Hook]
No matter what the fuck life throws at me
I continue to make it threw indefinitely
Immortal technique defeats the odds repetitively
Until there ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the tough times is imperative to me
Looking at the whole world revolutionarily

[Sample of Malcolm X]
""They don't want to hear you old uncle tom handkerchief
Hand talking about...uh thee [inaudible], no.""

Technique will force you into strategical retreat
Because I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets
There ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech
When I reach higher positions
Without the recognition of pissed on competition
Cause I conquered there ambitions
In a systematic form like a religionist tradition
My mission is to take you, lyrically break you
Lyrically assassinate you
Lyrically incinerate your body and recreate you
To destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you
Cause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you
Your my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you
The revolution of the mind that bring lee generates you
But when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you
Cause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin
Is to be ashamed of your skin
My rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin
Intoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy
Don't make me choke you down like Jon-Benet Ramsey
Something demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily
God commanded me to be a technological disease
And psychologically do battle with the best emcee's
*Inaudible* these in technique
Cause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible
Aztec like the Hannibal
Rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibal's
Your just a fucking animal but I'm the Neo Sapien
Cause my original civilization was based upon creation
You know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing
I'll put your best disciple on academic probation
Fuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper nominations
And fuck the president I voted for assassinations
I'm saying fuck the federal bullshit investigations
Fuck the cover up of ghetto radiation extermination
Using my people for experimentation
And if doesn't play hip hop then fuck your radio station

[Hook]

[Sample of Malcolm X]
""Revolutions overturn systems, revolutions destroy systems!"" [crowd cheers]

Yo what the fuck happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers
These days everybody trying to be a thug or a player
Where did all the real motherfuckers go in the game
Bring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame
I remember hip hop before the mic cunt clapping
Cause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers
Lyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification
Your not dope enough, spit self glorification
So don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation
Life is hard it'll leave you scarred cause I been threw shit
If you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit
Don't you understand the audience will listen and dance
In the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance
To be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher
Why do you think project rooms look like the cells in Riker's
I'm explaining the significance or the reason behind it
There preparing your children for the prison environment
When you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement
But I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains
Cause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain
The system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory
Close to hell but I rebel as begin to sparkle out
And tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in
Because they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape my women
So I leave the system Unforgiven like East Wood
Cause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could
You should of seen it coming long ago when you were very young
My word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son
Cause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it
I'll make Jesus turn around and say ""yo pop this nigga flipped it""
So talk about whatever and be what you wanna be
But don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy
Cause through the highest frequencies in the NYC
I'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's

Wanna tax us while y'all struggle to pay taxes

Memos and faxes shredded up documents
Slush funds through the corrupt continents
But they don't want me indicted

Got away scott free like el Vaticano

80% to the staff and company
And 20% to the homeless and hungry
The country gotta pay the fed reserve
Kick back to the banksters haven't you learned
You protest cops or patrols on the street
But I bought city hall so I own the police
Email facebook and the shit you tweet
On the phone companies so I heard you speak
My suggestion is no correction no elections, s** with no affection
No invention would benefit the world of man

Immortal Technique,Speak Your Mind,/i/immortal+technique/speak+your+mind_20291423.html,"[Intro]
You have to speak the truth
You have to speak your mind

[Verse 1]
Every time I speak my mind I'm lyrically critical
The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
Beyond anything ever studied that's metaphysical
Man fuck a minority, I'm not politically minimal
But obviously terminologies that are statistical
Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
Habitually utilizing typical rituals
With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
TO individuals who believe in biblical miracles
Instead of themselves, because they're not thinking original
And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
Like microscopic miscarriages lynched wit the umbilical
Only a fuckin imbecile would think their uncorrectable
Cause your susceptible to becoming more than a spectacle
Remember that your flesh your blood and you body are dissectable
Ill beat you until your vegetable
And wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals
In a fetal position wit your face sewn to your testicles
Thinkin that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
You got heart? I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles
Technique, I'm like ya soul nigga.. indispensable
Wit no respect for those that cower at the hour of revolution
Cause the government owes my people restitution
Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me
Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
In school my teachers blinded me
But now I can see
I'm mentally and revolutionarily free
Broadening Horizons about what my people could be
If we wasn't set up to get shot locked or OD
You see families bleed because of corporate greed
And monopolizing weed is virtually impossible
So it wont be legalized and that's another obstacle
But I'm still rollin up pocket fulls of tropical
The governments involved directly so it's unstoppable
Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins that invade the ecological
Improbable that the average intellect could understand
So I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand
And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
Cause I'm tryin to save the earth, but your just next in line to rape her"

Hit the block with a pen and glock, a ox and rocks, a devil spray

Leave you half-murdered beyond, recognition beat and indecent
Leave you with your plastic surgeon for a remix

Yo, aiyyo I'm hard-bodied with it
And these scars, contusions, concussions, fractures
And pains you suffer from; I probably did it
You ain't worth spit, I put a hit out on your mother
Then fuck up you and your four brothers

You play Scarface when a microphone's in the room
But you more like Pacino in ""Dog Day Afternoon""

Snatch that diamonds off your neck, worth 50 dead Africans

I’m from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality is not half as nice
It makes the hood in America look like paradise
Compared to the aids-infested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passport's an American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin' to deny it
I’m from where they cut the hands off if you make a fist
And niggas grow coca, 'cause the job market doesn’t exist
Except slave labor, modern-day company store
And peacekeepers don’t ever ever ever come here no more
From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Still has children born deformed, eight months before they gone
I’m from where they lost the true meaning of the Quran
'Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam
And niggas know that but grow that poppy seed anyway
'Cause that food-drop parachute does not come every day
I’m from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors
And practically every president's a money launderer
From where the only place democracy's acceptable
Is if America's candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president, but he’s useless
'Cause he does not control the economy, stupid!

[Hook]
Lock and load your gun where I'm from, the Third World, son
Been to many places, but I’m Third World born

The water is poison where I'm from, the Third World, son
700 children died by the end of this song
Revolution'll come where I'm from, the Third World, son
Constant occupation leaves the Third World torn

I’m from where the Catholic Church is some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spanish Jesus, who’s face is this?
But never talk about the black pope Gelasius
I’m from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Military's like the Mafia: you pay for protection
Catamite sex tours is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientèle
I’m from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder Coca-Cola union organisers
I’m from where the justice system está podrido
Fuck government, niggas politic over perico
Rebelde conocido, enterado vivo
Como otro Argentino desaparecido
'Cause rico laws don’t apply to the cia
And motherfuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
I’m from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers
From where blacks, indigenous peoples, and Asians
Were once slaves of the Caucasians
And it’s amazin' how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in the place they was raised in
You kept us caged in
Destroyed our culture and said that you civilised us
Raped our women, and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us, agent provocateur divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah
So I'm a start a global riot
That not even your fake anti-Communist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine tryin' to murder me!

The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemmings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right wing, ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall, cause I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves
Corporate America, dancin' offbeat to the rhythm

Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still wanna take me to prison
Just cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism

Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change

Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up, like a miscarriage

And they refuse to even mention, European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
You. S. Manufactured missles, and M-16's
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship, blocking out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms, bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word, when the people are starvin'
The average citizen, made to be, blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide, where the bodies are freezin'
And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
Cause you fucked the Middle East, and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the cia, bugging my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm tryin' to give the truth, and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the President, and the princes and sheiks

When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a pr campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant, and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven

You better watch what the fuck flies outta ya mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat, so when you scream, only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be... A more wicked mc
'Cause aids infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich
Just like the cia trained terrorists to the fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, ''cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth, so you don't hear me
You think illuminati's just a fuckin conspiracy theory?
That's why Conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the Federal Government

Sniper scoping a commission controllin the president

I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps. Flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
Now here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave Al Queda 6 billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are coming true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
Four Non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
""Jealous of our freedom,"" I can't believe you bought that excuse
Rockin a motherfucking flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the 7th
The New World Order was born on September 11

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
And just so Conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, ''cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet taking orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And dick Cheney, you fuckin leech, tell them your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggaz fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the cia saw Bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was Top Ten for the fbi
Government ties is really why the Government lies
Read it yourself instead of asking the Government why
'Cause then the Cause of Death will cause the propaganda to die...

The point of guerilla war, is not to succeed

Deprivin' the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need
Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave
The only way a guerilla war can ever be over
Is when the occupation, can't afford more soldiers
Until they have to draft the last of you into the service
And you refuse cause you don't see the purpose
The only way to counter the insurgents that are well-equipped
Is to paint the people fighting for freedom as terrorists
Then find a faction lookin' for foreign investments
You stall them with power and murder any objections
You can't stop a revolution from breathin'
So to beat 'em they offer people the illusion of freedom
But when you're done dreamin' and wake up, tortured for treason
Then you can see them, hidin' behind the god they believe in

[Chorus:]
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)
During the night before the start of the dawn
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)
When the gunshots are rainin' in the heart of a storm
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)
Guerilla war when the army is gone
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)

[Verse 2:]
The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
So I'd rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless
I don't need the circus or the day of national observance
I need you to think for you and stop being a servant
Pawns only move a square in the game that they're used in
And realise it too late, like the shootin' of huey newton
Or patrice lumumba and salvador allende
Slaughter by the power hungry branches of their own gente
Ghandi wasn't killed by pakistani nationals
He was assassinated by a hindu radical
And che guevara, rebel to a you. S. Continent
Was sold to the C. I. A. By bolivian communists
Wasn't yitzhak rabin murdered by a zionist
And anwar sadat a victim of the same violence?
Malcolm x was seen as a threat to the F. B. I.
But to blast 'em they used muslims from the N. O. I.
Even the 35th president of the republic
Was murdered by factions of his own government
So now that it's proven, that a soldier of revolution
Or head of an empire, disguised in a constitution
Can not escape the retribution or manipulation
Of the self-appointed rulers of the planets corporations
So imma need every generation to put your hands up
Cause you can only get 'em off your back when you stand up!

[Chorus:]
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)
During the night before the start of the dawn
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)
When the gunshots are rainin' in the heart of a storm
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)
Guerilla war when the army is gone
That's the place a martyr is born (mothafucka it's on)"

Before we go any further..
I would like to send a message to all the underground mc's out there, working hard
The time has come to realize you networked in a market
And stop being a fucking commodity
And if you didn't understand what I've just said then you already waiting to get fucked
For example; a lot of these promoters are doing showcases
Throwing events, and not even paying the workhorses
They trying get us to rock for the love of hiphop or rock for the exposure
Now look man, I don't mind doing a guest spot for my peeps
Or, or, or doing a benefit show, but don't lie to me pussy
Coz I find out I'm paying your lightbill, I'm fucking you up nigga
Besides, you ain't doing this for the love, you ain't doing it for the exposure
You charging up to 10$ at the door, and you ain't tryin to give me shit??
So wait a minute... You want me to go shopping, cook the food, and put it in front of you
But you won't let me sit down and eat with you? The fuck is that?
Niggaz need to start playing their position, man. Just coz you throw a party
A hosting event or an open mic or a showcase, or a battle
That don't make you important at all
Without me and everybody like me out there
You ain't nutting but a good idea, motherfucker
So stay in your place

And to all these bitchass saronayas who are too lazy to come up with a way to sell records..
That they keep recycling marketing schemes and imagery
C'mon..
There is a market for everything man
There is a market for pet psychologists nigga. There is a market for twisted
Shitfetish video's. For nipplerings, for riverdancing, for chocolate cupboard roaches..
But you can't find one for cultured hardcore reality and hiphop?
People like you: the house nigga executives
And them rich motherfuckers that own you; you the motherfucking machine man!
You and all these niggaz talking about the same shit
With the same flow over the same candy-ass beats
But I refuse the feed the machine
And I'm not giving any magazine money
So maybe my album won't get 5 mics, or double-x-l's, or 5 discs
Whatever man, fuck it
But then again; you don't own me, and none of you niggaz ever will
If I'm feeling what you fight for I'm rolling with you to the end
But if not, then fuck you!
And the more that mc's, producers, dj's
And independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality
Of what their contribution to the business of hiphop is
Rather then just the music - the more the industry will be forced to change

Oh, heh, and one last thing;

You don't have to agree with everything I've said
But don't ever be condescending to me
Picking up your wack ass friends that rhyme and being like
'Ow yeah, Immortal Technique - he's aaiight'
No nigga..
Your mom is pussy, that's aaiight, ok..
Your peoples getting shot dead in the street, that's aaiight
I'm the motherfucking Immortal Technique nigga! The message and the money!
And you ain't got either!
Remember that!
Punk ass motherfucker.."

Yeah... It's that real this time around
Immortal Technique... Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now mother fucker..
Lock and load!

[Verse:]
This is the point of no return I could never go back
Life without parol up state shackled and trapped
Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the spanish exterminating Tynos
Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Mother fuckers made me out of self richeous hatered
And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomer strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
Concreate jungle, guerilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and ma chatte
The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm little running up before Elijah Muhammad
The commedent killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you miss using them nigga
The temple of nights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Soloman's temple
Al Aksa the name is no coincidental
I know too much to government is trying to murder me
No coming back like cutting your writs open vertically
How could the serpant be purposely put in charge of the country
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the patriot act
So come and get me mother fucker cause I'm not coming back

[Hook:]
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore

[Verse 2:]
This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalen giving birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine gunnin' your body with depleated uranium
This is the age of micro chips and titanium
The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians, criminal minded
Broke into hell, tore it down, and built and city behind it
South Paul, murderous, methadology nigga
Remember that I'm just a man don't follow me nigga
Cause once you past the point you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
So tell me mother fucker, how could you die for the throne?
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
Comperized humanity living inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is living and real
Worm went to planet X and the seventh seal
Universal truth is not measure in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie

[Hook:]
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore"
Immortal Technique,The Poverty Of Philosophy,/i/immortal+technique/the+poverty+of+philosophy_20300053.html,"Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed.

Nigga talk about change and working within the system to achieve that. The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you. There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely, and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem. Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources.

I'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words. My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others.

You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America. Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States; places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Columbia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well.

As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined. And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques.

But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people. ""Fuck them, let them fend for themselves."" No, fuck you, they are you. No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them. They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in. And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us.

I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living. No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money. We have whatever they kick down to us. My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies. The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real Mother-Fuckers that I need to bring it to, not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up.

In fact, I have more in common with most working and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people. As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue. Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie Mother-Fuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole.

In other words, I don't want to escape the plantation I want to come back, free all my people, hang the Mother-fucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground. I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land.

You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil. I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole. Most of those successful individuals are sell-outs and house Negros.

But, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto. Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor. That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture and forms of government. You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois lead. The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people 'cause he represented the agenda of white Spaniards once he was captured, not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans.

So in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just 'cause they black or Latino they have to truly represent the community and represent what's good for all of us proletariat.

Porque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta, seramos libre pronto, viva la revolucion, viva la revolucion!"
Immortal Technique,The Prophecy,/i/immortal+technique/the+prophecy_20297570.html,"So you're the motherfucker they call....Immortal Technique.
What the fuck make you so special nigga?
Huh... what the fuck do you do?

I calculate planet alignment like Mayan astronomy
Discovering atrocities worst than Aristotle
Subjecting children to sodomy
Your theory of the galaxy is primitive like telome
The truth about the universe stuck up like Aztec pottery
Unpredictable results like experimental psychology
I stomp the streets with emcee's beneath my feet in colonies
But presentation and spirit revolve around autonomy
Searching for monogamy
And cutting fake bitches out of my mind like a lobotomy
So obviously I'm not gonna be here to play games
Walked the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames
Battle the beast and false prophet predicted in the King James
I give a fuck about your emcee name I don't admire you
Only by dental records will you be identifiable
Cause the future is not reliable
Remember when rap was not economically viable
Comparable to what motherfuckers think of me
I might be nobody but wait till I'm together like a symphony
Resounding sound that will continue infinitely
Angel of death punishing all those who live in infamy
And shine so far away from you
You'll never get a glimpse of me
Attempts to extinguish me don't even bother me none
Like retarded kids throwing ice cubes at the sun
A victory against Immortal Technique will never be done
Just degrees of losing it every second your adding one
Some niggas dream of pushing kilos but I drop tons
With more facts and formulas and philosophical logic
Then a basement full of scientists puffing on chronic
Dipped in mycin potassium cyanide and liquid bubonic
And use it as a sonic one to find the spawn of the demonic
Screaming like onyx is of absolutely no consequence
The poison is dense enough to clog up your arteries
Mercy is not a part of me
I cause you bodily injury permanently be simply verbally murdering me
Is inconceivable cause of the unbelievable evil injected inside
The blood stream of my people
And redemption is not located under a church steeple
The feeble and the meek in soul just like the technique
Will inherit the earth, But the earth will be weak
Mother earth in her decrepit terminal illness physique
The year three thousand is bleak no happily ever after
Just death following the forth right disaster, a legacy of bastards
With plastic explosives your futures been eroded
Cause you forgot that when your free it's multiplied indefinitely
By the struggle that be the struggle I see
To socialistically united the third world countries
Expose hypocrisy in Americas democracy
Sloppily obsessed with stopping me cause I speak prophecy
Trample and dismantle your capitalist philosophy
The same way I stomp the conquering rap monopoly
And I'm not a fucking prophet
But that's the fucking prophecy"

Yea, yea, immortal technique (you know)...Harlem to South Africa

For my peoples..insomniac I can't sleep (it's real son) Mic Check. ayo,
Ayo (yea)

Im a rebel that'll fire missles at red dawn
But before I issue the order to send bombs,
I want presidential money like execs at n'ron
And goldiggin porn chicks for me to spend on

But Im'a only pay for 1 night stay at the Ritz
I wont even get you a towel when I spray on your tits,
Im not a misogynist I just like it when gurls are
Massagin this so pop shit

And Im'a smoke you and your bitch momz
Im ambidextrist the microphone cause switch palms
Immortal Technique phsychotic nigga to spit calm
Misinterpreted by the media like Islaam

I love the underground but not enuough chicks in a thong
What the fuck how could beautiful women be wrong?
Tech load clips like they were hits from the bong
That was supposed to be the end of the song
But it's not the freestyle got me stuck in the zone

I can't stop brainwashed commercial hip-hop the government plot

But Im'a shoot down the propaganda stuck in your brain
Like the military did to the fourth terrorist plain
That was I'll but shut the fuck up and let me explain

What good is fame and flossan
When you stuck in a coffin?
And who the fuck you gonna run to when i make you an orphan?

Im metamorphisizin into somethin you thought that i could never be
Ghetto engineered sickness without a remedy
My heart pumps nitro-glyceran and hennessey twisted chemistry

Cry blood and i bleed venom
Never subliminal clear with the message im sending
Bending the space-time continuum

Just to get to you
And blast you so hard it'll kill the person next to you

So in retrospect remember and don't fuckin forget
Yall are walkin dead people yall just don't know it yet!

Yea...yea nigga..its on...you know wut time it is..
Im out...harlem nigga.....this is for all the devils..

Rep this life to the fullest
Rest in peace
This ain't for y'all, this' a toast to them
Rest in peace

[Immortal technique - verse 1]
Here's a toast to the dead
If you don't drink, smoke to the head
For the freedom fighters killed by the feds
For those who died hard in the streets soaking in red
And died slow asleep in a dream choking in bed
Here's a toast to the dead for my enemies that are gone
I'm not a coward so, celebrating that would be wrong
I pray to god that your soul will come back again
So I can see you in the next life and finish it then
A toast to the dead for criminals, burning in hell
I wonder how many presidents are burning as well
Emperors, popes, senators, generals
Amputees feel unlucky 'til they see the vegetables
A toast to the dead for those who I've forgotten
Written out of the history by the corrupted and rotten
Black saints whitewashed during la Reconquista
Thousands of Indios, Spaniards used to conquer the Incas
Fuck a moment of silence! I need a moment of violence!
Like the nineteenth century Caribbean islands
Long live those who came before, that paved the way for me
The warriors and scientists that came before slavery
And if that last lyric was predictable
Take your clairvoyance and apply it to your life in the physical
Presumptuous half-hearted homunculus
Self-destruction is the power without knowing what the function is

[Chorus:]
Rest in peace
Here's another warriors song, rep this life to the fullest
Rest in peace
Mothafucka, say yo' prayers!
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
Rest in peace
You ain't payin' respect when you' 'spose to
Rep this life to the fullest
Rest in peace
This ain't for y'all, this' a toast to them
Rest in peace

[Immortal technique - verse 2]
Here's a toast to the dead, for all of my fam
I will never let an idea die with a man
My rhymes are like Nazca lines designed to give a view-of-this
J. Dilla's still alive as long as his music is
A toast to the dead for rap legends and pioneers
Your legacy won't be forsaken as long as I am here
Knowledge of the past and, wisdom of the present
I'll teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant
A toast to the dead, for children with cancer and aids
A cure exists and you probably, could have been saved
Sad to see, medicine divorce morality
Corporate homewreckers, pimpin' up their salary
A toast to the dead, for those that've died today
The victims and those exonerated by dna
The only thing worse than giving freedom to the guilty
Is killing the innocent, and leavin' your soul filthy
Immortal technique, remember me when I'm gone
I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in a song
So you'll always keep a piece, of my spirit inside
When you struggle to complete what I started before I died
But some of you, won't survive the changes the earth makes
Swallowed by tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes
And that's just the first stage of 'you-can-not-reverse-ways'
And realise that we are one, regardless of our birthplace

Here's another warriors song, rep this life to the fullest
Rest in peace
Mothafucka, say yo' prayers!
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
Rest in peace
You ain't payin' respect when you' 'spose to
Rep this life to the fullest
Rest in peace
This ain't for y'all, this' a toast to them

You're watered-down nonsense, and I'm 200-proof
Chockin a local youth in his home-made vocal booth
You're a fucking incompetent killer like Ray Kurut
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitating period juice
So burn your fucking rhymebook, stay warm, and put it to good use
I'm bout to drop like frozen airplane shit through ya roof
And I'm sick of fake hustlers telling lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans, and you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestinian
You broke mother fucker, you cats don't burn rubber
You niggas can't even get a cab like Danny Glubber
You aint hardcore, ill smack the shit outta your mother
You wanna be gutter? I'll leave you laid out in the street
Signed yours truly, the mother fuckin Immortal Technique"
Immortal Technique,You Never Know,/i/immortal+technique/you+never+know+feat+jean+grae_20353691.html,"(feat. Jean Grae)

[Verse:]
She was on her way to becoming a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty's what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought, she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggaz always talking about, how they smoke kids
But the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play
""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way, gave up trying to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous, but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
'Cause they regreted the long list of niggaz that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except Mcdonald's and did-dick
Smoking weed with thoughts of envy, whenever they lit it
She smoked intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab, they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure

[Hook - Jean Grae]
Don't you know that, time waits for no man
Not fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find, a reason why
God came, to you and I
If I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, 'cause you never know

[Verse 2:]
Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday, I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about, power to the people and such
We spent more time together but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch, or even cop a feel
I was too interested, in keeping it real
Perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me ""carino,""
And never Technique, bought me a new book to read every 2 or 3 weeks
Forever changing the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her, I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me, to stop hangin' out on the streets
To stop robbin' and stealin', from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
, museo del barrio and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day, to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her so I told her, facing my fears
But honey's only response, was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holding me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C. O. 's talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer
Came back, in tact and on track
But the fact of the matter, is I still felt cold
Even after my mother, hugged me, cryin' at home
My real niggaz would catch me thinkin', out of my zone
Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinking of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do something, because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds (are) still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin' cocaine
Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up, like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed, when I asked about her daughter

[Hook:]

[Verse 4]
She told me that there was a note for me, that was left behind
She had left it there waiting, for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was and I started thinking the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope with my name on the floor
""Nobody loves you more than me carino"" is what the letter said

""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97 a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me, to see what true love really does
'Cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought, you made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby don't you see, I had a blood transfusion that left me with hiv
Hoped the end exists for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me""

What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishing that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel
And now you know why Technique, don't fucking fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have s** with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent, and then beyond
'Cause you never really know what you got, until it's gone"

We find the seeds of doubt
Don't water them with your tears
Don't think about all the years
You'd rather be without

Eden lets me in
I find the seeds of love
And climb upon the highwire
I kiss and tell all my fears

Falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn't hurt

Playing in the dirt
We find the seeds of fun
And we scream like alley cats
Tearing down what we attack
To prove that we are one

Cutting through the night
And we find the seeds of lust
And lose our minds on one intent
These passions never seem to end"

The walls are collapsing
Into your back yards
Here on terra firma
The fires are raging
The riots up staging
To prove a point to none
Here on terra firma
The fear is choking
The life out of each and every one

Where a black man with the same name
Had a televised beating
It's not too late
Yeah it's never too late
To heal these wounds
That are fatal to the end
To understand our sins
To make amends
See 'em down in hell
Must turn back the tide
This hatred must be stopped
Let's throw our arms out wide
And the dead are breaking in
When your world comes to an end
Will you say you did all could
And then just hang your head
Why not believe
In the good of man
Not bricks and burn
Take all that you can
To love your fellow man
With all of your heart
As you would yourself
We must try not to stand above
And hate you go to hell
Put love in your heart
God is not some TV show
Our life is not some part
Try to believe
That only good will come
If you give not to receive
That is kingdom come

On her motorbike, the way she's riding it, riding it
And she says it feels so good but she is hiding it, hiding it
Wet lips to cigarette and now she's striking it, lighting it
As she looks me in the eye, hell, she must know she's inviting it

Showdown in the northland
Just the whiff of corruption
Is the tip of the iceberg

Savor and sweet liberty
And there's trouble from the south
Shouting from the gallery
Now I find I've got to shut it out

I'm searching for a light
To kill my sense of fear
To break through darkened nights
And take me through the years

There's no need to tell you
What I think has gone wrong
There's grey clouds of dissension
Let it show, let it show a silver lining

Sweet blood on the razor
Is it poetry or politics?
Forget about the nightmare
I'll make it a dream that changes everything

I'm searching for a light
To kill my sense of fear
To break through darkened nights
And take me through the years

There's no life
Where it's dark
And we fuss and fight
We've gotta lighten up
We've gotta open up
Everybody
Gotta light the world up
Any man
Ain't that bad
Neither is
Being sad
We gotta let it out
Scream and shout
Letting go is
What it's all about
Well it's time to give
Be positive
Open up
Then you can live
Just check your motive
Make sure it's positive
In everything you do
There must be love
Gotta light it up
Light that world
Oh yeah
Here's the score
No more war
Just lots of love with
Open doors
To a higher realm
Where hate is sensitive
Remember open up and
Love one and all
You know what I'm talkin' about
Just gotta lighten up"

The syrup's so much sweeter when you let the butter fly

What I'm gonna miss, I'll remember your kiss when I turn my head and say

We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?
Don't let this bad world change you
You got places to go, so much further than I can see

We could be perfect strangers
Thank you for spending one night with me

We are passing trains, we are whiplash lovers
We are burning wax melting all over each other

We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?

Your love is all we need to bring us together
Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free, it comes down to us

Hungry babies on television, can you feel the shame?
We've got to keep on giving to one another, 'cause it's all gonna happen again
Why don't you try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard
Just think about what binds us and find a new place to start

Looking for the door

Giving him applause

Crashed the car
Into a wall
But everybody's
Calling for more

It's called the end of rock and roll

These days are numbered
Counted out in loss
Faith and spirit
Walking hand in hand

To meet a wall
Made of sound
But where does that sound
Find a place today

Maybe we came to the wrong show
I've seen this before

It's called the end of rock and roll

Oh shadow take me
Leave nothing still
'cause I've not seen the miracle
How could anyone

We ask too much of the song
To come and save our souls
When all it's trying to do now
Is save it's own

A path away
Hear your pagans
To dying faith i bid goodbye
A saddle for an unborn's cry
On sacred chance
I give my life
And bail from cost of pride
Im due
Ooh...
You bore the weight of lies that mankind sired
Ooh...
Patiently waited till your time was right
Ooh...
I heard you call
I shout thy will be done
Bathala..."

Handa ka ng umalis

Ipaskil ang dalangin
Sa pisarang ang hangin

Ng isang panaginip
Agiw sa isip
Itago ko man
Mahirap gawin
Na ikaw ay limutin

Hanggang dito na lang

Handa kang sumuko
Sa unang pagbitiw
Matutunan ko sana

Lumayo sa huling sandali

Hanggang dito na lang

Huwag na nating isulat
Ang maraming mali
Kung hindi makayanan
(tumalikod na lang)
Palayo sa huling sandali

Bago sulitin
Minutong dadaan
Bago tuluyang umalis
Walang pipigil
Walang hahadlang
Kung di mo rin matiis

A little bliss

Abreviated most of the time
Hallucination chambered well in my mind
Never on a rainy day
To freefall
Never on a run down day
To freefall
Tailend of a night gone crazy
Some favors never taken easy
Is it over? Still together?
I thought we were over this
We are faces-erased
So appreciated, not of this time
Regained emotions still linger when its gone
Leave your ambition no other time but now
To wait for the freefall
Never on a rainy day"

I stumble over and over again
The slip breaks me
And that kills your heart
When you feel like falling apart
I'd come running to catch you.

With the coldest of weapons
Confidence

Tongues colliding

One!
More!
Time!
Kiss before the sky falls
Out
From
This cloud we're hovering on
To send us off

A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off
A kiss to send us off!

Here I am, there you are
On a wire connecting our hearts
There's a string, and it's tied, to a kite
There's a storm, in the sky
Now the clouds become electric
There you are, here I am
Could I
Have!

A kiss to send us off

Pushed out by circumstance.

When the scenes terrorize honest citizens
Disgust multiplies

Guilty running free as the victims are suffering

Is the economy provoking it
Or is it just the ignorant side of a human being

Haunting frequently

Taking her out on the town to see up spin around making out with the dress turned upside down
Have a drink what ya think she's all heels and kick bet you thought you landed
Then like a pink Boba Fett she calls you on your bet and your hat is the least of what you're handed

Dance because you're young and you don't need a reason
Dance just like you got your legs from a cartoon
Dance just like you're dumb like you don't need the money
Dance under the moon cuz you never know never know

You were gift with the biz, now you're tired of the risk to the boss mans daughter
You thought singing her praises would get you a raise now you're just like a horse being led through the water
If I come on in take you on the chin is a price worth payin
For a glimpse just a look lets have one of the books
She's a pink Boba Fett and that's all I'm sayin

Dance because you're young and you don't need a reason
Dance just like you got your legs from a cartoon
Dance just like you're dumb like you don't need the money
Dance under the moon cuz you never know never know

Never know, never know
Never know, never know
Like you don't need a reason
Yea you don't need the money
Yea you don't need a reason
Like you don't need the money

Just when you thought you were done cuz you breathe too much fun, now the red lights flashin
She kept a rainbow of pills, she was up on her thrills, both her brains and her body, like, took a bashing
Of course in her mind I'm not trying to put it all on her
Put it on who, city boy, take a look it's just you, now I'm just like a lamb headed to the slaughter

Dance because you're young and you don't need a reason
Dance just like you got your legs from a cartoon
Dance just like you're dumb like you don't need the money"

When they're in trouble, they look for you
You can't lose this society battle
Evil plans are coming to your mind
To fight back, a sabotage
That has happened many times

Hunger for power
When you die
All you have
Won't go with you
Hunger for power
Stupid fight
You better stand straight
Or you might fall

You'll never know
What might happen
To us all
Hunger for power
When you die
All you have
Won't go with you."

Is a gift I didn't think could be real
To know that you feel the same as I do
Is a three-fold, utopian dream
You do something to me that I can't explain
So would I be out of line if I said
I miss you
I see your picture, I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days, but already I'm wasting away
I know I'll see you again
Whether far or soon
But I need you to know that I care
And I miss you"

Tell me who to believe!
What's the use of autonomy
When a button does it all?
So listen up,
Glisten up closely all,
Who've seen the fuckin eye ache too.
It's time to step away from cable train
And when we finally see the subtle light,
This quirk in evolution will begin
To let us live and recreate
T. V., what do I need?
Tell me who to believe!
What's the use of autonomy
When a button does it all?
T. V., what should I see?
Tell me who should I be?
Lets do our mom a favor and drop
A new god off a wall.
Let me see past the fatuous knocks.
I've gotta rid myself of this idiot box!
Let you see past the feathers and flocks,
And help me plant a bomb in this idiot box!
From the depths of the sea
To the tops of the trees
To the seat of a lazy boy...

Observant and afraid

It was there with their eyes like glowing embers
The man you see was made.

I was low but now I am high.
It helps to know serenity from ennui.
Something's wrong, something's wrong, when it all remains the same.
So face the fire, come into your name.

It was alive I think for the first time.
Infinity it falls, in feathery folds but she bites like loveless ice,
And with her belly full, she culled this Rite of Passage,
It was the longest night of my life.

There's something else
The afterworld

You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one - Dr Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cuz in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if de-elevator tries 2 bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
4 a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(s**, sex) is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no Let's Go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look 4 the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cuz
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all 4 (What's it all 4)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down

I think I'd enjoy a medium-rare dish with a side of fries.

That you smell like a rose.

For the rich they have no need
Left in the cold in crucial places
Feeling the horrors of real life
Places to places, no where to go
Agonizing pain and no one seems to care
Trying to revive 'em for a higher place

Disarmed from an endless war
Aimed by all kinds of poverty
Vagabonds you will find in types of societies
Resting in the underground of this materialistic

Treated harshly

Why men want to rule the space
While they can't even solve the problems of the earth
Where is our humane sense now
So much said, but so little done
Blinded and devoured by our greed
Facing all the worries of our minds
We can't feel what is happening in the world around us
Turbulence is the conflict which we all must face
Crossing the line of stupidity and discrimination
Is one of the reasons which makes us ignore
The actual state of the moribund
Breaking down their hope to piece
Destitution increases in front of their own miserable lives

Injured ones dying fast
Harsh temperatures
The whips of cold winds
Are frosting their bodies on the attack
Feeling the rigor mortis stage alive
Reaching to the ultimate muscular paralysis"

See past what covers the surface
Underneath chaotic catastrophe,
Creation takes stage.

With exception for the right parts
When will we be new skin?

That the forces of nature has brought
The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions

As we keep hurting the sea, the soil and the air
Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen
Causing death rate and we wonder from where

Because of drought
Occurrences of flooding everywhere
Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair
Abomination because people fear that all these events
Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly
Men subjugate the forces of nature
But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly

Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste

Doesnt't't have a clue why he's waiting or what he's waiting for

I'm a fan or yours and I need a good mistake.
I'm not a sinner or preacher, all I have is Sleight of Hand...
I do magic tricks for all the boys in the band.

Baby can I be... The rabbit in your hat.
I'd swing if you'd hand me... Hand me the bat.

~Chorus~

I'm on the road of least resistance!
I'd rather give up then give in to this.
So promise me only one thing would you...
Just don't ever make me promises... No promises.
... Oh no promises.

~Verse 2~

I've never done this before, promises promises.
But I'm enjoying the illusion and the things my body says.
Now you see me, now you don't... Oh how well you disappear.
What are you running from? And may I interfere?

Baby can I be... The rabbit in your hat.
I'd swing if you'd hand me... Hand me the bat. (x2)

And then she sat upon a bughill.

An army-o-de-pinchers climbed their creepy ways
Right inside her 5-0-1 cut-offs
And her skin took on a hue of a chemical unknown to me that's right!

Knowing not the deceived ones that they are
Asking for power, richness and desire
The price that they must pay
Is their souls thrown into a cauldron of fire
By being weak and blind
The fools disrespect the Christian houses of God
They are the opposite of all that is Holy
Locked in cages of sins
How can they reject the creator of all living things
The almighty God hears the prayers from Holy priests
And Christians alike, forgiveness for them in at hand
But curses shall fall upon those that refuse to repent
God's only begotten son was scoured, mocked and put
To death and resurrected on the third day
Proved his powers to demonstrative
How goodness always prevails
Followers of damnation march on in their darkest ways
Failing to see and admit the truth that Christ left for
Us today

One hundred things to do before I rest my sore ass
Upon the cushion that supports my array!

So get high the green way.
So get by the green way...yes!
I knocked upon their door
In hopes of bidding them their welcome
And instead I was caught by an eye.
His pupil was wide open
Kinda like a liquor barn at 3:00.
It was indoubadoubly dose derived.
It was then that they took me
And shined their light between my eyes.
He said ""What are ya new?
Why are you here? What's the catch?
Why not explain in clear? Why you're peakin around?!""
I wish I could've just kept to my own.
My hospitality has been too well spent and I've paid my rent!
I should've kept my thoughts, on who might've been inside
So that my mind could sit and delude my pride!
I beg my common sense to keep my
Neighbor out away from my front door
Until i find a way
To hide myself from those in 4-2-1.......one

The whites of your eyes
The marrow in the tree

Same as the storms, spinning on Io

You startle and wake
Salute the abyss
Smile and surrender
Into a glimpse
The rapturous nothing
Into the arms of your captor
Into the arms of the all

Over and over and over and over...

She woke in the morning.
She knew that her life had passed her by
She called out a warning.
Don't ever let life pass you by.

I suggest we
Learn to love ourselves,
Before it's made illegal
When will we learn, When will we change
Just in time to see it all come down

Those left standing will make millions
Writing books on ways it should have been

She woke in the morning.
She knew that her life had passed her by
She called out a warning.
Don't ever let life pass you by.

Floating in this cosmic Ja'causezi
We are like frogs oblivious
Soon the water starting to boil,
Now I flinched and we all float face down

She woke in the morning.
She knew that her life had passed her by
She called out a warning.
Don't ever let life pass you by.
Pass you by."

Cuz what I want, and what I need, is and will always be free

And it feels like a matador is taunting me with his reddest red cloth
And I am the bull
Yes I feel emphatic about not being static
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me
Cuz now I'm full

Like angles in a sphere,
Of our own design.
No more perpetual innocence.
With words we make shapes,
And our angles can align.

It humbles me...
We breath softly as like the predator?
Such is a sight to see.

Don't you wanna wait for me
Like I wait for you
Do you ever think of me
Like how I think of you
Don't you wanna wait for me.. Mmmm..

See
You're so far away babe
But you were on my mind
Holding hands on the boardwalk.. On our favorite ride ooh..
On the beach where we met aww baby... Footsteps in the sand
I remember like yesterday, reflections of your hands

[Chorus:]
Don't you wanna wait for me
Like I wait for you
Do you ever think of me
Like I think of you
Don't you wanna wait for me
Like how I wait for you

Sitting here thinking, of the summer we shared
And how you went away baby
You never knew I cared *no*
Your picture on my pillow, tears down the side
I never will forget it baby
I need you in my life

[Chorus:]
Don't you wanna wait for me
Like I wait for you
Do you ever think of me
Like I think of you
Don't you wanna wait for me
Yes... Ooh... Don't you wanna wait my baby... Yea...
Don't you wanna wait my suga...

And you still can't let go?

I was na've
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to plead
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cos I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cos I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from it
I need to walk away from it
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smog
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
Woke up in love and seems so great (deeper, deeper)
We both can't subdue
Darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your lure
And I'm feeling for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can make it
It's some state I'm in
Getting nothing everytime
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this moment
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from it
I need to walk away from it
Get away, walk away, walk away

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered and this sky, it's never over, over
Seems I never wake from this nightmare
I let out a solid breath, let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Breaking, pleading the world
Ahh...

My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cos I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cos I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I'm about to break
I guess I missed it
I'm addicted to your lure
And I'm feeling for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can make it
It's some state I'm in
Getting nothing everytime
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this moment
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from it
I need to walk away from it
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from it
I need to walk away from it
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from it
I need to walk away from it
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from it
I need to walk away from it

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile
My life is a masquerade
Since you took your love away
I just can't let you see
How much you hurting me
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile"

It's 2 A. M. Just gettin in about to check my message,
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors.
Cellular rings somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her she don't hit me back something's funny.
So I called her mother's house and asked her has she seen my baby.
Drove my six around lookin for that missing lady.
Got back in turned the tv on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused.
And then I turned the tv down
Cause I thought I heard a squicky sound,
Something's going on upstairs
Cause I know nobody else lives here
""bump bump bump"" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screaming out....

[Chorus:]

You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got;
(then a man said) s*** lady drive me crazy, drive me wild;
(all I heard was my baby's voice)
You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got;
(then I heard another man)s*** lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild;
(And I just can't believe this shit) ...

[Verse 2:]

I ran downstairs looked in the closet lookin for that ooh,
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin ""not in my own damn house"".
Who would have thought she was creepin with another man?
The down low happenin to me all over again
And then I turned the tv down
Cause I know I heard a squicky sound,
Something going on up there upstairs cause I know no one else lives here
""bump bump bump"" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear,
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screaming....

What the hell is going on between the sheets in my home?
Baby wait let me explain before you start to point your cain.
Girl I'm bout to have a fit
""oh it's bout to be some shit!""
How did I get into this? Should have never came home with this bitch!
Low down dirty woman, back to where you come from

Hit the streets your ass is grass!

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and fine machines in pieces on the ground
[Chorus:]
Oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around
Thought I'd see, thought I'd see you..."

You've got the love I need

The only time I'm happy
Is when you're on my mind
Every day I live
All my love I give

I've been a thousand places
Seen your smile on a thousand faces
No matter what I try to do
I'm always dreaming of you

I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

Every girl that passes by
I see your sparkle in her eye
Right away I stop and stare
Close my eyes and see you there

Whenever I feel almost free
Old Memories take hold of me
I love you now so much more
Then I ever did before

I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you"

For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony, 
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.  
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within, 
Don't let this feeling end, 
Let it go on and on and on now baby.

Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes, 
I care not for myself but for those 
Who've never felt the joy we've felt.
Whenever you are near,
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me 
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love.
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me 
Whispering how much you care,
A thousand violins fill the air now.
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end,
Keep standing close to me,
Oo so close to me, baby, baby.

Baby, baby, I Hear A Symphony, a tender melody.
Ah it goes on and on and on and on and

Isley Brothers,Let Me Down Easy,/i/isley+brothers/let+me+down+easy_20496737.html,"Is love behind me?
Though I need you to satisfy me
Destiny will prove to divide me
For you're a part of me
I feel the love within you
Your beauty lies deep within you
Touching me when you feel the need to
Become as one with me

So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

Take you for granted?
That could never, never be
An advantage
All this love, and free from demanding
You have always felt the need to be pleased
And you stay close beside me
Though our minds are free for deciding
The life to lead and desiring
To see what they can see

Oooh!
Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
Ooohhh...

Ah! Spending time, time with you
Counting the days of my life
Oh, hoping that, that with me
You will stay

So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

Being around you
Lovely things I feel are about you
Being strong until I'm without you
For you're the strength in me
And you give me inspiration
Realizing that it has taken
More love and more love makin'
To fulfill my every need

So for me
Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy

If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down
Oh, easy

If ever you were to leave
My lo-ove, let me down, let me down, let me down
Easy, baby

Oh-ho! Let me down, hey, down, down, down, down

The heat inside my veins
At the way my nerve ends tingle
Every time you call my name

I've got a lust ignited fever
And I can't put out the flame

Next time that I saw you
I felt so at ease
You had a languid disposition
I had an willingness to please

And your candy apple red lips
Full of violets and sex
Had me harder than a coal train
Had my collar wringing wet

Now I'm gonna crash and burn
But I'm not finished yet

My heart is pounding like a big bass drum
Excited at the thought I might get me some
Lick it off my fingers
Taste it on my tongue
Love you little baby like a machine gun

You're a symphony of elegance
A masterpiece of grace
And animated work of art
Who's acquired a taste

For the flesh of weaker lovers
Lie down on their backs
To be ridden at your leisure
And be taken off like hats

I'm not here for you to walk on
And I'm not your welcome mat

My heart is pounding like a big bass drum
Excited at the thought I might get me some
Lick it off my fingers
Taste it on my tongue

Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love

Alone to count the stars above

Save me
Give love another try

Made a fool of me
For years you gave your love
So tenderly

I call your name
Just to ease the pain
I push my pride aside
'Cause I want you back again

One hot summer day.
When I thought I'd lay,
Myself down to rest.

In a big field,
Of tall grass,
I lay there in the sun and I,
Felt it caressin' my face.

As I fell asleep,
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star,
Of the movie.

This really blew my mind,
But there I was,
Oh yeah I was.
I was taken to the place,
The hall of the mountain king.

I stood high upon the mountaintop,
Naked to the world.
In front of me,
Was every kind of girl.

There was long ones, tall ones,
Short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones,
Big crazy ones.

Out of the middle,
Came a lady.
She whispered in my ear,
Somethin' crazy...

[Chorus:]
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
[End Chorus]

I thought to myself,
What could this mean?
Am I going crazy,
Or is it just a dream?

Now wait a minute...

I know I'm lying,
In a field of grass somewhere.
It was all in my head.
But then I heard,
Somebody say...

[Repeat chorus]

I could feel hot flames,
Of fire roaring at my back,
As she disappeared.
But soon she returned.

In her hand was a bottle of wine,
And in the other, a glass,
Good god.

She poured some of that wine,
From the bottle into the glass.
And she raised it to her lip,
And before she drank it, she said...

[Repeat chorus]

Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on and take that pearl.

Spill that wine!

[Repeat chorus]

Spill, spill, spill...
Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.

Come on and spill that wine.
Take that pearl.
Come on spill that wine.

Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms

Leave troubles way behind

So hold on to my hand
Picture us on a island
Making love on the pouring rain

Once were there we'll know we're free
Your body screaming as we lay
Girl our love, take us away

I'll never, never hear your knock on my door
Before you leave me, leave me behind
Please let me feel happy just one more time

Fuck the machine, I’m raging against the broke life
I love the cream, my sayings affect the coke price
My demons are devils to the things that I don’t like
Can I detach myself from 'em I know it’s so trife
Murder assault, wild out of control type
Worshiping at the altar of Ralph like a low life
Dress correct, heavy metal emperor roll tight
I’m obsessed with death, helter skelter like Sean Price
Know the tech kid the sound of thunder
No respectable Boba Fett like bounty hunter
No remorse, mega force records seek and destroy
We kill em all, zip up the bag, bring em to the morgue
Bring him to the coroner table then cut him up and look inside of him
What the fuck would they think if someone lied to them?
Sold em the dead dreams, listening to philosophers
Going against me? Victory is impossible

Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice

My rap’s scary, it escaped from my Blackberry
Your rap stays trapped, it’s fake and imaginary
My rap full of gats and bad vocabulary
My rap has drug tracks and blood capillaries
It’s all cemetery, and about mortuaries
I ain’t saying anything out of the ordinary
Not unusual, it’s the cult itinerary
Attending funerals with a dull contemporary
Weapons put you in blessings whenever necessary
Gun straightened paper better than a secretary
With just one shot turn a jock into a Jerry
The Glocks that we carry, turn The Rock into a fairy
Murder for no reason other than monetary
The devil made me do it, it’s involuntary
I keep clips and newspaper obituaries
Behind a bookcase with a trick dictionary

It’s a perfect murder scene, a perfect murder about a perfect person
Brujeria verse perfectly cursing a virgin
What’s the faculty of energy perfect exertion
Call me majesty, my words are conversed in a serpent
Pussy boy left the war, they call it desertion
I am dirty, I am opposite in every detergent
If it isn't a Grey Goose then it’s certainly Bourbon
I write my rhyme in Beirut with a burgundy turban
Hard body rap, punch you in the chatter box
I would never walk the hallways unless I had a ox
That’s the reason why they put me in padded box
I would’ve never been a problem if I had my pops
I pull a motherfuckers card like a magic shop
Mossberg means spin several metal savage shots
The heater hit the fuckin flesh like the cattle prod
My physical body’s the vehicle for wrath of God

Ill Bill,21,/i/ill+bill/21_21529821.html,"(Chorus)

I turned 21 in prison, doing life without parole
When the jury heard what I'd done, guilty was the vote
When the judge gave me my sentence, he read it to me cold
Whiskey on his breath, masturbating underneath his robe
Only 21 in prison, doing life without parole
When I had the chance, I should've sold the devil my soul
Hell yeah, I shot the sheriff, left his body full of holes
Now I'm 21 in prison, doing life without parole

(Verse 1)

We all enter the world the same way
Naked and screaming, soaked in blood but things change
Some are brought home to palaces, others to the projects
Some are born billionaires and some are born convicts
Momma said when life gives you lemons make lemonade
Take a piss in it and serve it to the people that you hate
My pops always said there's only two types my friend
Those with loaded guns and those who eat shit 'til they're dead
I miss both of them, one's gone, the other in prison
I hate both of them, the love dies and none of it given
I gave both of them enough time to show me their wisdom
I'll take both of them to hell with me, my soul is convicted
As I stand in front of Satan hoping for answers
Coping with madness, I hold the chrome like a social advantage
Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgement
Keep it close point blank range and render justice!

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
The defendant's story begins within a childhood of fear and misery
Age ten, witnessed his father murder his own mother
The guilt of her death lingers in his dreams when he slumbers
Even though he was a child he still felt responsible
Most of his adolescence in and out of mental hospitals
Anti-social, anti-everything
Sucked into a system, pacified by prescribed medicine
With psychiatrists as father figures
His biological a scumbag sociopath locked in prison
He hated him with all his heart and so he never visited
Though the monster that his father was also lived in him
Kill a person you're a murderer, thousands you're a terrorists
Everyone, you're the father of Jesus of Nazareth
Perception is reality, facts are negotiable
I'll clap the Mac off and put twenty-one holes in you

(Chorus)

Coke, it costs money
Planes, they cost money
This yacht, it all costs money

Peace to HHC for putting me and Necro on their cover
Your favourite rappers are Non Phixion fans
Your wifey is an Ill Bill groupie with my dick in her hand
United and dead-set, these young hoes wanna fuck me
Excited like rednecks at gun shows in Kentucky
I rock soccer stadiums in Bogota
Saw ten thousand Colombians screaming, ""Non Phixion, god.""
Don't be confused, this ain't that bullshit you listen to
We that shit that your bitch fingers her pussy to
Pound that Moog organ, chemical warfare, songs for hardcore goons
The rest of y'all scared
It's that radioactive green chronic in the blunt music
Brooklyn homie, run up and pop you with a gun music
Break it down for the blind, the brainwashed
Religions, politicians and thugs pray to the same god
Bloods and Crips, Democrats, Republicans
Red and blue states to represent the sets they're running with
Other gangs play the game too
A blood named George Bush and his team smoked the entire Hussein crew
Classic example of former friends turned to rivals
Words of the bible inspire murder, turn to survival
Die for your set, bang for Muhammad and Jesus
A shitty public school system and a car that's decent
I'm an American, I need a blowjob and a pizza
So I'll overthrow you for oil, Mastercards and Visas

A holy vision of the purity and glory before

And about the second coming of the Messiah shit
About the motherfuckin' mark of the beast
About the CIA distributing the crack in the streets
A savage with beef, leave your body wrapped in a sheet
He from Brooklyn, I'm from Philly, we was trapped in the streets
My rap is complete, with everything from clappers and heat
Pay us homage as you're praying at your enemy's feet
That's why none of y'all can feel the god's real pain
And none of y'all will never know God's real name
Me and Bill is like the lightning and thunder
Like in 1985, Iron Mike and his hunger
A triflin' brother, give me the weed and the 'caine
So I can chop it up in pieces and distribute the pain
I know that that's some ignorant shit to be saying
But if I was you and you was me then you would spit it the same

First and foremost, a toast to my Mom & my Pop
My daughter and my wife, there’s no one more important in my life
Without them I wouldn’t be alive in the literal sense
And in the mind, they are my inspiration to grind
My reason to live, rest in peace to my grandmothers and my uncles
Y'all molded the person I became and for that I love you
It’s difficult to explain through lyrics how much I miss you
Please accept any success I’ve achieved as a tribute
A testament to your impact
And influence on everything I’ve ever did, you’ll forever live
I never been a religious person but still bear witness to a higher power
Some only pray in their final hour
But I remain grateful for my blessings
Thankful to the most high, for the many gifts whether present
Past or futuristic, blessed to be able to express myself through words
And give thanks using the lyrics

Secondly I’d like to address where it all popped
From Farragut Road to your block
Gargling booze, and saw god sparking a doob
Marketing crude, sharpening tools, we're martyrs & goon shooters
That shoot constant modern day Goose Gossage
Ice cold though, Siberian summers appear hotter
Quite bold like a Nigerian underwear bomber
Dope war, folklore, coke whore smoke more
Morbid epitaph, Sordid tortured past provoke more
Try to stab me with a knife to be exact
Spitefully attacked, trifling and wack, grimier in fact
Than any award or any rap, any whore or any rat
Close the door on petty crap
Very happy, thankful to my best of friends
Had to cut ties with any of the very many snakes in the grass that left me for dead
Dumped in the river, swept in the ocean
Heavy emotion, stand firm though the end is approaching, I’m open

Thanks to my fans, you're my family, I take pride
In your support and every album you bought
Down for life, I love y'all for never doubting your boy
Same way I love LL Cool J and Kiss
One made me wanna rock, the other made me wanna spit
Rick Rubin made me wanna flip em both at the same time
Slayer and Scarface inspired me to write insane rhymes
Thanks to L'Amours in Brooklyn accepting my fake ID
Opened for Sepultura there when I was only 17
Thanks to my band Injustice
Thanks to Ace London Studios for letting us rehearse when we ain’t have nothing
And shouts to all of y'all that said I couldn’t do it
You gave me the fire to kick down the door and walk through it

Reek of puterfaction and drugs, the acid taste often lingers
Susan Atkins licked the blood of Sharon Tate off her fingers
Off the hand of Satan, hot corpse masturbation
Get my rocks off, sparking a golf course assassination
Pistol whip and kill the rich, triple six
Extremely horrible like a beautiful bitch with a dick
Every society receives the criminals it deserves
Subliminal with the words, and every visual's absurd
Dope dealer storm dancers rain down chronic showers
The cult leader cure cancer with hypnotic powers
Goon druggie tie-dyed psychedelic paint job
Dune-buggy drive-bys, heretics that hate God
Red spider acid tongue, death rider, bastard son
Empire stand as one, Hellfire Canyon Club
Crocodile confessions occupy obsessions

Hawaii volcano, private Jimi Hendrix shows
I’ve seen the symmetry of infinity clearly, like Timothy Leary weary
Questioning every existing theory

Twisted like corn-braids
Trippin' like Grateful Dead tour-dates

The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed
By a forty-two year old - Romero Valadares
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil. It was sent to the local news bureau there
And sent to us by a sattelite just a few minutes ago
All initial opinions are; this is genuine
What you are about to see, may disturb you..
[Verse 1]
Murder forensicles, surrounded by alternative tentacles
Extra-terestials step out of starships in pressure-suits
Claiming humans were created inside of test-tubes
Horryfing with huge eyesockets recemble headwounds
Pumpin the protoplasma, jello-like substance
Lookin like goldblum in The Fly, but more dusted
Don't trust their reptilian tounge
They come in peace is what they claim
When their true intentions are to have the world in chains
Said, they came from beyond the stars, unexplenable
Religious people thought they coming was a sign from God
They thought these were the Eloheem
When the first mothership arrived over the planet, it was a creepy scene
A huge hovering metal structure stretching for over 5 miles every direction
Blocking perception, every news channel, 24 hour-coverage stopping commercials
Doctors, experts, UFO's, crop-cicles, arguing generals in closed doors-meetings
Religious cults claiming to know the meaning of these beings
Many of these cults claimed to have been abducted
Probe-prodded and fistfucked and caught in the tractor-beam and lifted up
- Into the lab, strap you to tables, made you endure
Series of tests, pushin beyond the limits of stress
Wakin up in a cold field naked, barely alive
Every inch of your body's in pain, you barely survive
Milleniums ago, starmaps were drawn to sand
The meanings of the pyramids has long tortured man
Pharoahs and Hebrews, Mayans and Aztecs
Mathemetically perfect architects the many gods have blessed
Hieroglyphics become the blueprint of primal physics
Pyramids buried kings screams, tribal clerics
Radar-signals from space bouncing off burnt rocks

Humming songs to the afterlife like psycho artists

I give my life to my people till I end up in a stone garden
Or hanged before I take a king’s pardon
If the grounds keep it street style
Will bet my the crowd it’s started
My sick squadron raised in Hell’s cauldron
In the belly of the beast where we’re murdering a pig sergeant
Blue soldiers walk in red paths with death masks
We’ll see it all in ceremony, massacres with bloodbaths
As long as apocalypse now, surreal battles in the end of time

Blam faster than handcannons Damned families curse armies, kidnap generals

To be in branded in the sand by the vandal squad
I’m a freedom fighter with a weakness for Brazilian waxed putas

In a chase with the state porks have walked into a face-off

Assassins with multiple personalities
Active with full access
A backstage pass to cover up spectacular assassinations
And arms deals across the axis
Another witch hunt, religious radicals with big guns
Big plans, invisible cameras built in Japan
CIA behaviour control scientists in the cults
And formed an alliance of cult leaders, also their clients
Tech-savvy hijacker associates board planes
To practice, anxiously awaiting their global audience
Enter the core, I feel this with ease

This is I'll Bill kill the police kill the president kill the police kill the police
I go from Brooklyn to Baghdad to Little Rock
Pistol pop
You get fucked up like an airline through a bitches twat
Listen up
My brain erupt
Like volcanoes
Hotter than jalepanos
Half a yall are the faggots takin it in the A hole
I spray crhome
At your dome
Like crime out
Wile out
I pull the nine out
Bust one nut in a dimes mouth
I shot loud
Put yall on time out
You Get your mind cloud
Head wetted up with the bud I smell cloud
Spit the real
Like the twelve tribes of Israel
Gangsta but I still don't want nobody's kid killed
I spilled enough blood
Slinged enough drugs
To them children I'm innocent
But the rest of ya'll faggots can eat a dick
I don't like non of ya'll never did
Non Phixion forever kid
We negative
We stay on top
I tried to play it cool but the plan dropped
Landslide avalance casteration
Masturbation Assassination of the fastest nation
Exasperation
Nuclear warhead evaporation
Aggrevasion lepresy
Laceration
Fault the pieces
Talk to Jesus
Walk with ya'll with us it's tall we creepin"
Ill Bill,Broken Pieces,/i/ill+bill/broken+pieces_21529837.html,"(Chorus)
When your dreams are broken pieces
The world can be a cold and cruel place

(Verse 1: Ill Bill)
Yo, Yo, speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Skinny waist, fat ass, pretty face, evil mouth
Hollywood, partied with fake thugs, posers, and cokeheads
Her uncle was the ex-drummer from Guns n' Roses
Met her over Joey Silvera's house, a party girl
She was 19 and happy that her parents finally let her out
Three abortions, two from the same boyfriend
The third one during an orgy, might have been Sean Penn's
Yeah, I put it in her mouth once and we remained friends
Seen her out at the clubs now and again, the same shit
The same sneaky crowd, same cocaine, same tits
Same dreams about becoming a star and making ?
Played a hooker on Entourage, swore she made it
Made friends with the wrong crowd, got played quick
Took the first sniff of that grey shit then ate dick
Dummy ate her first syringe was never the same since, listen

(Chorus X2)

(Verse 2: Jeru tha Damaja)
Check it out, he a self proclaimed thug but the kid could rap
His idol was 2Pac, he was always wanted to act
Portray a thug on the silver screen
Show Hollywood the block, just had the rock, just one last scheme
With this move he financed a demo
Planned to vic a spot, they mixed coke with other chemicals
His team the neighbourhood criminals
Guess they missed the truth about birds of a feather
? Part of the plot, nobody move but motherfuckers still get shot
Grab the shit and head back to the block
He ain't know, a witness seen him come and go from both the rooftops
First, they murked his moms and his pops, then his girl and her seed
Slit her throat then filled the kid with shots
Paramedics did what they could
RIP, another mural on a wall in the hood

(Chorus X2)

(Verse 3: Slaine)
When you were younger, under your bed there was a monster
Between your legs where he wants you he haunts you
Still to this day, you got little to say
'Bout the nightmares you kept that had you widdled away
There's a little girl, a victim who's a diddler's prey
But you shut up, now you grown up, all fucked up
? tongue slippin through your heart
Nowadays the same stuff's rippin' you apart
You're 26, tryin to get rich quick
High heels, lipstick, slidin' down poles
They don't call you miss now, they call you ""this bitch""
That bitch bend over backwards
Throw a dollar at you and that's it
You've been bruised and scraped, abused and raped
And so drained from cocaine and dudes and snakes
If somebody had to walk a day inside your shoes they'd shake
It's like you never had a chance to choose your fate, wait

Young mother smoke crack while her baby cries
Young brother sell crack, carry baby nines
Baby-faced gangsters wild out commit crazy crimes
Taking anything they want without shame or pride
Stray bullet hit a pregnant momma Bed-Stuy
Lead fly, final destination her death arrives
Was she in the wrong place or was she meant to die?
And whoever's responsible they'll never find
Fuck flipping burgers, serving milkshakes and fries
Kids committing murders living in these last days and times
White kids, black kids any race or price
Shooting up they high school Satan in they minds
We see everything and yet we forever blind
Society turn away and protect your eyes
Like a horror movie but you can’t press rewind
Bare witness to reality or step aside

[Hook - 2x]
Are we learning how to live or learning how to die
Building nuclear weapons and learning how to fly
I never graduated high school I got my GED in tenth grade
And ran around Canarsie High

[Verse 2]
Young baby girl gave birth to baby girl
Thirteen brought a little baby in this crazy world
I seen the same story every block, every borough
Every town same situation very thorough
Very sad baby girl never knew her dad
Broken home, broken soul ready to attack
Young dad doesn’t even know that he a father
And some do but don’t care, or care to even bother
Plenty good parents too, but bad situations
Young dad went to war in a distant nation
Proud American that wanted to be participate
Sent home in a box or in a crippled state
We see everything and yet we forever blind
Society turn away and protect your eyes
Like a horror movie but you can’t press rewind
Bare witness to reality or step aside

The satanic, Mephisto rap
Aristocrat of butchery, malevolent monarch of murder just kickin back
Loungin the four pound packin scoundrel
Gore hound clappin ya counsel
Wrappin you up surround ya grill with bandages
Strappin' you up, tie you up, deny you of freedom, mummify with creatons
The majestic dressed sick black gear baggy
Pessimistic blessed it react with fear when you see the maggy
Brutality part 1 mentality, arsenic
Lyrical sarcophagus like Metallica with Cliff
Black Mass Lucifer acid casket, back draft flame rap
Hit the crack pipe glass, blast it
An alien from another dimension
Experiencing tension with very serious blood drenching henchman
Mysterious, mystical, magical, miraculous
Some furious typical animals attack you for your shit

A murderous brain, the mind of a surgeon turned insane
We spooked out like vultures and birds of prey
Burn ya veins like heroin, my words are grey
They call me ill cause I'm sicker than the germs in aids
Young Vader, if my gun ain't it your mouth - keep it shut, hater
Take it down a notch, homie be a thug later
Not here, take it elsewhere
The'yll find your legs, then your arms, then your mother find your head next year
A masterpiece, cop killer, blast police
Laughin at the NYPD catastrophe
Lift you off your fuckin feet like a tractor beam
I'm sellin rap to teens like crack to fiends
Only after you lose everything is when your free to do anything that you want, and I'ma take it in blood
I'll feed you a feast of middle fingers and fuck yous
Fuck off, faggot, put my foot in your face, follow through

You'll catch a belligerent bludgeoning
By the metaphysical technician of execution, we'll cut your spleen
Surgically cuttin ya brain purposely, nervously
Labotamy fuckin', insane circuitry

Entrepreneur gore rep it, tepic, like a septic
Schizo, I'm a sicko technically prospected

Tried hard tryna blow up in the NYC
I won't stop untill Jordans rockin Ill Bills on his feet
The first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, hell fire island
Run up on you shootin' and start a riot

Evolution of an revolution is televised

Thats goodbye
King in south america selling pies

The devils raises as another empire falls
The enterprise allies on weaponized fire balls
At first ? at high cause
As soon central lies intelligence reveal their bottom plans on then I ain't yours
We went from innocence to centism
From heavy metal lyricists to hip pop lyricism
From animation to live action suspended animation the sleepers cells

You know when the cops are comin' to get ya
Tryna' light you up quicker than Nikola Tesla
Applying choke-holds like a professional wrestler
And videotaping the protesters and hecklers
I spit on you at the Diallo march, remember me?
When New York City rose up as one entity

And ICX towers in the streets like the West Bank
Thanks for the reality check, so far...
You been exposed as political Praetorian Guards
So you can drive drunk, kill people and only do a year
But soon dissidence to the system start to disappear
And all sorts of governments crumble, so stay humble

Love the scene of an accident when someone's dead
We love violence, we can't turn away, The Coliseum
Throw ‘em in the arena and watch the lions eat 'em
Music and movies are the mirrors of this madness
Some morbid mural of morticians upon the canvas
A beautifully composed symphony of sickness, bear witness
Reality's much worse, predictions of apocalypse
Found in the books of religious architects
Arguments hidden in forbidden documents
Consequence, falling for Columbine
Anatomy of School Shootings
Bloods and Crips of Brooklyn is no longer a new thing
Death is certain, we all die
Whether it's from natural causes or not
Nobody really knows why
But if there's one thing I know, Death holds a place
In his heart for murderers, take a look at his face

[Chorus: Mr. Hyde]
Death smiles at murder
Pain shakes the hand of homicide
We all die, it's certain
Can't change the path that's prophesied

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
Some people murder for money
Other people murder for hate
Some murder for love
A lot of people murder for drugs
There's really fucked up people that need a murder to cum
And some of y'all motherfuckers even murder for fun
They might stab you up with a knife or shoot you with guns
That's when the black carpet event usually comes
Some murderers are strange drifters or depraved sickoes
Like Gary Heidnik, Gein, Bundy, Berkowitz and Joel Rifkin
A lot of murderers you wouldn't suspect
He kept to himself, “never bothered anyone,” they said
He was a simple guy with a simple life
Till he killed his wife
Got a first taste of doing something he liked
Some murderers are famous
And they wind up in a Ford Bronco
With a gun in they mouth like O.J. did
No matter who the fuck you are, Death has a place
In his heart for murderers, take a look at his face

Like Kiss in '76 demanding pyro

It's actually the arms race between the facts of anarchy
The secret to success is believing that you succeeded
Is more than an achievement;
It's as important as you breathing
Sometimes it's one and the same, who's running the game?
All we ever say is ""they"", they know it's fun to complain
This shit should cause people to riot and flip
The way I think; I've been classified as violent and sick
I'm like a time bomb, the CIA designed me to tick;
Designed me to head over to papi to buy me a brick
These mother ships hit our radars in the skies as a blip
The entire sky is eclipsed just like the size of my dick

Where lightning bolts the thrown in anger, meant to spark the dome
Now frightening results unfold
Dragons, eagles, snakes, and aliens captured;
We keep 'em caged in various constellations and areas
Coded through letters, numbers, and symbols that transmit
Pulses and whistles and activate hundreds of missiles
Hundreds of killers with multiple pistols
While these name brands reverse engineer spacecrafts and make trillions
They made the cure for AIDS and ceased production
While the poor die and fester in diseased corruption

Ill Bill,Economics '91,/i/ill+bill/economics+91_20173150.html,"I love everything about money
You can be a millionaire and never pay taxes
Rust, I got to bust to my destination
I woke up late time from other transportations
Trains and busses  public adorations so better turn
But where I'm going to is a place where it really burns
And burns my brain, my job, my occupation
Another motherfucking source of frustration
4, 25$ an hour, leaves my mouth sour
Minimum wages like I'm caged in the prison tower
Tell you to take out another person flips
They can't cope so they create their own economics
With an Uzi some ammunition and a flat jacket
Stick up kids, wanna be fat like Buddy Hacket
And get props, ranks, thanks, power position
A piece of paper with a picture of a dead politician
So many times I've seen people play stupid for money
And at the funeral it isn't funny
But nevertheless the world turns, it doesn't burn
Cause money make the world go round is what I always heard
That's when I got that sadly look on my face
No matter how fast I run, I always wind up in last place
So I just like to would pick myself up an automatic
So I can end my fate check without a denim static
Got nothing to lose except my head
Yo I'm in it to win it and imma spray the town blood red
Autroprenorial skills coming all fly
And economically it doesn't matter if somebody die
It's all about getting the dollars and jewel specs
So give it up before I put your life in fast checks
Yeah I got money coming out my ass
Yeah I got money coming out my ass"

Take it back to when John Hinckley sprayed up Reagan

Hey yo my bathtub ghetto work out decompose mucus
Sit bank Hank with ten to twelve in the casket like Frank Lucas
Shank Judas cause yo the Torah be the holy sect
All you bags of suppliers jupe (?) a pussy like Richard Speck

Blood splattered sunglasses, guns blasted, dust, ashes
Funerals and young caskets, baby gangsters, dumb bastards
Live fast run past us
Smile now cry after assassin’s shoot up what you love with a smile laughing

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Medina frozen nose like dope from P King
Get your neck sawed off with a broken blade like Jake Seeping (?)
Post-mortem I hit ‘em with ice trays ‘til the body’s frozen
A thousand sleeps without war I got my lobby open (?)

[Verse 4: ILL Bill]
That crazy heady rap angel dust and the hourglass
The blowjobs from seventy-two virgins like Taliban
Action packed acid rap's backs like a savage
When the ratchet clap barrels blast to pierce you like a arrow shaft

[Verse 5: Goretex]
The mac is greater laugh when you go down like a sack of potatoes
Shook a (?) steel cage ’82 when he pulled the tazer
Smile now die later 700 horse power

[Male interviewee:] Absolutely, absolutely, that we can no long allow technology to come roaring down at us, I think we must begin to say no to certain kinds of technology and to begin technological change because we’ve now reach the point that the technology is so powerful that it could destroy us

[Verse 1]
He was accepted with Harvard at sixteen
Child prodigy
Math with specializing in complex analysis geometry
Earned a PHD in mathematics early
Youngest professor ever hired by UC in Berkeley
A short-lived position
He resigned in '69 with no apology
Without an explanation given
Social anxiety multiplied silently
Disconnected entirely from society
Built a cabin, became a survivalist
Rejected electricity and modern sciences
He cooked his dinner in a fire pit
And watched the stars from afar where Orion sits
The wilderness where the lions live
Primitive like the times of the giant pyramids the Mayans built
Then something caused his mind to chill
A course solidified successfully the very first time he killed

[Hook]
What would you do, how far would you go
If you thought that you can change the world for the greater good
How would you know
What’s right or wrong
Try to play God
Mail a bomb
To the CEO or the school or an airline
Do you justify murder for peace?
Do you believe that technology is the beast?
Imagine if your iPhone disappeared
That would be weird
Could you function in a world without technology
Or would you be scared?

[Verse 2]
Exploding octopus, block buster in the 6 finger hand
Booby trap a box to shock the populace with wishful plans
Initially ignored
""Industrial society and its future""
The manifesto of Kaczynski's war
Life in seclusion
Rivals and bruises
Rifles and UZIs
Devices with clues designed to confuse the FBI
Throw 'em off plans
Blowing off hands
Blinding people first
Soon the results were even worse
Became obsessed with teaching society a lesson
With home made weapons that reach society’s perception
The Washington Post and The Times finally printed his manuscript
That was the tipping point that notified his family
With suspicion leading to his arrest
His brother recognized his writing style and mission of death
Ran up in his cabin and discovered undeniable proof of his guilt
Sixteen bombs, twenty-three injured and three killed

Caucasoid mutants with Uzis
Die in action with the eye-patch and eyeglass, then my assassins rhyme ratchet without sirens and the badges ?)
Read the signs of a savage
Aligned to the tragic
Put cyanide in your sandwich
Cause a riot on your campus
Fist of fury when the crystal blurry, catch a pistol, hurry
Fuck quantum physics and theory we minds is fucking for-really
Dust the ganja and philly’s with Russian mafia villains
(? Right into to the Kremlin ?)
Coke'll take you right into the emblem
We the righteous to rebel, yet when we strike it then we tell them
Drop your swords or we’ll be forced to leave you lifeless and dismembered
Satanic messages spoken loudly with intros
Automatic weapons is pokin’ out of my tinted windows
Jack Daniels with some coke and some lime
My rituals are older than time, it’s spoken in rhyme

Who’s hungry let’s eat
Break bread pass it down chew the food then breath
And that’s the feed of the morning (who’s thirsty)
And that’s the feed of the morning

[Verse 2: Jise One]
Talk shit, breathe, and live with conviction
Lancer, dissident, reminiscing at the friction between love and hate
The gate oppression
The infestation of injustice
The blind accustoms between religion and state
The poisonous cake that we possess with the desire to overindulge
She’s fine, the mirror's sneaky, consults the ass and titties should be more bulge
The frivolous search for the fountain of youth
Constrain the beat of a pulse to a pulp
Pockets choke dream's croak
The question of life’s purpose decided by desire
They call it peace of mind
Distracted by greed
Envious deeds, self sympathy and foolish pride
We plead with God to survive
We're side by side ourselves
To coincide with our old lives
Ride the tide ‘til it concedes, concede in to all the demons inside

Pocket down briefcase, exchange cosmic shots
Diamonds and golden guns, smashing you with hands of bronze

With more than enough fire power to splatter yall

Beat the case, roll the dice and I walk
Like a forty deuce Hebrew played the corner of a mic when I talk

Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap-box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph

From gunning to glory, another young hustler’s story
Learn from the mistakes of my uncle that done it before me
But choppa base death, horror, leave children crying
Get out like slayer throat form, slick pushin rhymes
Young shooters bring a pistol full
Caught up in that crucifixion rituals
While worshiping Lucifer habitual
The streets raised me, I’m from Brooklyn like Jordan to Jay-Z
To be where I’m from is a great thing
While yall daydream I make things happen
Get things clapping, spray things laughing
18 I stopped taking acid,
But it left a stain on my brain that remain massive
Thoughts of perceptional open 'til they lay me in a casket
Until I stop making murder rap
Because the bible was written by those who were givens - the earth is flat
And I’ll be dead before this war stops
Praying that the author of the Warlocks the will throw rocks

If Funkmaster Flex was inside, rockin the whole place
We was outside, smacking kids and snatchin gold chains
Baggin mad pigeons, catchin mad digits, bad bitches
And when they husbands came around we had to blast bisquits
A bunch of bad Brooklyn kids that always had pistols
Broken dreams and broken homes, we always had issues
And mad problems worshippin gangstas and bankrobbers
Watchin star fade startin fights and rap conscience [?]
Until we realized how to get the real money
Steal money, kidnap money, kill money
Its funny how the money make the whole world love you
Jealous cats hate you, dime pigeons
Little ghetto children run up on you, wanna touch you

""Do your homework, get off the street, read a book.""

Ill Bill, human manifestation of genocide
Stand amongst Grammy winning grimy nose candy sniffers
Blast the black metal at you like Danny Lilker
It's impossible to escape my matrix of hate
I'll make a good girl a cum dumpster sayin' don't wait
Set the razors to AKs and turn razors to grapes
Turn blood into wine with an insatiable taste
Drink from the goblet of gore, vomitting porn
Sodom and Gomorrah back to Canarsie New York

[chorus]

[Vinnie Paz/Louie Dogs]
You don't know about the gospel of Judas
About the information found in the Galapagos Ruins
How the warriors would sharpen they blades
How if they government wanted to they could cure you of AIDS
We the equivalent of fire and ice
The equivalent of a prisoner who die for his rights
I'm lyin' to Christ, put your fuckin' spine in a vice
I'm like Trump in the Apprentice, only fire at night
I'm dyin' to fight, slap you five and put ten in you
Louie Dogs, a fuckin' genocide general
So I say fuck the CIA and they plan
Get me outta here I'd rather fuckin' stay in Iran
I'll run up on you with grenades in my hand
If you fuckin' round with Bill or try to hate on my fam
It's the dichotomy of hatred in man
If you ever even think of tryin' to play me then blam
Blap bap

Ill Bill,How To Kill A Cop,/i/ill+bill/how+to+kill+a+cop_20222785.html,"AwwwwwwwwwwwwwwWWWWWWWWWWWWWW shit!
Eat it out, eat it out, no doubt, no doubt
Check it out, yo
The year 2000 begins a new age for the cop killers, knowhatI'msayin?
The saga of the I'll Bill continues
The flavor's Non Phixion y'all - get wit it
Check it out, check it out
[Verse One]
Check out this new I'll Bill gimmick that's splendid
Since you're down with other shit let's see if you're down wit this
It's about strictly tryin to kill a cop
Once you get the hang of it, after you blast one you steal his glock
First of all you need a fat bag of dust plus the biscuit
Any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a milli', not that bitch Millie Jackson silly stunt
I'm talkin about the nine millimeter gun
Pick up the gat, scratch the serial numbers off
No fingerprints, surgical ones are my gloves of choice
All of these other cop killers be thinkin guns are toys
And when these cats get caught, they snitch on all they boys
I kill a cop on a solo mission; without a pair of gloves
Shot him in the face with a stolen biscuit
Then wiped my fingerprints off real careful
If you don't think you ready yet dog, just let the song prepare you
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 6X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up, what
That's how you kill a cop -- peace to Necro
That's how you kill a cop -- peace to Necro
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 4X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up
[Verse Two]
Yeahhhh!The second paragraph, might make you laugh
When a cat try to kill a cop and catch a plunger in the ass
That's when you know you got to take the gun from him
Cause you bout to get snubbed next, and you hyped up, so FUCK runnin
And now the real fun begins son
You kill these ten cops, the best part, you walk away with ten guns
Now you the one that's takin gats from pigs
Imagine one gang, consistin of the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings
That's when you start to realize what the police is
Government funded gang-bangin thugs; that's what beast is
They say I'm evil, I'm the most righteous
Run up in precincts with assault rifles; kill police and throw bibles
Walked out the precinct leavin no survivors
Half his decapitated wig splattered across the precinct driveway
The watts was stuffed up his body, jerk and gyrate
Shoot him ten more times, then I merc off on the highway
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 6X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up, what
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 6X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up
[Verse Three]
Yeahhhh!Last but not least, I'll Bill like to say peace
To all the cop killers, from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme some dust when I kick the bucket
Pistol or no pistol, when high I'm the wrong to be fucked with
So everybody put they gun up in the air
Cock it back and lick a shot like you just don't care
SO - PUMP UP THE VOLUME!!Screamin out, ""Fuck cops!""
I'm out - peace to my pops, I'm off to the dust spots
Yeah, I'll Bill's in the house
Yeah, Goretex in the house
Yo, peace to my motherfuckin fam Non-Phixion
Yo, I'm out
Yo Necro, turn that shit off, man
TURN THAT FUCKIN SHIT OFF!!"
Ill Bill,How To Survive The Apocalypse,/i/ill+bill/how+to+survive+the+apocalypse_21529909.html,"[Sample from the movie Armageddon]

[Verse 1]
If the apocalypse started today
Some of us would try to hide
And some of us would cry to God and pray
It's a dangerous world on a fragile axis
Most of us aren't prepared if society ever collapses
Major volcanic to earthquake events
Tsunamis swallowing cities
Drown entire populations to death
It could be nuclear, biological or chemical war
Or martial law or we could just run out of oil
Those with major health issues won't survive
Anyone on dialysis or a respirator device will die
When the power-grid fails for days, weeks or months or years
Think about that possibility with fear
Power failure leads to no food or water
Leading to collapse of law and order
Then massive robberies and slaughters
Riots and looting
Widespread violence and shootings
Gunshot battles
Survivors take rifles and Uzis

[Hook]
I'll show you how to survive the apocalypse
I'll show you how to survive the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Having guns ain't the key to survival though
They're just a piece of a big puzzle
Of course it's 'bout what you know
Practical skills are your most valuable tool
Don't fall into the same trap that most amateurs do
Buy your beans, bullets and band-aids
Cause in the last days money's worthless
What will matter is what you have to trade
So practice raising a vegetable garden
After the apocalypse you can survive
If you are an exceptional farmer
Old technology could be your salvation
Study how the old world survived before modern civilization
Gaining water, food, shelter, fuel, communications
And build weapons and tools that once used to rule nations
Share and watch each others backs
Choose your friends wisely
Increasing the probability of everyone surviving
But most of all build your self reliance
Protect your family
And make sure always be prepared for violence"

I’ll show you what my motherfucking name bout

And get away clean cause I paid off the courts

It’s Steven King, I spit nothing but classics
And it’s ill how I turn beef to nothing but caskets

More money more drama, don’t make me catch an open case
For opening your face, you’re soft like Hostess cake
I wanna live fat, I gotta eat what Oprah ate
So I hold niggas up with the one plus eight
I’m the man of the year
You so whack that niggas put their hands on their ears
And tell you, “Shut the fuck up.”
And the only dog that roll with you is on the Fedex truck
Now here’s the score: ten-zip and I ain’t talking about the disc
I’m talking about extended clips, smoking in expensive whips
Four-four’s the end of shit, give you a Hell’s membership

You violate I’ll put a hole in your melon

You like a campfire, homes, I light you up with all types of guns
The vampire, homes, I’m drinking all nine pints of blood

Destroy the evidence after I chopped up the witness
A cheapskate, I keep my money locked up for interest
Fuck the industry, y’all faggots make me not trust the business
Ill Bill, right money make a murder make sense
I make brains squirt out their heads right in front of their friends
I ain’t a nice guy at all, dog, lifestyle raw y’all
Sell drugs, tour, smoke nudies, and fuck whores
Got black bitches with white eye shadow that like to swallow
And white bitches that pop their pussies for Heineken bottles
I’m a dirtbag with brand new sneakers, throwback over the Desert Eagle
Blow your face off, leave you forever peaceful
Like a newborn dead inside of a crib
I cock back, empty Dessies in the side of your wig, faggot

The murder game is a race and I’m taking the lead
Fast and furious nigga like my gun got nitro
Playing games like Tyco, mama told me I’m psycho
And I believe her, now the clique running streets like cheetahs
We’ll meet up and put holes all in your wifebeaters
From BK to Queens we be pointing them things
Have your Ecko shirt looking like some damaged jeans nigga
It’s Syn Roc, the kid who got your grandpop shot
Over a game of bingo, I take the cream out his socks
In a cloud of weed is the place where you find me
And I stole drink forties like I’m stuck in the 90’s
Nigga I’m grimy, wilding on the alcho temp
Try to front on me and get hit with sixteen clips

Alright ahk who wanna fuck round?

Begging for mercy talking about, “Alright. Enough now.”
Hold up and y’all hammers bust pow
Enough, get touched like ooh ah ow
You suck, push your luck, get laid the fuck down
Get bucked, I was a wild off the hook child
Played tough plus steroids came in big viles
Puff puff puff liked to buy weed in big pounds
Crack that Dutch, I ain’t addicted I’m just in denial
When I blow then I flow like the river Nile

My energy similar to the devil's chi
My treachery stretch for centuries
Menacing venomously
Make you hemmorage tremendously
My five senses suspended in weed and Hennessy
You bleed endlessly
My greed gets me everything, pussy, cars, anything
The means to fulfill any dream
I'm a fiend for the better things

Explosive like stone tablets in the hands of Moses

Smile for the barrel, swallow the magnum
Laughing in your face while the back of your head is vomiting fragments
You can't kill Bill, that was a movie, you can't move me
Withstand the maximum impact of Uzis or AK-47s
I'm already dead, it's ILL BILL the 2011 Melle Mel
Motherfucker what's really real? Really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with israeli steel yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes and car seats
You die on the belt parkway next to Canarsie

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a goon in a world of atheists and religious fanatics
Pimps, whores, drug dealers, drug addicts
Rock stars, rappers, actors and other characters
Starfuckers and cocksuckers and million dollar savages
Negotiate with blowtorches to faces
Vacation, the golden nugget, made a fortune in Vegas
I'm the greatest, perfect methods of execution painless, popped in the ear of the stainless
Leave even geniuses brainless
Leave the general population shocked and horrified
Fucking with me you might as well have been born to die
My values are loyalty, truth, respect, and honor
My family's royalty, my life is an endless drama
My art is death and I'm about to paint masterpieces
Catastrophes, shattered dreams, amputees
Forgiveness is between you and god I just arrange the meeting
I just arrange the firing squad, arrange the bleeding, I'm a goon

Ill Bill,I'm From Brooklyn,/i/ill+bill/im+from+brooklyn_21529841.html,"(Verse 1: Ill Bill)
Brooklyn be billions and billions, I be Brooklyn Bill
It was Brooklyn where my uncle got hooked on krillz
A billion warped thoughts travel through the grime in his mind
A billion wars fought between crime designed in the devine
A billion seconds ago, it was nineteen fifty-nine
A billion minutes ago, Jesus Christ was alive
A billion hours ago, we were living in the stone ages
A billion dollars, the definition what cocaine is
This be a Brooklyn thing where Kings stampede
We got hundreds of greedy geniuses that get that cream
Acopolco Gold grab dutches at the bodega
Stuntin' in stashed Air Maxes, those are my most favourite
We met fanphibian, fucked up, I need lithium
Sabotage my life with northern lights and pifium
I been the illest William since Billy D
Sold Colt 45 of TV, it's really me, Billy Brooklyn

(Chorus X 3)
This is Brooklyn
Br-br-br-br-br-Brooklyn
I'm from BBr-br-br-br-br-Brooklyn
Br-br-br-br-br-Brooklyn

(Verse 2: Brooklyn Academy)
Yeah, you love the way I'm a burrough sound chopped up
Fuck around, that's exactly how you found, chopped up
In ? Canal with a sock in your mouth inside a hefty bag
Looking like Oscar the Grouch
No future, It's Apocalypse Now
You get blasted off, rocketship stlye
Brooklyn bad, the beautiful, the bomb
Its musical charm and I ain't talking Louie Vatton
I'm talking Tim boots, baseball caps, and facemasks
Polo patches, skully caps, and nap sacks
Fat sacks of weed, half black and Japanese
Drug pushers turning cats to catastrophe
It ain't the movies, you ain't gonna believe
Outsiders try to enter but they ain't gonna leave

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Brooklyn Academy)
I learned how to survive on the crossroads of a street and an avenue
Where kids brawl over stick ball and use a bat for beating you black and blue
Little bastards that would laugh at you if you were sweeter than passion fruit
Until your heart hardens on the streets with the Brooklyn attitude
And we would rumble like the Jets and the Sharks
But on Friday the spics and white chicks had sex in the park
And we didn't give a fuck from which section you are
But if you gonna step to somebody, you step with some heart
When we travel from Longbow to Marcey, from Partsworth to Canarsie
The strong and thorough made a name like John Turtturo
Our block was born so you'd lock your doors of fear of knocks
The birthplace of 2Pac Shakur
This is Brooklyn, the shots ? like poker face
Carve your skin like a Jack-o-lantern and crack jokes like Adam Sandler
Commit a crime with an open case, robbing armoured cars
With the warrant squad chasing you in the dark through Prospect Park

(Chorus)

(Verse 4: Brooklyn Academy)
The Dodger's first home where I bought my first phone
I had my first ? , where I broke my first bone
Flipped my first nick, where I got my first girlfriend to suck her first dick
Where I ate Section 8, where I took my first shit
Where I had my first fight, where I joined my first gang
Where I first broke night, hold tight, it's where I dropped my first shroom
Where I took my first bump, where I heard my first tune thump
Out Jamel's first Maxima trunk, after that, matter fact
Actual fact, it's where I first landed a track in the lab with the AK
The land that I rep go like ?
I fight for it like a Palestenian with a stone
B-R double O-K Corral where the illest MC could come spit a loser's morale
The most popular burrough where everyone wants to stay
My home, our zone, all hail BK

Using mental telepathy, my treachery, treacherous over centuries
I never meant to be reincarnated
Matter of fact if it was up to me I wish that I had never been created
Them swinging swords hoards up in physical fords walking through forbidden
Doors hidden withinside of the morgue
People grimace when they witness business of the bloody instance
So keep your distance, the smell of bodies is covered by incense
I show no mercy blood splats up on my hockey jersey
Similar to physicians in rooms of emergency
So fuck the gats I'd rather hit you with the axe
Laugh while your skull cracks but I'm still not happy

(Chorus X2)

All I really want is to be happy
To find a love that's mine would be so sweet

I'm turning red blood cells into dead blood cells
Using microscopic utensils within your entrails
Pushing the limit of your chromosomes
Sitting on the throne made of human bones organize up into foam
I walk alone into pandemonium utilizing plutonium
To build a bigger better stronger weapon
I sense the presence of great evil
So I erase and drain every bit of the power source conceivable
Bringing about the beginning of ending
I'm sending the crucifier tending to your so called messiah
Within the fire I eulogise planetary demise
Feeling energized as another planet dies
And nothing could ever really make me give a fuck about
Anything you care about so why even bother
The blood I spill could fill the entire New York harbour
So hang the Holy Father and light the candelabra
(Chorus X2)
I'm slowly killing myself to live infact
I couldn't even begin to explain the effects of the drugs on my brain
Nothing positive could influence the trip I take
I'm drivin by the negativity I instigate
Without a doubt the bloody body count increases, you fall to pieces
My mouth releases terminal diseases
And everywhere you look there's another dead fucking schnook
Hanging from a bloody meat hook
I always keep a smile on my face
So I can hide what's really going on inside of my mind
I feel nothing and therefore I am nothing
I thrive upon your suffering and there's nothing that makes you feel happy

Dolo fresh ox on, Polo Bear socks on
Freak dancing in the backstreet with our Glocks on
Hard rocks, hammers and heaters, they kept the blocks warm
Daily objective, being gone before the cops swarm
Holdin' TECs never sex, we was not porn
Streets made us then they raised us, we are not born

‘Cause some of the breakers I knew were stick up kids that leave you cold and bleeding
It wasn’t a happier time, New York was a fucking mess
Little yellow envelope stuffed with skunk and cess
Then I’m in the back of the B train with a four finger ring and a gold rope
Didn’t look like a rapper, I looked like somebody that sold dope
And maybe I did cause back home was no hope
But maybe because Rakim said he was no joke

A duffel bag of yeyo, at least seven keys
Pool party shoot out veteran, call me Jim Shooter
Whores copped, left me two guns with twin Rugers
Grand Theft Auto, sawed-off shotty party
Canarsie artie, rep the hood,
The rap John Tardy with nines on me
Tell me who you be or you be gone
We squeeze chromes, stop you in your tracks
Fuck up your life like teen moms
One Hour Photo, creep out like Mork From Ork
Use the HK to speak when I talk the talk
Walk quietly and pop with the MP-7
Put it to your melon, pop off and empty seven
Split you in half like when my mom and dad was divorced
Me and my peoples be the real life gangs of New York
I’m so sick with it, I spit it like cannibal corpse
We be causing a moshpit like Cro-Mags at L'Amours
So who you think this is? Ill Bill, ride and I’m gone
Horrifying like a Time Square suicide bomb
Beyond and beyond, we let the drama start
Terrorize you like freedom fighters
Exploding on the streets of Islamabad
Unapproachable, unfriendly, untouchable
Bulletproof, torture you to death, punish you
Connect heart, react like Colombian death squad
Funded by CIA drug money, possessed by

Legend has it that before I war I worship Satan
Drink human blood and have orgies amongst Masons
Amongst the faces of presidents that crush nations
Stuff a nun, sacred slut, draped in lust and hatred

[Verse 2]
I put the biscuit in your mouth and spit it like System Of A Down
Get your weight up, I’m throwing pistols at the crowd
Now a powerbroker
Non fiction, the future is now over
Prisoners of war tortured by proud soldiers
Tell horror stories, Medal of Honour for war ceremonies
Transport drugs like heavy metal roadies
While they transmit their bullshit through television cameras
Super powers throwing their gang signs like gang bangers
Fuck CNN, fuck Meet the Press, fuck Al Jazeera
Fuck all of y’all, I won’t be brainwashed by the media
Speak it how I live it, powerful lyrics
Leave an entire crowd in hysterics
Popping the four pound when you hear it
I been the worst thing since the CIA trained Bin Laden
The kids ride when I pop off, Crooklyn to Compton
I be the crypt keeper, the Grim Reaper, I spit ether
Guaranteed fatalities, leaving your wig leaking

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3]
When I die I pray to God that I arrive in Heaven
At least an hour before the Devil know that I’m dead
It’s gonna take more than a single bullet hole to my head
You’re gonna have to nuke the whole Brooklyn borough instead
I trust nobody, question everything, I’m the king
Turn the weak into wolves and the wolves into sheep
Teach you how to kill police then dispose of the heat
My foes throw themselves off of buildings in the throes of defeat
I’m like the Moses of this whole shit
I got bitches that sell blow, blow dick, and suck their own tits
Choking on weed smoke, we squeeze toast
My enemies scream, “No, please don’t!”
Get your whole team soaked
We coked out like Chris Farley the day he died
Survive and your life don’t mean shit if you ain’t even really alive
I walk off backwards with my nines in your faces
While you watch me brainwash your entire generation

Slaytanic cannibal rituals, welcome to the jungle holocaust
Chop you to pieces beyond modern laws
You and your friends with the yellow hairs
We don't understand the weird language you speak, but we can tell you're scared
And rightfully so; the nerve, how dare you spitefully roam our turf
Western man; entitled bullies of earth
The world is yours? There's five of you, but hundreds of us
And here you stand, empty handed
Besides a duffel of guns, hand 'em over
We don't use these in the jungle
They're for false gods and wannabe conquerors
We seen your kind before, funny beige hats and mustaches
Pop said never trust a savage with a satellite and hundreds of cameras
I put a apple in they mouth and roast 'em
I like to toast 'em with a marshmallow stuffed up they asshole
And hopefully amongst their bitches there's a virgin for the sacrifice

[Verse 2]
Cannibal voodoo leave you murdered in the afterlife
Dance with umfufu, dinner served lit by candlelight
Kill, eat, fuck, is the law; no murder charge
You and your squad turned to burgers and kebabs
Cook you impaled on the sharpest of knives
The length of my speer's like a machete got stuck up your arse
Still half alive, staring up at the stars
My favorite medium rare, center cut is the bomb"

Dirty hands over a sacrificial lamb
I got mad issues so I’m snatching the pistol fam
The green trees got me into orbit
Where I found the skeletal remains of a mafia informant
I’m from Gravesend where from out of the playpen
You could get paid from filling the graves with made-men
No remorse like the end of a nasty divorce
Marshall vs the sleaze stacked with her hand on the torch

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
Land of the Lost hit you with chrome barrels or with stone arrows
Could turn your oceans into blood like Mo' told Pharaoh
They exit Egypt thousand years before the death of Jesus
Millenniums before these Devils invented diseases
Created the AIDS ice-cold like vapors in space
Institutionalized like hiding razor blades in cakes
Incarcerated scarfaces that'll rape your face
To let you know what fucking time it is like Flava Flav

[Hook: ILL Bill] (x2)
We burn it up
Like Manson vs Berkowitz
We turn it up
Like acid vs Percocets
We serve it up
Like assassin’s that flirt with death
We sherm it up
Like gangsters vs stick-up kids

This is the mind of violence with a designer virus
Screw on the silencer in time so you can die in silence
Capital-Q decapitate capitalist rappers
I put a cap in they back after I turn my cap backwards
The blood on the hands a Pontius Pilate
Dwell on the underworld’s of the city where the monsters hiding
The mind of Heath Ledger with a handful of pills
My face covered in make-up and a plan for the kill

[Verse 4: ILL Bill]
The massacres real like crackheads dancing for krills
A hairy situation like a Tarantulas meal
I’m like a cross between a scorpion and Kevorkian
My impact will flatten a skyscraper like an accordion
Award winning war villains
Playing hopscotch across buildings and toss trucks like matchbox cars at your children
Homie I square off like it’s Sicilian
Fuck priceless cause every word I write costs a million

I shatter your jaw
I battle you all
It's like the end of day show
Criminals calling cocaine snow
Doing blunts, blood splatters when they blow they nose
The rap Tom Green, I rap obscene
They try to throw my album on NASA(?)

Super black market, we doped up like track markings
Run up on cop cars and blast sergeants

I’m giving you something you’ve never seen
Listen close, this is not a dream
Wake up from surgery, feel the doctor poke at your spleen
I’m from a place cause a racist cop will choke out a teen
Then leave him slumped in the street and beaten
That’s how it seems
Yo, what the fuck you mean? This life ain’t natural
Don’t make touch on government, the streets are like the capital
And Christianity is magical, they make you think
That you cannot finish a date without smoking, I’ll take a drink
This is not a story, some think it’s all a game
Most of us sold to the Devil just for a taste of fame
And so they pull something heavy, metal splatter your brain
It’s not a game when you watch a pistol shatter your frame
It’s pain and pleasure, you mix a little together
Then let it rise to the top and then popping, you get the measure
The president is a veteran sodomizing his people
To make you believe the words that he’s speaking
Naturally evil

This is that heavy metal shit
Don’t even meddle with
I keep a four just in case yo I gotta settle shit
You ain’t a veteran, I got some medicine
Don’t even act like you’re tough, homie
You’re better then
And this ain’t for the radio, don’t even play it, ho
The metal music to lose it, you know it’s crazy yo
And this is how it’s going down, let off a hundred rounds
Of metal music now can you hear the sound?

[Ill Bill]

I’m giving you heroin for your ears
Listen close, homie. This is dope
Get your adrenaline pumping like you was sniffing coke
Ride the lightning, cult leader my mind’s frightening
I drink blood from a human skull like a Viking
To toast the death of my enemies
I command an army of blood thirsty murderers with heads like machines
I’m the future of this piece of shit scene
Abandon all hope and these fake fucking faggots
I’mma snatch up all their bling
Got you stuck in the moment, zoning advanced but fucked up like cloning
I’m the evolution of super soldiers
Human vultures, better yet I’m exploding like super novas
Moving in circles of tyrannical goons with toasters
The face of the Devil, chased by the bass and the treble
The gunfight erupts amongst fallen saints in the temple
This is Ill Bill making the metal bang like Slip Knot
With twin Glocks, thirty-six shots, you get your wig popped

My life is- I'm dependent, I can't help it. I started at a young age
I'm too dependent on it, you know?
Drugs and music get me where I wanna go now
But I gotta make the money for it and it's not that easy nowadays

My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms used to smoke weed with her friends when I was eight
Smoked weed when I was twelve, sold weed at fourteen
Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
Conscious rap is bullshit, gangster rap is a fraud
This is real rap, bang your fucking head through the wall
This is drug music, stuck with a syringe in your arm
I'm the truth like the name of the song
Yo my uncle shoots heroin

[Ill Bill]
Bathroom floor, found a syringe
When I was on the Hiero Tour Howie went out on a binge
The snake bitch I was fucking even took him to cop
A month later he was on the floor looking for rock
Missed a flight to Czech Republic, walked in the path
Of Howie lying in his own puke dying from crack
Cocaine poisoning, he shot the heroin since fourteen
February 2003, he was clean
I helped him out, he kicked crack, dope, and meth
Hosted shows, free clothes, bubblebaths, autographs
T-shirts, soon I'mma make a Howie action figure
Before his latest relapse I'm glad I captured pictures
I love Howie, homie used to change my diapers
To save him I'd have jumped in front of spray from snipers
But this is just something that he's gotta do on his own
I try to get through to him with this song yo

He used to live in my crib, sleep on my couch smoking Newport 100's
Gave me comic books, bought me my first bass guitar
Learned from my grandma how to tell you the future with cards
Watch the sci-fi channel high off of methadone
More addictive than anything injected in the arm
D.T.'s five in the morning waking my moms
Got a search warrant but Howie Tenenbaum is gone
Roaming the streets, he was a superhero to me
When I was five I used to pick the seeds out of his weed
Nodding out, burning cigarette holes in his sheets
Wake up and eat a box of Captain Crunch then go back to sleep
He was a crackhead too, he might still be
A walking relapse, that motherfucker's still on the street
You tell him right he goes left
Show him right he does wrong
I hope I get through to him with this song yo

Who the fuck pop off harder than this
When I hit you the impact is like if God had a fist
I’m hollow tip my every molecule is part of the clip
I’ve been (lied) apart sick show a part of the chip
I’m not (showby) on the shadow of a doubt if I exist
Bitch talked up papy for discount on the brick
Kid walked up cocky got shot in the dick
Finance is a gun, politics is knowing when to pull the trigger
Electric heretic the zig-zag zigga
With the Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head, God descends
Part of the spiritually dead, pop the pistol through your head
Brooklyn 1986 Nike sneakers and beamers
Teenagers buying keys from drug dealers named Jesus

Belt Parkway like I'm Roy DeMeo
Chop you in the tub for yayo

If we on the grid we sit with no payloads
Like [?] respect with umbrellas to [?]

And dead homies, kissing their casket on final way home
Demented retribution canted with the congregation
Blessed to death, the angel, goodbye to meditation

Life is enslavement and suffering, crazy snuffings, attacks
Overdosing like David Ruffin, craving, puffing some crack
Hell is endless and friendless to the Hitlers, Mengeles, and Himmlers
Mangled, ripped to pieces by characters like Pinhead, no forgiveness
Reincarnated as God and Satan, logical psycho sadist
My cadence hits like razorblade tips or when Vader invaded
Corresponding with demons, bonded in blood
Like the Ugandan president Idi genocide like Rwandans in bondage
Divine comedy, mind lobotomy, do the math like Ptolemy
A bloodbath, you're split in half, dichotomy
The honorable, horrible, incorrigible, adorable death oracle
Beautiful like a funeral floral, you heard the stories: Murdering for glory
Sent to purgatory for doing something perverted and gory

I fall upon my knees like, ""Lord forgive me""
Out of the commandments I've broken ten out of ten now
Blasphemy passed to me because now Satan's my pen pal

Outbursts like bismillah, hallelujah
On the other hand I lust for flesh in my quest for gouda
Shaboobalaboopy time, I choose and the coochie's mine
My booze through the nine and I ooze at a groupie dime
I threw B-signs, but the Cs got more patnas
Everything dead, blasting at peep ma poor patois
Trying to bring you peace but the beast brings forth kaka
I really feel like I hate you but it's eep opp ork ah-ah
You don't know what that means? Then ask Jet Screamer
Trash that lingers will cause the enemies to blast that femur

How many lifetimes have I taken you through in this hour?
I trust nobody cause Babylon destroyed my uncle
So many lessons I've applied to my life that taught me to function
In this hell on the earth the dark clouds have silver linings
Until the lightning strikes down upon the unrighteous and frightening
The non-believers like eighty year old atheists on their death bed
Crying and begging for forgiveness from God

We real so you die find you laced with the slugs
With the quickness you callin me my sacred love
I got bad brains the reason I spray with guns now listen

Ill Bill,Pentagram,/i/ill+bill/pentagram_21529829.html,"[Intro:]
The pentagram has always been used, Satan worship, satanic worship, the five pointed pentagram
And if you take the arms off of the pentagram, you have a pentagon
And the United States' Pentagon is sitting exactly to north, aiming to north of the north star Thuban
Which is drawing power, according to the ancient egyptians for, for the god of war

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Anton LaVey Fu Manchu facial hair
Goons with the hateful stare
Move with palatial flare
Young Gary Busey but carry an Uzi
Young Cosby, hairy pussys and strawberry roofies
Young Ozzy, young pentagram, young Robby
Double septagram, rest in power to Prodigy
My living dead is like a snake on Medusa's head
Killers laugh like snakes while they shoot you dead
Billions drop brainwashed by foolish trends
Ha, [?] spray Glocks at you, shoot his head
Rest in power to Sean Price
Salute to my brother Vinnie, we all nice
I'm like Scorpio from Dirty Harry
I prefer it [?] I'll be murder happy
I'm the sorcerer supreme
You'll be murdered in your nightmares and tortured in your dreams

A little drug money never really hurt nobody, nobody

[Verse 2: Goretex]
They call me Captain Trips, Young Jerry
A hundred hits pure lysurgeon
Weed immersive, I roam the streets scheming for bleeding virgins
Use detergent and bundles and isotol, monsters brawl
Caprichaun and the goat
Young pentagram and matzah balls
Me and Bill rock wigs like Abel Ferrara
The coke cabo wabo private jet papi got the dope from heron
From Gustava, rocking Iommi jackets, fat mattress
Set a church on fire with catholics
I never went on my rackets
Rock a sadie shirt murder scene, plenty shades of dirt
I'm like a pagan cloak, 3:15 evade your turf
Tie your father up, and get the Tokyo blade, its double serrated Make his flesh a mess, sizzle like a slab of bacon
Buck 50 for the dope the pelicon took, mexican cooks, Billy Idol with heroin hooks
Flying Vs through your molly bags, running through customs
Got 40 pounds covered in polly bag, you started from nothing

Of you sucking my cock
Check it out

Ill Bill, the rap Jules Jordan, call me the hip-hop Joey Silvera
Represent the bitches bang me, then let them blow me forever
The balls deep, but we all creeps, the pistol's popped
Looking for beautiful girls like Christoph Clark
I need an Evil Angel in my life, [?] property
More goons with guns that go to war properly
The projects, the gutter, I grew up in poverty
I'm rich now, Uncle Howie Records is a monopoly
Your monstrosity roll with the dream associates
My team is the real deal, your team is a bunch of dicks
We top of the pie, rock it like [?]
Lockin' it down, droppin' it live and then rock it with pride
I been around the world, partied with all types of girls
From police woman and stripper with thousand pearls
A whole boat rode the hoes that swallowed my pole
But only a Puerto can throw me out of control

[Chorus x2: Ill Bill, Sabac & Goretex]
Pussy and hard drugs, sawed-off shotguns, we God’s thugs
Get my cock sucked by rock groupies and pop sluts
Weird chicks, with big titties and pierced clits
Exotic dancers in love with us, the fuck you think?

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Goretex the young wizard, my life is like a porn set
Drug blizzards, runaway bitches slump dead on my door step
Sugar momma's got a crush on Gore
Fisting their ass, twisting nipples, sucking my balls
Tappin' the bush, medium rare was mush
She ain't happy unless she got pills and the arm in a tush
Sparking the kush, leavin' off the strippers like it's welfare
Hip-hop the ligaments, I'm killin' shit (we in the mix)
Haters obsessed, I'll be swervin' the Benz
My chick's ass is so fucking fat, be hurting her legs
Twenty eight cadavers, but I ain't heard from the feds
Uncle Howie opium dead, we be reppin' on death
Stay bakin', you american faggot like Clay Aiken
Come back and you be dancin' the raves like Ave's patients
Belly up, we thuggin' and heavy, my goons ready
Your skull's a deli, my guns turn your head to confetti

Enter your nightmares, challenge your dreams
Non-Phixion, we the most balanced team

Sabacolypse, conscious lyricist perverted and sick
Converted the wig of a nationalist
I love them chicks on tour who like flashin' their tits
A passionate bitch who take it in the ass or what attached to wrist
Them fast with the fist, a massacres of [?] and kids
Blast at the pigs (blaow!) cause of what they do to the people
I get my dick sucked while I read the Rulers of Evil
I flew with the eagles, swam with the sharks
Damage your heart, I break you down, built you up as I plan for the mosh
Stay armed with fourty women that are psyched about porn
Phone the biggest fucking orgy on the White House lawn
Force the twins to join in, have the both them to blow me

Yo, behind the scene Rasheen calling shots
We debate in front of have-nots, lost souls from back blocks
Everybody in they hood feeling they all can rap
Thinking it’s a way out the Trap
School is lame, feel it, they have nothing to gain
All they know is guns and cocaine
I can’t recall the moment, the time the suits despised rap
Saying it was noise and non-sense
Once it became a voice for the people
They saw dollar signs, artists got signed
Low level opinionated A&R's
So off is they had no clue what was going on
Fast forward, cash out the start of minus
Skewer days, I really can’t call it
Evil seeds in place, all I’m seeing is a wasteland
Built off drugs, money and self-hate

(Hook x2)
I’ll tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin get they ones, I’m tryin get them M's
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live

(Verse: Cormega)
I might front but I won’t go backward
I’m every slave’s dream, I own my masters
Unlike most rappers, even if I don’t go platinum
I live like I did, that’s all that matters
They said I couldn't do it, I did it
Independent with lyrics that don’t produce for listeners
Forward music no excuses
Only a chosen few show and prove it to be true to cultures influence resulted in moguls’ influence
Revolution’s the only solution
Get back to basics and stop chasing illusions, of vultures looming
Causing confusion, regain the focus you losing
The goal’s improving, the future of our culture ensured
If you're a vocally gifted artists supposed to be winning
But those who be spinning, dick ride are more than the women
Causin division by ignoring the feelings of fans who know what is missing
Hip-hop in its purest existence

(Hook x2)

(Verse: Ill Bill)
Another record label snitch but fuck it
You know, one love kid, no I’m not doing it big
Try to throw me under the bus and ruin the kid
And came back with full fronts and exclusive kicks
Stays up ahead, always adapt; evolve; survive
Sharpen your knives, in other words sharpen your mind
That’s your most valuable tool
Always stay alerted, wide open, alerted all times, actual truth
Make opportunities happen
Once that your a full time student of rapping, you’re responsible for your actions
No complaints, you ain’t got no time for that
‘Cause time’s money and you're in the red 9 to black
Get it where you fitting in there's more power in packs
Pop em before they pop us in the showering gats
From corporate pack lies to crack spots
I got the chop chops way before you popped out your mom’s box

I leave you looking like a blood transfusion gone bad
With no dick, you a hoe, bitch
The only thing you know is you don't know shit
And that's a good thing, peep the heat the hood bring
I be in Brooklyn and e'rybody know my crew sling
'nough drugs, we 'nough thugs with 'nough guns
The only thing you faggot cats pull out is butt plugs
I got this coke-head lesbian bitch that blow head
That will shoot you in the dick point blank range then jet
The gangster of love, grimy like Sanford and Sons
My magnum's a drug
Splatter you then dance in your blood
I bust repeatedly
I always knew that God hated me, created me
Threw me on a planet that's afraid of me
My date of birth will be the day the earth learn to hate love
At fourteen is when I first heard Reign in Blood
At fifteen is when I first start to play with guns
At seventeen I ate my first blunt laced with dust
At twenty-one I shot Reagan and made the paper son
My life is Non Phixion, sex, drugs and laser guns
Love junkie drug producer, I fucked Medusa plus her two sisters
My clique is murderous, your crew's bitches
Confused victims walk around wounded and oozing liquids
Shoot you then threw the biscuit
In the dumpster, flew to Kingston
I fucked Halle Berry in the bathroom during the Grammy's
Then ate Roumanian steak at Sammy's
We rhyme like we never got paid yet, I face debts smiling
I die in a shootout with eight vets
Mr. Ill Bill assassinate character witnesses in courtrooms
In front of the judge and jury and their kids
I'm like the side of the Force that the righteous man walks

I create this effortless
Take it back like Kirk Hammett when he played for Exodus
Get mines, motherfuck you and your fake pretentiousness
Spit rhymes plus I’ll punch you in your face for emphasis
Clips fly, spit shrapnel, big bangers and det mines
Militant tribal cliffhangers risking their lives
Visitors arrive, extraterrestrial villainous tribes
Exit starships dripping in a glistening slime
My dungeon master levels are high, it’s a rigorous climb
Raised on Canarsie block, stuck in this system of crime
We all goons be the first to put the fist in your eye
A loyal dude, be the one to say the pistol is mine
I used to put PCP in the spliff and get high
Let’s fly like Michael Jordan 1985
That’s the Ill Bill mind frame, mind state, I’m great
Take it back like The Future is Now on live tape

Asked him who the best rapper is
Removed the gag, said it’s Ill Bill

Triumphant, worn by the sounds of trumpets
My crew abundant, surrounds the villa ground’s circumference
The crowd I run with hit you with a thousand punches
Piles and bunches, you can’t avoid it crouch and lunging
You’re found when running, bloodhounds is hunting
Hundreds and hundreds of hints that head to the house you hung in
My power’ll punish, you cowards succumb in less than an hour
And you can’t control your bowels’ functions
You all earn your own right in the booth
Solo you whack so just spend your life in a group
You shouldn’t write to the loops and make the loop
From the rope, put your head through it
On your throat and tighten the noose
My mic is a license to shoot, snipe you from the height of the roof
Precise, could hit a pigeon in flight from the coop
My motorcycle bikers in route, disrupt the neighbourhood with tattoos
Leather jackets and spikes on their boots, you didn’t know?

Yeah, buckle up, I’m a turbulent rapper
Rap married me, performed my own sermon in the chapel
Yeah, I’m certain that you rapping soft is the result of many factors
You lack afterthought, get your face caught on a cactus (Ouch!)
You ought to be an actress, you’re bad practice
I’ll backslap you in the face until you rap backwards
I spit classic verses, the cuts that are mine will damage you
Worse than Kanye’s mom’s plastic surgeon
You’ll get a lesson from listening, look what happened
Young rappers turn the beat off and write to my rapping for practice
You lack vision, something is sweet
You’ll dream of how I write hooks when I punch you to sleep
Stop me? Shit, I’m Rocky Balboa
I’m like a boa constrictor choking the raps out of your throat like ?
You know you’ll never figure out my hooks are grimy
That’s like trying to figure out why poison ivy is so conniving

Fuck you shackles, I'm free
Thank You LSD and mushroom fragments in tea
Watching Yellow Submarine and laughing at Blue Meanies
The true meaning
Open the door and walk through the ceiling
The matrix is gone, I view clearly
Realizing society is brainwashed is a brutal feeling
Finally see who's really the truth and who's the demon
Who's still sleeping in the womb dreaming? Who's scheming?
Who's smoking angel dust with Rick and Russell?
Who's equipped to hustle?
Who's the one that always thinks first and who's the muscle?
Who's the bible burner?
Did that guy that wrote Fight Club realize that 'Tyler Durden' rhymes with 'violent murder'?

Rethink my strategy
Rethink reality
Rethink sanity"

My heavenly soul control the deadliest chrome
But the life of a child is what God has blessed me to mold
This is something I put before everything, every thought
Every bit of energy is focused on her every need
I don't give a fuck how gangster you think you are
When you witness the birth of your first child it hits hard
Speaking for myself I'm still speechless
But I owe it to her to put this into words
In case I'm not here when she peeps this
God forbid, I plan to be here 'til a hundred and five

Or at the very least, it could be & it should be

Guerilla warfare black market tactics
Biblical secret scrolls hidden in the federal building
Uncover the mystery with meddling children

Devilish villains, a violation, entire nations rise, tides are changing
Annihilation of the sky when my mind is racing
I place a cruise of calm in the white station
Vibrations through my arm when the nine's blazing

It’s mine's for the taking, I point the snub nose
Pull out the bamboo, homie, and get your drugs rolled
The bundle of dimes hit the corner with the stash
I’m in front of the line like the shortest in the class

Get the torture goons with caps, crews attack with the Uzi clap
Swiss-cheese you up, make you do a foolish dance
My nine will make you lambada, my pistol make you do the limbo
My Mac-11 make you do the windmill

It’s simple, I’m with Slippin’ Jimmy scheming on the cash

Beheading consumers with the president’s authorization
Sleeper cells kept in a basement deep as hell
Trigger the hammer, smack the primer and heat the shell

The same goons, drinking Grey Goose and grape juice
What's really good or bad is relative
Never been beyond neutral
But if you fuck with my family I shoot you, I'm too crude
My poverty got me bugging committing armed robberies
Voted the most likely to probably die violently
Who the fuck are you, stupid?
I carry two clips
One to murder you, the other to shoot pigs
I'm like Miami Beach on new years eve
Blondie singing Rush Rush, give me yayo hanging with the Gipsy Kings
I spit these things
Major businessmen spitting flem
Kicking these raps and kick you in the face with Tims
Foot up on your desk
Four thousand square-foot office supplies
Fought to survive, torture your mind
Car-chase, two cop cars collide
On the Belt Parkway I'm rhymin' for the cop killin' to dive
Nothing's sacred anymore, take your last breath
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death - I'm obsessed
If superheroes were real, they'd be evil

Dance with the Grim Reaper, leading up with the street sweeper
Then fuck her with the broomstick until she bleeds ether
Feast on the heart of Goliath, heart of a lion
Part of a dying martyr brigade conquering tyrant
Gave birth to your death - I’m the father of violence
The Alpha, the Omega, the palm of Osiris, palm of Ramirez
My concert appearance is like a cross between Manson and Osama with lyrics
This is hardcore hip hop, homie
You just escaped from the Matrix if you’re hearing this song

The pain caused by a world by a business of death
Blowjob from your mother and wife at the same time
Sit back, recline with my cocaine rhymes
Heroin beats, let the rhythm hit him, terrible heat
Relentlessly, effortlessly hit them
Street villainess, we the chosen of man now get in the van
I get it cookin' like meth in a pan
Tie your arm up with a belt and inject in a scab
Round trip to the drug spot set in a cab
Rolling Stone concert flicks, thousand dollar chips
Model chicks with Katana tits and hypnotic hips
Get sprayed at your table at the Babylon club
Left dazed, mangled, disabled, and splattered in blood

Me and Bill are both martyrs
Flows so similar to Harvard books inside libraries
One step beyond smarter
Cajun hot, we throw it up like a half-court lob
Into the quarter when the shot clock does 'em
So sick, fuck around, become a victim
Don't blame me, young cats put themselves in this position
You're facing a dilemma
There's no telling when you might end up face off with a nutcase and a sinner
Embrace this and parish, face that shows terror
No punches or edits, I rival up the devil
I walk past everything falls dead
Verbally spreading my medula
Ho store speech released unchained mechanics
In the form of bar with the music
Join us and permantly sleep cause your appointment
Two guns, me, O.C and bill, we're double-jointed

(Verse 3: Jeru The Damaja)
The rhyme alchemist, hip hop scientist
Mix bonds in a lab like an Al Quada terrorist
My shit narcotic from start to finish
I knock out so many teeth I get kick backs from dentists
I feed MC's to the vultures, man
While their chicks' asses up in the air like Chin Chan
Wanna test this? Have a good medical plan
Cause I bash you in the dome like Captain Caveman
And this dope's a billion bucks a gram
I wipe the blood off my mic and fuck a female fan
You never thought you'd see me, Bill, and O on a track
So dope the DEA thought it was crack
When it comes to rockin a mic I do works
So many exotic feats they call me Captain Kurk
Shit-faced like the jerk
My shit's a street sweeper, your shit just squirt

My mind consume the doom as I walk through the school
15 people killed and over 14 wounded
My name is Eric Harris, I was forever harassed, an outcast
You fuck with us and now me and Dylan is pulling out gats
I've been wantin to murder people
Suicide is played out, if you gonna die, take people with you
We've been planning this before the kids from Jonesboro did it
And I wanted the world to know when people died why we did it
I even killed myself but don't feel sorry for me
Feel sorry for your seads as we spread the diesease
Another bloodbath coming soon to a school near you
Smalltown killing-spree that's organized by the youth
Fuck the media, them fags be disguising the truth
Dragging my name through the mud when televizing the news
A bunch of ticking timebombs y'all, is more like me
Overflowin with hate, bullied to get raw like me
They constantly get picked on and shitted on like me
You'd probably get your head blown off by a kid like me
I put my mind to it and what I accomplish's frightening
The right thing, no matter what you idiots might think
Check it, I did that shit so idiots might think
This ain't a game, the nerds that you be fuckin with might flip

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It's like this, what's more fun than slice wrist?
Kill that teacher that you hate, spray 25 kids
You'd be famous just like me if you did what I did
This is the anatomy of a school shooting

[Verse 2]
I see dead people, it isn't my fault that they were evil
Fuck a favorite I hate everybody equal
Bitch I warned y'all, didn't I?
Now everybody want to talk shit and cry asking why
- Two geeks picked up guns and turned murderous
All of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live
Two nerdy kids is that a crime?
why I've gotta be one of the cool kids just to walk by
- without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked
Insulting me for no reason, I was treated like shit
The teachers let it happen
I've even seen some of them teachers laughing
That's why I had a smile on my face when I started blastin
I wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick
I was the nicest person in the world - y'all were dicks
Don't even try to analyze me now you have no chance, back then

Sounds of a dirty syringe, heroin gon’ swim
Polluting the souls of the project kids
Born to drug fiends, growin’ up to jail bids
Broken dreams and promises fuel gang violence and
Pigs always show up when the guns is done firing
Another family crying, another funeral
Another retaliation, another burial
And that cycle gonna continue until you see the God in you
Kings and queens of the earth with a lethal virtue
Crack rocks shape the block like an earthquake do
Drive-bys in the hood with the plates removed
Bandanna gun handle for the flag you choose
Putting they conscience to sleep when them hammers is used
Penetrate the penitentiary swallowing balloons
Poison the prison system crushed glass in your food

Deep freeze like 40 below booze (?)

Same blood thirst, same ignorance
Same motivation when the gun bursts

Downhill shootout with Bill, they out for vengeance
Those two brothers
The same two motherfuckers I mentioned In Swordfish
Yeah, Isaac and Ish
Ishmael is shit backwards and Isaac's a bitch
I'mma kill 'em both and still be left with five in the clip
These people invented and injected they mind with a chip
They shot and missed almost skiing off the side of the cliff
You know I shot back, Isaac was hit
A bullet ricochet off of his hip
Hit his brother Ish in the lip
An avalanche final finished they trip
Afterwards I had a ski buddy sucking me off up in the lift
Fucking me off up in the whip, dusting the dips
See me arriving by the hollow tunnel puffing a spliff
Put a hollow tip shell in my shit
Mind full of evil thoughts and my enemy's bitch

I laugh and spit in the face of death, load 'em with lead
Go to the sunset on a black horse, holding his head
Destroyed an army closing in, it reminded me of that time in Brazil
When my government assigned me with a license to kill
Fresh out of CIA torture school
Taught me the most effective ways
To make prisoner of war talk to you
From Europe to South America, bloodbaths, kidnappings
Sounds hysterical, orgies in a mansion
Where the Cult Leader drained warheads
For antidotes to viruses
Corporate alliances, we buying shit
Finance security, first-world terrorism
Combined it with religion

Give me a Ferrari and box full of money

Kill 'em with success and bury them with a glad face
Meet 'em with a smile tell 'em what you really think
Then beat 'em with a brick then feed 'em to the pigs
Throw 'em to the roaches feed 'em to the spiders and snakes
Lies and fakes personify violence and hate
But I'm smarter now I realize that drama is lame
And I own my mistakes though my karma is pain
And that’s just the way of the world but what part of the game said I gotta stay the same way I was yesterday

Billy Idol put the nine to your ear
The all-time grimiest, I'm the nuclear truth
I let black market plutonium loose in the booth
My beats kick you dead in your face, loosen your tooth
I'll be creeping up on you like a deuce-deuce in a boot
Trust nobody, homeboys will change on you
Stab you in the back, pull the twelve gauge on you
I've been involved in epic battles and holy wars
No remorse, quiet money, private benjamins like Goldie Hawn
Most religions sleep underneath a soldier's corpse
Chopped them in half, used them a source of warmth
Seven eyes, seven horns, secret wars
Jesus walks across troubled water bleeding from his palms
His feet, eyes, ears, nose, his crown, his mouth
Eventually stopped talking when they cut his tongue out

[Hook 2x]
Trust nobody, no way, no how, never
Trust nobody, no shit, homie, don't you ever
Trust nobody, no way, no how, never
Trust nobody, trust nobody

[Ill Bill]
The person you least expected to cut your throat
Will be the first creep directing a gun at your dome
I've seen brother kill brother for the love of the dollar
They turned snakes on each other like my mother and father
I beat everything, every angle, every agenda
Many pretenders attempt to enter my presence
And test the intelligence level
Remove the head of the devil, I don't even trust God
I think I'm going to hell
It's a cold world, I don't trust religion
I don't trust the police nor the justice system
I don't like doctors, lawyers, or politicians
I don't like liars it was deception that ruined Non Phixion
I pray for peace but always stay prepared for war
Destroy you if you push me up against the wall
I seen it all, everyone of y'all love to conduct schemes
Trust nobody, homie, don't even trust me

Ill Bill,Truth,/i/ill+bill/truth_21529903.html,"[Verse 1]
Ayo, I seen it all
From what the truth should be, to what the truth is
As we evolve from what we used to be onto some new shit
Rewrite the blueprint, with true grit
Students of moving bricks and full clips
Or otherwise we just threw fists
Been breaking bad, ever since before I became a dad, or made in in rap
In truth, I still cater to that
Root for the villain getting paid in full
Spraying the gat on the roof of my building
Getting brain, taking it back
I was that projects professor
A white kid digesting Five Percenter lessons
I copped from the brother selling incense
Extensively, studied Rakim and all the emcees
Eventually discovered I spit rather intensely
Now here I am, speaking to everybody that be listening
The hardcore hiphop with heart, like nitroglycerin
The type of rap you feel in your cardiac
That grimy, illmatical boom bap - mathematical goon rap

[Hook]
Check one-two, one-two

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I rise and laugh at the lies, analyzing the science of things
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
The path of the divine crash into gunfire and brimstone
Adapt to survive - the spilled blood dries when the wind blows
Look to the past, see your future staring back at you
Holdin' a gat, holdin' you back
And bearing ample fruit and opportunity
Get in where the fuck you fit in with unity
We stand tall - what the fuck could you do to the assault literary?
Slaughtercult military - Necronomicon Don
Occult visionary
Conspiracy host behold secret mystery scrolls
Seen black satanic lesbian titties explode
Fuck livin' on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Rise in the street, fistfights with riot police
These lines I wrote potent like lines of coke
A kaleidoscope of the violent prone
That's just me on the beat by Pete Rock n roll

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The excellence and inspiration of truth, is the pursuit
It's like an exercise for the mind
Like a nine when it shoots
Testify with lies implied beside a mountain of proof
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, many have died for the fruit
Organic and natural, harvested from off the vine
Of verified indisputable factual and actual
The only sure thing in life is death, shooters and bricks
Coca pure, sniff white, respect Lucifer's gift
Death is only the beginning, heads exploding and spinning
Like The Exorcist possession
Unholy and grinning
Tell 'em Welcome to hell, enter the ceremony of winning
Where I'm from sharks fly and the vultures are swimming
The truth is gang raped while the world watches it horrorified
Compulsively taped with flip cams then watch it tomorrow high
Shoot it like Columbine
Edit it and upload, then YouTube it online for derelicts and cutthroats"

Tom, Jeff, Kerry, and Dave
1981 before they hooked up with Metal Blade they played
Maiden and Priest covers
Brian’s label put ‘em on Metal Massacre 3 released July, 1983
No recording budget, Tom and Kerry’s dad had to pay
For the studio time and Show No Mercy was made
Burst on the scene in 1984
Slayer began their first national club tour
And the facts is they travelled in Tom’s Camaro
In August of ‘84 released Haunting the Chapel
After getting kicked out of Metallica
Dave Mustaine hollered at Kerry King to play in his new thing
Lasted five shows, never went any further
Next exodus, Slayer and Venom, Heavy Murder
Ultimate Revenge Combat Tour, Studio 54
Tom pissed on Cronos’ head, it was raw
Hell Awaits was the next anthem
And Metal Forces said that Slayer made 1985’s best album
Met Rick Ruben at Def Jam, strike a deal
Same year Rick produced Raising Hell and License to Ill
He produced the greatest thrash metal record of all time
Reign In Blood still sends shivers up your spine
Their first gold album, South of Heaven gold too
Their whole career, so influential and so true
Aged 15 I was so mesmerized
Had every word from Angel of Death memorized
Mad respect Larry Carroll album covers in Spiked Wrist
They won their first Grammy February, ‘07 like this

Destory you like cancer of the brain
I can't be stopped
I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you wanna turn the other way
Stick yo fuckin head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
You define trash, I personify perfection
High beemin on the highway driving benzes
Crime scene lookin like a homicide convention
You walk around with a dick in ya mouth
Don't ever let the kid joe take a shit in ya house
Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to there husbands
At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
Nobodys fault, it's all good as long as nobodys caught
Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
Wont stop till I put uncle howie in forbes
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
Major label deals I've been fucked around
Spent years money dangling in front of my face
Instead of blowin the spot, bill was runnin the place
Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
Sold drugs studio time my gun in ya face
Look at me now, Non-Phixion running the game
Kings of the underground and we loving it man
Yea I'll punch you in your face when I'm out on tour
When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
Till they spitten they own teeth out the side of they mouth
Even the bouncers was scared of us, Callin for peace
While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, it's easy to tell
Fuck wit me, Ima see you in hell
The un-fuck-wit-able, achieve the impossible
Cause there ain't no stoppen the unstoppable
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
I found your lack of faith disturbing, now my aquisitions are merging
Streets are your, executions are murders, these goons will worship
Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and s**
Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the bussiness plan
Listen man, I'm old fashioned
Fuck taking over an answer, kidnapp the family and hold em for ransom
We gettin dough yawll, it's the jump off
Eather you get with us or fuck off
An unstoppable fource on a rough course
Big success, fuck with me you fuckin wit the best
Fuck whos on top, cause I'm a lot hungrier than them

I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died you probably vision me shot up
And laying on the stretcher
Cause I ain't the nigga that die from high blood pressure
My demise in the midst of a crime go fresher
Look at his eyes he's ready to die, Lord bless him
It is what it’s gonna be, ain't much that worry me
Can’t care whether is 20 of us or one of me
Gun boys ride with us, niggas still get yapped
Pistol whiped on all monitors, you know what time it is
Low nigga run up, squeeze a couple shots in your shirt
Touch your best out to see if it work (Brang! Brang!)
My niggas get high, get drunk, go ape
Whoop you out for about 20 minutes straight then we rotate
Straight put the beats on em, no brakes
Since way back in the days, nigga's name hold weight
And we still active, still mashin'
Still inspiring, still shining, still firing

[Hook: Lil' Fame]
Violence is a universal language
Nah nigga you done pick the wrong nigga to bang with
(Brang-brang!) We murder ya
BK nigga get down, the dirtiest, we bang
We give 'em the whole thang!

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You probably picture a hollow bursting out of a nine
And splattered me when it popped, jerked me out of my prime
My fam'll be mad of God, cursing out of the sky
If violence begets violence and death rules everything around me
Dreams are really nightmares, in King’s County
And even though my daughter was born here
Slaughter and war go on here
You'll get your fucking wig blown off here
Let's put the mirror to the violence, an electrify spirit
That defines visionary riots, military science, dignitary silence
Ambassadors are assassinated
From the war-room to the block assassinations are created
Murders are premeditated and orchestrated by a symphony conductor
Sort of when sawed-offs are spraying
The rhythm of the gun shots is like a song is playing
Speaking in the same tongue to God like to talk to Satan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shabazz The Disciple]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You’d probably picture me slumped over the wheel in my ride
Drugs planted in the trunk, being accused of a crime
Orchestrated by COINTELPRO the FBI
? all on the dashboard, cause my spirits to fly
Wanna see me scalpel ride?? filled with formaldehyde
Police the modern day romans, stolen profits with nines
Like the prophets in black, leaders of what they prophesized
Hood Christ crucified, two G’s on my side
My peter’s heater a sly, cause my Judas demise
I pray I look my angel of death right in his eyes
You coming with me motherfucker, finish this beef in the sky
These last earth memories, the sight was frightening
Hear thunder when the hood Christ, striked the lightning
Ain’t no fuckin hail Mary’s, is hail of slugs
Brain dead on your deathbed, family pull the plug

Oh I'm in love with the drugs, I'm in love with the women
I've got ""Drugs, Money, Sex."" tattooed on my arm and I take it from coast to coast

Yeah, this time is really rainin' on me, I've got no cover
The only one who thinks I'm handsome is my own mother
The street game is a bitch and I don't love her
When you dope they jones so I keep my poems gutter
I speak clearly into mics and I don't stutter
These other clowns talk loud and they won't shut up
I have declared war therefore from here on
There ain't no army that can attack that I ain't prepared for
I am in rare form, scarin' the norm
All night long 'til I disappear in the dawn
In between heaven and hell, my spirit is torn
Between the Virgin Mary and fly hookers wearing a thong
I'm on so many drugs that my eyes are blurry
But they still can't hide or disguise my fury
He who lives life slow will die in a hurry
Live by the gun, you fire in a violent flurry

(Chorus)

We're livin' in a violent time and my eyes designed for crime
We kill for a nickel or dime and there ain't no way you can vic me for mine cause I'm
Livin' in a violent time and my eyes designed for crime
We kill for a nickel or dime and there ain't no way you can vic me for mine

(Verse 2: Sick Jacken)

Well underground like the freedom movement
See our car in the street, salute it
These are bars from the psycho unit
We stay strong despite the lack of union
Cops throw us in the jail like the camps in Munich
Exiled in the palace of the most polluted
Fallen stars from ghetto spars and block shootings
Another soldier taken away to stop you and us from improving
It almost seems change is just an illusion
I'm losing my life before my pride
I'm a student of the revolution
Put me in a noose if I'm a nuisance
Give me a truce or get strong abuse from troops
That wanna break loose from the force you're using
We're rebelling in the form of music
Speak truth and I hope you use it
It's a sore world how Bush views it
We gotta take the power back and get through this
If not, there's no future for our kids, get to it

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Ill Bill)

It was the first robbery of 2006
Banana clips, a couple cops got shot
Listen to the sound of the police when the bullet rips through his knot
You hear nothing, just another tear drop in the plot
Another kid gets killed by a stray bullet
Another grandmother cries in the pulpit
It's bullshit, we need more justice of the people
Yet we sell drugs even though we know it's evil
It's a way lot more complicated than that
And that's why half the projects gravitated to crack
Nowdays the hustle game is all fucked up
Have you up state, doing 15 years for nothing
Not guilty were the first ones with good alibies
Cops is pissed, they got the whole hood paralyzed
Fuck all of y'all, prosecutors never can hurt me
Cause I've got big retainers with the best attorneys

Ill Bill,War Is My Destiny,/i/ill+bill/war+is+my+destiny_21529859.html,"[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They killed my entire family
Murdered and tortured, raped and pillaged
I was only five and I was the only surviving witness
My entire village burnt to the ground
He wore a serpent in his crown
Happily committed murder with a frown
In an army of black-hooded fiery-skulled generals
And a sorcerer that could cast spells that’ll change your genitals
Held me in slavery till I turned eighteen
Killed my slave master, five years later became king
And I slain dragons and ate steaks during famine
Had the seeds of war planted in a dirty tavern
Had the seeds of presidents killed in a burst of anger
And had their parents bleed to death on the floor of a dirty bathroom
I watched their palaces burn, I seen the ashes of my comrades
Returned to their family in an urn
While a proud child remembers his father that died
The cycle continues with vengeance alive in his mind

[Hook: Max Cavalera]
Refuse, resist, war is my destiny!
Desire unleashed, war is my destiny!
Chaos, A.D., war is my destiny!
Under a pale grey sky, war is my destiny!

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, yeah, I was an angel before a third of the stars fell
Cast with the sternum from Satan into the pit of hell
Our beloved leader forced to be a bottom-feeder
The great deceiver that promised victory over the monkey lovers
We took a vote to restructure and traitors fell upon him
We ripped his skin off and crowned a new son in the morning
A new president to lead our corporation
The vengeance on God and Heaven’s domination
But I seduced the daughters of man and made the Nephilim
I demanded human sacrifice from the rest of them
I became the spirit that tortured and protected them
And I built them the tower of language that connected them
And then the Lord cried, water falling out from his eyes
And my children died drowning in the tears from the sky
And it was then that Satan crawled back to me with a plan
A design for the ultimate corruption of man
See back then we used to set the chosen ones on fire
You really think God only sent a single messiah?
And so we allowed the birth of many prophets on earth
And since the followers were human they were born with a curse
They began to claim superiority to their brothers
And for eighty-five thousand years conquered each other
And when they prayed before battle they were praying to me
Killing in God’s name cause war is my destiny!

[Hook: Max Cavalera]
Refuse, resist, war is my destiny!
Desire unleashed, war is my destiny!

Pull out the shotty and clap, I'm like a suicidal jihadi attack
Try to react, pull yourself together, keep your body intact
Stuff your own intestines back in your body then shotgun you back
Yeah I chopped you in half, bouncing with a hundred thousand in cash
Top half of your body still talking mountains of trash
Point blank range, one for you the sound of the gats
A murder machine that's constantly evolving with class

Creep with the biscuit, I'm peril when the fiends are vendicted
Lights the American Nightmare - the trees of the wicked

Time's up, caught up in the blowjobs and mindfucks
The metal that killed my enemys, occupy guns
Say goodbye cause you only die once

Sometimes you wanna murder me, sometimes you wanna marry me

As reality slips away I'm startin to loose my grip
No smile is genuine or real
I find myself loosing faith in every thing and every person that I hold dear
I'm in a bad place, so who do I trust?
I don't trust myself, how the fuck I'm gonna trust you?
If I don't love myself how the fuck I'm gonna love you?
I made this album to reveale my inner thoughts and discuss truth
What it's like, me without death
Would you appreciate the sunlight without the darkness?
But I appreciate my grandmother raising me cause she'd never pass away
So many things I never had a chanse to say when she was here
I see you when I get there
I hope that there's a heaven even though I know I'll prolly burn in hell
- I lived it, it couldn't get much worse I guess
Suicidal thoughts, I think that I've become obsessed with death
And I know it's fucked up, but yo I'm trying hard so get the fuck out o'my face
I'll work it out myself, it's my problem, I'll solve it
Picking up the pieces of a life shattered
I never knew my life mattered

I named my daughter after you
So when she smiles it's sorta like you're still here
It's kinda crazy how time flies - 25 years since my grandmom died
But it feels like just yesterday when we was all laughing together
Those happy memories are so vivid, they'll last me forever
And yet you're still here somehow - I still feel your presence
I credit you for my inner strength - I feel it in my essense
In my soul, in my inner being, in my genetics
I wouldn't exist if you hadn't persisted through the trenches
I wouldn't have been a lyricist, I owe you every sentence
Every verse I've ever written - Your energy is kinetic
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die

I named my label after you
So when I rhyme it's sorta like you're still here
It's been a year - Still in shock about exactly what happened to you
Made a song for you called ""My Uncle""
I was just rapping to you, just talking to you
I just saw you at my mother's house
I can't believe I just bought a coffin for you
We always feared that you would die from an overdose
God knows you loved to do drugs, it swallowed you whole
But in the end, drugs didn't kill you, cancer did
Why do good people die young? I don't know what the answer is
All I know is I worshipped you as a scrappy kid
Being around you made me feel cooler than rapping did
& that's pretty fuckin cool, trust me
I was embarrassed when you started smoking crack
Honestly, it crushed me - Swept it under the rug
Started smoking weed & popping acid but managed to not do the uglier drugs
We grew apart after my grandmother died
Homeless, in and outta jail, we stopped relating to each others lives
But years later, we connected once again
Not just as nephew and uncle, but as homies, we were friends

Even God turned his back on you, homie, you're dead
Just a fragment of your former possibilities and aspirations
A casualty in the civil war of a gangster nation
My generals plot the death to millions
The media spread lies and cash checks for trillions
I organize crime - money and murder synchronized beyond time

Gavin Cato got hit when they ran that red light
Over a decade of healing but the scars remain
Both families involved still harbor the pain
Age 13 - 70's baby raised in the 80's
Mad fights with blacks and whites
And both sides hated me for nonsense

In Texas they dream about hunting jews with Borat

[Hook]
Call me white nigga
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigga lover
Because I spit on the mic
Think you got me figured out
You're not listening right
Get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
Call me white nigga
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigga lover
Because I spit on the mic
Think you got me figured out
You're not listening right
Get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype

[Verse 2]
They call me white nigga
Call me every name in the book
I done heard em all
Fuck ya'll - I made it a hook
Made it a song
Exposing the hatred to all
Cos any type of racism is wrong
Had newsmen talking as a kid about Yusef Hawkins
Same age as me when Joey Fama caught him walking through Bensonhurst
A world away from my Glenwood Projects
Racially mixed - combustible - it lead to conflicts
I was never raised prejudice
My grandmother was a holocaust survivor
And my uncle did heroin
My pops wasn't around
My moms kicked him out the house
And broke her back to put food in our mouths
Age 12 - they bussed my projects to the white school
Holes in my sneakers - I never fit in with them rich white dudes
I didn't click up with the blacks kids neither - I bought a Iron Maiden
T-shirt and wrote rhymes in my trapper keeper

[Hook]
Call me white nigga
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigga lover
Because I spit on the mic
Think you got me figured out
You're not listening right
Get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
Call me white nigga
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigga lover
Because I spit on the mic
Think you got me figured out
You're not listening right
Get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype

[Verse 3]
Run-D.M.C. really made me wanna get wreck
Same time Kerry King played guitar for Megadeth
It was 84, 85 - LL Cool J ""rock the bells""
Obliterated my mind - so inspired I created a rhyme
Beastie Boys on U68 - ""she's on it"" made up my mind
Hardcore - the other bright side
I thought Bad Brains was white guys when Melle Mel dropped ""White Lines""
Nazi skinheads showed up at Lamour's in Brooklyn
Got stabbed up by puerto rican skins from Bushwick
Geraldo got his nose broken - Tawana Brawley on Donahue
Central Park wildin had the world scopin
Now VH1 got a show for wiggers
And some claim the jews be the biggest wiggers - we're considered
The most dangerous cause they think we shift our forms
Cast spells & wear beanies to restrict our horns from being seen
Growing out our heads - the killers of christ
These fools wear white sheets and believe that hitler was right
Believe it or not they still exist undercover
And Mel Gibson never liked Danny Glover
Another piece of shit called out in the paper - if we was there
Me and my peoples would have beat the fuckin shit outta Kramer
If this song offends you, you're a hater - take a look within yourself
And figure out what the fuck you're afraid of

[Hook]
Call me white nigga
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigga lover
Because I spit on the mic

""This a world premier""
""Ill Bill""
""Well then you just sit back and listen because I have a story for you.""

[Verse One]:
It was a commercial on the DNA & Hank Love show
If you was there you know about the Little Rascal Studio
In Jamaica Queens, hot to death, dude was a clown
But back then it was prolly the cheapest studio in town
I went from watchin' Video Music Box with Ralph McDaniels
To rockin' 30,000 people surrounded by cameras
First rhyme in '82, first band in '87
First time we played as crew I doubt it was very impressive
But we kept on practicin' and we got better with time
Practice makes everything perfect, I'm in my veteran prime
And it's bigger than hip hop or being clever with rhymes
Cause I actually feed my seed with these endeavors of mine
And it's taken me around the world several times, it's crazy
It’s crazy what hard work & being focused can achieve, it’s amazing
My uncle's favorite group was Gang Starr, I wish he was here
Rest in peace to Howie and Guru, but salute to Premier
This is The Grimy Awards
When it's time to record
I attack the beat breaks like a viking with his sword
So throw your motherfuckin' hands up in the air
Like you don't care and make some noise for DJ Premier

[Hook]:
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
""It's Ill Bill""
""Is a world premier""
""World""
""Premier""
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
""It's Ill Bill""
""Is a world premier""
""World""
""Premier""

[Verse Two]:
I remember dreamin' about workin' with Extra P and Pete Rock
Put my mind to it and now they blessin' me with heat rocks
Same thing with Muggs, same thing with Primo and The Beatnuts
My dream team injected in your bloodstream you bleed drugs
Done four with Preme but this one's gots to be my favorite
Been a fan before Mass Appeal or Daily Operation
Since before they dropped Just To Get A Rep
I've been a fan of Gang Starr ever since Words I Manifest
And what's my favorite Primo joint of all time?
It's either Kick In The Door or New York State Of Mind
Or Ten Crack Commandments or Take It Personal
Too many bangers to choose from, he's too versatile
The Future Is Now joint, Rock Stars, unforgettable
The way he flipped Above The Clouds on the hook was incredible
Society Is Brainwashed, Mind Ya Business
This is a World Premier, and I designed the lyrics
This is The Grimy Awards
When it's time to record
I attack the beat breaks like a viking with his sword
So throw your motherfuckin' hands up in the air
Like you ain't care and make some noise for DJ Premier

[Hook]:
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
""It's Ill Bill""
""Is a world premier""
""World""

Say Premo!

Ill Bill,X And Bill,/i/ill+bill/x+and+bill_21529877.html,"[Verse 1] Ill Bill

One percenters and five percenters
Album outlines the center
Rapping knives and the Berettas, the lies and vendettas
Trials of menace to society is brainwashed
Brain drops, nervous rooks cops with itchy trigger fingers spraying Glocks
And frustrated rappers sometimes swear
Waving Mac 11s you either buy my CD or die in the streets
Sometimes I feel like I was born on Doomsday
Then I think about my daughter
And the future and pray that these moods change
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
Get on your knees, I brought a guillotine to put your heads
Essential, the essence, always carry a deadly presence
Destined to be revolutionary with every sentence
I been the one to pull the card on frauds
Put them in their place, drop the bomb and start the war
The fuck you think we brought these rocket launchers for?
Not to brag about the way we pop Techs
Ill Bill, Sadat X, who got ?

[Hook]

A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues

A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues

[Verse 2] Sadat x

The backbone sets the overall tone
We soldiers, dude, and ain’t even standin’ straight up or weightless
Listen, I ain’t gon’ debate this
How you win the case when your shit is all over the place?
Who’s your co-signer? It must’ve been a minor
Bill is ill, ain’t no feelings heartbeat
Dudes left the Apple while we stay in the heat
Cause we love to compete, that’s what gladiators do
They say they love blood, dirty sick but
Vietnam tactics, spikes in the mics
In the States turnpikes is reduced
? after nine hours for the cake can make me stay awake
I’m not concerned with who earn
I need my stacks to blow
When I be hearing some of these records
I don’t really know these dudes, I’m not a fad thief
And I’m original pattern, one of one
After the needle line is done, the educated sniff a dollar
The rest still suck from the breast and keep nursing
Don’t be that person (never that)

이상하게도 요즘엔 그냥 쉬운 게 좋아
하긴 그래도 여전히 코린 음악은 좋더라
Hot Pink보다 진한 보라색을 더 좋아해
또 뭐더라 단추 있는 pajamas, lipstick
좀 짓궂은 장난들

[Chorus 1: IU]
I like it, I'm twenty five
날 좋아하는 거 알아
I got this, I'm truly fine
이제 조금 알 것 같아 날

[Verse 2: IU]
긴 머리보다 반듯이 자른 단발이 좋아
하긴 그래도 좋은 날 부를 땐 참 예뻤더라
왜 그럴까 조금 촌스러운 걸 좋아해
그림보다 빼곡히 채운 palette, 일기, 잠들었던 시간들

[Chorus 2: IU]
I like it, I'm twenty five
날 미워하는 거 알아
I got this, I'm truly fine
이제 조금 알 것 같아 날

[Verse 3: G-Dragon]
어려서 모든 게 어려워 잔소리에 매 서러워
꾸중만 듣던 철부지 애
겨우 스무고개 넘어
기쁨도 잠시 어머 아프니까 웬 청춘이래
지은아 오빠는 말이야 지금 막 서른인데
나는 절대로 아니야 근데 막 어른이 돼
아직도 한참 멀었는데
너보다 다섯 살 밖에 안 먹었는데
스물 위, 서른 아래 고맘때 right there
애도 어른도 아닌 나이 때 그저 나일 때
가장 찬란하게 빛이 나
어둠이 드리워질 때도 겁내지 마
너무 아름다워서 꽃잎 활짝 펴서
언제나 사랑받는 아이 you
Palette, 일기, 잠들었던 시간들

[Chorus 1: IU]
I like it, I'm twenty five
날 좋아하는 거 알아
I got this, I'm truly fine
이제 조금 알 것 같아 날

I like it, I'm twenty five
날 미워하는 거 알아
I got this, I truly found
이제 조금 알 것 같아 날"

So are you happy now?
Finally happy now, are you?
뭐 그대로야 난
다 잃어버린 것 같아

이대로는 무엇도 사랑하고 싶지 않아
다 해질 대로 해져버린

작별은 마치 재난문자 같지
그리움과 같이 맞이하는 아침
서로가 이 영겁을 지나
꼭 이 섬에서 다시 만나

[Pre-Chorus: IU]
지나듯 날 위로하던 누구의 말대로 고작
한 뼘짜리 추억을 잊는 게 참 쉽지 않아
시간이 지나도 여전히
날 붙드는 그곳에

A small one that we made with each other

A farewell is like a disaster cast
A morning greeted along with yearning
Let us both pass this eternity
Surely meet once more on this island

Like what someone said as they were consoling me, passing
It isn't that easy to forget a memory merely big as a handspan
Even as time goes by, still
At that place which takes hold of me

Under an orange sun
We dance with no shadows
There is no such thing as decided goodbyes
Meet me in that memory that was once beautiful

Share stories that aren't of sorrow
There is no such thing as gloomy endings
I will forever meet you in this memory

Singing sweetly through the night,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their brave delight.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why these songs of happy cheer?
What great brightness did you see?
What glad tiding did you hear?
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the new-born King.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

See him in a manger laid
Whom the angels praise above;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While we raise our hearts in love.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo."
Ivor Bigun,I'm A Wanker,/i/ivor+bigun/im+a+wanker_20623380.html,"My mother said
That I never should
Never play with the naughty rude girls in the wood
Their giggling talk I could never understood
And that's why I fell in love with my right hand

[Chorus:]
And that's why
I'm a wanker
I'm a wanker
And does it good like it bloody well should
I'm a wanker
I'm a wanker
And I'm always pulling my pudd

I was 25 years old
Before I was kissed
And then I found the guy prefered
A swift one off the wrist
Its cheap and convenient
And you can't catch vd
Its avalible at anytime and its absolutly free

[Chorus:]
And that's why
I'm a wanker
I'm a wanker
And it does me good like it bloody well should
I'm wanker
I'm a wanker
And I'm always pulling my pudd

Oh Mrs Palm
And your 5 lovely daughters
Thank you for having me
And being oh so kind
I've got pains in my arms
And my donkeys growing shorter
My knees have turnt to water
And I think I'm going blind

I've wanked over Italy
I've wanked over Spain
I've wanked in an omibus
I've even had a wank in a train

I've used a badger
And a lemon
And a cat
A inflatable Linda Lovelace
And a David Crocket hat

[Chorus:]
And that's why
I'm a wanker
I'm a wanker
And it does me good like it bloody well should

Ivor Bigun,I've Farted,/i/ivor+bigun/ive+farted_21079917.html,"My mother had the vicar and the vicar's wife to tea
They cleared the room, they blamed it on the dog
But it was me.

[Chorus:]
I've farted, I've farted,
I've made a trouser cough,
I've whistled in my Y-fronts,
I've just peeled one off.
I've blown my bowel bugle (Alt: I've blown my bloody brains out),
I've been eating peas,
I've broken wind,
I've dropped my guts,
Open the window please

I've been eating cabbages, prunes and pears and beans,
Drinking Dandelion & Burdock, and you know what that means!
Polluting the environment, my friends leave me alone,
The front of me sings tenor and the rest sings baritone...

(Repeat Chorus)

[Interlude:]
Bubbles in the bath! (echo: Bubbles in the bath!)
Real rip snorters! (echo: Real rip snorters!)
Up on one cheek and hope it don't make a noise.
Window rattlers! (echo: Window rattlers!)
Cushion creepers! (echo: Cushion creepers!)
Don't shake your leg and keep it in your courduroys.

A gentleman tells before it smells, he waves his jacket 'til it's gone;
But I'm the kind of sneaky bugger, who lets off and doesn't let on!
I let them go in lifts, in queues, in phone-boxes and trains,
And when they stink, the people blink and blame it on the drains.

(Repeat Chorus)

(Spoken ending)
I say, have you farted?
Of course I have - d'you think I always smell like this?"
Spitting Image,I've Never Met A Nice South African,/i/spitting+image/ive+never+met+a+nice+south+african_21101177.html,"I've travelled this old world of ours from Barnsley to Peru,
I've had sunshine in the arctic and a swim in Tinbuktu,
I've seen unicorns in Burma and a Yetti in Nepal,
And I've danced with ten foot pygmies in a Montezuma hall,
I've met the King of China and a working Yorkshire miner -
But I've never met a nice South African!

No he's never met a nice South African,
And that's not bloody surprising man!
'Cause we're a bunch of arrogant b***tards,
Who hate black people!

I once got served in Woolies aften less than four week's wait,
I had lunch with Rowan Atkinson when he paid and wasn't late,
I know a public swimming bath where they don't piss in the pool,
I know a guy who got a job straight after leaving school,
I've met a normal merman, and a fairly modest German -
But I've never met a nice South African!

No he's never met a nice South African,
And that's not bloody surprising man!
'Cause we're a bunch of talentless murderers,
Who smell like baboons.

I've had a close encounter of the twenty-second kind,
That's when an alien spaceship disappears up your behind,
I got directory enquiries after less than forty rings,
I've even heard a decent song by Paul McCartney's Wings,
I've seen a flying pig, in a quite convincing wig,
But I've never met a nice South African!

No he's never met a nice South African,
And that's not bloody surprising man!
'Cause we're a bunch of ignorant loudmouths,
With no sense of humour.

I've met the Loch Ness monster and he looks like Fred Astaire,
At the BBC in London he's the chief commissionaire,
I know a place in Glasgow which is rife with daffodillies,
I met a man in Katmandu who claimed to have two willies,
I've had a nice pot noodle, but I've never had a poodle -
And I've never met a nice South African.

No he's never met a nice South African,
And that's not bloody surprising man,
Because we've never met one either!
Except for Breyten Breytenbach, and he's emigrated to Paris. (farts)

Yes he's quite a nice South African,
And he's hardly ever killed anyone,
And he's not smelly at all.
That's why we put him prison!"
Spitting Image,The Chicken Song,/i/spitting+image/the+chicken+song_20165462.html,"Its the time of year
Now that Spring is in the air
When those two wet gits with their girly curly hair
Make another song for moronic holidays
That nauseate-ate-ate
In a million different ways
From the shores of Spain
To the coast of Southern France
No matter where you hide
You just can't escape this dance

Hold a chicken in the air
Stick a deckchair up your nose
Buy a jumbo jet
And then bury all your clothes
Paint your left knee green
Then extract your wisdom teeth
Form a string quartet
And pretend your name is Keith

Skin yourself alive
Learn to speak Arapahoe
Climb inside a dog
And behead an eskimo
Eat a Renault Four with salami in your ears
Casserole your gran
Disembowel yourself with spears

The disco is vibrating
The sound is loud and grating
Its truly nauseating
Let's do the dance again

Hold a chicken in the air
Stick a deckchair up your nose
Yes you'll hear this song in the holiday discos
And there's no escape in the clubs or in the bars
You would hear this song if you holidayed in Mars

Skin yourself alive
Learn to speak Arapahoe
Climb inside a dog
And behead an eskimo
Now you've heard it once
Your brain will spring a leak
And though you hate this song
You'll be humming it for weeks

Hold a chicken in the air
Stick a deckchair up your nose
Buy a jumbo jet
And then bury all your clothes
La la la la la

As I comfort myself with tears

I would’ve thrown away these feelings a long time ago
I’m talking bout you and me

You hold his hand and get far away
You don’t have to draw a line like that
Cause the person you leave behind here gets embarrassed
You don’t have to be so pretty
Making me contemplate inside every night

A wave that crashes over me who is shaking
If love is a sin, you’re my prison
I try deceiving my heart, as if nothing’s wrong
Because of you, everything gets mixed up

Words I want to tell you some day
Hey girl you know i love you so

I can't fight my decision

Now I can see
I have my control
From despair
I'm back again

You tried to deceive
I'll never forget
For now you'll pay and suffer

I cannot reassure
As I have lost my vision
I've fallen to the floor
I can't fight my decision

I know that things could never be the same
I've gone too far and now that I have changed

Does it feel the same for you (Repeat)

But now it's too much
How much longer can I stand

That kept me restrained

iKON,DON'T FORGET (English Translation),/i/ikon/dont+forget+english+translation_21205545.html,"It feels like our time has stopped
Maybe there’s nothing that lasts forever in the world
When time passes, will you
Remember me in vague traces
Don’t forget about me
The scenery of you and me starts to fade and
I wake up from a terribly beautiful dream

If I can’t remember you with your all
Then leave me a piece of you that I can’t forget

Whispering promises and staying up all night
Please remember it all on that day

Don’t foret, don’t forget
Please don’t forget me

Don’t forget us don’t forget me
Everything about me

The saying that you don’t know how something is precious until it’s gone
You really don’t know until you lose it
I thought it would just feel like a big wave
But the whole universe is collapsing
We were young but in honesty we became adults because of each other
We were sloppy but we gave each other everything and honest words
I hope that you remember it all because it’s too pretty to just throw away
I hope that you’re happy because I was happy because of you

The scenery of you and me starts to fade and
I wake up from a terribly beautiful dream

If I can’t remember you with your all
Then leave me a piece of you that I can’t forget

Whispering promises and staying up all night
Please remember it all on that day

Yeah saying goodbye and going back home
We must spend different nights under the same moonlight
I’ll try to get used to it if you’re doing well
It’s a relief, the fantastical days

Don’t foret, don’t forget
Please don’t forget me

Don’t forget us don’t forget me
Everything about me

If I can’t remember you with your all
Then leave me a piece of you that I can’t forget
Whispering promises and staying up all night
Please remember it all on that day"

Realize not to blame myself

I’m writing you a letter that I can’t send
To me, who used to be alone, who used to stumble
Even missing you is romance

Please remember
You are small in this world but
To me, the beautiful you
You’re my everything and my world

Through endless time
There’s a face that I want to see again
Even this radiant loneliness
Must be a gift that you left me
All the times I spent with you
Were all bright like early afternoon
I realize you were the universe
That I was curious about then

I write past memories on a small letter
That can’t be reach no more, no more

Someday, someday
In all the memories
You may slowly be forgotten
We were together and to me, you are

Everything to me you are
Everything everything

When you’re starting to get tired
Please look back at me
Even if it’s vacant
Even if it’s teary
Waiting itself is happiness too

The world is cruel
Everything beautiful is wilting
Even the moonlight may be but
Even the flower petals may be but
I pray that memories are eternal

I hope that you’re happy
As much as I was in pain, with someone like me
It’s too lacking
Don’t be with someone like me
But I hope that the next person
Makes you shine and makes you keep on laughing
After time passes and if you come back
I will be that kind of guy

I write past memories on a small letter
That can’t be reach no more, no more

Someday, someday
In all the memories
You may slowly be forgotten
We were together and to me, you are

Everything to me you are
Everything

That day, you made me live
Good bye

Like a midsummer night’s dream, you
Good bye

That day, you made me live
Good bye

Like a midsummer night’s dream, you
Good bye

Shall I fall in pastures
Will I wake the darkness
Shall we torch the earth

If I wake from dreams
Shall we find the emptiness
That breaks the silence
That shall stop our hearts

If I wake from dreams
Shall we cry together
For the howling echoes
And restart the night

And why did you say
That things shall fall
And fall and fall and fall
And fall apart (2)

If I wake from dreams
For the glory of nothing
For the cracking of the sun
For the crawling down of lies

If we fall from dreams
Shall we push them into darkness
Stare into the howling
And clamber in the night

If we fall from dreams
All my prayers are silenced
To love is to loose
And to loose is to die

And why did you say
That things shall fall
And fall and fall and fall
And fall apart (3)

Love has already left, only attachment remains
We just accepted it and became lukewarm

Interest turned into obsession

We doubt each other like it’s breathing
The castle of trust I built has broken down
Now I’ walking on this goodbye road, looking for someone new

I didn’t meet you to cry together

I didn’t build up memories to get hurt
(It’s being forgotten)
But I’m becoming strangers with someone so easily
When I didn’t love you merely to say goodbye later

Goodbye, leave me on this dangerous goodbye road
And please only walk on flower roads

Take care, as you walk on this lonely goodbye road
Throw away all memories of me

Living in the past
Is such an incompetent loneliness
Being forgetting in those memories
Is such a cruel pain, more than any other moment
I loved you to death but in the end, I didn’t die
I take a deep breath but when I let it out, it becomes a sigh
Everyone goes through break ups so let’s not be sad
I’ll look for a person who resembles you but not

I didn’t meet you to cry together
(Tears are coming)
I didn’t build up memories to get hurt
(It’s being forgotten)
But I’m becoming strangers with someone so easily
When I didn’t love you merely to say goodbye later
(We’re getting used to it)

Goodbye, leave me on this dangerous goodbye road
And please only walk on flower roads

Take care, as you walk on this lonely goodbye road
Throw away all memories of me

(check it out)

Goodbye goodbye
If only I knew we’d say goodbye
I wouldn’t have loved you this much

Goodbye goodbye
If you’re gonna leave anyway
Be happy so I can completely get over you

(check it out)

Goodbye, my dear
Leave me and be happy

(Be happy)

Take care, my heart aching love
Don’t be in pain like you were next to me

(Don’t be in pain)

(check it out)"

iKON,HUG ME (English Translation),/i/ikon/hug+me+english+translation_21205553.html,"Just one time
For 10 seconds
Let me hug you
Were you surprised?
I’m drunk with the night’s emotions
Thinking about stuff and I came here
No need to be nervous, it’s nothing important
Just listen first, I don’t wanna hear anything from you
I know we’re friends and you’re his girlfriend
Tomorrow and the day after that, I know we’ll be friends
But as a friend to a friend, let’s just talk
That’s why I called you at this time, sorry
If a conversation is too much, just listen
I was trying to hold it in but I’m so frustrated
I’m about to get sick
You’re his girl but I love, no I like you a lot

We’ve already come so far
I just quietly waited
Every night, pacing back and forth through the memories
Trying to throw away these feelings

Just one time, for 10 seconds, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won’t have any regret

Just one time, before you go to him, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won’t have any regret

I became like the people I hated the most
My head says no but I want you
As time goes by, these feelings get stronger
I try to hide it but I keep moving to my instincts
When I’m next to you, I’m a friend
When I’m alone, I’m a lover
I tried to get over you so I walked
On the street you and him walk on
But you’re so perfect to me, like a dream
Like playing with water in the summer
You’re a spring rain story to my drought-like life

My heart won’t listen to me
I didn’t know it was this bad
But I still feel so strongly, I’m a bit impatient
Who knows? I’ll keep the door open

We’ve already come so far
I just quietly waited
Every night, pacing back and forth through the memories
Trying to throw away these feelings

Just one time, for 10 seconds, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won’t have any regret

Just one time, before you go to him, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won’t have any regret

This is how your embrace feels, it’s very warm
Maybe it’s because I love you
But you’re so beautiful, you, who I can’t have

This is how your embrace feels, it’s very warm
If a love that can’t ever be can still count as love
Will I feel better?

Just one time, for 10 seconds, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won’t have any regret

Just one time, before you go to him, let me hug you
Just enough so it won’t ruin our friendship
Just enough so I won’t have any regret

This is how your embrace feels, it’s very warm
Maybe it’s because I love you
But you’re so beautiful, you, who I can’t have"

I’m OK
Don't comfort me
You don't have to have pity on me
You don't have to stay with me, I'm fine
I’m OK
Don't worry about me
You don't have to mind about me
I'm used to be alone
I’m OK

[Verse 1: Bobby]
I don't want to hear any hopeful words
I can hardly fall asleep because the reality is to difficult to handle
I tried to find things that can fill me up, which eventually turns out to be drinks
I become indifferent to any situations
Even though I'm better off by myself, loneliness hits me from time to time
Even though I want to do many different things, I become lethargic
My answer will always be a huge smile if anyone asks how I'm doing

[Pre-Chorus: Song, Chanwoo]
I feel like everyone has turned their back on me
I feel bad for myself, I feel so small
When I become lonely
If you ever witness my tears, please walk past by me

Don't comfort me
You don't have to have pity on me

[Verse 2: B.I]
I don't want to hear any hopeful words
Why is everyone making it a big deal when I'm fine?
My breakup was a bit tough, left me with a small scratch
I know it is going to be way better after a day or two
Silence means ""please be happy""
Tears mean ""I truly loved you""
I won't die just because she left me, so please don't look at me as if you're looking at someone who's dying

[Pre-Chorus: June, DK]
Just like when the wind blows, the autumn leaves tremble
And just like when the waves occur, the ocean trembles
I trembled because the love past by me
If you ever witness my tears, please walk past by me

I’m OK
Don't comfort me
You don't have to have pity on me
You don't have to stay with me, I'm fine
I’m OK
Don't worry about me
You don't have to mind about me
I'm used to be alone
I’m OK

[Bridge: Jinhwan]
You've broken every piece of me when you laughed out
As if my sadness didn't mean anything to you
Leave me alone, don't come to me
I don't want to start anything when i know you're going to leave me in the end

[Chorus: June, Jinhwan]
I’m OK
Don't comfort me
You don't have to have pity on me
You don't have to stay with me, I'm fine

Don't worry about me
You don't have to mind about me
I'm used to be alone
I’m OK

You don't know anything
Don't act like you know everything
You say that this is all for me
Well what can I say
I want to be alone
So please leave me alone"

But I was so young back then, your heart was tender
I was immature and I plucked you, a beautiful flower
I was greedy and you wilted in the end
You waited and waited for my honesty
I said I was giving you my honesty
But I didn’t know what honesty was back then
I regret it but let me say this, even that was love

Tears fall when I understand your pain
I call your name when I get smaller in this world
All the times you stood by my side without a word
Finally they touch a part of my heart

I’ll be the bad guy
Because you’re a good woman ye ye
I’ll be the bad guy
Because you’re a good woman

My trashy personality
And my worthless looks, you
Took it all ye ye
I’ve got nothing to say

You’ll come to your senses when I’m not there
When I came to, you weren’t by my side
I snort at your habitual saying and
I take you for granted
At first, we only knew about me
When we became used to the butterflies, we knew of love as attachment
When friendship rather than attachment became more important to me
I wanted us to break up
Even in this song
I talk about you
I hope that you are listening

Tears fall when I understand your pain
I call your name when I get smaller in this world
All the times you stood by my side without a word

Baby please say nothing

He was always the person that shined in your two eyes
It wasn't me
I'll silently send you to him

Be more honest with yourself
He's still in your heart
It's not like you pay attention/try
My heart is unlike my own

It's okay to go to him
I'll only accept that

Don't regret it and just go, just go

I feel bad seeing you who's feelings I messed with
So much that you couldn't tell heads from tails
Don't be sorry to me

Parting is our answer
I don't know how it'll be for you
But every night will be gloomy for me

That I don't even compare
I'm dumping you now

Before I change my mind,
Don't regret it just go, just go

Just go to him again oh to him
Not baby baby baby
It was messed up from the beginning
In the end, I became the fool
I'll hope for the happiness you couldn't have with me

It's okay to go to him
I'll only accept that
Don't worry about me, just go, just go

Before I change my mind,
Don't regret it just go, just go"

There's nothing I can do yet.
A great promise.
I can not think.
Please come to the future in the future

I'll take care of you. I'll protect you.
I'll make you laugh as tears
I'll shine on you I'll be a star
I'll stay with you as long as you wait.

Tired of the day
The way home
When you think of it suddenly
Make a phone call.
We'll get you a good day.

I have only you on my side.
I do not have the confidence to give that world to me.
I can not hold my hands
Even though we are compromised
In the near future

I'll be good. I'll protect you.
I'll make you laugh as tears
I'll shine on you I'll be a star
I'll stay with you as long as you wait.

In this dangerous reality
A person to guard
I have you. I live.
In this endless darkness
A person who has become a light
There will be a smiley day without a thread.

I'll take care of you. I'll protect you.
I'll make you laugh as tears

One sunny afternoon
Put everything down.
Drawing on a lonely day

Tired of the day
The way home
When you think of it suddenly
Make a phone call.
We'll get you a good day."

The thought of seeing you again. It makes me excited

I made a promise to you.

The pain given by god I was getting over it
Brothers that share blood and flesh I was trying to protect
My mind filled with emptiness. I drained it
My dreams getting bigger I had to keep achieving them
Very late
My shattered dreams, It was hard to patch them again
Finally I am where I am now.

Can I rely on the things that mean less to me
Can you deny this hurt you have placed on me
When I try to understand this void that you can't feel
Will you let me take away what I have given you

What is my enemy
So close that I can't see
What is my enemy
You've placed inside of me

What do you hide when you move right back from me
A change of tide when I curse your destiny
If you think I'll understand then stop and think again
Now I've opened up my mind I know that you don't care

What is my enemy
So close that I can't see
What is my enemy
You've placed inside of me

I have learnt again
No trust to depend
No letter will I send
No lies to defend

When you held my hand I forgot with who I really am and
When you called my name I came running to you without shame
I could never understand just what I can't fulfill
And I broke the barriers that kept me standing still

What is my enemy
So close that I can't see
What is my enemy
You've placed inside of me

What is my enemy
So close that I can't see
Love is my enemy
You've placed inside of me"

I wish my thoughts had never died

I focus away from myself
And now I can heal all the doubt
I am the servant for all I can portray

I've misplaced my heart
I'll find it again
Behind my own mask illusion has bled
And now I can stop my shadow of selfishness

I stumble forward and back again
I watch the clouds and leaves descend
Others pass I envy them
As this hour comes to an end

I focus away from myself
And now I can heal all the doubt
I am the servant for all I can portray

I've misplaced my heart
I'll find it again
Behind my own mask illusion has bled
And now I can stop my shadow of selfishness

If I stop at these roads ahead
Sometimes I feel like I am dead
I had to find the strength to carry on
And take me back where I belong

My shadow of selfishness

Let me let me tell you something first
This isn’t a song where I’ll pretend to be strong and act tough
I’m not strong
I’m standing right at rock bottom
So if you’re going to stare
Then lower your eyes first

Watch carefully and see just how far I go
Uh I’m walking on this path alone
A samurai sharpening my blade in the shadows
All you hotshots up there, start getting nervous
I fight to have my way
The town thug uh
L’m rare and precious
I love myself so much uh

My way – If I was supposed to live and die for the charts
I wouldn’t be making music anyways
Those meant for success will make it
And those who weren’t don’t have a chance

Going headfirst to the ground
I hit hard, no modifiers needed
I’m just a gangster, a psycho who’s got no fear
That’s me

I’m a natural, bob your head
You keep reaching for me, getting addicted

What do you know to be judging me like that
I’m just me
And I don’t care much for money
Those golden utensils you speak of?
I use them to spoon up dirt

They tell me to follow the path
My well-off sunbaes have laid out
But I don’t exactly agree
Because from down here,
It doesn’t look all that great up there

Yo in the B-grade life, I’m the head honcho, punk
If this pisses you off, bring it on – this is how I play, punk
Excluding me, all the kids these days need a good spanking
Using English that they don’t even speak
Making a show of saying popular greetings
If you’re asking how I’ve got the balls to wild out like this
It’s my baseless confidence and cockiness, bitch
Fuck me up if you will

I’m a Dotdae, South Korea’s Dotdae
One and only fuckin one and only
I’m a natural, bob your head
You keep reaching for me, getting addicted

I’m a problem child
Try setting me on fire

I’m the one and only, I couldn’t care less
Warning to all: I’m foolish, so I choose to ignore it all

One and only fuckin one and only

Brand new start
Battle of nerves with the audience
Just as always, going with the feel today
Rash and cool, I’m saying peace out
My passion and heat are always hot
I’m still fearless, still an innovator
Easily ignoring the decided path
And going my own way

Everyday I sing of youth
It makes us breathe
It becomes a new beginning

Come on let’s do it again
Shout out louder
Feel the freedom
It’s a new generation
It’s a new day

Yo rest for one beat
Ye rest for two beats

Your cheers and lighting a fire in my blood
Get ready to stay up all night
Before I burn it up with the rhythm
Your bodies move on their own
No alcohol, only carbonated juice yeah
We’re good guys yo
Don’t worry and everyone bounce and move
If you don’t wanna, go home
Are you ready? 1, 2, 3, 4

Every day, watch, i’m gonna do whatever

As my consciousness regains
For a moment I've been saved
From

There is a part
That keeps me away
Am I too close
That now I must stay
There is a part
That keeps me lonely
Am I too close
Too close to turn away

There is this stranger I have become
In touch with the other side
A part of me I'm not coming out
A part of me you did not see

As I awaken from my sleep
As this place holds no retreat
For this vision I shall keep
From

There is a part
That keeps me away
Am I too close

Too close to turn away

Suffer the weak suffer the strong
All I ever felts was so wrong
The choice I've made that's torn us apart

Uncertain we wait the path unknown
The power of hate the power we're shown
And now it's too late for what's been done
Cry for the weak and cry for the strong

I find it hard sometimes to keep my faith alive
This search my destiny will darkness follow me

Awake from the storm we have grown
A shelter of grief a shelter of stone
My trust has betrayed all I know
No choice I've made an endless decay

In sickness I watch all has been thrown
Surrender dictate how can we know
Is it too late for what's been done
Call on the weak and call on the strong

I find it hard sometimes I push my faith aside
The search what can it be now darkness follows me

There must be a way that we have known
Strength for the weak more strength to the strong
No clouds of doubt will cover us all
Don't hide from the truth don't hide from the cold

More certain I wait and all shall be known
The power of faith the power we're shown
It's not too late now it's done
No more are the weak all are the strong

I found it hard sometimes I've kept my faith alive
I found my destiny no darkness follows me

On eagles wings on path
I'm closer every day

A cloud of dust has rained

We met and became a memory that can’t be erased
It was a commendable melodrama
A pretty good ending
That’s all I need
I loved you

The love scenario that we made
Now the lights are off
When you flip the last page
The curtains will quietly fall

I’m not really okay
Going through this break up
Today was our yesterday and now there’s no tomorrow
It hurts but if we dragged it out more, it would’ve become a scar
I loved you and I was loved
So that’s good enough for me

Sometimes, I’ll think of the memories
If you’re in it, that’s good enough for me

We were in love
We met and became a memory that can’t be erased
It was a commendable melodrama
A pretty good ending
That’s all I need
I loved you

The love scenario that we made
Now the lights are off
When you flip the last page
The curtains will quietly fall

The electric feeling in between my ribs
Your eyes that made me know I am loved
I learned so much from you, I filled up my other half
You’re too precious to just leave in the past

Sometimes, I’ll think of the memories
If you’re in it, that’s good enough for me

We were in love
We met and became a memory that can’t be erased
It was a commendable melodrama
A pretty good ending
That’s all I need
I loved you

I already miss you but I’m trying not to
I’ll remember you like a warm spring in a movie

The love scenario that we made
Now the lights are off
When you flip the last page
The curtains will quietly fall

We went through pain
We got jealous too, so funny
We loved like crazy
That’s good enough for us

We were in love
We met
That’s good enough
I loved you"

誰かが今日も泣いているのに
つながることもないまま
生まれては消えた
優しい声をひろいあつめて
さよならの向こうに 陽が昇る
こころをともす あいのうた
生きていくことの悲しみを
ひとりで越えられなくて
誰もが立ち止まる
想いがかさなるその日まで
あなたに言葉を僕は伝えたいよ

青いだけの空がつらいよ
あの日のことがなかったみたいで
まぶたを閉じても もう
何も聴こえない
僕にはそれが切なく思えた
変わりゆくことさえ 受け入れて
こころにきざむ あいのうた
誰かとともに生きることは
信じて傷ついて
またその手を握ること
あなたの頬にこぼれおちた
涙のそのぬくもりを忘れないよ

いつかまたあなたのもとに
ほほえみが戻る日まで
僕はなんども いのちを揺らし
明日を歌うよ
あなたを愛し生きていくよ
こころは ふるえるいまも
ともにそばにあるよ
希望が生まれる 明日がある
あなたに言葉を僕は伝えたいよ"

El mundo he de cambiar
Para ir a un futuro ideal
En donde no reine el mal.
Lo haré con decisión,
Un mundo lleno de esplendor
Es mi ilusión.

Con temor iba mi corazón
Sin poder el futuro esperar,
Sin pensar, ningún aliento
Me podría animar.
Pero un dia te conocí
Y encontré motivo para vivir.
Con tu ternura e ingenuidad
Conocí la verdad
Brotando en mi un anhelo.

El mundo he de cambiar,
Quiero ver que podrá llegar
Un nuevo amanecer,
Pues a tu lado se que mi futuro no es obscuro.
Cambiaré, pues hoy sé que lo lograré,
Junto a mi vas a estar.
Abre tus alas, ven,
Un mundo donde reine el bien
Hay que lograr."

Keep on holding on your desire
You will get that shining love
That you can't wait to know
If you go on to get your goal
It's wonderland!

I felt so worried when I spout all the time
After all, the future's not lost
Because I know that there's nothing that I really want to know.
And that I met you so I could feel
What you should know
I finally find a love
And now I'm really feeling her right
'Cause the matter is gone
This is the way to love you!

I want to change the world!
Walk again, never miss the way
Don't be afraid, I'm with you
And we could fly away
If you could stay with me forever
Change my mind!
Won't get lost if your passion's true
I'm gonna fly with you again
So you could spread your wings
And you could fly with me away
It's wonderland!

Every single thing
The time and the flyin'
Til the day, I won't let you go
You will see that your desire will be granted again
It's just the feeling
You understand the travel life
It won't be to bad to face
And then it probably you will see will not be to heart
If we could walk beside you

I Want To Change The World
Walk again, Fire against the wind
Don't be afraid to be true
Cause now you have to bring
The power of your smile in your face
Change my Mind
Keep on holding on your desire
You will get that shining love
That you can't wait to know
If you go on to get your goal
It's Wonderland!

Every Heart, doestn't know so what to say or what to do

Was afraid of darkness cause I felt that I was left alone
So I prayed for help to distant million stars

And we always seek after love and peace, forever more
Growing, growing, woe baby we can work it out
Look up at the sky, every heart is shining on today

Show me now, what kind of smile do I come across
Every Heart, every heart can take a step towards the dreams
All of us, what to take a lasting happiness
Whenever you feel sad, I wanna hold you and give you a sound sleep

Someday every heart's gonna be free and easy
We have peace of mind
Someday all the people find the way to love

Goes and goes, the time goes on we are not alone
We live on together and we will find some precious things
Sometime we will smile sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believing yourself, tomorrow's never die

There is the warm heart places on my mind
In my earlist day's there and it's so sweet
There are many stars they have talk with me so kind
They say yes always time's a friend of mine, so shine

Round and round, the planets revolve around the sun
And we always seek after love and peace forever more
Growing growing, woe baby we can work it out

InuYasha,Fukai Mori (English Version),/i/inuyasha/fukai+mori+english+version_20623672.html,"I'm sure that the heart I left behind
Still lies hidden in the heart of the deep, deep forest.

Exhausted, without the strength to search
People vanish into the infinite darkness.
Could we still have seen if we were there?
Could we've seen it if it were little?

If it's so small, I wonder if I can see it even now?

* As we live on,
We lose a little bit more.
Shrouded in falsehoods and lies,
We stand frozen to the spot, unable to cry out

The days pass by and change,
Without us even realizing how blue the sky really is.

Overcoming that made-up scheme, we live the present,
And our rusted hearts begin to beat again!

If we can find the rhythm of time, we can fly once again

We live our lives
Wandering to the ends of the earth.
Believing (in you?), now I begin my journey with you,
In search of the light.

* Repeat *

We live our lives
Wandering to the ends of the earth.
Closing off
The way back,
We walk on for eternity.

We live our lives standing frozen to the spot,
Unable to cry out, for eternity..."
InuYasha,Fukai Mori (Full English Version),/i/inuyasha/fukai+mori+full+english+version_20623670.html,"There must still be the soul that you have left behind, hidden somewhere
In the deep deep of the forest lying among the trees
People who are too tired they just don't look around, any farther
They disappear into the eternal darkness of a foreign place

Could we still have seen if we were there?
Could we have seen it if it were little?

Go on with our lives and lose those things behind.
Wrapped around in lies, we stand there voiceless.
We want to leave our lives, until we find a way.
Searching for the light for eternity.

Things are passing and changing and moving around,
But the colors of the sky,
Still remain the same, as we used to know,
Every single day.

We are running so free now, ignoring the risk
The limits that we had.
Leave our fears behind, take another chance.
Our souls will live again.

If we could catch the rhythm of time,
We could probably fly so high.

Go on with our lives, and lose those things behind.
Wrapped around in lies, we stand there voiceless.
We want to leave our lives, until we find a way.
Searching for the light for eternity

That you can't wait to know

I felt so worried when I spout out the time
Thinking of the future it lies
Cause I knew that there's nothin'
That I really want to know
And then I met you
So I could feel what you should know
I finally find a love
And now I'm really feeling her right
Cause the matter is gone
This is the way to love you

I Want To Change The World
Walk again, never miss the way
Don't be afraid I'm with you
And we could fly away
If you could stay with me forever
Change My Mind
Won't get lost if your passion's true
I'm gonna fly with you again
So you could spread your wings
And you will fly with me away
It's Wonderland!

Every single thing
The time and the flyin'
Til the day, I won't let you go
You will see that your desire will be granted again
It's just the feeling
You understand the travel life
It won't be to bad to face
And then it probably you will see will not be to heart
If we could walk beside you

I Want To Change The World
Walk again, Fire against the wind
Don't be afraid to be true
Cause now you have to bring
The power of your smile in your face
Change my Mind
Keep on holding on your desire
You will get that shining love
That you can't wait to know
If you go on to get your goal
