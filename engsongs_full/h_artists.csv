Hambog,Alaala Nalang,/h/hambog/alaala+nalang_20910548.html,"1st Verse:

Hindi ko ginusto ang ilayo ako sayo mahal
Ngunit ito ang desisyon ng tadhana at may kapal
Alam ko din ako'y magtatagal sa lugar na to
Na kung saan wala ka kaya kulang kulang ako
Hindi lang araw hindi lang buwan kundi ilang taon
Tayo ay di magkikita makakaya ko ba yon
Sa tingin ko hinde hindi ko kaya
Dahil ako'y mamamatay kapag wala ka
Wala ka na dito sa aking tabi kaya di na mapigil ang luha
Gusto kitang makapiling mayakap mahalikan yun lang di ko pa makuha
Dahil ilang kilometro at milya ang ating distansya at ating pagitan
Pangungulila ko sa iyo yan ang resulta ng aking biglaang paglisan
Di ito madali para sayo ngunit mas hindi madali to para sakin
At alam kong hindi tayo magkakalapet kahit sa isang libong dalangin
Nadadama ang lungkot at puot hinagpis at ang pagkabigo at pasakit
Ngunit gaano ka man kalayo saking puso palagi ka ditong malapit

CHORUS:

Inisip ko kung bakit ganito ang langit
Nilayo ako sayo
Hindi ko matanggap mahirap magpanggap
Na ako'y hindi bigo
ngunit di ko rin inaasahang mangyayari to
Kung ikaw ay alaala nalang paano na ako

2nd verse:

Binibilang ang mga araw hanggang saking pagalis
Habang palapit ng palapit lalo akong nagtitiis
At tinatago ang namumuong lungkot saking damdamin
Di mo lang alam di ko na kaya di ko lang maamin
Dahil sabi mo sa akin masaya ka para sakin
Di mo lang alam ako'y nalulungkot na para satin
Dahil tayo'y magkakalayo ng walang kalaban laban
Ang masakit pa doon kung kelan pa tayo nagmamahalan
Nagmahalan tayong dalawa ngunit bakit ito naging plano
Ng kapalarang naging malupet ako'y inilayo sayo ng eroplano
Habang ako'y nasa himpapawid ako'y nakatingin sa mga alapaap
At iniisip na sa alaala nalang ba kita muling makakayakap
At sa gabi nakatitig sa mga larawan na katabi ko saking kama
Nakatingin at tinatanong dito na lamang ba tayo magkakasama
Nasa malayo na ang aking katawang tao at parang pinipilas
Dahil puso ko'y naiwan jan sayo sa Pilipinas

CHORUS:

Inisip ko kung bakit ganito ang langit
Nilayo ako sayo
Hindi ko matanggap mahirap magpanggap
Na ako'y hindi bigo
ngunit di ko rin inaasahang mangyayari to
Kung ikaw ay alaala nalang paano na ako

3rd Verse:

Ang pilitin kong limutin na sa buhay ko'y wala sya
Ay parang pilit sinusuot singsing na hindi kasya
Dahil habang pinipilt mas sumasakit ng todo
Kaya buhay ko ay parang musikang wala sa tono
Di ba pwede naman magsama ang nagmamahalan
Di ba pwede naman wala na din ang hiwalayan
Di ba pwede naman sa pagibig walang hadlang
At pwede ba sya ay ibalik nalang
Walang matarik na bundok walang karagatang malalim
Na aking tatawirin maibalik ka lang sa akin
Dahilan kung bat nabuhay sakin ang pagkasawi
Ay ang pagibig nating tamang nasa oras na mali
At sana wag mo palitan jaan sa puso mo pangalan
Ng lalake na nagsabe na ""mahal kita paalam
At magingat palage"" noong aalis na sya
At higit sa lahat ""Mamimiss kita""

CHORUS:

Inisip ko kung bakit ganito ang langit
Nilayo ako sayo
Hindi ko matanggap mahirap magpanggap
Na ako'y hindi bigo
ngunit di ko rin inaasahang mangyayari to
Kung ikaw ay alaala nalang paano na ako

4th Verse:

Paano na ko mamumuhay nito kung sa piling ko ay nawala
Ang nagiisang minahal ko makasama ko sya ay isa nalang bang himala
Alam ko na sa oras na to ay nakikinig kang pinipigil mo ang pagiyak
Sige ilabas mo wag pigilin ang emosyon ng iyong puso na nagkabiyak
Dahil ang alaala nating dalawa ay nagiwan ng sugat na nakamarka
Sino ba naman ang hindi masasaktan kapag nalayo ang tao na mahal ka
At kung minsan naisip ko din na wag nang ituloy itong nagawa ko na kanta
Dahil malamang pag narinig ko ito sigurado na maaalala kita
Pero kahit pilitin umiwas sa sitwasyon naten ay kusang bumabalik ang
Mga nakaraan kaya titulo ng kanta ko ngayon ay alaala nalang
Dahil sa alaala nalang umiikot ang aking isipan na nalilito
At prisensya ng pagmamahal mo sa akin ay dala ko lagi at naririto
HIndi man kita nabigyan ng materyal pero di mo alam may iniwan ako
Ito ang isang bagay na di maluluma yun ay ang pagmamahal ko sa iyo
Sana pagkaingatan mo yan hanggang sa oras na ikaw ay muli kong balikan
Dahil ipinangako di na ko iibig sa puso ko di ka mapapalitan

CHORUS:

Inisip ko kung bakit ganito ang langit
Nilayo ako sayo
Hindi ko matanggap mahirap magpanggap
Na ako'y hindi bigo
ngunit di ko rin inaasahang mangyayari to
Kung ikaw ay alaala nalang paano na ako"
Hambog,Breakup,/h/hambog/breakup_21087129.html,"First Verse:

Alam mo yung feeling na pagnakinig ka ng kanta?
Basta love song, “Naaalala sya”
Lalo na kapag nakaraan dinalaw ka nito
Ang nadadama ng puso, “Bakit ganito?”
Pag pangalan mo ay merong nagbanggit
Ako’y naiinis, totoo, “Ang sakit”
Pag sa profile mo sa Facebook napasilip
Bumabalik pagmamahal sa puso ko at isip
At sabi ko madami pa kong pwedeng ipalit
Sa loob loob ko, “Pwede kaw nalang ulit?”
Nasira na ang buhay ko nung sabi mo “Break na tayo”
Gusto ko sanang bumawe kaso “Too late na ba ko?”
Wala na bang pagasa? Ha? Wala na ba?
Ibalik sa date buhay ko na kasama ka
Baka pwede pang maayos to daan naten sa usap
Dahil di ko kaya ako’y nakikiusap

Chorus:

Nagiisa man ako ngayon
Ramdam ang lamig ng panahon
Bakit ba sakin pa
Napunta ang mga ganitong pagkakataon at kalungkutan na
Aking nadarama

2nd Verse:

Relasyon iyong tinigel pagibig mo’y pinigel
Kaya ako ay miserable sa pagiging single
Akala mo ba masaya ako? Male
Nakangiti kunyare ngunit puso ko’y sawe
Purkit ba nakangiti ako ay tanggap ko na
Na wala ka na di ba pwedeng panggap muna
Makita lang litrato mo ako’y naiiyak
Kaya ang ginawa sa Facebook ko ikaw ay naka-block
Dahil alam nila sa puso natanggal na din kita
Pero alam ko sa sarili kong mahal pa rin kita
Mahal pa rin kita mahal pa rin kita
Mahal pa rin kita kahit ang sakit sakit na
Grabe
Pag bumawi sa pananakit mga babae
Ang hirap makatulog dahil sa mga nangyare
Sana ay bumalik yung ikaw na mahal mo pa ko date

Chorus:
Nagiisa man ako ngayon
Ramdam ang lamig ng panahon
Bakit ba sakin pa
Napunta ang mga ganitong pagkakataon at kalungkutan na
Aking nadarama

3rd Verse:

Hindi ka na sa akin anong magagawa ko
Bakit mahal pa rin kita pilit ko mang mabago
Ang naramdaman sayo hanggang ngayon ganun pa rin
Kahit sa kanya ka masaya kahit masakit “Tatanggapin”
Ang di ko lamang matanggap ba’t date ang saya pa natin
At ang masakit doon yun ay di na babalik sa akin
Sabi mo wala na tayo ba’t pa ko nagdadamdam
Ewan ko, ewan ko, hindi ko din alam
Dahil galit ako sa bago mo sakin di yon maayos
Bakit kahit di na tayo bakit pa ko nagseselos
Para na akong tanga saking mga ginagawa
Tinitiis ko yon pero sila sakin awang awa
Nanjan lamang ang babae, at madami daw
Madami nga pero sa puso ko may nagiisang ikaw
Sana’y marinig mo to itong kanta para sayo
Pasensya na pasigaw ito kase nasaktan ako
(Nasaktan ako)

Teka di pa ko tapos meron pa kong sasabihen
Ikaw lang ang mahal ko yan ang lagi mong isipen
Ganda sana ng pinagsamahan ba’t natapos lang
Kaya kung ikaw ay babalik sa akin ayos lang
Kahit turing lang akong reserba at pangalawa
Ayos lang basta’t kasama ka yun ang mahalaga
Sabihan na akong madrama dito sa aking kanta
Nilalabas ko lang naman “Aking nadarama”

Chorus:

Nagiisa man ako ngayon
Ramdam ang lamig ng panahon
Bakit ba sakin pa
Napunta ang mga ganitong pagkakataon at kalungkutan na
Aking nadarama"
Hambog,Classmate,/h/hambog/classmate_20985461.html,"[Chorus:]
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

[Verse :]
Unang araw sa school ako'y nasa eskwelahan
Uniporme ay cool baka may maeksenahan
Syempre meron bagong chicks ngayon nagenroll
Kaso yung iba mukang pang shake rattle and roll (Oh)
Pero iisa ang agaw pansin
Isang babaeng kumakain magisa sa canteen
Tapos lalo pa kong natuwa at lalong sumaya
Nung nalaman ko ang crush ko classmate ko pala
Haha ngayon nga madiskartehan
Wala akong pake kung magtaray o maginarte yan
Basta gusto ko lang sabihin salitang nakakasado
Sa exam ng puso ko alam mo ba ikay pasado
Pero teka lang pangalan mo di ko pa alam
""Hoy mister wag kang maingay"" tumahimik ka ma'am
Anyway di ko pa rin alam pangalan mong banal
Pero pwede ba tawag ko nalang sayo mahal

[Chorus:]
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

[Verse 2:]
2nd subject andun kame sa may lab
Hindi ako nakikinig titig ako kay my love
Oo love na nga kita L-O-V-E
Di ko dama ang pagod ko kahit na mag P. E.
Pag topic ay P. C. ito'y hindi easy
Kaya ika'y busy pero ako'y sisi-
Ngit pa rin sa oras mo kahit ikaw ay maines
Kase ikaw bumubusog sa puso ko kapag recess
Kung eskwelahan ang puso ko ikaw ang principal
Dahil sinusunod lamang nito kanyang minamahal
Daig ko pa ang first honor kapag nakita kita
Ikaw solution sa problem sa matematika
Ng buhay ko kase ikaw plus ako equals for better
Multiply by tiwala at love equals forever
At wala ng pwedeng magdivide sa ating dalawa
Kase sa aklat ng Sibika tayo'y nakatalaga

[Chorus:]
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

[Verse 3:]
Tumatangge ako sa tropa pagsinabeng cutting tayo
Kase misyon ko saking pagpasok maging tayo
Yayayain lang nila ko sa bilyarang kalapitan
Bakit pa ko dun sasamakung sayong tabe kalangitan
Di ba tama aking katuwiran
Sa eskwelahan dun lang kita natatabihan
Kapag ikaw ang seatmate ko ayoko ng lumisan
Sana dito nalang tayo at walang uwian (Damn)
Baliw na ba ko hay nako lagot
Saking assignment, quiz at exam pangalan mo sagot
Lagi kong hinahanap ang yong essence at presence
Kase kinukumpleto mo ang nonsense na sentence
Kaya di na aabsent you're the angel God sent
Ayos ba ang accent syempre laging present
Di nawawala sa school laging lumalapag
Kase ikaw ang dahilan kung bat ako nagsisipag

[Chorus:]
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

[Verse 4:]
Ika'y iba sa lahat masasabeng ibang klase
At salamat sapagkat ika'y aking naging kaklase
At ikaw ngayon ang subject dito sa aking rap
Kung hindi ka nakilala malamang ako'y nadrop
Kase tamad akong binatang sawa sa eskwelahan
Ngunit ikaw ay estudyante don kaya may kwenta yan
Gumawa ako ng project tulang ipapabasa
Di ito para kay ma'am sayo ko to papasa
Sana pumasa ako sayo
Sana magreview ka rin na umaasa ko sayo
At ang mahalin kita hindi ko yon pinagaralan
Dahil nadama ko yon ng kusa at agad agaran
Classmate kong mahal sana maisip mo na
Matamis mong oo ang tuturing kong diploma
At bago ka mawalay sakin sa bakasyon
School year na kasama ka sa puso ko babakas yon

[Chorus:]
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita

[Bridge:]
(Classmate ko na)
Nagbigay ng kaligayahan
Kaya ang nais ko ikaw ay lagi lang na nanjaan
Sana kahit tayo ay magkalayo
(Classmate)
Maalala mo ako
(Dahil)
Unang araw palang minahal na kita
Bakit ba ganito ang aking nadama
Di man kita lubusan pang kilala
Eh ano naman basta mahal kita"
Hambog,Ermats,/h/hambog/ermats_21091842.html,"Ako ay anim na taon nung ako'y iniwanan mo
Kaya nung bata pa ako ikaw ay iniwasan ko
Kasi ako'y may katanungan at ako'y nagtatampo
""Wala na nga akong ama iniwan pa ng nanay ko?""
Sa eskwela pag magulang pinapupunta nila!
Ako'y walang kasama dahil ako'y walang ama't ina!
Bakit Po? Ba't iniwan nyu akung nagiisa?
Ba't ganun? Ba't sila? Andon ang ina nila?

Nung ikaw ay umalis bakit di mo ko dinala
Alam mo ang pangalan ko pero di mo kilala
Dahil ang aking paglaki hindi mo nasubaybayan
Iniwan mo akung anghel ngayon ay may sungay na yan
Ilang kaarawan ko na ang nagdaan laging wala ka
Kung kaya't habang umeedad mas lalong lumala pa
Pero wag magalala di masama aking loob
Bakit? Ma pakinggan mo ang susunod...

Iingatan ka
Aalagaan ka
Sa puso ko ikaw ang pag-asa
Sa 'ting mundo
May gagabay sa iyo
Ang alay ko'y itong pagmamahal ko
May nagmamahal, aakay sa iyo
Aking inay ikaw ang nagbigay
Ng buhay ko
Buhay na kay ganda
Pangarap ko na makamtan ko na

2nd verse
Hindi mo ginusto noong ako ay naiwanan mo
Lahat ng binigay mo sakin ay pinaghirapan mo
Tanging inisip mo nalamang ay kinabukasan ko
Sarili mo hindi mo inisip nilunasan mo
Ang ating buhay na mahirap kaya ika'y nagsikap
Sarap ng buhay ko ikaw naman ay naghihirap
Kaya nagtanung ako bakit ba ko nagtampo
""Pwedi ka namang maghirap basta sama mo ako""

Dahil ang buhay mo alam ko at aking nakabisa
Matagal ka nang hirap, tagal mo nang nagiisa
Ayukong dumating yung araw lahat ay huli na ma
Yung dapat kung ipadama hindi ko naipadama
Kaya hayaan mo ako hanggang ika'w nandito pa
Magsimula ng panibago ulitin sa umpisa
Alam mung puso ko'y manhid at bakal ang pagkasadya
Pero mahal kita ma hindi lang mo mahalata

3rd Verse
Hinahanap mo pa ang pagmamahal ng babae sa iba
Eh, ang babae na tapat kung magmahal ay ang ina""
Madameng babaeng daan sayu at iba'y Iiwan Ka Din Nila
Pero ang yung ina'y ang syang babae na matitira
Dahil ang isang ""inay"" ay kayang maghintay
Magbago ang kanyang anak at di sya bibigay
Ngunit kanyang ibibigay, lahat ng kayang ibigay
Kahit walang matira sa kanya walang problima kay inay

Ang galing galing nila no?
Kaya sana'y suklian natin sila kahit papano
Di usapan kung magkano ang usapan ay paano
Ipakita at ipadama sa kanya kung gaano
Mo sya kamahal at nagpapasalamat tayu
Sa pagmamaha nilang walang talo laging panalo
Kung wala aking inay, walang ""Hambog Ng Sagpro""
Hanggang dito nalang dahil naiiyak na nga ko

Sa katulad kong anak ay dapat nga lang mainis
Pero ikaw ay nag tiyaga at saakin ay nagtiis
Kaya ako'y awang-awa habang sayo'y nakatingin
Kahit walang kwentang anak pinilit kong intindihin
Lahat ay kaya mong gawin Basta lamang para sakin
At patawad sa lahat sana ako ay patawarin
Pag ako ay namatay sa kapalarang malupit
Sa kabilang buhay maging nanay ko sana ikaw ulit

Dahil kahit hirap ka na sa tulad ko na pabigat
Magaan pa rin loob mo sakin kaya halika't
Pakinggan kanta ng anak mung suwail at pasaway
Ngunit tinanggap mung buo naging mabuti kang inay
Kahit ngayun ako mayroon ng dalawang anak
Kekwento ko sa kanila ang lola nyu ay nagpatak
Ng luha, pawis at dugo at laging nasa tabi ko
Kaya salamat ""Ermats"" ikaw kakampi ko"
Horrible Histories,Australia Song,/h/horrible+histories/australia+song_21080054.html,"In Britain's Georgian times
There were so many crimes
No time to hang each crook guilty of a felony
Cos there's no room to jail you
They'd send you to Australia
To live in our new-fangled penal colony
Think that sounds like heaven?
In 1787, it wasn't that kind of once in a lifetime trip
First fleet took the journey
Months at sea so churny
Over 40 died while they were on the ship

Those that lived were plucky
Plucky, plucky, plucky
Crammed on board with rats and vermin, cockroaches in bed
Stench inside was sicky
Yucky, yucky, icky
Lice not very nice, can't get them out of my head

Landed Bay of Botany
Convicts' life was rotteny
Needed food and shelter but everything failed
Threes too strong for felling
Stagnant water smelling
A real step back in time in New South Wales
Soil too poor for budding
Huts washed up by flooding
Plans for building houses came to sticky ends
The best of all their labours
Attacked by local natives
And that is when your neighbours don't become good friends

Situation tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky
Then a second fleet of ships was due aground
Some thought this was lucky
But illness had strucky
Half were dead or I'll
Fever was spinning around

After seven years
Convict record clears
Just one catch
You got to pay your own way back
No wages meant no money
No choice, but what's funny
Many stayed, became farmers and made a stack
Original arrivers
Proved hardy survivors
Sydney turned into a place you'd choose to go
Think that they'd be fairer
To convicts who were sent there?
No way they built prisons even more remote

Port Arthur was one of the jails
Where every escape attempt fails
Was one man who nearly got through
Billy Hunt dressed as a kangaroo

Inmate's life still sucky
Sucky, sucky, sucky
Life behind bars was not very nice
Hideous and messy
Who would ever guessy
This hellhole would become a
Holiday paradise?"
Horrible Histories,Aztec Priests Song,/h/horrible+histories/aztec+priests+song_20982116.html,"We're Aztec priests so mind your head,
Our prisoners always wind up dead.
Our favourite colour is blood red,
We're not nice.

At an Aztec temples opening day,
We priest would please the gods this way.
Hoards of enemies we'd slay,
Mass sacrifice.

To win at war, make crops grow more,
To cure our kids when ill.
The sun to shine, this song to rhyme,
More victims we must kill.

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

You won't survive! You won't survive!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Ain't staying alive! Ain't staying alive!
Yeahhh!

With scarifice, we priest appease,
Our gods each powerful big cheese.
Lets hear it for your favourits please! Haaa!

We're doing it for Toci, the Aztec goddess of the earth's heart,
We're doing it for Chantigo, goddess who makes volcanoes start.
We're doing it for Itzli, the goddess of stone knives.
We're doing it for Itzpapalotlometeotlchiconahuiehecatl,
Errr? Some other gods great lives!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Don't cross us Aztecz, we advise ya!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Or you'll end up as fertiliser!
Yeahhhhh!

Our year starts in november, when every priestly member,
Is asked if they'll remember, our Aztec dead.
We do this if you haven't guessed, by getting something off your chest,
Your heart would proberbly be best, or else your head.
And then on our year planners, it's the raising of the banners,
And it's only polite manners, to kill more guys.

December and January, desmembering methods vary,
All you need to know, is that we pill them high.
May and June, it's summer time, the killing is easy,
It's only halfway through the year, bet you're feeling queasy.
In autumn time, we sweep our home and kill some more but then,
By late October, the killings over, then it starts up again!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

You won't survive! You won't survive!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Ain't staying alive! Ain't staying alive!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Want to live until you're old?

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Avoid us priests, you've been told!"
Horrible Histories,Blackbeard's Song,/h/horrible+histories/blackbeards+song_20914077.html,"When I was a nipper
I boarded a clipper
Sailed the seas as a goods importer, oh!

Edward Teach is my name
But I earned my fame
As Blackbeard the pirate of the water, oh!

Was a jolly chap
With a jaunty cap
Always gave my crew good quarter, oh!
But I'm best known for
Blood and guts and gore
And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!

Best known for
Blood and guts and gore
And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!

Left my home in Bristol
With a sword and pistol
Bid a fond farewell
To old Blighty, oh!

What my enemies feared
Was my thick, black beard
Which I always enjoyed
Setting light to, oh!

Once I had a thing
For a captive's lovely ring
That shone like a jewel in the nighty, oh!
When the man said no
I just said 'Oh! '
And chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio! '

Man said no
He said 'Oh! '
Chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio! '

Oh, I love to sail the ocean
With my flag that inspired emotion
With it's smiling pile of skull and bones
Smashing hearts with a violent stabbing motion

And I love to escape detection
And to win my crew's affection
Which was nothing to do with the twelve guns he wore
On his belt that were for protection

I was awfully nice
But I had the odd vice
Which occasionally caused a commotion
The thing that I'd do
Was shoot members of my crew
If they didn't show enough devotion

The thing he'd do
Was shoot members of the crew
If they didn't show enough devotion

Once when very irate
I shot my first mate, Israel Hans
For a bit of pleasure, oh!
And when my debt's grew
Killed half of my crew
To increase my share of the treasure, oh!

Was doing well then
Seemed to run out of men
My captives boarded at their leisure, oh!
Smoted me dead
Then cut off my head
And displayed it on my mast for good measure, oh!

Smoted him dead
Chopped off his head
Displayed it on the mast for good measure, oh!"
Horrible Histories,Blue Bloody Blues,/h/horrible+histories/blue+bloody+blues_21019629.html,"I bet you think the Stuarts were an English dynasty,
But we only came to England when the crown belonged to me,
Our clan may hail from Scotland
But our tales are not a bonnie one, you'll see.

We got the blue blooded blues,
In our blue Stuart shoes,
Each king queen and heir
Had there own personal nightmare,
Have you heard the news?
We got the blue blooded blues.

Let's start with me, King Robert iii,
Some say I was a fool,
Once fell off my horse and hurt my self,
Quite badly, how un-cool,
Ended up with a limp,
And limp was what they called my rule.
(And I tell you for why).

We got the blue blooded blues,
Strapping(?) sons, he had two.
One in prison, starved in jail,
The other captured, epic fail,
The worst kings, my review,
I got the blue bloody blues.

The next 5 kings all called James,
But none was lucky Jim,
James I hid down a sewer,
Got caught by assassins.
James ii was less unpopular,
But killed by his own cannon so, pretty dim
(And it doesn't end there. You're not wrong)

We got the blue blooded blues,
So many ways to lose.
3 and 4 killed in battle,
5 lost at war and that'll,
Explain why we got confused,
About the Stuarts clan blues
(Sing it Mary go on girl)

I'm Mary queen of Scots,
Misfortune I had lots
To Queen Liz was a threat
She threw me into prison yeah
Still accused me of plotin'
Can you seewhere I'm heading?
Liz is a Tudor, take a guess
Beheaded? Yeah!

After queen Liz died,
I was made King of England too.
Became James the first in England,
But the Stuart luck stayed true
Guy Fawkes try to blow me up,
And turn me into stuart stew

(One more time! Yeah!)
We got the blue blooded blues,
Not the role I would choose.
With my son Charles a decapity,
We briefly killed off royalty,
Stuart mourners it's true...
Cause we're the blue blooded blues

Won't be the first to blink
I'm not who you think
Don't mess with me, I'm Boudicca!

My husband Presotagus died
He was a Celtic king
I was his queen, so due to me
Was half of everything

Roman law gave half to me
So half was what they got
Till their nasty soldiers came
And took the blessed lot

Hey mister!
I say you got the wrong end of the stick
His answer turned this sister
Into one angry chick!

No man, Roman'll
Push around this woman
You won't get far, with Boudicca
Foeman, yeoman,
Smash the Roman foeman
All say yah! Yah! Boudicca!

I built a massive army
Headed straight for the city
Beat 'em all with ease
And like me, it wasn't pretty

Chopped 'em and hacked but
What made their red blood curl
Bad enough being beaten
But beaten by a girl?

Wacked 'em, smacked 'em
Boy how we attacked 'em
Near and far, ha ha ha!
Flayed 'em, slayed 'em
Up and down parade 'em
Boudicca! Toughest by far!

Colchester, London, St. Albans
Everybody talk about dead Romans!

We marched on up the Roman road
That's known as Watling Street
They trapped us in the forest
Then thrashed us to our defeat

By now you'd guessed I'm not the kind
Of girl to sit and cry
Be sold a slave to Romans?
You know I'd rather die!

They tried to take me prisoner
So I led the Roman boys on
Instead of giving in to them
I swallowed special poison!

Martyr, smarter
Capturer, non-starter
This was our last hurrah!
Slaughtered, dismembered
Our tribe always remembered
Boudicca! Superstar!
Boudicca! Superstar!"

By studying cadavers
Which are bodies not long dead
One day two suave young gentlemen
Appeared within my view
I'm Mr Burke, I'm Mr Hare
How do you do?
These gents explained that their
Acquaintance had just passed away
It seemed the body'd only been
A goner for a day
Excuse the curious offer
Said Hare or was it Burke?
But would you care to slice this up
To see how corpses work?
Well it's always a palaver
Getting hold of a cadaver
So I said yes I'll ahve her
Oh, it's a he!

This body taught me much about
What makes a person poorly
Why some men live to 99
And some die prematurely
How these thing function perfectly
And others won't repair
How everything is, interlinked
Oh what's that doing there?

'Til one day there was nothing left
And all my work was spent
Then Burke and Hare turned up again
My, how convenient!
Another slab of fresh
Human organs, bone and flesh
Another gory sesh, excellent news
(Laughs evilly)

As time went on these kind men
Brought me several guys and gals
My lab was choca-block
With all their freshly passed on pals
I paid them lots of money
Bodies came from everywhere
You really are a busy Mr Burke
And Mr Hare

They seemed such cultured gentlemen
I never did suspect
That Burke and Hare were not so nice
I really should have checked
Then one day a policeman came
Asked if I've seen a chap
I hadn't, but days later
His corpses turned up in my lap

It seemed that these acquaintances
Of Burke and Hare actually
Were not their friends and
Did not always die naturally
Burke and Hare had murdered them
It was plain to see
Then brought the corpses to my lab
And pocketed the fee

The two men were arrested
But one of them set free
Poor Burke was hanged
But happily his corpse was sent to me
Oh bit wiffy!
Still much to learn"
Horrible Histories,Caveman Love,/h/horrible+histories/caveman+love_20914065.html,"I'm just a lonely cavegirl
Searching for a date
Looking for cave romance
Or at least a caveman date

My momma says I must wait here
Until the moon is bright
With cakes, milk and honey as gifts for the Gods
Or as snack food for Mr. Right

Now crawl around three times
On your hands and knees
And if the face of a handsome man comes into view
Then he's your caveman love

I think I must look really silly
What caveman in his right mind would go for a crawling, circling cavegirl
Like - 
Oh, are you the man for me?

My handsome caveman husband
Is all I'd hoped he would be
He likes to go out hunting
Then I cook it for his tea

I promise to love him forever
Until he's old and grey
He'll live to the grand age of thirty
At which point he'll probably pass away

But that doesn't mean you stop loving him
'Cause now you have to prepare
A burial to show how much you care
For your caveman love

First I set fire to my husband
Then carefully cut off his skin
Boil in a pot some oysters and snakes
Let the funeral begin
Drop in some limpets and winkles
And sprinkles of mouse, toad and shrew
Then put out the fire with the cauldron
And say au revoir to my caveman love
My caveman love
Caveman love."

Year.!

100 Roman soliders lay dead on the beach, who'd slayed them?
I am the greatest warrior who has ever lived! Year.!
Warriors! I bring tidings of great victory, surely there is know other
Warrior in the land who can beat me! Huh!
I am the most fearsome warrior to walk the land of the living,
So I think we've got a problem.
I think there's only one way to settle this!

Boast battle!

So lets clear the air, grab a chair,
I've got flair, when I fight a bear.
I rip off it's skin, for my wife to wear,
I did it for a dare, I'm your worst nightmare look close, check out my
Facial hair.

Relax, face facts, a fight with you would be an anticlimax,
When you go to war, you don't take off your slackes.
Look at me I'm tough, I fight in the buff,
I could say more but I've said enough so...

Boast Battle!

Have some grace, shut your face!

Boast Battle!

Cause Braedon boy you're well off the pace!

Seems to me that you're not even skilled,
I can fill a lake with the blood I've spilled.
I decorate my house with heads of men I've killed,
I'd stab you right now but I'm trying to chill.

Yeah you got a brain but you've just got one,
I've got five on my belt from the battles I've won.
In a rage, on a rampage, I've killed more men then old age so...

Boast Battle!

And I've only just begun!

Boast Battle!

And I'm not even done!

You're just killing the enemy, that's lazy,
I kill my own people, I'm that crazy.
I go berserk and my eyes go glazy,
I get so mad I could stab a daisy. (But I won't cause that would be stupid)

All right! All right! Stop!
Think a while! Look at your style man that's vile!
You look like you've been dressed by a reptile,
You're a steaming pile, I'm dressed like a king.
I wear a torc round my neck when I'm doing my killing,
And on my finger, I'm wearing a ring.
When I said I fight nude I wasn't counting my bling! Yo!

Boast Battle!

Oh! And I paint myself blue!

Boast Battle!

That is way, way cooler than you!

So much better than you, that you ought to bow,
I'll offer to fight you but you wouldn't know how.
Enough with the talk year, lets end this now,
I can sum it all up in just one word...

Owww! Muuum!"
Horrible Histories,Charles Dickens,/h/horrible+histories/charles+dickens_21065587.html,"I lived a happy life ‘til I was ten years old
When debt landed dad in prison and our country house
Was sold
Lodged with a lady in her London flat so cold
Worked at a good polish factory, labelling jars quite
Dull be told
Goodness only knows
I was a miserable soul

For a time I went to school but then I found a job
As a clerk to a lawyer, oh it made my poor head throb
I failed to be an actor, despite my loud gob
Ended up reporting speeches of the parliamentary mob
Then as everybody knows
I started writing pros

Put my life into my books
Friends and enemies and crooks
Legal bosses of the crop
In “The Old Curiosity Shop”
Fagin in “Oliver Twist”
A factory pal, you get the gist
And although my memory’s quite foggy
Got Scrooge from the grave of Ebenezer Scroggy

My first book was an overnight sensation
But I drove myself too hard to enjoy the agilation
Despite my wealth, my family begged for money
I wrote of it in “Chuzzlewit” which people said was
Funny
Didn’t sell like books before
My family still asked for more

“Little Dorrit” is a tale
About my dad in debtor’s jail
While “Hard Times” tells my life ‘bout
When I tried to leave my wife
“Little Nell’s” here was my poor dear
Departed sister-in-law
And “David Copperfield”, working in a factory
I must confess that that was really me

In my life, felt shamed ‘bout poverty in childhood
Wrote about sadness, suffering and fears
Also wrote about people with funny names
Bumble, Smallweed, Scrooge, Uriah Heep
And Wackford Squeers

Whilst writing “Edwin Drood”
Train crashed in, helped my mood
Still I drove myself on
With readings far across the pond
Died before I wrote Drood’s end
Something drove me ‘round the bend
So Dickens, take a dickens, take a bow
And Heaven knows
I’m miserable now"
Horrible Histories,Charles II,/h/horrible+histories/charles+ii_20914075.html,"My name is, my name is
My name is, Charles ii!

I love the people
And the people love me
So much that they restored
The English monarchy!

I'm part Scottish, French, Italian
A little bit Dane
But one hundred percent party animal
Champagne?

Spaniels I adored
Named after me too
Like me, they were fun
With a nutty hair do!

Is today my birthday?
I can't recall
Let's have a party anyway
Because I love a masked ball!

All hail, the king!
Of bling! Let's sing!
Bells ring! Ding ding!
I'm the king who brought back partying!

King Charles, my daddy
Lost his throne
And kings were banned
They chopped off his head
Then Olly Cromwell ruled the land

Old Olly wasn't jolly
He was glum, and he was proud
Would be miserable as sin
Only sinning's not allowed!

When Olly died, the people said
'Charlie, me hearty!
Get rid of his dull laws
Come back, we'd rather party! '

This action's what they called
The monarchy restoration
Which naturally was followed
By a huge celebration!

The King of Eng! (Land say!)
No sin! Too sing! (Okay!)
Or anything!
All say, I'm the king who brought back partying!

Great London Fire was a whopper!
In my reign, London city came a-cropper!
So this king did what was right and proper
Fought the fire, proved I'm more than a bopper
I'm a fire stopper!

Married Catherine Braganza
She was a love so true
There would never be another
Well... Maybe one or two!

Lucy Walter, Nell Gwynne
Moll Davies, Barbara Villiers
You think that's bad
But her name's not as silly as...
Hortense Mancini!

As king, I must admit
I broke the wedding rules
But who cares when I brought back
The crown jewels?
I reinstated Christmas
Make up, sports and even plays
I was the merry monarch
They were good old days!

When said and done!
King Charles did run!
England for fun!
I was the king loved by everyone
My song is done!

Party anyone?"

Okay, no time to grieve!

Think that's alarming, you'd be right
But it gets worse
Married my half brother

Led to an overcrowded throne
But then he died, boo-hoo
So now I rule alone

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
All hail lady Cleo!
Wah, wah, wah, la, la
Coolest pharoah by far!

Fashion topped my list of vices
Bathed in asses' milk and spices
Then I dressed like goddess Isis
Long, black hair in ringlets nicest
Viper's tooth for men entices
Finest linen robe, top prices!

Married another brother
He's an okay geezer
But never told
Of my love for Julius Caesar

Had Caesar's child and hoped
That he'd be crowned king
My bro said no, I said 'Oh! '
And I murdered him

'Cause I am Cleopatra
Egypt's royalty
The ruling pharoah, don't you dare-o
Mess with me!

My pokerface smiles
Only when I see
A man who takes my fancy like
Oh! Mark Antony!

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Another Roman leader
Wah, wah, wah, la, la
No Egyptian crowd pleaser

Ra, ra, Cleopatra!
Finally, I'd met my matcher!

Of Dick Turpin's highway glory
But my past was far more gory
Was no saint

You think life is one big antic
My profession is romantic
Hate to be pedantic
But it ain't

HA

As a butcher down in Essex I was handy with a knife
Had a sideline as a poacher led a lest than honest life

A notorious gang of Gregory
Liked my stile and dedication
They signed me up and gave me
A real robber's education

We rampaged through the Essex farms
We stole and robbed and fought
But when the law came for us
I escaped and they got caught

I became I highway man
Was daylight robbery

HA

I was no prince charming
Nothing dandy about me

HA

The truth is, I was violent
And with my good mate, Matt King
Robbed travelers at gunpoint
Money, watches, anything! 

My horse wasn't called black Bess
Although that's what you've read
Was no romantic hero
Shot but one but two men dead

The legend that surrounds me
Misses out the crucial part
I was a ruthless killer
With a ruthless killer's heart

I was a vicious highwayman
A source of pain and tears

HA

When you hear how my story ends
You won't believe your ears

HA

I ran away to Yorkshire
Changes my name to John Palmer
Was sent to prison
Stealing chickens from a farmer

Wrote a letter to my family
A plea it did relate
The postman saw the envelope
And here's the twist of fate

He had taught me how to write
So he'd knew I'd lied
""that's not John Palmer's hand! 
That's Dick Turpin's!"" he cried! 

I was a vicious highway man
My crimes had brought me fame

HA

Was stitched up by a postie
That's not glamorous
THAT'S LAME! 

HA

No more stand and deliver
You'll remember this I hope

HA

It's no fun hanging with highwaymen
When you're... 

Hanging from a rope!"

Ordered men to kill my mother
Tried to drown her but she fled

For some splendid beauty tips, pay attention listen to me.

White is beautiful dear ladies, smear your face with paint of lead,
Never mind the lead had made the men who mixed it ill or dead.

Take some silk of red or black, cut a circle or a cresent,
Stick it on your face to cover, smallpox scars, it's much more pleasant.

Shave your eyebrows, clean away, take a trap and catch some mice,
Make flash eyebrows with the mouse skin, stick them on, you'll look so
Nice.

Next you need a monster wig, if you want to look real smashing,
Once your wig has reached the roof, then you'll be the height of fashion.

Decorate your lovely hairpiece, use the feathers of a parrot,
Add some ribbon, fruit and flowers, from your ear then hang a carrot.

Make your face look soft and chubby, pack your mouth with balls of cork,
Hang your flash teeth in the middle, hope you don't choke when you talk.

Now you followed my advice, last of all you need a fan,
Flutter it oh so demurely, then your sure to bag your man."

With the ball it means the French and Spanish ships don't stand a chance at
All we can get nasty injuries sometimes it's best to die if your hit by the
Enemy you're lucky to survive (magic sponge magic saw)

You're gotta wait to fight only do it when it's right gotta break their line
They're be swimming in the brine pick your time to shoot then they're ships

Orange anyone

Shakespeare wrote four, five, six, eight but seven not a word.
People think I'm dreary, to some extent I am.
But look a little closer, glam, bam, thank you mam! 

I didn't agree with King Richard three, 
So I fought him at Bosworth field and won, victory! 
How cool does it sound, that I'm the king who found, 
Richards crown in a hedge on the winning battleground.
The only way to end war and avert further disaster, 
There's got to be a way to unite York and Lancaster.

I'm the original ch-ch-ch Tudor, 
Founder of that dynasty.
The man who closes, the wars of the roses, 
That's right, that's right, that's me! 

I launched attacks on lords who earned stacks, 
Mine was a noble cause to tap them all for tax.
They paid their share, was only fair, 
To make England rich and me a millionaire.
Elizabeth York became my wife for life, that make me a bore?
Joined our family seats, that's neat, made my rule secure!

I'm the original ch-ch-ch Tudor, 
Returning power to the state.
It seemed quite toothless but actually ruthless, 
I made the monarchy great!

Spent a long time fighting, pretenders to the throne, 
Lambert Simnel, Perkin Warbeck said my throne was their own.
They claimed they'd been the princes, in the tower their rule delayed, 
I said 'this crown ain't big enough for the three of us' and had one slayed!

I'm the original ch-ch-ch Tudor, 
King of foreign policy.
Doing hostile relations with enemy nations, 
I asked them a-make friends with me.

Yeh, the original ch-ch-ch Tudor, 
They say dullness my main trait.
Well that's a sad endightment, cause if you're looking for excitement, 
My son was Henry the Eighth!"

Roman soldiers built the road
Egypt's pyramids were buildings at their peak
But when we talk of great invention
It's important that we mention
A special race who really were unique

Plato and Pythagoras
Both of them did stagger us
Socrates, he showed such great technique
Was there ever, ever, ever
Such a bunch of chaps so clever?
If you want to know the answer, ask a Greek!

I'm a Greek, I'm a Greek
We are all so magnifique
We invented sundials, catapaults and bricks
Chic and sleek, so to speak
Our success was not a freak
But working hard was how we got our kicks

We created the first siren
And the first soldering iron
The Olympics, well... That was quite a busy week
So the next time that you go-go
To the toyshop for a yo-yo
Let them know-know it was thought of by a Greek!

We are Greek, we are Greek
Nowadays you'd call us geek
But in ancient times, people thought of us as tough
Our physique was not weak
'Cause when people gave us cheek
We invented boxing, and other violent stuff!

Fiery flamethrowers for battles
Pinhole cameras, baby rattles
'Is there nothing they can't do? ' I hear you shriek
So next time you take a shower
Or you see a lighthouse tower
Just remember they were thought of by a Greek!

Stage acoustics, ancient harps
Music sounds of flats and sharps
Central heating at your doorsteps
Splints, syringes, lamps and forceps
Fire extinguishers, thermometers
Coin dispensers and odometers
Pontoon bridges, pistons, pulleys
Parchment, prisms, puppets, dollies

Shock absorbers, draughts and maps
We were oh, such brainy chaps!
Anchors, chewing gum, the list does never cease
Spinning tops, the dice, the crane
Do we have to ask again?
Did they come from Spain?
No, they came from Greece!"

And our only aim in life is to fight
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight
We fight by day, and when it's not so bright
We're not so bright!

We like to beat, and chop and stab our wicked enemy
But all the time we try to stick to rules of chivalry
Rule one, we have to do brave deeds for some great lady fair
I'd write poems, I would joust, well I would fight a bear
(Well, maybe a teddy bear. Oh, I can't!)

I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight
And our only aim in life is to fight
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight

We're never right!

Rule two, we have to practise in the noble art of war
Battle for our king and country, that's what knights are for
And if there is no war to fight, a-hunting we will go
We hunt for deer and rabbits too, so long as they are slow
(Otherwise we can't catch them!)

I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight
And our only aim in life is to fight
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight
We are fighters and our armour's always tight
And these swords aren't light!

Rule three, in war we aim to capture other knights alive
Their families pay us lots of dosh so long as they survive
We act like gentlemen, and only fight with other gents
A real knight, he would never fight against peasants!

Wanted people to say I was brave,
But I lost my first fight and hid in a cave.
Living there could be a pauper's nightmare,
But if you're rich like me then you don't care.
I called my slave to the cave to ask it,
To cook a feast and lower in a basket.

Those Romans think they're minted,
But they aint rich like me.
You can't call yourself loaded,
Till you can by an army.
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar,
They're more famous than me.
But I'm the worlds richest geezer,
There's no-one richer than me.
I'm minted!

I back General Sulla,
Everyday my wallet got fuller.
Took the land off enemies to flog it,
Used the cash to fill my pocket.
If I heard of a house on fire,
I'd rush over and be a quick cash buyer.
My fireman would then douse the flames, boom!
Another big house to my name.

Those Romans think they're minted,
But they aint rich like me.
You can't call yourself loaded,
Till you can by an army.
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar,
They're more famous than me.
But I'm the worlds richest geezer,
There's no-one richer than me.
I'm minted!

I bought an army for fighting Spartacus,
At the start my men lost heart-acus.
I killed on in ten in a killing spree,
So they were more scared of me than the enemy.
Smashed the slaves, it got real gory,
But then Pompey stole my glory.
To show it was me that crushed the horde,
Nailed up the slaves like on a billboard.
They're splinted!

Not enough to be a politician,
Wanted triumph, took my army on a mission.
Got owned by the Parthian Persians,
They killed me, but you'll hear two versions.
The famous one's quite hard to follow,
They gave me boiling gold to swallow.
But the true way they made me pay,
They used my head as a prop in a play!
Embarrasing!

Those Romans think they're minted,
But they aint rich like me.

And Tutankhamen's tomb
Was never hit by any curse
There never was a dragon slain by George

I'm Joan Of Arc from Domremy, religious visions came ter me.
God said 'Save France from the English' and make Dauphin Charles, king!
Dauphin means heir to the throne, but England claimed the crown as their own.

We had a hundred years of war. This girl had to do something!
So I did it like a dude, cut my hair.
Gave up wearing dresses, bought a pair.
Of trousers, no blouses. Said I wanna fight Angleterre.

Charles let me join the army, army, army.
Know that might sound barmy, barmy, barmy.
I proved impressive,
Hit by an arrow a-a-and lived.

English troops I over ranny, ranny, ranny.
Defeated them at Patay, Patay, Patay.
We saved Orle-eans and Charles was crowned tres bon!

Me leading troops- a long shot,
But I was a lucky mascot.
Inspired soldiers with brav-er-y.
Fought injured and sur-vived.

But in 1430, Burgundians captured me!
King Charles couldn't pay my ransom.
No-one told me, why!

Being prisoner was not my style, tried escaping from my capture's vile.
But then the English who fought me, bought me! Made me stand, trial!

So where was King Charlie, Charlie, Charlie?
He'd given up and left me, left me, left me.
In the Engli-ish snare.
Whole thing so un-fair.

They put me in a uh- hu? N-nunnery.
They said don't be uh-hu? F-funnery.
If you dress like a-a male.
We'll put you in men's jail.

Joan of Arc? You're charged with sorcery.
You're just jealous cos God speaks ter me.
Say you speak to saints? In this discourse? What language do they speak?
French o'course.
Pah! Now you're in prison, they have failed yer.
I say it's God's plan that you're my jailer.
Here's a trick question in that case. Do you think you're in God's grace... ?

If I am not, may God put me there, and if I am, may God so keep me.

Oh your smart remarks go round the houses.
You're guilty of heresy.(and wearing men's trousers)

Despite my testimony, mony, mony.
Condemned for reasons phony, phony, phony.
But my will did no-ot break.
So they tied me to a-a stake.

Burned alive was my destiny, tiny, tiny.
And here is the irony, rony, rony.
My death led France to put on war paint.
And crush the English so now, I'm a saint."

My enemies stood no chance
They call me the first English king
Although I come from France

1066, the Doomsday book
I gave to history
So fat on death my body burst
But enough about me

To help remember all your kings
I've come up with this song
A simple rhyming ditty
For you all to sing along

Oh, William
(Bit short init? We need more kings. Who came next?)

William second, cheeks were red
Killed out hunting, so it's said
I took over, Henry one
That's my next eldest son

Then King Stephen, it's true check it! 
Hi, Henry two, killed Thomas Beckett
Richard Lionheart? That's right! 
Always spoiling for a fight

Oh King John, what a disaster 
Rule restrained by Magna Carta

William, William, Henry, Stephen
Henry, Richard, John, oi! 
Time for my mate, King Henry eight
To take up this song

Henry three built the abbey
Ed one hated Scots
A red hot poker killed Ed two
That must have hurt him lots

Edward third was a chivalry nerd
Began the hundred years war
Then Richard two was king aged ten
Then Henry, yes one more 

King Henry four, plots galore
Not least from Henry five, why?
Killed ten score at Agincourt
Then Henry six arrived

Edward four, Edward five
Richard the third, he's bad
'Cause he fought wars with Henry seventh
First Tudor and my dad

So Henry eight, I was great
Six wives, two were beheaded
Edward the sixth came next, but he died young
And so my dreaded
Daughter Mary ruled, so scary
Then along came... me
I'm Liz the first, I had no kids
So Tudors RIP

William, William, Henry, Stephen
Henry, Richard, John, oi! 
Henry, Ed, Ed, Ed, Rich two
Then three more Henrys join our song
Edward, Edward, Rich the third
Henry, Henry, Ed again
Mary one, good Queen Bess
That's me, time for more men

James six of Scotland next
Is English James the first he led
Then Stuarts ruled, so Charles the first
The one who lost his head

No monarchy until came me
Charles two, I liked to party
King Jimmy two was scary, woooh 
Then Mary was a smarty

She ruled with Bill, their shoes were filled
By sourpuss Queen Anne Gloria
And so from then, you were ruled by men
Till along came me Victoria

William, William, Henry, Stephen
Henry, Richard, John, oi! 
Henry, Ed, Ed, Ed, Rich two
Then three more Henrys join our song 
Edward, Edward, Rich the third
Henry, Henry, Ed again
Mary one, good Queen Bess
Jimmy, Charles and Charles and then
Jim, Will, Mary, Anna Gloria
Still to come, it's Queen Victoria

And so began the Hanover gang
George one and George two (grim) 
Then George the third was quite absurd
Till I replaced old him

King George the fourth and known henceforth
As angry, fat and cross (hang on)
It's true you beat Napoleon
But were mostly a dead loss (bang on) 

Old William four was a sailor (ahoy) 
It's nearly the end of the story-a
As onto the scene comes the best loved queen
Hail to Queen Victoria

William, William, Henry, Stephen
Henry, Richard, John, oi! 
Henry, Ed, Ed, Ed, Rich two
Then three more Henrys join our song
Edward, Edward, Rich the third
Henry, Henry, Ed again
Mary one, good Queen Bess
Jimmy, Charles and Charles and then
Jim, Will, Mary, Anna Gloria
George, George, George, George
Will, Victoria
Victoria Victoria Victoria

(I ruled for sixty four years, you know.)

Ed seven, George five
Then Ed, George sixth
Liz two then reigned and how
And so our famous monarch song
Is brought right up to now, oh 

William, William, Henry, Stephen
Henry, Richard, John, oi! 
Henry, Ed, Ed, Ed, Rich two
Then three more Henrys join our song
Edward, Edward, Rich the third
Henry, Henry, Ed again
Mary one, good Queen Bess
Jimmy, Charles and Charles and then
Jim, Will, Mary, Anna Gloria
George, George, George, George
Will, Victoria 
Edward, George, Edward, George six
And Queen Liz two completes the mix

That's all the English kings and queens
Since William first that there have been"

That my ruling made them sick 'cause when it comes to praying my tastes
Were catholic they revolted, challenged me fuelled my great desire to tie

Intended tried to be good you see but history only remembers I was a
Catastrophe

Married Phillip king of Spain who then left me England he thought was a

French advanced we lost Calais oops through out my reign it rained and
Rained it poured upon the poor the harvest failed no food remained and flu

Horrible Histories,Natural Selection,/h/horrible+histories/natural+selection_21066826.html,"Mmmm yeah.
Mmmm yeah.

People thought all animals
Arrived here unrelated
The world began, and then came man
All perfectly created

But then someone looked up a tree.
And said ""That monkey looks just like me!""
So it really was a mystery
What I'd learned in natural history!

So I joined hms Beagle
Watched the eagle and the seagull
We studied rock and plants
Flowers, trees and bees and ants

Slept on hammocks without pillows
Eating rats and armadillos
Till I realised on reflec-tion
It's natural selection! Yeah!

Natural selection means
Each animal evolved
To blend with its surroundings
Ch-ch-changes were involved

So birds with different, foods to seek.
Seem to have developed, different beaks.

And over time they'd,
Modified
So just the fittest
Of them all survived!

On the Isles of Galapagos
I noted the giant tortoise
Had interesting shells
And I rode on them as well

Iguanas land and swimming
Meant my new theory was winning
It all led in the direction
Of natural selection.

My findings went with outrage
From the ch-ch-ch-ch-church of England
And from me.

The idea that we came from ch-ch-chimps
Questioned my own Christianity
But it was hard to disagree!

Every species new mutation
Had a perfect explanation
It seems the worlds inception
Must predate common perception

And if lack of adaptation
Means a fatal limitation
So each creature's imperfection
Over time gets a correction

Meaning animal collections
Grow unique means of protection
And to fail nature's inspection
Means immediate rejection
Which all leads to the detec-tion
Of natural selection!
Natural selection!"

Henry first's throne.

My wife's also called Matilda,
Quite confusing cause we choose to claim
Matilda's throne our own.

I'm Henry that Matilda's son.

You got that. Here's th story of our spat.

Starts in 1135, when king Henry, my father died,
And I think you'll find named me, Matilda, as his heir.
But his nephew, Stephen, said 'that crown should be upon my head'
I'm a man and men come first, what it's only fair.
Had married Geoffrey of Anjou,
Stuck in France not Waterloo.
When Steve without a vol-a-vout,
Took throne from me.
Should be dancing queen,
Oh stop causing such a scene!

Gimme, gimme crown and take a chance on me,
I'm heir to the throne not you! Ah-ha!
Think you'll get it back,
That I'd like to see!

Oh, I do, I do, I do!

Fought in Lincoln,
She caught me.
Was pro-claimed first English Lady!
But she made many enemies,
Remember me! I'm Stephens wife.

Made royal councillers agree,
That she lacked bare mininity.
Took Stephens army and beseiged her!
Eugh! More strife!

I was trapped so faked my death!
Hid in coffin, held my breath.
Escaped!
You think thst I'm impressed?
Well I'm not""
Just look how I've got, your half brother,
Want to swap?

Gimme, gimme hubby and we'll fight again.
The winner takes it all! Ah-ha!
In Oxford I'll beseige,
And I'll escape and then,
I'll join the battle core!

Age 14, I fought but lost,
So Uncle Stephen stayed the boss!
Who should be ruler, muma?
Mia! Here we go again!

Sadly my darling Matilda,
Caught a fever and it killed her.
I gave up my dream,
To build a royal dynasty!
When my son died,
Had no heir which was abide!

Gimme, gimme crown cause next in line it's me!

You can have it when I'm done! Ah-ha!
So I guess Matilda never did make queen.
The throne went to my son!

Knowing Mum, knowing you!

Everybody happy? Good!"

Fought King Henry Four because Wales abhorred English rule
But my uprising, it went a bit wrong and this song tells the surprising tale.

Owain Glyndwr!
Welsh hero, of the hour!
It all began 'cause my neighbour, a vindictive man,
Baron Grey De Ruthen was spreading untrue things 'bout me!

Said I was a rebel who planned to repel England's king,
Not really true but more than a few were convinced.
So, I decided, to take up the mantle, was given the handle of Prince.
Of Wales!

You don't have to be Welsh to feel Welsh pride.
Even kingsman Henry Hotspur ended up on my side.
We claimed Welsh ground, then in Hereford rain meant,
The king nearly drowned, washed away in his tent.
So partly thanks to Welsh weather,
I was crowned, think I'm gunna dance now!

I had great plans for new government, new law and churches.
But Henry the Fourth had dried off and revenge was his game.
We were defeated, he blocked supplies to Wales,
Our crops failed and starvation came.

Owain Glyndwr!
My family sent to the tower.
As Welsh towns fell, and we all know that never ends well.
So I disappeared but my name is revered throughout Wales.

Owain Glyndwr!
Father of the fight for Welsh power.
Welsh legend holds that should Wales ever need someone bold.
I'll rise up to help them, I'm due, I'm six hundred years old!

When it comes to claiming nearby lands
I was the type to risk it
But it's how I treat dead enemies
That really took the biscuit

I drink from their skull
(Do the Pachacuti!)
Pull out their teeth whole
(Do the Pachacuti!)
Turn teeth into charms
(Do the Pachacuti!)
Make flutes out of their arms
(Pachacuti!)

Once on a hillside, my troops hid
To cause a rival strife
And when they jumped out, it looked like
The ground had come to life

The rocks they are my warriors
I then used to boast
And that little lie helped us win wars
But violence helped the most

I drink from their skull

Pull out their teeth whole

Turn teeth into charms
(Do the Pachacuti!)
Make flutes out of their arms

If you were a rival chief
We'd kill you fast and then
We'd stuff you like a scarecrow
But one for scaring men

Then we'd rest your bony fingers on
The stretched skin of your belly
And in the breeze, they'd tap that tum
Like a drummer, but more smelly!

Drink from their skull

Pull out their teeth whole

Use their skin as a drum

You may have heard rather
A lot 'bout our notions
Crossing the ocean
On the good ship Mayflower
But it's true our journey
Turned into quite a commotion.

People report that we sported these hats
But that's not true, I mean, would you?
Anyway the main thing to say
We began the usa
Our little band of religion fans
From the East Midlands.

We all believed slowly
That England was becoming less holy
So set off for Holland
Cause there we had friends
But in the end seemed the Netherlands
Would never be the land, we planned.

Couldn't stand to remain on that terrain
So again we rearranged
To start a new nation with our congregation
A new and calmer life took a farmer and a builder and his wife
And a clerica, to find America.

Oh it's a new world
It wasn't new to the natives
Still we thought we'd claim it
Yeah, it's the new world.

I still remember 9th of November
The year 1620 and we saw plenty of land
We thanked God when we found ground
I kept calm but it didn't go as planned.

Couldn't land on the sand
A month later though, we made it
New Plymouth man, we claimed it
The natives said not
But ran when we shot.

Moved there it proved yeah
That life would be tough
Cause we didn't have enough
Of the right stuff.
Did you know had no seeds we could grow
Although William Mullins had stacked
126 pairs of shoes in his pack
Now that's whack.

A fishing rod, a plough,
A pig, or a cow
Would have been a much better idea
But now there's no food for us to eat
Does this mean that we'll meet with de feet!

No fun in the new world
I'm glad we've arrived here
But will we survive here
Yeah, in the new world.

People were staving
Our numbers halving
And when the winter winds blew
Even fewer live through
It wasn't pretty in our new city
But the natives took pity even though
They didn't have to.

Man called Squanto
Showed us how to grow maize
Catch eel for a meal
Chopped up in the baze
Tribe gave us a feast
Our starvation ceased
In 1621 what they had done
Turned us back from the dead
To the living and to this day
That's why we have thanks-giving.

In Massachusetts built a colony it's true
They say modern America was founded by our crew
It's a new world
But we can't call it England
Let's call it New England
Yeah, in the world.

My home was in Plymouth
Lets call it New Plymouth
I got an idea let's call this New Hampshire
Wait I'm from Newcastle
Can we call it New Newcastle?
Nah!
It's a new world."

His kids too young to rule
So... I took the throne
Why not? I'm nobody's fool!

Thomas More wrote a history
Said I'd murdered Edward's boys
Shakespeare said their death
Was an evil ploy
But I say those two
Are historical vandals!
They've ruined my image!
I mean, what a scandal!

Never bumped off
Those harmless young heirs
Never buried them
Under the Tower of London stairs
Never poisoned my wife
Bumped off her daddy
This is me, sweet Richard
Do I look like a baddy?
Never was two-faced
Sure you'll agree
I was misunderstood
King Richard three

Can you imagine it?
I'm the last Plantagenet
Beaten by Henry
In the Wars of the Roses
The Tudor dynasty
Didn't care that much for me
Now I'm painted as a baddy
That's why one supposes... (continues while next verse is sang)

Never forget
When you hear of my crimes
Never drowned my brother
In a massive vat of wine
Never said 'a horse!
My kingdom for a horse! '

Why, William Shakespeare, of course!

About a special ruler

We're taught not to be meek
And if we're good they feed us
Three square meals every week

To see who is the best

Roughest, toughest Spartan contest

Than maybe it first appears.

Dinosaurs, Neanderthals,
Let's make this clearer.
Didn't live together,
Came from different eras.
That's not all I can tell you,
So much more to be known.
About the many phases,
In the ages of stone.

Shooby-dooby-doo-wap

It's all the rage.

To skiddly-bap-doo-wa

Brush up on your Stone Age.

Oh yeah! All right!

It's fine to define,
An era Palaeolithic.
But you're gonna have to be,
A little more specific.
Do you mean lower,
When ancient beings first used tools?
Or middle Palaeolithic,
When Neanderthal ruled?

That's when Homo sapiens,
Starts to emerge.
But just in Africa,
It's long before the global surge.
Not till upper Palaeolithic,
Forty thousand years ago.
Did Neanderthal and Homo sapiens say hello,
Neanderthal and Homo sapi,
Living in caveman harmony.

Language was invented,
Cave painting art.
Then Palaeolithic ended,
Which meant the start.
Of phase two-be-doo-be-doo-wap

Turn a new page.

Skiddly-bap-doo-wah

Buck up on the Stone Age.

Oh yeah! All right!

This is where it starts to,
Get all scientific.
Palaeolithic's followed by,
The era Mesolithic.
Then Neanderthals are wiped out,
By the ice age - horrific!
After which the Neolithic age,
Was terrific.

Man learned to farm,
Built homes so they could settle.
Then some other folks turned up,
And they discovered metal.
Bigger men from Europe,
Found bronze and outgrown.
The simple and traditional ways of stone.

Bronze Age was invented,
By now man was flying.
'Cause hot on it's heels,
Came the age of iron.
Celts, Druids,
Religion then Rome.
By now a distant memory,
Those ages of stone.

Shooby-dooby-doo-wap

Since that metallic stage.

Skiddly-bap-doo-wah

There was no more Stone Age.

Started the battle for our rights
Argued the government should change the laws,
Here is how she stated applied

How come girls can't vote for rules that we have to obey?
When we work and pay taxes too!
Parliament's reaction was
'Oh do go away! '
How dare they diss the suffrage crew

Suffragettes sing, we're gonna do this thing
Peaceful protest started in 1903
Got no reaction, needed drastic action
Got a new leader Emmeline Pankhurst
That's me

Burst into parliament shouting votes for women,
Actions though were shocking anf new
Chained ourselves to palace gates
Tension was brimming on the wspu
Burned down churches, smashed up shops
Attacked mps, the result we were thrown in gaol
This made us more determined as you'll come to see
Think we'd give up fighting? Hey fail!

Suffragettes sing together we can win
In prison we protested and went on hunger strike
Men still said no but we just said Yo!
You won't stop us now!
Miss Davison please take the mic

We became more extreme
Derby day June 13
In front of king and queen
Committed sacrifice supreme
Crept unseen between the team
And crowds watching the race
And threw myself under a horse
To try and make our case
Became a famous martyr, how did men react?
We can't give women votes if they're so stupid they'll do that

Seemed our cause was lost
When world war came along
Our suffragette reaction
Was to wave our protest good bye
Farewell, so long, took patriotic action
Put down our banner sayinggive us votes
Instead supported the men's fight
Worked to help them win the war so guess what they said
Okay ladies... You were right!

Suffragettes sing, we've done it ding-ding
At last those men could see they should treat us the same
So all take note now that women can vote
And it's thanks to those who fought in the
Suffragette name!"

Had a war with Prince Charles Bonnie
Everyone said that I was f-f-funny

In four jars so they do not decompose.

For the mouth and pop in artificial eyes.

Pack his tomb with wealth, Which he'll need for his health,
If he makes it to the country of the dead.

Very witty
Very wise

No one
Can out-wink us
We are Athens
Brainiest guys.

Not everyone likes smarties though
Even Socrates had his foe
When tried for treason
He simply said ""Why?""

They sentenced him to drink hemlock
He said ""You know if I take stock
I am annoying, I'll take that
And die. ""

Hey, hey,
We're The Thinkers
Politicians
Gave us strife

But we don't
Give a tinkers
Cause we taught them
All about life.

Ooohhh!"

Is well aware that you should never mess with the Tudors. 
My Grandad Henry Seventh, 
He beat King Richard, 
That's him pictured, 
Defeating the Tyke. 
He liked his name so much that, 
To keep alive is memory, 
He called his own son Henry, 
What was he like! 
Everyone said Hen-er-y the eighth was a baddy, 
I have to agree, 
Even though he was my daddy. 
(Just popping of to chop some wives.) 
Cos we're Tudors, 
Britain's biggest feuders, 
And just like barracudas, 
We kill with methods foul. 
Tudors 
Each enemy a Judas, 
At least we're not as rude as, 
Simon Cowell. 
My reign was quite notorious, 
I liked to hunt and slaughter, 
But then you had a daughter, 
Mary was her name, 
It was a son I wanted, 
So I divorced her mother, 
Then wife two had another, 
A girl? Not again! 
(That's me your talking about! ) 
Tudor, 
Superior to you duh, 
Who followed me as ruler, 
Best not to ask. 
It must have been my laddie, 
Yes sicky little Eddie, 
Was I'll and soon got deady
And who came next? 
Your daughters then took over, 
First came Bloody Mary, 
My sisters rule was scary, 
So all hail meeeeeee
Tudors, 
The history books reviewed us, 
As nutters and big bruisers, 
Who kill and cull. 
I never had an heir, 
So our reign ended there, 
We my not have been fair, 
But we were never dull:)"

Stephenson's the name and my steam engine's the best you will find

It pulled a train that carried passengers and was the first of its kind
(Caused a commotion, doing the locomotion)
Was best by miles
And won top prize
At the Rainhill Trials

The Lords said it was dangerous then saw how many tickets could sell
(The toffs were off it, til they saw a profit)

Railways off pat
A massive hat
And to top that

I was a tunnel building
Bridge creating
Hard grafting
Ship crafting
Polymath in search of a way
To take my train through my tunnel, cross my bridge to my ship
And sail me fastest to the usa
My steam ship, it made the trip
In just fourteen days

There across the ocean was clever old me I'm quite a star
(He's Henry Ford, yes that's what he's called)
My assembly lines the first to make it cheap to buy a motor car
(From Henry Ford, cars you can afford)
I think you'll find
Made just one kind
But never mind

I was the fastest rating
Car creating
Introducing mass producing
Original Model T guy

We took an engine, a bird wing
Some bike skills, worked until we found out how machines did fly
Not just a hop
But non-stop
Gonna get high, high, high!

I'm Orville, was the brains
The brawn, my brother Wilbur Wright
We refined the plane and made the first sustained flight
Our engine small
But powerful
Propelled to a great height!

They were supreme
Our mean machines
The stuff of dreams

We were creative, inventive
Progress our incentive
Always searching for a solution
We took some steel and a wheel
Made a plane, car and train and created a revolution

Hard to believe what we achieved
Looking back, we helped change tack
Transport was duller, we added colour
Well, as long as it's black"

Was a time of great invention

Was it really? What did we invent then?

Well I'm just about to mention,
Drum roll please lets raise the tension
We invented this. Music hall.

Is that all?

Well...
A chap called Henry Bessemer invented molten steel
Which led to other chaps creating the automobile
Which let to petrol, tires and bikes so all that was required
Was roads so concrete came and tarmac thought up to

Your hired!

Ooooh. Concrete, tarmac, steel.
The automobile
Seal of rubber wheel
Such inventive zeal

Still there's plenty to reveal.

Victorian brains worked over time to come up with ideas.

We invented lights bulbs.

Nice one!

Cheers!

Type writers and radios, now news was fast conveyed. Hello?
A telephone was no good till a second phone was made. Hello!

Our inventors did not snooze,
Always had another rouse.
The latest flushing loo
Films that did amuse.
Flashbulb cameras to use.

What a picture! What a picture!

Vacuum cleaners, toilet paper, postboxes and stamps
Toilets, aspirin, anesthetics, locks, electric lamps.
Sewing machines, X-rays, comics, ice cream in a pot.
Easter eggs and rockets, we invented the whole lot.

Ooo... !

Hang on there's more

Trains and lines and bridges and the underground as well.
Paddle steamers prams and disinfectant for their smell
Sterile doctors instruments, one last unmentioned brand.
Victorians invented the worlds first conveyor band.

Cuddly toy?
Invented 1902. The year after Victoria died.

Oooohhh, barometers were new
Iron ships a coo
What genius!
Thank you.
Seems we're almost through

Just one little oversight...

Made nice villages.

Scunthorpe, Ormskirk, Wetherby, Scarborough fair…
We named them, yeah.

We split your isles diagonally from south-east to north-west.
Our section called the Danelaw, King Alfred ruled the rest.
Think we’re scary? No don’t flee.
Conquered Saxons would find we
Settled and lived in harmony.
Vike-Eng-land.

So well-planned, 
You accepted us as traders.
We introduced some new terms; 
Husband, gasp, egg, awkward, nag, leg.
More than fifty words to leave your lingo, 
To your liking, thank a Viking.
Your little town of Swansea City
Named for our King Sweyn.
Waterford and Dublin; 
Us old Norse Vikings again.
As farmers we made doubly sure
To respect agriculture.
With us, locals felt secure.
Norse-Scot-land; 
Large parts of that whole region
Norse got land
Were improved by Norwegians.
London Bridge is falling down
The nursery rhyme comes from our time.
Vikings played key roles.
In 1014 it was pulled down
By Olaf Haraldsson, 
You can call him Ol.
In a dispute with King Canute
Olaf’s side won.
Ethelred returned as king
And could be heard proclaiming
“Here’s to you, Olaf Haraldsson”.

Brought progress in science and art.

We gave you plague and disease.
Travelled, found the Incans, spread smallpox in a blink and brought them to their knees.
Dogs, cats and the French blamed for plague along the way.
We're History.

Victorian technology went hand-in-hand with poverty,
Kids up chimneys and down mines.
Improvements to the world did pick up despite some violent hiccups;
Two World Wars, millions died.

We reigned over you and told you what to do
And that is this story.

My life was a mystery
Some say born twelve seven two
Some say twelve sixty three

Was dubbed Malcolm of Paisley
Maybe Alan from Aire
Did I have a wife or no?
Do you really care?

They say I had a big, red beard
But all you need to know
I was a Scottish rebel
And the English were my foe

William Wllace, Scottish rebel!
This is war I cried!
Many English fought me
And many English died!

I took against the English
Back when I was fairly wee
'Cause an Englishman called Selby
Bullied my whole family
It upset me, so I struck him dead
Well, wouldn't you?
Then an English sheriff came along
Guess what, I killed him too!

They say he killed my wife
So he deserved what he got
Then England's King Ed came for me
Ooh, I'm scared! Not!

William Wallace, Scottish rebel!
Possibly six feet seven
But all that really matters is
I sent Englishmen to heaven!

Forty thousand English came
To Stirling Bridge for me
They had to cross a narrow bridge
To get to us, you see
We held them off, pushed them back
It was no contest
Bridge collapsed, hundreds drowned
Of course I killed the rest!

I celebrated Stirling Bridge
Another Scottish win
By decorating my sword
With the English general's skin

William Wallace, Scottish rebel!
Scottish legend too
Fought for Scottish freedom
Was a hero through and through

Here's where my rebel story comes unstuck
At Falkirk defeated, I'd run out of luck
Spent seven years playing hide and seek
Captured, sent to London, tried for treason
What a cheek!

King Ed hanged me, then a lovely touch
Pulled my guts out, guess he didn't like me much!

William Wallace, Scottish rebel!
In Scotland my heart lived
Though sadly, my head wound up
On a spike on London Bridge!

Ooh, that smarts!"

Up chimneys to clean
Paid pitiful wages

Get sacked by the master!

To stop machines and get you out
Will cost you a week's wages!

So if we get hurt
They will just replace me

I have to pick pockets
Wallets from gentlemen
And lady's lockets

Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me

I’m no longer a slave to my sin anymore

To the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding

You are here and You know me
All I need is You
And I love You
I love You
I love You

Breathe in me Your life
'Til Your love overtakes me
Open up my eyes
Let me see You more clearly
Falling on my knees
'Til I love like You love
Like You love me

But grace found my heart when logic ends
When justice called for all my debts
The Friend of sinners came instead

O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side
O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply
Cause in the highlands and the heartache
You’re neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find

[Pre-Chorus]
O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where your feet rest of the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past

[Chorus]
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain’s in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

[Verse 2]
O how high would I climb mountains
If you reserved your heart to the heights
But you carved a river through our lowlands
'Cross canyons far too deep and wide
O how fast would you come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failures
And walk me out the other side
For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same

No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the Heaven where my heart is

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I’ll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
My song of ascent

From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain’s in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You’re the Heaven where my heart is

Wherever you are, the needle will continue to spin
I lost the meaning of words.
Within the memories I'd set down.
Following the passed time,
You couldn't see...

Gently Rewinding the clock.
A distance between us. It connects with time,
Just as I grasped that small hand,
I woke up from an unwarrantable dream.

On the other side of your eyelids,
Little by little, your shape is changing,
Someday, all of this will be forgotten.
An I still won't know,
That this chest is burning.
Without caring, the needle of the clock spins.

Gently, rewinding the clock.
A distance between us. It connects with time,
Just as I grasped that small hand,
I woke up from an unwarrantable dream.

Just for a day
Less than 2 inches from you
Yet so far away
But this glass wall between us
Won't keep us apart
I will sing out my heart
Just for you, my love

The sound of your voice
Reaches through the noise
The bits of your words
They make up my world
But we're two worlds apart
My code, and your heart
But you'll be there for me
I'll be here, through your screen

If I could break through

Less than 2 inches from you

Los vierto en una copa helada

Abrн mi corazуn para decir, 'Que alguien detenga esto'
Entonces muy pronto, me di cuenta que aparecнa un impulso en mi
Ese dнa querнa escapar de esta jaula

Soltй una broma diciendo que ya no podia or. A nadie
Pero... їEso solo es una excusa para ocultar mi debilidad?

Cuando vi ideales increнblemente tontos
Y miraba en ellos sin saber por que
Una brillante luz parecнa casi tragarme
ЎAh todo esto rponto se derrumbarб! 

Mis sentimientos marchitos se dispersan
Y aquellos idelaes increнblemente tontos

ЎAhhh! 

Ahora expongan todas las mentiras
No hay nada que temer
Creo que eso podrнa facilitar las cosas
Asн que, їy si lo dejamos de una vez?
Este es un mundo infantil lleno de fealdad
Y lo siento por solo respirar
Pero el mundo aъn no es tan cruel

I will show how I feel

How hard I try to overreach myself, I would fail to get into your sight

Ah, a clear sky slid by, but it doesn't suit at all
I couldn't get hold of my feelings
How can I...What can I...

Crying...no, I'm not

I love you

Fight it out, shoot right at the heart

I shall make you gaze upon me

You said you wanted me; Where is that self now?
Pull and pull; pulling my lose threads.
I kissed your illusion.
Hug me, Hug me- Hug me until I break.
If I do break, throw me away.
With all your lies, you have no words to say.
Your feeling is no longer here.

To me, who had no reason to live.
You showed me,
Joy, happiness and hope.
The darkness that covered me is now gone.
The lenses reflected a shiver of light.

Love; the love deprived marionette you so wanted.
You said you wanted me; Where is that self now?
I can feel heat through the long strings.
I wanted to be one with you.
Pull, pull; pull me till I break.
I want to feel your presence.
I can not see your lie drenched face.
I can't remember your smile.

Sadness is slowing building up.
Love and hate for you; overflowing.

No matter how much I wish to return, I never move from this spot

When I close my eyes, you are always there smiling

Every time I remember that smile, tears flow from my eyes

I am not strong enough to say good-bye to the past and move on

Yet those memories are not flimsy enough to get carried away by the waves of time

That's why I've always...

I'll never forget, wherever I am

Whatever I do I'll always think of you

Even if I lose sight of the road I already traveled

Even if I cannot return to those days, the footprints on the ground will always be there

I will always wish that the day will come where we will meet

And laugh with eachother...

As I go by the crowd of people, I thought I saw you

Even though I realized it was a mistake, I still couldn't believe it somewhere in my heart

I can't remember the warmth I felt touching your hands

If I meet you in my dreams then I would never want to

Wake up...

Even if I tried to forget, the days I spent with you were so heavy

It's rooted in my heart and won't go away

I never knew walking alone was so lonely

The footprints that used to be next to mine were

No longer here... ?

The things I saw, the things I felt

All the things you showed me will always

Be with me no matter what lies ahead

Even If I fall, even if the road's gone

I won't stop moving forward

So please stay there with that same smile of yours...

I'll never forget, no matter where I am

Whatever I do I'll always think of you

Even if I lose sight of the road I already traveled

Even if I cannot return to those days, the footprints on the ground will always be there

I will always wish that the day will come where we will meet

Through this wall I mumble alone, ""love me""

I keep hunting out your personal love information
In the closed door of myself
I wish I could touch your face, stroke your face
My sweetheart!

Oh my, oh my you have a guest?
What a pretty girl she is
Tell me how much you love her
I'll kill her and pack her up

Burning photos of that girl
I wonder what she's doing now lol
You can do anything you want to me
Because I love you this much, see?

I want to keep you

Completely riveted

And I want to have a collection of you

Why are you crying?
What wrong? Oh, this one?
I'll affectionaly hold a cardboard box
That you will be put into when you're dead

I'll put a present behind the door
A kitten head every single day for you, a cat lover

Burning photos of that girl
I wonder if she ever existed lol
""I love you"" such a cliche doesn't satisfy me
But makes me want to puke

""I will...""

""Eternally""

""Love You..."""

Hukbalahap,Buhay Ng Gangsta,/h/hukbalahap/buhay+ng+gangsta_20731705.html,"(Teku Pu)
Pumasok ng gangsta sa edad ko 14 years old
Tinanggap 30 second massacre mata'y blindfold
Halos sumabog ang shoulder tiklop ko parang folder
Hindi naman soldier, pero ang war is not over

Akin burn ay forever nasa magkabilang daliri
Mga tusok ng karayom marka ng mananatili
Alam kong mali, pero buhay ko dito naging makulay
Bala ang alay para saming mga kaaway

Ang mawalay sa minamahal ako'y nakahanda na
Matyempuhang Kalaban ang edad ihihinto na
Pero teka muna, ito ba'y katotohanan
Mabigat na katanungan ano bang pinaglalaban

Ng dahil ba sa gang ang buhay mo'y isasakripisyo
Kahit alam mong hahantungan kulungan o nitso
Ang peligro at banta sa buhay namin ay likas
Bawat luhang papatak bala ang katumbas

[Chorus:]
Gusto mo ba na sumama
Saming mundo na madrama
Na may halong lungkot at saya at may kaba
Bala ang pang tubos sa sala ng iba
Ang kaligtasan sa isat-isa inasa
Yan ang buhay ng gangsta
Yan ang Buhay ng gangsta
Buhay ng gangsta

(Braduzz)
Lagi na lang umiinit ang aking ulo
O para bang gustong pasukin ang lahat ng gulo
Ang punlo lumalabas pag pumutok na ang baril
Ang pagiging ""G"" sa kalsada yan ang aking papel

Ako ay laging gigil kaya't minsan napapasabak
Sa away ng iba kaya't heto't napapahamak
Pero pag hinahamak umiiral na ang poot
Kundi suntok may tutumba na lang sa isang putok

Heto na ba ang sagot para masabi lang na ""G""
Hindi ko to pinili pero bakit nagsisi
Ang tulad ko pano kung kunin Mo na ako,
Sino na lang tititngin sa mga maiiwan ko?

Kaya't nagsusumamo pakinggan aking dalangin
Ang tamang daan ay ituro mo sa akin
Ng akin pang Makita pag bukang liwayway
At darating din ang oras kamay ko ng kumakaway

[Chorus:]
Gusto mo ba na sumama
Saming mundo na madrama
Na may halong lungkot at saya at may kaba
Bala ang pang tubos sa sala ng iba
Ang kaligtasan sa isat-isa inasa
Yan ang buhay ng gangsta
Yan ang Buhay ng gangsta
Buhay ng gangsta

(Sacred One:)
Mula noong 1998 buhay ko dito na ginugol
Dose anyos ang laro sa mga lespu magpahabol
Naging kakaiba ang pananaw sa kaedaran
Pinagarap na lahat ng gang ay mapang ibabawan

Habang di na alintana ang mga tao'y lumipas
Tumandang walang tinapos tila nagsayang ng oras
May mga tropang nangulungan at ibang di na lumutang
May mga nagbuwis ng buhay at naging pambayad utang

Ngunit tinuloy ko parin ang laban hanggang makilala
Ang pangalang O. G Sacred parang mayor ng manila
Hinawakan ang corquera permanent at ugbo
Tunay na ninong ng velasquez at roxas sa tundo

Nakipagsabayan sa mga hamon, humantong man sa patayan
At walang tigil na putukan ang ganti pag nalagasan
Ngunit isang katanungan ang naglalaro sa isip ko
Ito ba ang buhay na dapat manahin ng panganay ko.

[Chorus:]
Gusto mo ba na sumama
Saming mundo na madrama
Na may halong lungkot at saya at may kaba
Bala ang pang tubos sa sala ng iba
Ang kaligtasan sa isat-isa inasa
Yan ang buhay ng gangsta
Yan ang Buhay ng gangsta
Buhay ng gangsta

Our fallenness and mercy meet
Where blood and water flow

Verse 2:
What grace divine what selflessness
That Christ would bear the weight
Our proof is scarred on hands that bled
That we were worth every nail

Chorus:
And all the praise and glory to God
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah
For the King has carried the cross
He is risen from the grave

Verse 3:
Beyond the tomb to holy skies
He rose in victory
And bridged for us the great divide
His life is our liberty

Chorus x2

Bridge:
Your love
It's Your love
It's Your love
That has saved me

Your blood
It's Your blood
It's Your blood
That has claimed me

Bridge:
Oh-Oh-oh
Woah Woah

Man of sorrows Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of man and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten mocked and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns

Chorus
Oh that rugged cross
My salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out
Hallelujah
Praise and honour unto Thee

Verse
Sent of heaven God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree

Bridge
Now my debt is paid
It is paid in full
By the precious blood
That my Jesus spilled

Now the curse of sin
Has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed

Verse
See the stone is rolled away
Behold the empty tomb
Hallelujah God be praised
He's risen from the grave"

A cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray
Forget your woes and let your troubles lay

You will soon be dead from fright
So sailors tell their children on a dark and stormy night

Oh forty fathoms deep he walks
With rusty keys his locker locks
Just like he's half asleep he stalks
Forty fathoms deep
Forty fathoms deep he owns
Each sleeping sailor's soggy bones
The legend they call Davey Jones
At forty fathoms deep


Nor east we sail to brimstone head the captain crew and I
At 16 knots we fairly flew
Beneath a darkening sky
Atop the main mast I rode
Near 10 stories high
When up there blew an icy squall and over board went I

Oh forty fathoms deep he walks
With rusty keys his locker locks
Just like he's half asleep he stalks
Forty fathoms deep
Forty fathoms deep he owns
Each sleeping sailor's soggy bones
The legend they call Davey Jones
At forty fathoms deep

I hold my breath, I say prayer for all the mates who died
I turn my back on Davey Jones and cast my fears aside
Raise up my head and kick my feet
And toward the light I go
The heartless jailer left behind the locker far below

Oh forty fathoms deep he walks
With rusty keys his locker locks
Just like he's half asleep he stalks
Forty fathoms deep
Forty fathoms deep he owns
Each sleeping sailor's soggy bones
The legend they call Davey Jones

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail

When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here

There can be miracles

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says love is very near, oh [Oh]
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) [Though hope is frail]
Though hope is frail [Its hard]
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe [When you]

Everything I love is gone
Weeping as they lay my darling
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

In this world i'm left to wander
With no one to call my own
While my precious darling's sleeping
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Out there in that lonesome graveyard
She is sleeping all alone
And I burried my heart with her
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Skies above are dark and stormy
All the sunshine, all is gone
For the while my love is sleeping
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

My heart is dead and yet i'm living
Traveling through this world alone
I wish that I was with my darling
Neath a cold gray tomb of stone"

Headin' south from Caroline.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
Got in trouble, had to roam,
Left my gal an' left my home.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
Just a kid, actin' smart,
I went and broke my darling's heart,
I guess I was too young to know.
They took me off the Georgia Main,
Locked me to a ball and chain.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

All alone I bear the shame,
I'm a number, not a name.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
All I do is set [sic] an' cry
When the evenin' train goes by.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
An' my hair turns whiter than snow.
I'll never see that gal of mine.
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow."

Hank Williams,30 Pieces Of Silver,/h/hank+williams/30+pieces+of+silver_20630230.html,"Tis a sad but true story
From the bible it came
And it tells us how Judas
Sold the savior in shame
He planned with the council
Of high priest that day
30 pieces of silver
Was the price they would pay
30 pieces of silver
30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus
On the cross he was slain
Betrayed and forsaken
Unloved and unclaimed
In anger they pierced him
But he died not in vein
Twas on there on the hillside
The multitude came
And found our dear savoir
Then took him away
They bruised and mocked him
Thorns was crowned around his head
And his garment of purple
Showed the blood stains of red
Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun
Judas begged merci for what he had done
He gave back the silver
For his heart filled with strife
Then there in the mountain he took his own life
30 pieces of silver
30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus
On the cross he was slain"

To give you a heart true and real

Capo: 2nd fret/key: e/play: d
[d] in the worlds mighty gallery of pictures
Hang the [g] scenes that are painted from life [d]
There's pictures of love and of passion
Then there's [e7] pictures of peace and of [a7] strife
There hang [d] pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old [g] age and the blushing young [d] bride
They all [g] hang on the wall - but the [d] saddest of all
Are the [a7] pictures from lifes other [d] side.

[d] just a picture from lifes other side
Some-[g] one has fell by the way [d]
A life has gone out with the tide
That [e7] might have been happy some [a7] day
There's a [d] poor old mother at home
Shes [g] watching and waiting a-[d] lone
Just [g] longing to hear - from a [d] loved one so dear
Its just a [a7] picture from lifes other [d] side.

The first scene is that of a gambler
Who had lost all his money at play
An he draws his dead mothers ring from his finger
That she wore long ago on her wedding day
Its his last earthly treasure, but he stakes it
Then he bows his head that his shame he may hide
But, when they lifted his head - they found he was dead
That's just a picture from lifes other side.

Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heart-broken mother and babe
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an outcast whom no one will save
And yet, she was once a true woman
She was somebodys darlin and pride
God help her, she leaps - for there's no one to weep
Its just a picture from lifes other side.

Extra verse:
The next was a scene of two brothers
Whose pathways so diffrent had led
One lived the life of a rich man
The other one begged for his bread
Then one night they met on the highway
Your money or life, the thief cried
And then with his knife - took his own brothers life
Its just a picture from lifes other side."

As day was drawing to a close
My eyes beheld a tragic story
I saw a teardrop on the rose

It should have been a tear of gladness
But deep inside the sorrow shows
A trusting heart had just been broken
I saw a teardrop on the rose

A sobbing tear that follows parting
Holds all the pain that sorrow knows
A book to buy a life is shattered
There lies the story on the rose

The tear will dry the rose will wither
When spring and winter comes and goes
I loved, I lost, my story ended
With just a teardrop on the rose"

A hound in the distance is starting to bey
I wonder, I wonder - what she's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten - without any love.

But today I got her letter said she'd be my Cajun bride
Gonna go and wed my Cajun baby and I've by the old bayou
Eat a lots'a shrimp and craw fish ride around in my old pi-rogue
Way down yonder

Before the sun goes down this evening I'll be on my way
To see my Cajun baby and there I'm gonna stay
On a Saturday night we go dancin' and listen to the fiddle-o
Lord I got me a Cajun baby just a livin' and a lovin' by the old bayou
Way down yonder"

Yet youre afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Youll never know how much it hurts to see you sad and cry
You know you need and want my love yet youre afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just aint smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart"

Hank Williams,Country Boy Can Survive,/h/hank+williams/country+boy+can+survive_20817314.html,"The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River she's a groin' dry
The interest is up and the stock markets down
And you only get mugged if you go down town

I live back in the woods, you see
A woman and the kids, and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun rifle and a four-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long, I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do
We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

Because you can't starve us out and you can't makes us run
Cause one of ‘em old boy's raisin' ole shotgun
And we say grace and we say ma'am
And if you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trout line
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For forty three dollars my friend lost his life
Id love to spit some beechnut in that dudes eyes
And shoot him with my old forty five
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
Cause one of ‘em old boys raisin' ole shotgun
And we say grace and we say ma'am
And if you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We're from North California and south Alabama
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trout line
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive"

Hank Williams,Deck Of Cards,/h/hank+williams/deck+of+cards_21338493.html,"During the North African Campaign, 
A bunch of soldier boys had been on a long hike. 
They arrived in a little town called Casino. 
The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to church. 
A sergeant commanded the boys in church.

After the Chaplain read the prayer, the text was taken up next. 
Those of the boys that had a prayer book took them out. 
One boy had only a deck of cards, and he spread them out. 
The sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those cards."" 
After the service was over, 
The soldier was taken prisoner 
And brought before the Provost Marshall.

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man here?""
""For playing cards in church, Sir,"" was the response.
The Marshall asked the soldier, ""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""
""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier.
The Marshall stated, 
""I hope so, for if not I will punish you 
More than any man was ever punished.""
The soldier said, ""Sir, 
I have been on the march for about six months. 
I have neither bible nor a prayer book, 
But I hope to satisfy you, sir, with the purity of my intentions."" 
And with that, the boy started his story 

""You see, sir, when I look at the Ace, 
It reminds me that there is but one God.
And the deuce reminds me that the bible is divided into two parts: 
The Old and the New Testaments.
When I see the trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
And when I see the four, I think of the four evangelists 
Who preached the Gospel: there was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
And when I see the five, 
It reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; 
There were ten of them: 
Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out.
When I see the six, 
It reminds me that in six days God made this heaven and earth.
And when I see the seven, 
It reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from his great work.
And when I see the eight, 
I think of the eight righteous persons that 
God saved when he destroyed the earth: 
There was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives.
And when I see the nine, 
I think of the lepers our saviour cleansed, 
And that nine of the ten didn't even thank him.
When I see the ten, I think of the ten commandments 
That God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone.
When I see the King, 
It reminds me that there is 
But one King of Heaven, God Almighty.
And when I see the Queen, 
I think of the blessed Virgin Mary who is the Queen of Heaven.
And the Jack or Knave is the Devil.

When I count the number of spots in a deck of cards, 
I find 365, the number of days in a year.
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year.
There are four suits, the number of weeks in a month.
There are twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year.
There are thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.

So you see, Sir, 
My deck of cards serves me as a bible, 
An almanac and a prayer book.""

""And friends, this is a true story. 
I know, I was that soldier."""

It's headin' for destruction now

Oh, see the greatness of the crowd
That waits beside the track
They're leavin' on that Devil's Train
And never comin' back

Oh Lord, please stop that terrible train
Before it is too late
And teach them how to bow their heads
Before they seal their fate

The Devil's Train will take you
To a land of groans and pain
You'll spend your days in sorrow
If you ride that Devil's Train

Oh, listen to that whistle scream
Like echoes from the blue
The blood is white and spouting steam
She's on her way to doom

Oh Lord, please stop that terrible train
Before it is too late
And teach them how to bow their heads
Before they seal their fate

The Devil's Train is long and black
It's beautiful to see
It offers you temptation
But it gives you misery

So come and ride that glorious train
Where happiness is free
It's on its way to heaven now
To spend eternity

Before it is too late

The porch rotted down - that's more expense
The durned old mule - he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and - I can't pay

The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The durn rabbits - they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay

My lands so poor - so hard and yeller
You have to set on a sack of fetilizer to raise an umbreller
And it rains out here - nearly ever day

The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water
Up from the spring - about a mile and a quarter
My helper, he quit - for the lack of pay
But - were still a-livin - so everthings okay.

The house it leaks - it needs a new top
When it rains - it wets everthing we got
The chimney fell down - just yesterday
But - were still a-livin - so everthings okay.

The corn meals gone and the meats run out
Got nothin to kill to put in the smokehouse
The preachers comin sunday - to spend the day
But - were still a-livin - so everthings okay.

The canned stuffs spoiled - else the jars got broke
And all we got left is one old billy goat
Were gonna have a new baby about the first of may
But - were still a-livin - so everthings okay.

My crop it rotted - in the ground
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down
But - were still a-livin and were prayin for better days

But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Master's bouquet

Gathering flowers for the Master's bouquet beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels then carried away forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet

Loved ones are passing each day and each hour passing away as the life of a flower
Taken and cared for in heaven's own way forever to bloom in the Master's bouquet

Are away beyond the skies

More precious than diamonds and gold
Up there I'll meet my darlin'

In this world, I'm just a drifter
I know nothing but sorrow
But to me somehow it don't matter
For I know she's waiting up there

Heaven holds all my treasures
More precious than diamonds and gold
Up there I'll meet my darlin'

I stand on the banks of the river
And I stare at the water so deep
And think of my darlin'

[sung]
A little girl prayed at the close of the day,
Cause her daddy had gone far away,
On her little face was a look of despair,
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
My mommie says daddy has brought us to shame
And I'm never no more to mention his name
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly father help me understand

[recitation]
You know friends I wonder--
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said

Id like to tell you a story
Of a family I once knew.
Well call them mary and william
And their little daughter sue

Now mary was just a plain mother
And bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
(like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad

Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce

Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little sues expense

You know she didn't ask to be brought to
This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most

Thered be a lot more honest loving
In this wicked ole world today
If just a few parted parents
Could hear little sue say

[sung]
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly father, help me understand"

Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin spree
Cause there aint a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me
I eat three bones for dinner today, then tried to tree a coon
You got me chasin rabbits, scratchin fleas and howlin at the moon.

I rode my horse to town to day and a gas pump we did pass
I pulled I'm up and I hollered whoa!, said fill I'm up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham!, he changed my tune
You got me chasin rabbits, spittin out teeth and howlin at the moon.

I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard
But honey baby, when I fell the whole world must have jarred
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if you'd take me for your groom
You got me chasin rabbits, pickin out rings and howlin at the moon"

She read me the Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
She never close her eyes to sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights when we come home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away
We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key
For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
She seemed to fear that the world might harm the ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children're all with you now the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know that we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years tand then she went to sleep
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep I dreamed about mama last night"

I’ve traveled it long enough

Why don’t you act a little older
And get that chip off, of your shoulder
I’ve told you once, now I’ll tell you twice
You better start to treat me nice
’Cause I just don’t like this way of living"

I [c] wouldn't let my dear saviour [g] in
Then jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the lord [d7] I saw the [g] light.

Chorus
I saw the light I saw the light
[c] no more darkness no more [g] night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord [d7] I saw the [g] light.

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the lord I saw the light.

I was a fool to wander and astray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the lord I saw the light.

The love we shared is now a memory.
I had built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you,
And now,
I guess,
What is to be will be.

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own,
Drifting out across the ocean blue.
I'll sail my ship alone,
Though all the sails you've torn,
And when it starts to sink
Then I'll blame you.

I'm just like a ship at sea
That's lost without a sail,
The dark clouds hide the sun from up above.
And even with these broken dreams
My heart will never fail,
For deep inside there's only one true love.

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own,
Drifting out across the ocean blue.
I'll sail my ship alone,
Though all the sails you've torn,
And when it starts to sink
Then I'll blame you.

Gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you,
Hoping you would hear my s.O.S.
Maybe you would come back home,
My darling,
If you knew how much my aching heart
Is in distress.

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own,
Drifting out across the ocean blue.
I'll sail my ship alone,
Though all the sails you've torn,
And when it starts to sink
Then I'll blame you."

You can still learn a thing or two

Go get you some treatments just like I've had

Usually gets just what he deserves

So, this world would not be lost, Jesus died for me long ago
Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name
Jesus died for me long ago
What pain He suffered there, the holy one, so dear
So that you and I could live, I'll try to repay
For His sufferin' on that day, Jesus died for me long ago
Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name
Jesus died for me long ago
As He hung there all alone, His life's blood almost gone
He never stopped prayin' for me, so I'll follow all the way
And live with Him someday, Jesus died for me long ago
Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name
Jesus died for me long ago, Jesus died for me"

Nothing but darkness, no [a7] sunshine [d7] within
I [g] lifted my eyes, to the lord in the sky
And jesus re-[d7] membered [g] me.

And so he set me [d7] free

Glory to god, he re-[d7] membered [g] me.

Now the sun is shining, I'm happy and free
No more sorrow, no troubles to see
I'm going home to glory, my saviour to see

When he talked to his disciples at the sea of galilee
He said he'd remember a mortal like me
I asked for his blessing down on my knees
And glory to god, he remembered me."

WRITER HANK WILLIAMS
Little Bosephus, you're the one, makes me feel good inside
Just to know that you're my son makes my heart swell with pride
I've always needed one like you to love and understand
Now that you've come to fill that place, you're my buddy, man to man
There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice
The complicated phase of life is called ""adolescent age""
And sometimes breaks a father's heart---wish you could skip that stage
I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth
Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you
There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men
And the more we learn of love and life, the more they come crowding in
It's just little things at first, my son, then, as we grow older
Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet
So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude
On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude
Ah, Sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes
It's just a father's love, I guess, that comes to every Dad
That makes me want to shelter you from things that make you sad
Bosephis, boy, I'm standing by to help you when you call
For Son, you are my flesh and blood and the grandest pal of all"

Standing with all the angels on a golden stair
I thought I heard her whisper welcome home my boy
Last night I dreamed of heaven and it filled my heart with joy
I heard the angels singing songs of peace and rest
And then there was a silence
Each eye looked toward the west
There sat my Saviour on his golden throne
Last night I dreamed of heaven my eternal home sweet home
Last night I dreamed of heaven that land so pure and sweet
And the joy within me made my glad heart weep
I was there with my Saviour free from grief and strife

They started searchin' and then found him dead

And when I find me that river, lord I'm gonna pay the price, oh lord!

With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were paupers some were kings and some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts

We hid from the shower an hour or so
She asked me how long Id remain
I told her that Id spend the rest of my days
On the banks of the old ponchartrain.

I just couldnt tell her that I ran away
From jail on a west texas plain
I prayed in my heart I would never be found
On the banks of the old ponchartrain.

Then one day a man put his hand on my arm
And said I must go west again
I left her alone without saying goodbye
On the banks of the old ponchartrain.

Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell
I know that shes waiting in vain
Im hoping and praying someday to return
To the banks of the old ponchartrain."

Then you cry and ask the judge won't you please turn him loose
The good Lord only knows what I go through
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do
My life with you baby has been one hard knock
Lord my head looks like an old chop block
And I'll tell you right now honey that ain't all
You done kicked me till I feel like a used football
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do
You knock me down and then you pick me up
Honey do you have to love so doggone rough
I wish to my soul you'd slow down the pace
Cause I tell you right now the hide's gettin' sca'ce
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through
Will you please make up your mind what you want me to do
Why when I married you, you were such a meek little thing
But honey among tigers you'd be queen
If a poor little rabbit had you on his side
Every hound in the country would crawl off and hide
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through
Will you please make up your mind
What in the confounded cat hair you want me to do"

Lead me on, let me stand
I am tired, I am weak and I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light

Take my hand
Precious Lord
Lead me home

When my way grows unclear
Precious Lord, linger near
When my light is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
And hold my hand so I won't fall

Take my hand
(Take my hand)
Precious Lord
Lead me home

When the darkness appears
And the night is drawing near
And the day is almost gone
At the river I'll stand
So guide my feet and hold my hand

Take my hand

And lead me home"

I went to church with my mom once and they had an evangelist visiting who told the congregation that he was once a drunk and was doing drugs. At a party, someone was playing hank williams and the song ready to go home started playing. He listened to it for a bit and he said that the way hank sang it made chill bumps come up and that he threw the bottle down and left. He said that one song totally changed his life. So here it is, enjoy!

He loved ev'ry footstep, he loved ev'ry curl
But she went to heaven, just one year ago
The angels came for her, at The First Fall Of Snow.
He still had the dolly, that she used to love
He held and caressed it and gazed up above
He whispered my baby, ""You're waiting, I know
I'll bring you, your dolly, at The First Fall Of Snow.""
And there as I listened, my eyes filled with tears
I knew she was part of, his happier years
His frail body trembled, he spoke soft and low
I'll be with my baby, at The First Fall Of Snow.

He couldn't kno-ow, I was crying inside

Recorded by Hank Williams, Sr.
Writer: Unknown (Not Fred Rose or Hank Williams)
I was walking in Savannah past a church decayed and dim,
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn.
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew,
Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew.
Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild.
On the altar was a casket, and in the casket was a child.
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips,
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips.
Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk,
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque.
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race.
And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay,
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away.
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love,
But his sho-'nough father wanted him in the big house up above.
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles,
He just think you need some sunshine and He lent it for a while.
And He let you keep and love him til your hearts were bigger grown,
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan.
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow's way,
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today.
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round,
In the angels'tender garden of the big plantation ground.
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too"".
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song,
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long.
And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest,
And don't go to criticizn' the One what knows the best.
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray."""

To (G) judgement be- (D7) fore the white (G) throne.
From the throne came A bright shining (C) angel,
And he (G) stood on the land and the (D7) sea,
And (G) swore with his hand raised to (C) heaven,

The rich man was there but his money,
Had melted and vanished away,
A pauper stood there in the judgement,
His debts were too many to pay.
The great man was there, but his greatness,
When death came, was left far behind,
The angel that opened the records,
No trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there and the orphan,

No sorrow in heaven forever,

And they who had sold them the drink,
With people who gave them the license,
Together in hell they did sink.

The moral man to the judgement,
But self rightousness would not do,
For the men who had crucified jesus,
Had passed off as moral men too.

Not tonight I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of salvation,
At last they had found time to die.

We lived in a place
That they called Chapman Town

And late in the evening
When the sun was low
Way off in the distance
You could hear the train blow

The folks would come runnin'
and mama would sing
Get the supper on the table
Here comes the log train

Every morning
At the break day
He'd grab his lunch bucket
And be on his way

Winter or summer
Sunshine or rain
Every morning he'd run
That old log train

A sweatin' and swearin'
All day long
Shoutin' get up the oxens
Keep movin' along

Load'er up boys
'cause it looks like rain
I've got to get rollin'
This old log train

This story happened
A long time ago
The log train is silent
God called dad to go

But when I get to heaven
To always remain
I'll listen for whistle
On the old log train"

[G] Listen poor sinner; you're driftin' away
>From the Dear Saviour; who's pleading to-[D] day
[G] What will you do; when the Saviour ain't [C] nigh
When the Pale [G] Horse and his [D] rider goes [G] by?
The time now ain't long; when the Saviour will come
Then you'll be judged; by the deeds you have done
On that judgement day; you'll weep and you'll cry
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
When that trumpet sounds; on the sinners below
Not even the angels; in heaven will know
Then's when you'll wish; you had Jesus nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?
Won't you redeem; your poor wicked soul
You can't pay your way; with Silver and Gold
If you're not saved; you'll be lost in the night
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?"

Though life to him had been unkind
And as I watched, I cried in sorrow
Oh! Lord his burdens are greater than mine.
I can speak my name aloud
Make my way among the crowd
Yes, his burdens are greater than mine.
Just by chance I passed a graveyard
I saw a young man kneelin' there
In his hand, there were some roses
On his lips, there was a prayer
On a stone, these words were written
'Your soul is God's, your mem'ry mine'

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you

A lady of the evening and you know the penalty
Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin
We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now
And when you're in that juryroom just remember there and then
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done
Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands
This girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands
Those Broadway roses and prevalent sounds at too many parties and too many pals"

And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So, Why Don't You Love Me like you used to do.
Well, why don't you be just like you used to be
How come you find so many faults with me
Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue
Why Don't You Love Me like you used to do.
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer or further --> or closer"
Hank Williams,WHY SHOULD I CRY,/h/hank+williams/why+should+i+cry_20064204.html,"(C)Why should I cry, I (G7)never done you wrong
I kept my vows you left me all a(C)lone
You told me you loved me, you (F)told me a lie
(C)Why should I pay, tell me (G7)why should I (C)cry
You knew I worshipped you, right from the start
I gave you my love, never thought that we'd part
You didn't care enough, to even say goodbye
Why should I pay, tell me why should I cry
You know I miss you, now that you're gone
Life can be sad when you're livin' all alone
But darlin' I'll forget you, your memory will die
Why should I pay, tell me why should I cry"

From Hank Williams: The Singles Collection
Transcribed by: Ron Mcgough
[D] What's the use to deny we've been [G] living a [D] lie
That we should have admitted be[A]fore
We were [D] just victims of a [G] half-hearted [D] love
So why should we [A] try any[D]more
The vows that we make are [G] only to [D] break
We drift like a wave from the [A] shore
The [D] kisses we steal we [G] know are not [D] real
So why should we [A] try any[D]more
The dreams that we knew can [G] never come [D] true
They're gone to return no [A] more
[D] False love like ours [G] fades with the [D] flowers
So why should we [A] try any[D]more
Our story's so old a[G]gain has been [D] told
On the past let's close the [A] door
And [D] smile don't regret but [G] live and [D] forget
There's no use to [A] try any[D]more"
Hank Williams,Im So Lonesome I Could Cry,/a/al+green/im+so+lonesome+i+could+cry_20804759.html,"Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too good to fly
The midnight train whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry

Did you ever seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome that I feel I could cry, I could cry

Did you see, ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
[Incomprehensible] I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder, wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry, I could cry

And as I wonder, wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
If you let me, oh no

That you're my every dream
And yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme

A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold heart?

Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart, my heart is paying now
For all of the things I didn't do

In anger unkind words are said
And these are, these are the things that make the teardrops start
Why, oh why can't I free your doubtful mind?
Ooh honey, I'd really like to melt your cold, cold heart

Why, oh why can't I free your doubtful mind?
And I really, really like to melt your [Incomprehensible]"

That I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down
But if I only could

I love to see the towns go
Crawling by
There's something I got to do
Before I die

I love you, baby
But you got to understand
When the Lord made me
He made a ramblin' woman
He made me, he made me

Some people say
That I do just fine
'Cause I hear the sweet song
Moving down the mind

And when that old
Southern train come-a calling me
There's something over the hill
I just got to see

Well, I love you, I love you, baby
But you've got to understand
When the Lord made me, he made me
He made a ramblin' woman
He made me, he made me, yeah

When I'm gone and at my grave you stand
Just say God called home

Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick againt modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why I go for that
Rock And Roll Music ...

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and Roll music .....

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and Roll music ....

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo;
It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music ..."

I was a fool to wander and stray,
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right

This Kind Of Lonely

Sittin' alone and I hear rain fallin' on my windowsill
Just wanna do what's right but I don't know if I ever will
There's so many reasons, too many excuses
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses
And I'm so lonely
It's kind of scary
And this kind of lonely is making me weary
I'm so lonesome I could die

Sittin' alone and I am waitin' for the sun to shine
Sometimes I kneel and pray hoping someday you'll be mine
She's so many miles away
So many things to say
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway
Cause I'm so lonely
The s** is empty
But this kind of lonely makes it easy to tempt me
I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die

Sittin' alone and I am waitin' for somebody to call
Think if I up and died wouldn't nobody notice at all
Cause I'm so insecure and I feel so unsure
Can't take it anymore, no
It's never been like this before
And I'm so lonely, feel like cryin'
And this kinda lonely is worse than dyin'
I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die"

And then maybe my heart
Won't hurt me so.

But my tears I can't hide

Have really got me down

All the day we met, I went astray

Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now i'm lost, too late to pray

My woman ran away with another man

A lawyer proved I wasn't born, I was only hatched

Everything's against me and it's gotten me down
If I jumped in the river I would probably drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

Shake it, baby
Play the guitar, boys, play it, play it

These old shabby shoes, I'm wearing all the time
They're full of holes and nails
Hey, brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
I bet a nickel, I could tell ya if it was heads or tails

And I ain't gonna worry, wrinkles in my brow

With shoulders stooped and heads bowed down and eyes that stare in defeat
For souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all her parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the mistery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be if they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes or seen things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were pauperes some were kings and some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where you start
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken hearts

He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever let it show
So she could never answer yes or no.

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knoty pine.

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
Is there any wonder that his face is red
Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head.

Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no.

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knoty pine.

When God comes and gathers his jewels
All his treasures of diamonds and gold
You'll meet her up there in Heaven so fair
When God comes and gathers his jewels

Every night when the pale moon is shining
You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted up toward heaven

The roses have faded
There's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore

The grass in the valley has started to die
Out in the darkness the whippets will cry

Alone and forsaken
Oh lord if you hear me then hold to my hand
Oh please understand

Where has she gone to, oh where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away

The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to bay

Forsaken, forgotten without any love

Alone and forsaken
By Fate and by man

In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life? To try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

Why don't you spark me like you used to do?
And say sweet nothins like you used to coo
I'm the same old trouble that youve always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Well, why don't you just be like you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebodys changed so gimme a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you love me like you used to do?"

Hear the lonesome whipperwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

I never seen a night so long
When times goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide it's face and cry

Well maybe the night is cold
But together they fade
Like the shadow that ran up to the hills
Trying to fix her wings
There's a saint and a sinner
And forever the missing day
Where the winners and the losers feel the same
Who knows what tomorrow brings

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights a purple sky
And I wonder where you are
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry

Well maybe the night is cold
But together they fade
Like the shadow that ran up to the hills
Trying to fix her wings
There's a saint and a sinner
And forever the missing day
Where the winners and the losers feel the same
Who knows what tomorrow brings

Hear the lonesome whipperwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"

Y que llege a todas partes mi voz
No hay porque esconderse si todo se da
Como lo imagino, ese es mi destino
Solo me dejo llevar, solo me dejo llevar

Hay una respuesta que veo llegar
Y al mirarte siento que lo debo inventar
Si cuando algo empieza y un miedo a vencer
Ese es el camino, y ese es el destino
Hoy lo debo comprender, hoy lo quiero comprender

Hay que buscar el sol que ya comienza el día
Hay que buscar el sol que se asoma a tu vida

Si dejé las cosas siempre en la mitad
Hoy voy a arriesgarme un poco, solo un poco más
Una melodia me pone mejor
Suena diferente si abro mas mi mente
Y me toca el corazón, suena en mi corazón

Don't panic, panic

Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude I don’t think we have the choice
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Gotta look just right
Dressing to impress the boys

Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Where's the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird
Should I go movie star glamorous, sassy or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me

It's the night of our nightmares
It's the night of our dreams
It's too late to back out of it, hey!
Makeovers, massages, don’t know what a corsage is
Been waiting all our lives for this

It's gonna be a night, can’t wait
To remember, aw man
Come on now, big fun, alright
It’s gonna be the night, I guess
To last forever, lucky us
We'll never ever ever forget

Gettin' ready, get gettin' ready
Gettin' ready, get gettin' ready

So, what should I do with my hair?
Where's my shaver? Ooh, I love it
I look like a waiter, should I fluff it?
It's gettin' later, already should be there

He's here, it's time, the hour's arrived
Don't know why, her father's staring me down
Where's my purse? Lip gloss?
Now I'm really freaking out
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes

It's gonna be a night, oh yeah!
To remember, that's for sure
Come on now, big fun, alright!
It's gonna be the night, yeah tonight
To last forever, forever more

Who's that guy? I don't recognize
Who's that girl? She looks so good, yeah
Guess you never really notice, but you probably should

Big fun, on the night of nights, alright
The night of nights, tonight
Let's dance on the night of nights
You know were gonna do it right

It's gonna be a night to remember
It's gonna be the night to last forever

Its gonna be the night, love it
To last forever, the rest of our lives
We'll never ever ever forget

Siento que mis sueños, alguien más los comparte

Y mi voz se escucha más vamos todos a bailar

Make 'em like them my best friend
Telling their lies
And they can scheme behind my back
Make fiction not a fact
Try to re-write my life

But they ain't got a clue
If I were in their shoes
I'd shut right up

Take me as I am
Or not at all
I ain't ever gonna change myself for no one
No compromise
'Cause it's my life
It's all or nothing.

They can laugh all they like
Got no need to justify
I am who I am
And they can do their worst if they dare
If it makes them happy we don't care
It's out of their hands

'Cause they ain't got a clue
If we were in their shoes
We'd shut right up

Take us as we are
Or not at all
We ain't ever gonna change ourselves for no one
No compromise 'cause it's our life
It's all or nothing.

Take me as I am

¡Rrrrr aye aye aye - arriba!
¿Quieres bailar?
Mirame

[Verse 1]
I believe in dreamin', shooting for the stars
Baby, to be number one you've got to raise the bar
Kicking and a scratching, grinding out my best
Anything it takes to climb the ladder of success

[Pre-Chorus]
Work our tails off everyday
Gotta bump the competition, blow them all away

[Interlude (Spoken)]
Caliente
Suave

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we're gonna bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm
Jump and hop, hop til we drop
And start again
Zip, zap, zop, pop like a mop
Scoot around the corner
Move it to the groove, till the music stops

[Post-Chorus]
Do the bop, bop, bop to the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimme gimme, shimmy shimmy

[Verse 2]
Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction
Show some muscle, do the hustle

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we're gonna bop, bop, bop, bop to the top
Wipe away your inhibitions
Stump, stump, stump, do the rump
And strut your stuff
Bop, bop, bop, straight to the top
Going for the glory
We'll keep stepping up and we just won't stop (stop)
Till we reach the top

Looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want
Is to be over there
Why did I let myself believe
Miracles could happen
Cause now I have to pretend
That I don't really care

I thought you were my fairytale
A dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star
That's coming true
But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you

I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel
Like I could sing along
But then you went and changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's
Once upon a song

Now I know your not a fairytale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
Just don't come true
Cause now even I could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
Cause I liked the view and
When there was me and you

I can't believe that
I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And I didn't mind

Cause I liked the view
Thought you felt it too
When there was me and you"

Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever, 
Forever young.

Some are like water, some are like the heat, 
Some are like the melody of some other beat, 
But sooner or later they all will be gone, 
Why don't they stay young?

It's hard to get old without a cause, 
I don't want to perish like a fading horse, 
Youth is like diamonds in the sun, 
And diamonds are forever.

Forever young, 
I wanna be, 
Forever young, 
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever, 
Or never?

Forever young, 
I wanna be, 
Forever young (forever), 
Do you really want to live forever,

Or never?

So many adventures couldn't happen today, 
So many songs we forgot to play, 
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue, 
We'll let'em come true.

Forever young, 
I wanna be, 
Forever young, 
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever, 
Or never?

Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?
They lived with Zayn and his room was vile

Did you know Harry's such a slob?
He needs to win X-factor 'cause he can't get a job
And oh Louis needs a boat
He dresses like he owns one
'Cause he's got no other clothes
They really need your vote
Vas happenin' boys? Vas happenin' boys?

Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad
Vas happenin' mum? Vas happenin' Mick?
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad
Vas happenin' song? Vas happenin' sad?

And Zayn's the master of echos
And Niall was raised by leprechauns
So he won't ever grow
And oh Louis needs that boat
He dresses like he owns one

Gave the word now in the morning I sleep alone sweep the

Dead long live the king
All: I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing roman cavalry
Choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and sheald my
Missionaries in a foriegn field"

I'd buy a big house where we both could live

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while
I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

And you can tell everybody this is your song

It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that
I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

And you can tell everybody this is your song

Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

Oh, oooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
Was the one little thing that you can

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you

Like shelter from the rain

We live of faith
In the hands of those who guide us
And tear the page
On the fear we left behind
We set the pace
For every born survivor
Don't turn the other way
When I need to hear you say

Allies with our backs against the wall
I will answer when you call
And take on the odds
For what we believe is true
Allies in a world of too much choice
I only need your voice
To tell me you care
I'll be anywhere for you, allies

We search our hearts
To justify the reason
And draw the line
To meet somewhere halfway
If faith is blind
Through darkness it will guide us
'cause the spirit still remains
With the keepers of the flame

Allies with our backs against the wall
I will answer when you call
And take on the odds

And man that axe
Could sing and scream
Crying for that big breakthrough
Only small time local news

Just about to pack it in

Paid the way - broke the band

Every minute feels like days
Feels like time is standing still since you've been away

Broken down so low - so sad

You better not hide it
Let it come - let it bleed
I ain't laughing - reach in and get it
And set it free
Cry to me - Cry to me

The glass is empty and the wine
Is bitter on your tongue
People don't seen wild and fine
Like when you were young

You're lonesome over a stormy ocean
Lost in the rain and wind
We can clear these clouds away
And feel the sun again"

His eyes looking back like jewels
The call of the mirror - too strong to resist
The call of the water - the call of a kiss

It wants consummation
It moves on obsessed
Blodstream through pipes
Singing in the wires
Heat - motion - control

Calling you back by force of will
Where did you go?

Too much longing inside
You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise
I was the love in your eyes
You took me over
My innocence cracked
You own my passion
I want you back

Like a dirty demon daughter, don't put up no fight

Safe in the trees you had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers
Stealing your fires, the message hit my mind
Only words that I could find

Laughing to the sky, up to the sky

For the life of me I don't know the reason why
Maybe it's livin' making us give in
Hearts rolling in taken back on the tide
We're balanced together ocean upon the sky

Another night in this strange town
Moonlight holding me light as down
Voice of confusion inside of me
No begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through
Then the old man's words are true

Telling of riches only given if through

From your sleep!
Ahhh gentle romancers... Drink of Love
So sweet! ""

Treasure glowing in their eyes - Forest
Deepens dark their dream

Are more than they might seem""

Ending sounds
Call you into her mystery - are your eyes
Not sparkling now? ""

Sighing ""ahh! Take you no warning -
Make no foolish fight
Ahh, think not of morning - lie here
Through the Night! ""

""Beauty take us!"" they call ""In my arms!""
They hear her say
As the silken web falls, mist illusion rips away
""Helpless! Helpless!"" now they scream it
Helpless on the path he stands
And awakens from his dream singing string
Beneath his hand

Free the goal
Come and roll your arrow to my Soul - release the aim

Only to make it true

But when I'm alone all alone
No one home, the tv and the phone
Still say 'it will rain today""
O. K.

Hey darlin, darlin help me understand
What went wrong with the peaceful plan
Was it bold?

I ain't wishing for what used to be
I only hope that you and me can keep hold, unsold

When you go t no history, you're free
You sing and you believe so strong
You hold out fast and long, so long

Now the latest is the greatest is their plan
But they didn't make us and they can't break us
Darlin, darlin I don't think they can

I walk by Christmas windows full of things I'll never own
Things I cannot give you, my fortune's set in stone

And heals the melancholy heart, how beautiful, how beautiful
A candle in the window, it dances and it swirls
How beautiful the snow tonight, how beautiful the world
How beautiful

For some the table's laid and others are denied
Makes my love run deeper when I see how hard you tried
And just like you, the snow falls silent in the night

How beautiful the falling snow, it hushes on the world
And heals the melancholy heart, how beautiful
How beautiful a candle in the window, it dances and it swirls
How beautiful the snow tonight, how beautiful the world

Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?
I could get addicted
To your energy
The way you take me over
Pulling on me
Our hearts beat together
Our timing is the same
Can I trust my feelings
Save myself the pain?

Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?

Spare ourselves the misery
Discover it again every day
We could take love all the way

You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know
What I believe anymore
Or whether to leave, or whether to stay
Or what I can say
To make you know
How deep it goes

Somebody turned on the dirty blues
I know you don't like the blues
Cause the words are always the same
And they kind of remind you
Somebody turned the blues on me
I don't like the blues cause I can't see
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you

Come on down
Come on down
You've got to come lay down here and say those things
Those warm things, right here in my ear
The times that you had that water like wine
So clean and so fine to make me know how deep it goes
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know

Still fresh from the war, don't think about it no more

Turn on the radio and play it
And fall in love again
Can you feel the light shine
You now this song's yours and mine
Ain't it good to know you've got a place to go
Where the melody's fine
Sometimes I'm not so strong
And even now I could be wrong
But if you love me like music
I'll be your song

Lately the day's been grey
And time's been hard
Man up in town putting everybody down
Watch him play his card

Make each other really know it

You'll never be replaced

Is the song still in your ear
Were we only high
Just the wine
Only the times

When we're old
How will the story be told
Windswept smoke used by time
Waiting for the bus
Will that be us?

Selling our soul to buy

Sweet little love getting high getting down
Sailors see her running along the beach
Laugh and jump out of reach

Wild music blowing in her mane

I down need ~ deep I bleed for love
Wise ones say seize the day
Waste not time make your mind for love

We'll ride that rollercoaster up and down
No promise that we'll never crash to the ground

Same old day same old race
Just in case find a place for love
All to taste little grace of love

When days are gray we go downtown
We'll walk around and talk and talk it out
Under the cover of the old marquee see colors on the twilight street
We find a shelter in each other now the rain is like a symphony

I down need ~ deep I bleed for love
I down need ~ deep I bleed for love
I down need ~ I bleed"

Lying close by the fireplace
I wish you could see yourself this way my love
With the firelight upon your face

Ain't it strange how love put things together
One like you... someone like me
But no one ever moved me like the way you do
Held against your love I am weak

Before us now our dream of love is playing
A butterfly rising from the flame
You and me don't need no chains
Since this feeling came to us
A touch of love a lighter touch

A lighter touch than hands of love through time
Reaching up to have and to hold
You know I'll always stay if I am free to go
You know I'll take your love into my soul

Before us now our dream of love is playing
A butterfly rising from the flame
You and me don't need no chains
Since this feeling came to us
This touch of love
This lighter, lighter touch of love
This lighter, lighter touch."

Making your passion play - little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind -
Little queen

Away from the sellers, the papers said
Your crown was tight and heavy on your head
Still you danced and you sang - all night
The telephone rang
Music kept on playing from your pen.

Hot on the presses today - little queen
Making your passion play - little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind -
Little queen

Raining Raining- he knows your Soul ain't free
Raining Raining- he feels you little queen

Slipping away with your gypsy band
Hot on your music and playing a winning hand
He was standing in the line, thinking how you
Moved his mind
Feeling like he held you in his hand"

I knew I had to keep my Love
Keep my Love alive
Keep my Love - Keep my Love live

Hold me in your love
No more habits, promises and jive
Ever since I was a baby girl
Wanted one thing most in this world
It was to Keep My Love -
Keep My Love alive

I want to keep my Love -
Keep my Love alive
Keep my Love - keep my love alive

So we made our own escape
In that new york cafe place to be
Outsider, traveler you and me
We were laughing about it
Kept us out of reach

I won't forget that light
Through the window and the lace
Making patterns on your face
Exposed with all your pain
I know it hurts the worst
That very first love mistake
You said we'll still be sitting
Here again someday,
Laughing at ourselves this way
After time has healed and made it right
We'll still be looking in each other's eyes
And through it all
It's friends who will survive
I won't forget that night
I won't forget that light
Through the window and the lace
Making patterns on your face
Exposed with pain
I know it hurts the worst

Shining prince inside my head,
Live inside a palace underneath my bed

Typewriter steel and gray, work away, everybody's going home
Over across town, caught in a crowd, still living alone
Little room for her out of the rain
A little something for the pain
Lady-in-waiting potentially for the lord of the rock 'n roll aristocracy
Dreaming in photographs at night, love's like sand held in your hand so tight

And everybody know who they are in a velvet garden of rhinestone stars
Shine down on me satin queen, overlords of insane scenes

Everyday's like the day before
Come in tired and lock the door
Paint your space with magic hands
Shining slick and dandy
Shining slick and dandy
Smile at your fans

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen.
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen.
I was introduced and we both started groovin'.
I said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on.
Keep movin' on.""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

Well, I don't know, but I've been told,
You never slow down, you never grow old.
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down,
Tired of myself, tired of this town.

Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.
Honey, put on that party dress.
Buy me a drink, sing me a song.
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long.

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

There's pigeons down on Market Square.
She's standin' in her underwear,
Lookin' down from a hotel room.
Nightfall will be comin' soon.

Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.
You got to put on that party dress.
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone.
I hit my last number and walked to the road.

Far beyond the death

A restless sailor waiting
I closed my eyes said the
Words of will for the gentle
Breathing that moves the seas
Make my sails fill

Whisper waves cloud the glass
Awake at last like a lover
It rushed around me talking sweet
Roll over, roll over, roll over
And in my ear he blew his name
It sound so strange but I heard it plain
Mistral, mistral wind

I have always held the wheel but
I let the wind steal my power
Spin me 'round lose my course
Nights run by like hours
Well, it would show me the way
To the deepest mountains
Too high and beautiful to be
Mistral, mistral wind

All the hours on the watch
I wait for that breeze to move me
And blow me back to that place
Magic space all through me
And I sigh your name
Across the empty water
You made a crazy dreamer out of me

That rose trees never grow in New York City

You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes I might join in
I'll go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found"

In the catacombs of styrofoam out of mind and out of sight

Filling up my open eyes

All the gusts of English Bay
Singing on an ancient radio
And a young girl with a burning heart
Stares down at the big ships anchored far below

And she knows where she is going
Cause her very soul is glowing
And in this gentle harbor
She don't need to go no farther

With no loverboy to hold

Till he comes home to lift you out of this haze
You dream all day, climb the walls all night
No satisfaction till he makes it right

So hard to lick

Heart,The Night,/h/heart/the+night_20064724.html,"Deep in the darkness slumber
Endless sleep
Nothing moves inside my funeral suite
I feel the sun slip down as hunger strikes
Waking like being born
Here comes the night

All my senses awakened
By little demons
Taste the human heartbeat
Bittersweet
Bittersweet

Don't take long
To get back in the groove
Sharpen up you attitude
Get down with the moves
Don't look no stranger
In the eye
Walk across some trouble baby
Just walk on by

No tomorrow - take it right now
In the night I walk alone
In the night is where I belong
Take my flesh - I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on

Neon concrete jungle
Devour the weak the humble
Hear the city nocturne
Makes you burn

Oh, slip on into darkness
Sharpen up your awareness
Get your seven senses working tonight

No tomorrow - take it right now

In the night I walk alone
In the night - that's where I belong
Take my flesh - I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on

No tomorrow - take it right now

In the night I walk alone
In the night - that's where I belong
Take my flesh - I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on

In the night I walk alone
In the night - that's where I belong
Take my flesh - I'll give you my soul
Hungry night keeps driving me on
On and on"
Heart,The Perfect Goodbye,/h/heart/the+perfect+goodbye_10141177.html,"Do you see me ~ do I see you
And all the footprints we left in this room
A smile in the hall ~ framed on the wall
Do we way words that rise and fall like the circles of blue

Shoes on the floor ~ they're intertwined
Just like the touch we left behind
Walk through the door and say no more
Say no more easy alibis to put out the fire

[Chorus:]

It's the perfect goodbye
No time no tell ~ as from your lips the words that never fell
It's a simple farewell
No fight no flight ~ no live no die
No me no cry cry cry cry
No me no cry

Hang up the phone ~ I should have known
Better alone that killing time with fake valentines

[Chorus:]

I'll see you sometime ~ once in awhile
No partners in crime ~ just a face in the file

Heart,The Situation,/h/heart/the+situation_20064801.html,"Go to the city away from the land, stand in a line
Where they stamp your hand, wind up at a dance
You want to energize, is it just by chance
People have electric eyes

Wires and strings, line that lead to power supplies
Games read green on table screens, charged and powered
Mediaized, we are channeled, we are hypnotized

Wake up, shake up the situation
Hold on, help the situation
Human condition, so extreme, you can see it feeding the new
Machine

There is still a dream, our humanity, hero rebels die
Leaving us the key
Wake up, shake up the situation
Hold on, help the situation"

Licking on a silver spoon
Think you gotta buy all your friends

I've seen it all before
A parasite in a good disguise
Just another wolf at the door
The wolf
Prowling in the nighttime
The wolf
Howling in the moonshine
The wolf
Gives you what you want but he ain't no friend of mine
You lay it on oh, so sweet
Just like that bad cologne
Just smiling tooth and nail
You gotta make your presence known
But you are only a lonely hunter
Some things you can't disguise
Just to look in the hallway mirror
Now it's howling in your eyes
The wolf
Prowling in the nighttime
The wolf
Howling in the moonshine
The wolf
Gives you what you want but he ain't no friend of mine
Silent, slick and stalthy
Slinking through your evils nights
You can see in the dark they tell me
The daylight burns your eyes
I know you're trying to track me down now
You're right on my trail
Your think you're going for the big big game
But you're chasing your own tail

Prowling in the nighttime

Howling in the moonshine

Gives you what you want but he ain't no friend of mine"

It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me
Baby there's so much no man has ever touched of the woman in me

I might be trembling but I'm not scared
Just my desire breaking free
I've never had a chance like this before to unlock all the doors to be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me
Baby there's so much no man has even touched of the woman in me

Like the dark side of the full moon
I've never shown what I'm showing to you
It's so easy with you I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me

To forget her name

Heart,These Dreams,/h/heart/these+dreams_20064760.html,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"

Then you took it just a little to far
Now I see you for what you are
I don't need the heartache anymore
Lovin' you was an endless fight
I was wrong and you were always right
But look what happened when I called your bluff
When the truth comes out
You aint' so tough - no
You turned me into an emotional prisoner
You hit me with words that cut to the bone - oh
Then you kissed me and made me believe that I needed you
And think I could never survive on my own - oh no
Never thought that I would break away
Now I see right through your power play
And I don't feel so helpless after all
Lovin' you was an endless fight
I was wrong and you were always right
But look what happened when I called your bluff
When the truth comes out
Hey, you aint' so tough
You took me too far to forgive it
That was your last mistake
That was your last mistake
Lovin' you was an endless fight
I was wrong and you were always right
But look what happened when I called your bluff
When the truth comes out
You aint' so tough
You take it all but you don't give back
You feel strong when the odds are stacked
There comes a time when enough's enough
When the truth comes out
You aint' so tough
You aint' so tough"

Hezekiah Walker,Breakthrough,/h/hezekiah+walker/breakthrough_21282035.html,"I told somebody I was looking for a miracle and then they go
And try to conjure up a resolution for my hang-ups
But it cannot be done
I told them what I need was a supernatural act from God
Then they looked at me like I was so crazy
Like it was too hard

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

I told somebody I was sick in my body and they they read
Me a list of all the doctors in this pamphlet but not if they’re human
What I have it doesn’t require a vaccine or anything
What I need is the healing virtue of the Father not a doctor

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

Some people try to help me out others try to pull me through
But they cannot figure out what they can’t get it right
Sorry but it’s not your fault- I’m in need of a breakthrough
Everybody’s praying for me putting in petitions for me
Trying to keep the faith as wait for a breakthrough
Wrestle with the angels until we get a breakthrough

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and
Be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough."

Of my enemies, and if God did it for me he'll do the
Something for you. Don't worry about your haters your haters
Can't do nothing with you. Listen to these words

Verse 1
Love is patient, caring. Love is Kind. Love is felt most when
It's genuine, but I've had my share of love, abuse, manipulated
And it's strength misused, and I can't help but give you glory
When I think about my story, and I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

I'm still here, I'm still alive, I'm still blessed, on my way to
My destiny, because the favor of God is on my life. Let me
Tell you about love.

Verse 2
Love is patient, caring. Love is Kind. Love is felt most when
It's genuine, but I had my share of love, abuse, manipulated
And it's strength misused, and I can't help but give you glory,
When I think about my story, and I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

Verse 3
They whispered, conspired, they told their lies (God favors me)
My character, my integrity, my faith in God (He favors me)
Will not fall, will not bend, wont compromise (God favors me)
I speak life and prosperity and I speak health (God favors me)

Never have I spent a day without you on my mind.
And I've tried a lot of songs and I need to try one that's new.
But I don't have anymore love songs to try on you.

We just can't ever get it together it seems.
You'are arm's don't hold me the way that they do in my dreams.
And it's hard to make up things that you never do.
And I don't have anymore love songs to make up about you.

I don't have anymore love songs to write for you.
Too many I wrote before have never come true.
And it's hard to make up lines for things you don't do.
And I don't have anymore love songs to sing for you.

And enough memories for one man's life
(That is true)
The one I love, she ain't comin' back ever
So it looks like I've got my future on ice

I got bottles and cans
That just left my hand
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit

O love let me down
Now a truer friend I've found
Why I've got my future on ice

There was a time, she was my one and only
Until someone else caught her eye
Then for awhile, can you believe I was acting so lonely
Now I've got my future on ice

I got bottles and cans
That just left my hands
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit

Yes love let me down
Now a truer friend I found
Now I've got my future on ice

O love let me down
Now a real true friend I found
Why I got my future on ice"
Hank Williams Jr.,A - EEE,/h/hank+williams+jr/a+eee_20216865.html,"She's got soft finger tips and a warm red ruby lips. She 24 in the waist and 36 and 38
She's is pretty as she can be and got a beautiful body
And when she makes love to me I can't help but hollar A-Eee!
They say that I'm a crazy cajun always rantin' and a ravin'
But they don't know what they're missing if they ain't never had her kissin'
In the car or in the shower I'm thinkin' of every hour
And sometimes I get this urge to just hollar 'cause I love her
I jumped up in a bar one night when I was feeling alright
Let out a great big A-Eee and the sheriff said come with me
Well he threw me into the jail I guess he didn't like my Louisiana yell
But a man come and bailed me out and said in his mind there was no doubt
That I could be a big star probably get myself a brand new car
I says you mean your going to pay me just to hear me hollar A-eee!

Yes he said that's right son! We're gonna make a million
So we went to Nashville town. I made a record and it played all around
From then on they were Number 1, but I wasn't having no fun
I miss my Cajun Baby and all that good A-eee!
So I went on back to Louisian' to find my girl and have a love again
'cause after all she's the one you see that made it all happen to me
She's my soul and inspiration and soon her love I'll be tasting
Oh she's drivin' me crazy with all of her A-eee!
She's got soft finger tips and a warm red ruby lips
Well she's 24 in the waste and 36 and 38
And she's as pretty as she can be. She's got a beautiful body
And that's all that matters to me. Me and my baby and A-eee!"
Hank Williams Jr.,A Country Boy Can Survive,/h/hank+williams+jr/a+country+boy+can+survive_21131197.html,"[Verse 1]
The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River she's a goin' dry
The interest is up and the stock market's down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown
I live back in the woods, you see
My woman and the kids, and the dogs, and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke, too
Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Chorus 1]
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Verse 2]
I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just ""hillbilly""
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars my friend lost his life
I'd love to spit some beech nut in that dude's eyes, and shoot him with my old 45
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Ma'am
And if you ain't into that we don't give a damn
We're from North California and south Alabama
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, and run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

[Outro]
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive"

Nothing I could say ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon, up ahead, it looked like a place

To find some satisfaction
With a little less talk and a lot more action

I paid the man at the door and pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen to a word he said

I knew somewhere amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk and a lot more action

A little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action

Well she was fighting them off at a corner table
She had a long neck bottle, she was peeling the label
The look on her face, it was perfectly clear
She said, ""Somebody please get me out of here""

The look she shot me through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk and a lot more action

A little less talk if you please
A lot more loving is what I need
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action"

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin' seems
I hear your voice a callin' it's all right
On this rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia

I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Neon signs a flashin' taxicabs and buses
Passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain onto the night
On this rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia

I think, it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I have wondered
But it always comes out the same
No matter how I look at it'll think about it
It's just like some of its pleasures
Some of its pain

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And then I'm all right
But it's still a rainy night in Georgia
It's a rainy night in Georgia

I believe it must be rainin' all over this world
All over the world rainy night in Georgia"

And go by my house today
No, I can't visit her or my son
I'm supposed to stay away

But it won't hurt to bring back old memories
'Cause after all they used to all belong to me

Now there's our car
The one that I'm still paying for
And in the front yard
Lord, I see my little boy
And there's his mother
I hope she's doing fine
Oh Lord, I'd give anything
If they were all still mine
But they're not
And I'm the one to blame
I should have known I'd never win
When I played that cheating game
This other man holds my life
And my son calls him daddy tonight

But how can I complain?
'Cause after all they used to all belong to me
How can I complain?
'Cause after all they used to all belong to me"

Maybe that would help me get it all off my mind

I made it up to the top, picked out a clear spot
I thought a whole lot about the rest of my life
I had no idea then soon it would nearly end up
On this mountainside I would nearly die

And there all in Alabama and there all in Dixieland
God, I'm dying here in Montana
Please Lord, just want to go back to hold her hand
Just let me get back to my old homeland

They said I'd never sing again
I learned a lot about my friends
'Cause when you’re shot down and out
You don't get many calls
But I saw some tears in some eyes
And soon my poor old mother would die
I nearly lost it all when I lost my Grandpa

But you could find us all in Alabama
Yeah, we're all down in Dixieland
I didn't die out in Montana
No, Lord, you let me get back to my own homeland
And I'm gonna hold on to her hand

I done a whole searching, a whole lot of hurtin'
Before I finally found my road in life
You got to say things you want to say
Go on and do things your own way
You can climb any old mountain
Once you make up your mind

And I made mine in Alabama
And I found mine down in Dixieland
I didn't die out in Montana
No, Lord, you let me get back to my ole homeland
And I'm gonna hold on to her hand"

Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud. Everybody just wants to go back home.
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the page,
But I need to find a friend just to run around. But no one wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down.

And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway and old George Jones I'm glad to see he's finally getting straight,
And Waylon staying home and loving Jesse more these days,
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have settled down.

And the hang overs hurt more then they used to and corn bread and ice tea took the place of pills and ninety-proof,
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town and all my rowdy friends have settled down.

Yeah I think I know what my father meant when he sang about his lost highway and Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kriss he is a movie star and he's moved off to L. A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah me and my rowdy friends have rowdied on down."

You can do anything that you wanna do

I almost forgot where I come from
Ain't got no money but I still ain't a bum
I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb

A back last summer down by the sea
I seen a pretty girl in
I snapped my fingers, said son of a gun
She's almost nearly but not quite plumb

Some people wonder how I live
Sometimes I pick, sometimes I give
People say I'm a bum
I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb

I met a pretty girl up in Chicago
She said, honey baby, I love you so
She begged me to stay and not act like a bum
I've been almost nearly but not quite plumb

Friends ask me why I don't take a wife
Settle down to a married life
They say it's good as most and it's better than some
I say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb

Some people wonder how I live

Just the other night out in Tucson
I had a little date with a great big blonde
I took her home, she said didn't we have fun
Hmm, almost nearly but not quite plumb

When it's time for the final date with
Old Saint Pete's at the pearly gate
He'll say I hope you're ready for your time's come

I met a girl with a drink of beam in her hand
She had ruby red lips and coal black, black hair
And eyes that would tempt any honky tonk man
Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like cheap honky tonk wine

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered I need you
Take me away from here and be my big ol' southern man
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw that look and
I saw something else the reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded to stip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home

That was really hard to do"

Sometimes I think that my trains done gone.
The way all old things must do.
Yet I still wait for it's return,
Just like I still wait for you.

And I still hear that old whipperwill.
I've seen the ghost of the midnight train.
And I still love to walk alone,
Down by the old union station in the rain.

Now I don't know where you are tonight,
But I feel you across the miles.
Am I still standing there inside your mind,
Just behind a pretty smile.

Hey babe, can ya hear that old whipperwill?
Have ya seen the ghost on the midnight train?
Do you still love to go alone,
Down by the old union station in the rain?
Down by the old Montgomery station in the rain."

If you blew in from Boston, no, you sure won't have to wait,

About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars,
And the good old American way.

I've noticed I don't get much help when they see my blue jeans,
Some slick with a suit walks up, ""Oh, can I help you please?""
Yes, I'm learning, as I gain a little age,
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars,
And the good old American way.

Some high society lady says, "" Is your horse outside?""
""No, ma'am he's between my legs, but you're too fat to ride!""
And you're learning, a little more about my ways,
And what I think about your dollar and your white collar,
And your good old American way.

If you don't like my Nudie boots, I'm sorry about that,
Don't make fun of my hat, too, or you might get knocked flat,
And you'll learn some more, if you ever pass down our way,
About the folks without the dollars, and without white collars,
Hell, they are the American way."

I got a cabin in the country where I go sometimes
To clear my head and get away
Got my channel on tv, no laptop for me
Cold beer, smile on my face

You better think twice
Before you turn that damn computer up
There's so much more to see than that old office routine
So forget all that logon stuff

Be an American offline
Go out and have yourself a good time

On that lily white business suit skin
Why don't you go and get a beach front room
Make some noise and wear your hat in the pool
Make some love in the day time

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligator for a living
He just knock them in the head with a stump

Louisiana law gonna get ya Amos
It ain't legal huntin alligator
Down in the swamp now
Well everyone blamed his old man
For making him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait

Time for? And chokin in the swamp
Alligator babe in a Louisiana bayou
About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodaux Louisiana
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap
And his pretty white Hannah
They raised up a son who could
Eat his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around South Louisiana
Thought Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left
Cause the alligator bit it
Left on gone, clean up to the elbow

Well the sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp hutnin alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp
Tried to get the boy
And he never came out again

Well I wonder where the
Louisiana sheriff went too?
You can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou
About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodaux Louisiana
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap
And his pretty white Hannah
They raised up a son who could
Eat his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Sit down on em Amos

Someone that I can call my darling
If You can think of someone to fit that description
Lord could You help me one more time?
But I know Lord, angels are hard to find

It's my fault I lost the first one You sent to me
I didn't know 'til she was gone how much she meant to me
She loved me but I was blind, I bet I do a whole lot better next time

Hank Williams Jr.,Attitude Adjustment,/h/hank+williams+jr/attitude+adjustment_20543214.html,"Now I met an old friend 
In the bar the other night 
And he got a little drunk 
And he wanted to fight 
And he jumped up 
And challenged every man in the room 
And just about the time he got the words out 
An 'ol boy jumped up and closed his mouth 
And used his head for a mop 
And his butt for a broom 

It was an attitude adjustment 
I guess it was his first time 
An attitude adjustment 
Now he understands just fine 
He got bent out of shape 
And he opened his mouth 
And just one appointment 
Straightened him right out 
It was an adttitude adjustment 
Oh It'll work every time 

Well I've got this big 'ol brother-in-law 
And me and him just never did get along 
Because he wants to make sure 
I'm treating his sister right 
He got drunk one night 
And started beating me up 
And I went and got a tire tool 
Out of my truck 
And laid him out as cold as a block of ice 

It was an attitude adjustment 
And it will work every time 
An attitude adjustment 
I made him see the light 
And he says I'm his kind of man 
And he comes around with his hat in his hand 
It was an attitude adjustment 
I cured all his family pride 

Now my girlfriend slapped me in the face 
I said darlin that was you're first mistake 
Then she went wild and her eyes turned red 
She started breaking everything 
And sceaming loud 
And kickin me and cussin me out 
And I gave her a little adjustment 
On the top of the head 

It was an attitude adjustment 
Now she loves on me all the time 
Just an attitude adjustment 
She got a whole new frame of mind 
She don't nag 
And I don't beg 
And we get along and like I said 
Just an attitude adjustment 
Oh everythings just fine 
Well almost 

She called the cops to take me in 
And I said you're never gonna do it friend 
And they just smiled 
And said ""Oh Yes We Will"" 
Now a stick to the head 
And some kicks in the chin 
And a several bites from Rin Tin Tin 
And I couldn't wait to get into that jail 

It was an attitude adjustment 
Oh I went along peacfully 
Attitude adjustment 
Oh they made me cleary see 
Cause my head is black 
And my legs are blue 
And both knee caps are bent clean through 
It was an attitude adjustment 
It made my whole outlook brand new 
Just a attitude adjustment 
It made my whole outlook brand new"

Hank Williams Jr.,Ballad Of Hank Williams,/h/hank+williams+jr/ballad+of+hank+williams_20155940.html,"(Don, tell us how it really was when you was working with daddy)
Well, in 1950, I took a little nip
Along with Mr Williams on the way to Mississippi
We were stacked eight deep in a Packard limousine
When we met this promoter in the town of New Orleans
Well the man told daddy he had what it took
And he liked the way he sang and he liked the way he shook
He said pretty soon he'd make us all rich
And we started believing that fat sumbitch
Now daddy told the man if you wanna make some dough
Take a little money and book me on a show
And we played them dates and we filled the places well
But Hank he done blowed the profit all to hell
Cause he'd run through a ten and he'd run through a twenty
And he'd run through a hundred just as hard as he could go
Like a big (unknown) to a little bitty feller
He'd spend a thousand dollars on a hundred dollar show
Hank looked at me with a funny looking grin
Said I been to the Opry and I'm going back again
We met the owner in a little office there
A big fat fella with some artificial hair
He told Hank he wanted half of everything he made
Or he'd have to tell Audrey bout some women Hank had laid
And you told daddy he'd better get smart
Get rid of them fellas and make a new start
Then he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired every body just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Well every song he made it went to number one
Y'all was workin like hell and you was havin fun
We was ridin every day and playin every night
And every twenty minutes some of us had a fight
Now daddy he was makin money hand over fist
And y'all was getting screwed but you wasn't gettin kissed
Yeah I told him to pass a liitle bit around
But he said he'd rather send it to his folks in Alabama
So he fired your ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Now the owner of the Opry he's doin pretty good
He's got a music company that they call Cedarwood
And Hank played nothin but sold out halls
And I was pumpin gas in greasy overalls
Cause he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Hank'd run through a fifty and he'd run through a hundred
And he'd run through a thousand just as hard as he could go
Buying Cadillac coupes paying double alimony
And he fired some people that he didn't even know"
Hank Williams Jr.,Be Careful Who You Love (Arthur's Song),/h/hank+williams+jr/be+careful+who+you+love+arthurs+song_20815635.html,"The old guitar picker had run out of liquor
So I sat down beside him and bought him a drink
Then I bought him another and finally some color
Returned to his cheeks and he said with a wink

""Son, I worked with your daddy, I knew Ernest and ol' Lefty
I played on the Oprey back when it was strong
But it's show-biz you know, sometimes it gets slow
So buy me another and I'll sing you a song""

""Be careful who you love, for love can be untrue
Be careful who you love, be sure she loves you too""

Well, you like it, I see and that's real pleasin' to me
'Cause Bocephus, I've wrote hundreds and some you know well
I wrote and sold 'em, they bought 'em and stoled 'em
But paper is cheap, why they're just tunes, what the heck

Then he tried to sell me the song he'd just song me
I told him that song is a piece of your soul
""Keep your song, here's some money"", said Hank Jr.
""Bless you, son""
And I heard him singin' as I walked out the door
He said, ""Now Hank remember""

""Be careful who you love, for love can be untrue
Be careful who you love, be sure she loves you too""

Well, that was about a year ago and now friends wouldn't ya know
The songs a big hit, some superstar claims he wrote
He sings it and grins and the money rolls in
It's a wonder the words don't stick in his throat

Now I think of that writer, his name was Arthur and I often wonder
Just how many hit songs he sold in his time
And how many men take the gift that God gave 'em
And throw it away for the pretty red wine, quite a few

Be careful who you love, for love can be untrue
Be careful who you love, be sure she loves you too"

Where's the good loving you use to give
Alone is a bad bad way to live
Arms so soft, lips so sweet
Before you fell out of love with me

Where are the walks we use to take
Where are the plans we use to make
Where are the dreams we use to dream
Before you fell out of love with me

Where are the laughs use to have
Why did the good times turn into the bad
Where are the mornings we use to see
Before you fell out of love with me

Where are the nights we'd stay awake
Where is the love we use to make
Where's your body so eager and free

When it's so hard to tell
If I'm going the wrong way
To heaven or hell

And I've been a saint
There's a few things I ain't done
And a few things I can't
I was this close to heaven when I slipped and fell
Between a rock and a hard place
Between heaven and hell

Cause I have been lost
And I have been found
I've been a square
And I've been around
I'm down on my knees
At the heartbreak hotel
Begging for directions
Between heaven and hell

Cause I've been a sinner
And I've been a saint
There's a few things I ain't done
And a few things I can't

Between a rock and a hard place
Between heaven and hell

We'll soon be a-winin' and a-dinin' I know
With a cute little filly in the town of Reno

The Apaches are restless there's smoke in the sky
But I'm too old for scalpin' and I'm too young to die
But they'll soon be around us like ants on a hill
Bringin' this muleskinner up for the kill

The crowd all stepped back to give both brothers room
Young Johnny stepped down there was fear in his eyes
But for lover pity he'd gladly die

They still tell the story to this very day
How their, ma, jumped between them when Jim made it play
She cried out in anguish oh sons are you blind
If you must take a life oh Lord let it be mine

Death bells are ringing in Wichita town
They mourn for a mother whose son's shot her down
And there in the Wichita's street where she lay
Blood's thicker than water her smile seemed to say"
Hank Williams Jr.,Blue Lady In A Red Mercedes,/h/hank+williams+jr/blue+lady+in+a+red+mercedes_21033709.html,"There's a blue lady
In a red mercedes
Driving down from her big house on the hill
With her mind on fire
For an old desire
And sweet memories bring on the tears

And that blue lady
Would give that red mercedes
All the money and big house so fine
Just to feel him touch her one more time

She's sewn and reeped
And now she's gotta sleep
In empty arms tonight
All night she's got her little paradise
But she's a lonely wife
If that old flame could burn again
Would it justify the sin
I think it would considering the shape her heart is in

And that blue lady
Would give that red mercedes
All the money and big house so fine
Just to feel him touch her one more time

Just to feel him touch her
Just to feel him touch her
Just to feel him touch her one more time"

Blues my name, heartbreak is my next of kin

I'm living in a world of misery
Life ain't been peaches and cream for me
And I ain't smiled since I don't know when friend

Blues my name, heartbreak is my next of kin

Yes I know what it's like to love and loose
I've stood and watched my golden dreams turn to blue
I've lost my love to someone I called my best friend

 Your not the first to walk away and leave someone in pain.
 I know how much its hurting you, hurting me this way.
 Believe me I've been in your shoes and I know you can't stay.


 I've been on both sides of goodbye. I know there ain't no easy side. I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time. I've been on both sides of goodbye.


 Don't feel so bad for doing what you've got to do.
 You can't make your heart love me if it don't want to.
 When love just don't work both ways and someones got to go.
 So close that door and don't look back, believe me girl I know.


 I've been on both sides of goodbye and I know there ain't no easy ride. I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time. I've been on both sides of goodbye.
 I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time I've been on both sides of goodbye,
 goodbye!"

My underwear's too tight, my clothes don't ever fit right.
My collar's so tight it's poppin' my veins,
We walk around in constant pain.
When I get home from work, I usually start with my shirt,
I leave a trail behind, when I undress I unwind.
I like to let it all hang out,
Hey don't you know what I'm talkin' about,
It feels so good to get buck naked, that ain't no sin,
Buck naked wearin' my skinny skin skin.
Buck naked in my birthday suit,
Buck naked and I don't give a hoot,
Buck naked like a centerfold,
Buck naked is the way to go.
I joined a nudist colony, they make me green with envy,

They spend no money on clothes, they got their own dress code,
They walk around au natural, no more expensive dry cleaning bills,
They just like to get, buck naked, swimmin' on the beach,
Buck naked they're so squeaky clean,
Buck naked in their birthday suits,
Buck naked now ain't they cute,
Buck naked there's a sunworshipper said,
Buck naked what you see's what you get.
My girl said you don't know how it feels,
To walk around in panty hose and high heels,
You oughta try to wear a bra all day,
You don't know the price a girl's gotta pay.
We wear our clothes so tight we
Can't move, she said you don't know what a woman goes through,
It feels so good to get buck naked like Adam & Eve.
Buck naked like the monkeys in the trees,
Buck naked like Tarzan and Jane,
Buck naked no more high fashion pain.
Buck naked like a centerfold,
Buck naked is the way to go."
Hank Williams Jr.,Cajun Baby,/h/hank+williams+jr/cajun+baby_20167848.html,"Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne
That's where lives my Cajun baby, the fairest one in the land

Wouldn't trade my Cajun baby for the world's gold
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne

My heart's been sad and lonely since the day I left her side
But today I got her letter said she'd be my Cajun bride
Gonna go and wed my Cajun baby and live by the old bayou
Eat a lotsa shrimp and crawfish ride around in my old pirogue

Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne
That's where lives my Cajun baby, the fairest one in the land
Her teeth're white and pearly hair black as coal
Wouldn't trade my Cajun baby for the world's gold
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne

Before the sun goes down this evening, I'll be on my way
To see my Cajun baby and there I'm gonna stay
On a Saturday night we go dancin' and listen to the fiddle-o
Lord I got me a Cajun baby just a livin' and a lovin' by the old bayou

Hank Williams Jr.,Clovis New Mexico,/h/hank+williams+jr/clovis+new+mexico_20837923.html,"Well me and Billy, we left Boulder City
Decided that we'd head out west
We've been east and south but it didn't workout
We were getting' nowhere fast

Me with my guitar and him with his saddle
Tryin' to out do the rest
I sang my heart out and he rides them broncs now
And that's what me and Billy do best

We took 'Interstate 20' 'til we ran out of money
In a place just past Abilene
So I sang at a honky-tonk and he broke the bad bronc
And we bought some gas and some beans

With a whole lot of luck and an old pickup truck
We made it to New Mexico
We pulled up in Clovis and I sure didn't know this
Was as far as I ever would go

I needed some strings, Billy wanted a ring
The kind that the Indians made
A voice said, “Hello boys, I've got silver and turquoise
And that's when I saw her face”

That's when I noticed that girl down in Clovis
A black haired beauty, she set a fire to me
A green eyed lady in old jeans that were faded
No, I didn't notice what happened in Clovis but I called her baby

I asked her with care if she'd like to share
An evening with someone like I
I said, “I ain't a winner just a hard livin' singer”
She smiled and said, “Meet me at nine”

We ate tacos and talked and then we took a walk
In the clean southwestern air
Then we went back to her house, I took my guitar out
And sang of my joy and despair

She served me her wine and she helped me write lines
To songs I could not complete
And her eyes seemed to say, put that guitar away
That's somethin' that both of us need

What a beautiful site was her face in the light
And the candles there on the wall
And we reached the height of good love on that night
And I hope we never will fall

And I'm glad I noticed that girl down in Clovis
Daughter of a driller, she's a born thriller
A green eyed lady, kinda wild, kinda lazy
I didn't notice what happened in Clovis but I called her baby, baby"

Yes every fifteen minutes, I can drink another bottle down and get fifteen minutes closer to that cold, cold ground, to that cold cold ground
Well I think I'll play the jukebox and light up another cigarette
They say for every puff of that loving smoke you get another minute closer to death
Well I smoke two or three packs a day and my arithmatic is not to sound
But I know I'm getting hours closer to that cold, cold ground
To that cold, cold ground
Now this morning I had me a woman and a love so nice and fine

But this evening I watched her board that train and move on down the line
Our love was so good but now she's gone and this is what I've found
Her leaving sure brought me closer to that cold, cold ground
To that cold, cold ground
Well I'm standing in the back alley with a pistol in my hand
I never thought a womens love could do this to a man
I hear that hammr clickin', what a sweet, terrible sound
Let my tombstone read ""no liquor, no smoke, no drugs, but a woman's love put me in that cold, cold ground. Put me in that cold, cold ground"

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are spoke that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart"

Did your daddy really write all them songs? Did he?
That don't deserve no answer, hoss
Let's light up and just move along

Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama
Or about the man who done her wrong, you know that

Yeah, back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint

Are still ridin' on his name

Well, if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right? Do you think he might?
Don't you know he would Watasha

And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies

And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line
And a country boy can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly

My Grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a business man

He used to send me pictures of the broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For forty three dollars, my friend lost his life

I'd love to spit some beechnut in that dude's eyes
And shoot him with my ole 45

Country music, those tear jerking songs

He's not happy at home so he'll play them old songs
And dance with someone that's not his

When the man of the house has trouble with his spouse
And she locks him out of the bedroom
He'll just stroll down the street and some darlings he'll meet
To have a drink and play them old tune

He's not happy at home so he'll play them old songs
And dance with someone that's not his

To your favorite honky tonk bar
Play some Haggard and Tubb or Jones
Or Acuff or your's truly H W J are

Always bow your head and pray anytime, night or day
Whenever you see a cross on the side of the highway

Now Derrick Thomas was a champion no one can deny that
He led the Alabama Crimson Tide in all time total sacks
But his heart was even bigger than all his natural skill
He always helped kids in the city and you know what
I think he always will
Now my buddy Mike Tellis was a good man everyone loved him so
He took care of his dear father 'til he too was called to go
How my little girl cried when we all got the dreaded news
She said but Daddy Derrick and Mike will always be with us
Don't children always tell the truth

I never paid no attention anytime I passed one by
Oh but now I say a prayer because now I know why
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred
And I lost my two good friends taken to a better world
Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day
Whenever you see a cross on the highway
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel
So God help us through these troubled times
And please bless us with peace of mind
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away

There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred
And I lost my two good friends taken from this mean old world

All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name

I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter
That said, ""I don't love him, I'm leaving this cold, mean man""
As the train pulled away from the platform and I put her in the wagon
With her head on my shoulder, God knows I was one happy man

And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin
In the winter of '94 there burned such a powerful flame
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cut Bank, Montana
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name

Hell rolled into town one night on a Wyoming stallion
His heart full of hate and eyes full of cold jealousy
One way or another he said partner I'm taking back my woman
With my hand on my gun I said don't bet your life the lady said
She's staying with me

His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lantern
That fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor
He was a dead man, but I have been to since I lost her
from the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door

But I went to heaven that night in her arms in my little cabin
In the winter of '94 there burned one hell of a flame

On a midnight ride
Take that highway down to that famous town on the ocean side

Daytona nights

You need to be looking for
Hawaian tropic women
They got the best buns of all
I like the way they sway when they walk up and say,

So we swim all day
And we played all night
And I never want to leave this free as a breeze, daytona nights

You junped up on the table, did a slow strip
Girl your as bad as me.

The way they did in sweet home Alabama,
The people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey,
The way they do in that Tennessee mountain land.

I've always heard lots about the big apple,
So I thought I'd come up here and see,
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle,
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee.

If this is the promised land,
I've had all I can stand,
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line
Well I just don't fit in,
And I'll never come back again,
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind,
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind.

These people never smile or say a word,
They're all too busy tryin' to make an extra dime,
Oh I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg,
And show 'em how to raise hell in Carolina.

Oh, the things you know that I miss most of all,
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines,
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here ya know,
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine.

If this is the promised land,
I've had all I can stand,
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight,
Well I just don't fit in,
And I'll never come back again,
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind,
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind."

Has Porter Wagoner suits
Got a four wheeler, that's all wrong

Now his palace is a lot
On a rough, rocky top
And a bright red bobo on

He flies the red, white and blue
And I'm telling you
He knows how to honky tonk all night

When he pulls up in his truck
All the guys are out of luck
The girls know his reputation is fine

He's Don Juan D'Bubba
He's got a Spanish mother
But his daddy worked in a coal mine

He cooks squirrel hors d'oeuvres
And he only serves
The very cheapest supermarket wine

Now he's cool as a rule
He's nobody's fool
If there's a party
He's the first to be found

Don Juan D'Bubba
The hillbilly lover
Blue Ribbon country hound

He's a playboy true
And he pitches his woo
To a different girl every night

He's a practical joker
A smooth talkin' stroker
A real man if you want a fight

And when he gets on a roll
He puts on a show
Barnum and Bailey ain't never seen

He is fine and dandy
Handsome and handy
Bubba's in every country girl's dream

He's Don Juan D'Bubba
He's got a Spanish mother
But his daddy worked in a coal mine

He cooks you squirrel hors d'oeuvres
And he only serves
The very cheapest supermarket wine

Now he's cool as a rule
Nobody's fool
Make him the man you don't want to be around

She's got a way of walking that'll do you in

No harm in looking if you understand
She's a one man woman, I'm a one woman man

There's no doubt about it when she holds me tight
Early in the morning and late at night

Early in the morning we rock
Late in the evening we roll

Traced her footsteps down to the shore
Afraid she's gone for evermore

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
I took your baby from you away
I heard a voice cryin' in deep
Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight
Why did I leave her alone tonight
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me

I looked at the sea

Ran in the water, heart full of fear
There in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darling, held her to me
Stole her away from the angry sea

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
You took your baby from me away
My heart cried out, she's mine to keep
I saved my baby from that endless sleep

Endless sleep
Endless sleep

Hank Williams Jr.,Everything Comes Down To Money And Love,/h/hank+williams+jr/everything+comes+down+to+money+and+love_20336326.html,"Sitting at the kitchen table Monday afternoon
House is so quiet
I spent the morning looking for a job
But the job markets pretty tight

And I'm wondering
Just what I'm gonna do
Someone to hold and the rent
I owe are long overdue

Seems like everything comes down
To money and love in my life
It seems like everything comes down
To money and love in my life

I'm used to having a woman around
Cooking for me and when I lay down to love
I got used to having a woman around
Looking to me to rise above

I've got a lonely heart, two open arms
And a pillow I never use
I know it ain't much to offer
But it's the best I can do

Seems like everything comes down
To money and love in my life

I've loved a lot of good women
And I could sure love one now
I've had more than enough money
In my bank account

But where they went and how they got spent
Isn't really clear
They just left me here
And it all disappeared

Sitting in another office Tuesday morning
Application filled
I doubt they'll ever call me
But I can't keep from hoping that they will

I know I need to keep my chin up
But I'm telling you the truth
If there's no one else to live for
Is there anything left to lose?

It seems like everything comes down
To money and love in my life
Seems like everything comes down
To money and love in my life, in my life"
Hank Williams Jr.,Everytime I Hear That Song,/h/hank+williams+jr/everytime+i+hear+that+song_20336572.html,"I heard cowboys should never cry,
But there are some things that bring tears to my eyes.
Some old movies they've shown,
Some old people all alone,
And everytime I hear that song.

Everytime I hear that song,
I think of someone who is gone,
And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,
Everytime I hear that song.

What makes big old boys like me,
Get down on bended knee?
And today's girl who's moving ahead,
Stay at home all night crying in bed.
It's those old loves that linger on,
Just like some of those good old songs.

Everytime I hear that song,
I think of someone who is gone,
And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,
Everytime I hear that song."
Hank Williams Jr.,Eyes Of Waylon,/h/hank+williams+jr/eyes+of+waylon_21033711.html,"When it comes to real rounders, there's only one
That was better than I was at havin' some fun
Now it's true he shows grey in his beard
Does that mean he's history, or is he a pillar and a peer
This music called country, somethin' we all make
No, it didn't just happen cause of the latest rage
Soon he was the biggest thing to come along in Nashville in those days
He sang his song called ""Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way""
I don't know if he did or not but I sure know what I saw
The 1st triple platinum in that town was hanging on his wall
Radio will play him until the end of time
Because he's a real legend not the phony kind

And I looked in the eyes of Waylon
And there I saw things that I'd never seen before
I saw a father and a brother and a friend
I saw the nights we spent while out on the road
It's not the money, it's not the fame, it's not the ladies
And the eyes of Waylon just told me so
Yes, I looked in the eyes of Waylon
There I learned things that I better know
And if I doubted there is a hillbilly heaven
The eyes of Waylon just told me so

And if I doubted there is a hillbilly heaven
The eyes of old Waylon just told me so"

Why do you drink?
(Hank) why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over
Everybody made my prediction
So if I get stoned
I'm just carryin'
On an old family tradition

I am very proud
Of my daddys name
Although his kinda music
And mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over
Put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long
It's a family tradition

So Don't ask me Hank
Why do you drink?
(Hank) why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a Honky-Tonk
Some ol' slicks tryin to give me friction
I'll say leave me alone
I'm singin all night long
It's a family tradition

Lordy, I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me
In 1973
When that doctor asked me
Son how did you get in this condition
I said hey sawbones I'm just carryin on
An old family tradition

So don't ask me Hank
Why do you drink?
(Hank) why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs you wrote?
Stop and think it over
Try and put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long

But you decide to take a chance; this could be a great romance
If only she could just get rid of her
""She's my cousin from the East and I know that she's a beast""
And I don't think that this is gonna work

So you take them both out while you try to figure out
""How can I dump the pig?""
You've spent sixty bucks, but things are looking up
She just said she wants to make it big
Now the problem is this, every time we hug and kiss
Her friend says, ""I want to go home!""
And we want her to, but we don't know what to do
And that's why it's time for this song

Why do the best lookin' girls have real ugly friends?
It seems like it always works like that
Oh, you'll meet a queen; the girl of your dreams, 
And she'll have a friend that's really, really fat! 
Every time you make your play, you'll find out there ain't no way
To make love to beauty and the beast
Why do the best lookin' girls have these real ugly friends?

Why this is the latest and good ol' American high technology
And when this hits the marketplace Uncle Sam will rule the world

To sweet home Alabama in 1974
Had to get out of Music City
And I had to get off the road

Woman, she left and the people
Wouldn't let me sing nothin' but them old
Sad songs, had to get high so I wouldn't cry
You know they hit pretty close to home

I'm feelin' better
Now that I'm back on the road
Getting it together
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals

I started turnin' up loud and looking at the crowd
And bendin' them guitar strings
Knew all the while, though it was my style
Could they ever forget my name

Rocked 'ed in Raleigh, knocked 'em outta Nashville
Just couldn't do no wrong
People went wild and the band said
""Child, better keep on playin' your songs""

I'm feelin' better
Now that I'm back on the road
Getting it together
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals

Well, my life ain't the same and I had to change
And I hope this music will show
A little bit less of cryin' in the beer
And a little of my own soul

Waylon and Toy and all them boys
I wanna say thanks to you
Your fiddle and your steel make me play what I feel
And I don't feel lovesick blues

I'm feelin' better
Now that I'm back on the road
Getting it together
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals

All came together in my sweet Alabama home
And I'm through forever of tryin' to put everybody on
And I'm feelin' better
I got hurt but I'm back on the road

Getting it together, had to eat a little cornbread
I've been eatin' that cornbread, sleepin' on a featherbed
Drinkin' that homegrown
Writin' some new songs, do it on, get home

Eat a little cornbread, lovin' on a featherbed
Smokin' that homegrown, write a few new songs
This here music's homegrown"

Finders are keepers
And I'm keeping you as long as I can
Finders are keepers
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand

A needle in a haystack would be easy to do
Compared to me finding somebody else like you
I tell you chasing the perfect woman is just like rolling the dice
She's as pretty as a natural eleven
And I'm puttin' my heart on the line

Finders are keepers

Through the years he'd always picked it up
For the guy who came back and saved his butt
What they have in common is a brotherhood
So few could understand

They were forged by fire
Hard times you get beyond
Give you an unbreakable bond

Forged by fire
When you pray to God, beat the odds
And you walk through hell together
You're forever forged by fire

The young gi said from his va bed
Why you wanna hang out with us broken men
While you could be spending your time
With your family and friends

He told him son, you're family too
I see myself when I look at you
In a place and time you don't forget

So even though we've just met

We're forged by fire
Hard times you get beyond
Give you an unbreakable bond

Forged by fire
When you pray to God, beat the odds
And you walk through hell together
You're forever forged

He said goodbye gi, see you next week
He rolls himself out to the street
Pretty hard for him to get up in that van
And throw the wheelchair in the back

He was headed home ready to unwind
When Charlie called, can you help me one more time?
He said Chuck, I'll be there on the double
For a brother, it's no trouble

When you're forged by fire
Hard times you get beyond
Iraq, Korea or [Incomprehensible]

Forged by fire
From Iwo Jima to Afghanistan
We're talking about the American fighting man

Forged by fire, forged by fire
Forged by fire, forged by fire"

Break our heart
Then we say goodbye

We hope to die
Let the other one to blame

How to meditate
Read your horoscope
And cheat your faith
And furthermore to hell with hate
Come on and get on board

What you see
Whats happening to you and me

From Shilo to Nashville we made our last stand
When the battles were over, everythin' we had was gone with the wind

But I still had my family and a hope and a dream
And I heard of gold fever and the Rocky Mountain streams
So we took what we had and some gold diggin' gear
And we headed for a new life on the Northwest frontier

Montana Territory where the winters are cold
The lands full of game and the creeks are full of gold
Just west of the mountains is a town they call Gibbonsville
You can sure get gold fever, you can damn sure get killed
But I staked my claims, I was rarin' to go
I've made up my mind and I set out to find the Gibbonsville (D)gold

Oh, you find just a little, just enough to get by
Aww, you dig and you dig, and you start wonderin' why
There's a whole lot more down there, I don't have to be told
I've made up my mind and I'm gonna find that Gibbonsville gold

Every morning at daylight with a pick and a pan
Keep an eye out for the blackfeet. Keep a rifle near hand
Back shooters and grizzlies, better stay alert all the time
'Cause the only law here in this wild country is the gun and the knife

In the year of our Lord, eighteen sixty-nine
I lost my dear son to a cave-in at the mine
Yes I know he's gone please God rest his soul
So many have died trying to find this damned Gibbonsville gold

[Chorus:]
Yeah, you find just a little, just enough to get by
Aww, you dig and you dig, and you start wonderin' why
Then someone finds a nugget, just as big as your thumb
And we all go hard at it from sun until sun
Yeah I got to find it, that main mother load
I've made up my mind and I swear to find that Gibbonsville gold

There's a whole lot more down there, my share of that main mother load
I've made up my mind and I swear to find the Gibbonsville gold --- fade"

Hank Williams Jr.,Half As Much,/h/hank+williams+jr/half+as+much_20709596.html,"If you love me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down

If you missed me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

That's the kinda world that I live in
Play a different town most every night
Lovin' your woman write a new song that's my life

That's my life and I love it that's my life
There ain't nothin' else in the world above it
I see people all alone pickin' their guitars and singin' their songs
But I tell 'em forget it cause you can't fake it
If you're gonna make it you've gotta live it

I got a big bus with a tv and a bar
And a little room in the back for me and my ole guitar
Gotta stop and fuel up every five hundred miles
Give a picture to the waitress eat a little breakfast country style

That's my life and I love it that's my life
There ain't nothin' else in the world above it
I see people all alone pickin' their guitars and singin' their songs
But I tell 'em forget it cause you can't fake it
If you're gonna make it you've gotta live it

We get home to Nashville on a Monday night
Record songs on Tuesday and on Wednesday take out the wife
But then on Thursday night it's back on the road
I don't care if it's Montana or down in Louisiana just as long as I go

That's my life and I love it that's my life
There ain't nothin' else in the world above it
I see people all alone pickin' their guitars and singin' their songs
But I tell 'em forget it cause you can't fake it

Never seen a situation he couldn't handle
No he'll never give in and he always helps his friends
But the world today sure looks strange to him
His trade mark his big square grey glasses
He wears t-shirts he don't care about high fashion
When he plays his guitar, in his mind he's a star
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king

Cause a hick is a hick (a hick is a hick)
And a dude is a dude (a dude is a dude)
A squirrel is a squirrel and a nut is a nut and I love his attitude
There's only one show that's worth a damn on the tube
Yeah he's my hero, a man I'd be proud to know
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king

Now our kind of food is barbeque and steaks
We hate jet skis and beaches
We like fishing boats and lakes
Close as heaven I can go is watching hunting and fishing shows
And hanging out down at the hardware store
Now Texas that is one beautiful place
We don't have as many weirdos as New York and L. A,
We got our ideology and politics just right you see
He's our only hope, a man we'd be proud tp know
I'm telling you Hank Hill is the king

Cause a hick is a hick (a hick is a hick)
And a dude is a dude (a dude is a dude)

And I don't see your blouse or jeans or your pretty white cotton gown
And I've looked all over Hell but Heaven can't be found

I looked on the bedside table but your jewelry was all gone
And I just wish you'd call every time I look at the phone
I looked in our dressing mirror and I saw myself break down
Oh, I looked all over Hell but Heaven can't be found

I called and looked in everyplace you used to hang around
I've searched in every bar and club and honkey tonk in town
And I don't know if I can go on without breaking down

Here I am lyin' again making up places that I've never been

I thought I was through with these heart breaking blues
But here I am lyin' again
Why don't a man ever take time to think what is at stake?
Is it the danger or the pleasurable stranger?
But those are the chances we'll take

I'd hate to come face to face with her and her at the same place
'Cause it will be hell if I had to tell her someone has taken her place
I had a beautiful wife, she found it all out one night

And the pleasurable stranger, Lord I didn't change her
And I lost it all this time
So here I am cryin' again and callin' sympathy from my ole friends
He once loved her and she once him and here I am cryin' again"

Playing hide and seek.

Now what if you an I was a hundred thousandover
On our bank accounts?
And the s and L scandal, tax payers can bail 'em out.
And the Anita Hill Hearings, what exactly did that prove?
Except that a lot of senators think they're holier than you.

Let's cover it up Let' hide it No one can ever tell.
Let's cover it up let's hide it before it starts to smell.
Don't rock the boat, don't make any waves.
Just write a brand new speech.
Well here we are two hunderd years old.
And we're still playin' hide andseek.

Now the Rodney King case, if that ain't the livin' proof, 
Six guys nearly beat 'I'm to death, and they all flew th coop?
And I don't like those odds of six goin' on one, 
We're all playin' hide and seek, and noones havin' fun.

Me and them city folks couldn't get along

That a man can have a good woman
A woman that he can call his very own
A woman who'll stay right there at home
And mind the children while he's gone to work

A woman who'll have his dinner cooked
When he comes home
Where some men make mistakes is when they go out
And stay because they feel that no other man
Wants his woman but him, but listen

If you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some man will have her before you can count
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, he will

Ha, ha, listen girls, this goes for you, too
Because you know I've seen so many women
Who've had so many good men in life

Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin
Men who would go to work everyday and bring home
Their hard earned pay
Men who would give their women anything that their
Little heart desired

Where some women make mistakes
Is when their men go out and let 'em play
They would stay because they felt that no other
Woman wanted him but her, listen

Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see

Everybody's got problems that's no lie
Everybody's got somebody on their mind
They wanna get on board and just leave their problems behind
And their engines are burning hard for honky tonk wine
So I take my guitar and make that little string moan
And they're moving on down the line like Casey Jones

Cause there ain't a hounddog in this state that can hold a light to me
I ate three bones for dinner today I tried to tree a coon
You got me chasin' rabbits I'm cratchin' fleas and howlin' at the moon

I rode my horse to town today and a gaspump we did pass
I pulled him up and I hollered whoa and I said fill him up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham he changed my tune

Because the things that they know, 
How to do can't be learned in a book!

I was with Red Foley the night he passed away)
We was down in Port Wayne Indiana the night the Lord took Red away
And we had to get there a little early cause we had a matinee
And when Red first went on stage it seemed that he moved and talked a little slow
But of course he went on to do his regular great show
So soon the afternoon show was over with and we all went down the street and ate
Red said he wasn't very hungry but he came along anyway
And we got done eaten and came back to the last show
But the thing just would be Red's very last well who's to know
And when he went on the stage for his own ten thousandth time
We was all back to the curtains there just shootin' the lines
But when he sang Peace In The Valley there was such a quiet still
I know I'll never forget it and anyone that was there never will
Well soon the last show was over with
And I went back to the hotel and Red gave me a call
I told him to come on over I was just starin' at the four walls
So he came over to my room he was just next door there
Lit a cigarette and sat down in the chair
And he started talkin' bout all the worries that a country music singer has
I said old Red I reckon it's not that bad
He said yeah you're workin' a lot now and you'll have 'em some day
Your dad had 'em and I have 'em I guess it's just meant that way
Then he got up and these were the last words he said
I'm awful tired now Hank and I've got to go to bed
And while I layed there with Red just a few steps away
The angels came and took him into the last golden stage

My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive.

A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch
And I was livin'g high until that fatal day
A lawyer proved I wasn't born
I was only hatched.

Ev'rything's agin' me and it's got me down
If I jumped in the river I would prob'ly drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive.

These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time
Are full of holes and nails
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails.

I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
'Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright nohow
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive.

I could buy a Sunday suit and it would leave me broke
If it had two pair of pants I would burn the coat
No matter how I struggle and strive

I'll try to drink enough to drown the hurt
And if that don't work I'll think of something

Where do I go for love that I still need
Now that I'm free I'll think of something
And if someday by accident we meet
And I can't speak I'll think of something

If I can't say a word to her
I'll blame it on this lump that's in my throat

To hide my love enough that it won't show

Lights up a purple sky.

With us high riding cowboys
She says she feels a whole lot
More at home on the range

She can handle her feelings
In most all situations
But she just cannot handle
The arms of cocaine

Hey, I'm just a rhymer
Writing down new phrases
Looking for ladies
Who know I'm subject to change

Content to believing
The songs I am singing
Help her find her feelings
Help her break the chains of cocaine

Oh, my lady is special
She’s into my kind of music

I like Levi's and leathers
Making love together
No more stormy weather

Final chorus:
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh

Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou."

Stand by me Jesus, forgive me somehow
If there's any hope left, don't leave me now
I might be worth saving, I'm trying to be

It's late I know and I've made you wait
But don't turn the light out, don't lock the gate
Forgiveness and patience, that's all I need

Stand by me Jesus, forgive me somehow

You're just another girl that were not too well equated
I'm a drifter at this time and we parted
Oh, but why am I so heavy hearted
It's just another town on the highway

Just like a thousand others I passed her goin' my way
I just came to say, goodbye
Why do I wanna cry after all it's just another town
That's just another door why can't I open it and go
If I told you what's in my heart I'm sure that you'd say, no

It's just another town that won't miss me
You're just another girl that was kind enough to kiss me
My mind says walk away why does my heart say, stay

I know what the cards say
Sometimes the hard way
It looks so easy

My curiosity always gets me in a ditch
What really happens if
You turn that knob
Or flip that switch
Something I shouldn't do
Why you already knew
That's all been taught to me

I know just enough to get in trouble
And that's just enough to understand
That the more I know
The more I'm sure
Someday it's gonna do me in
Yeah when my time comes
And I'm dead and gone
Let em put it on my tombstone
He knew just enough to get in trouble
But not enough to leave it alone

They got a book somewhere
On everything a woman wants
Bout how and when and where
And why they will
And why they won't
That's complicated stuff
And when it comes to love
I'm still learning

I know just enough to get in trouble
And that's just enough to understand
That the more I know
The more I'm sure
Someday it's gonna do me in
Yeah when my time comes
And I'm dead and gone
Let em write it on my tombstone
He knew just enough to get in trouble
But not enough to leave it alone

Waylon always told me
Son everybody makes mistakes
And how come it's always me
Standing there when something breaks

Yeah I know just enough to get in trouble
And that's just enough to understand
That the more I know
The more I'm sure
Someday it's gonna do me in
Yeah when my time comes
And I'm dead and gone
Let em write it on my tombstone
Here lies just enough to get in trouble

But not quite enough to leave it alone"

""Just another guy on the lost highway.""

Oh, the day we met, I went astray,
I started rollin' down that lost highway.

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two,
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you,
And now I'm lost, too late to pray,
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway.

Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round,
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound.
Take my advice or you'll curse the day

Always no huggin no kissin until I get a wedding ring
My honey my baby don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't give no lines and keep your hands to yourself

Cruel baby baby baby why you want to treat me this way
You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And she said no huggin no kissin until I get a wedding vow
My honey my baby don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself

You see I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talkin' true love started talkin' about sin

Ain't got a thing to do
I don't wanna go to the movies
Couldn't if I wanted to, I'm on trial for lovin' you

Now this all started in a honky tonk
Just the other side of town
A girl come in took a stool by me
Ordered gin and drank it down

She lit up a cigarette and turned around
Well, she said my name is Jeannie
And asked me what was mine
I answered Hank and I walked
To the jukebox droppin' a dime

I looked at her short dress low neck line
Well, we danced for five or ten minutes
And I held her close to me

Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips
And judged about twenty-three
Whispered in my ears, I said, ""Yes siree""

Now the scene is a little motel
Out on the state highway
And there's a room for two
Love is about to take place

And a state trooper breaks down the door
Shines a flash light in my face
I said, ""What the hell is this""
And another man and woman come in

And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin'
And she runs over to them
Said, ""Thank God you're here
He tried to hurt me mama""

I said now you don't mean
The cop says, ""Son the girl is seventeen""
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse
And the judge passed sentence on me

And it's ten long years for statutory rape
In the state penitentiary
Lord, I can't believe this is happened to me

So when next time you give a girl the eye
She gives you that certain smile
Just remember under that woman's breast
May beat the heart of a child

Don't you let yourself be the one
To help a mixed up kids go wild
This story happened a lot that's true
But you better hope and pray it never happens to you"

Some of them like that meat just a little bit lean

I like gravy on the side with hot and juicy lovin'
Brown sugar on top, sausage warm out of the oven
Sometimes you get to eatin' Lord and you just can't stop
Make me wonder to myself
Why oh why, why did I leave that last pork chop

Well met this fine gal in the choir, she sure could sing
She said come down to my house
I'm gonna give you ham hocks and beans
We devoured each other Lord, her kitchen was smokin' hot
I had to jump up and open a window and I thought to myself
Why did I leave that last pork chop

I have been on a very strict diet of beer and scotch and love
I was offered lunch break specials, but now I'm a fool for her
She'd been serving that pie while I was gone punchin' the clock
I thought about that waitress down at Maxine's and I said to myself
Why did I leave that last pork chop"

Somehow I got stuck
Between the rock

And he been known to get out of his mind

He's got a string of hits about two miles long

Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing there songs?
You know there gonna do whatever they want
If you don't like the way they sing who's gonna cast the first stone?
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing there song?

Hank Williams was the king of country soul
My daddy took me to see him in Lubuck but he didn't show
Now the people got mad and they all went home
The first thing we did was put his records on
I guess, we should have left him alone and let him sing his song

Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing there songs?
You know there gonna do whatever they want
If you don't like the way they sing who's gonna cast the first stone?

But it's hard to smile when my friends all know
I got you on my mind
Hey I'm not in the mood
To hear another fast dancing song
I don't care if it's old country gold or new country soul
I've had enough of this rock-and-roll

[Chorus]
Let's keep the heart in the country
Because that's where it should always be
Don't get me wrong, I like to party
But tonight I must sit this one out, you see
Because the one I love is leaving
Bartender, bring me whiskey please
Let's keep the heart in the country
Because love has torn the heart right out of me

[Verse 2]
Now that was great
Please thank the band for playing that song
It was nice and smooth
Like this Kentucky brew that I am sipping on
Oh how I'll miss her
But I got my music and now I'll get along
I don't feel bad now, you see
Misery loves company in a country song

I like her just fine

Tell me what to do
Tell me what to eat
And how loud I can chew
She even wants to tell me
What thoughts I oughta think
It used to drive me crazy
Till it drove me to drink

She can scream all night

As high as a kite

Said he met a girl
Said she was the meanest
Woman in the world
I saw her pretty picture
I said man your poking fun
Then the day I met her
I said pour me one

I like her just fine

You may look down your nose at me
Think I'm an old sorry
Son of a bean
The only way I'm giving up
My drinking glass is if I can
Find a way to get her off my back

Spoken: Your wife's on the phone.

Little brown jug upon my lips
Your saving our love
With every sip

It takes a whole lot of liquor
To like her
That's why I drink all the time
It takes a whole lot of liquor

I like her just fine

Every time I get sober
She drives me out of my mind

An old drunk came up to me
He says ""You ain't as good as your daddy, boy
And you never will be""

Says, ""I'm your biggest fan""

They were in the summer of life
When you called them away, Lord
I don't wanna pay that price

Hank Williams Jr.,Montana Song,/h/hank+williams+jr/montana+song_20259868.html,"I'm going to Montana to spend the winter
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are cold
Way out there the blues will never find me
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul

I wish that special someone was goin' along
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone
Maybe I can find someone who cares
'Bout the man I am stead of clothes I wear
'Cause I ain't takin' nothin' but my boots and jeans
And a big ole cold along

But oh Lord, wouldn't her warm skin feel good at night
Makin' love in a sleepin' bag and holdin' me [pretty] tight
We've spent the days side by side right upon the great divide
And look across America and feel so free inside

Oh Lord, that would be quite a change for a country boy like me
Up there in the snow drifts right up to my knees
And as I warm my hands by the fire
I'd have to fight off the great desire
To call that girl and ask her
To come out here for a while

I'm going to Montana to spend the winter
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are so cold
Way out there the blues will never find me
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul

I wish that special someone was goin' along
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone
Maybe I can find someone who cares
A sweet simple baby who'd like to share
This love I've held inside me for so long
And help me sing my Montana song, ooh"
Hank Williams Jr.,Moods Of Mary,/h/hank+williams+jr/moods+of+mary_20837956.html,"She speaks with the voice of an angel she smiles a heavenly smile
Soft as the warm winds of April and pure as the heart of a child
But that's just one of the moods of Mary one of her faces that I see
I know about the moods of Mary 'cause one of her moods is me

Mary will lie and deceive me she can be fickle and cold
She'll offer her lips just to tease me and then give me heartaches untold
But that's just one of the moods of Mary part of her personality
I don't mind the moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me

Mary can change like the seasons she can be tender and kind
Then she hurts me without any reason and drives me out of my mind
But I can live with the moods of Mary if that's the way it has to be
I forget the other moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me"

She told me not to play around but I done let her deal go down
So pack it on over (pack it on over) tote it on over (tote in on over)
Move over nice dog's cause a mad dog's movin' in
She warned me once she warned me twice but I don't take no one advice
So scratch it on over (scratch it on over) shake it on over (shake it over)
Move over short dog cause the tall dog's movin' in

She'll crawl back to me on her knees I'll be busy scratchin' please
So slide it on over (move it on over) sneak it on over (move it on over)
Move over good dog's cause a mad dog's movin' in
Remember up before you whine that side of door ain't this side of mine
Su shut it on over (shot it on over) sweep it on over (sweep it on over)

Hank Williams Jr.,Mr Lincoln,/h/hank+williams+jr/mr+lincoln_20262942.html,"(Chorus:)
Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here
The Republics changed alot in a hundred years
I don't think its working like you planned
Mr Lincoln we sure could use a hand

I just read the headlines in the Nashville News
And I wish I made this up but I'm afraid its true
Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street
He was takin his wife to a nice place to eat
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time
He plead insanity like they do now all the time
Sir what would you have done in 1859
Now if you shoot someone sir you can get off scott free
Its the latest thing mr Lincoln can you believe
Now they sue the manufactures of the guns
Aint the law changed alot since 1861

[Chorus:]

I just heard the new story on the radio
They let dangerous men outta prison now yes sir I'm afraid its so
Because theyre overcrowded and it was only his fifth offense
And this time hes killed someone does that make any sense
Now my lawyer called me about a nuisance case
Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days
Well at least we're right all we gotta do is tell the truth

He said youre living in the past you romantic fool
I said you got that right I lean toward the older ways
And theres damn few back woods lawyers left today

(Chorus 2x)"

Hat and shades, beard and all
Now I have heard, mmm hmm, I've gotten the word
About all these silly imposters runnin around
Let me tell you somethin now they ain't real
They got no scars, they got no feel
Why they don't know nothin about whiskey bent and hellbound
Now I'm looking for a lover and I'm looking for some fun
My name is Bocephus
I'm a son of a gun

Some of us are born with it, some of us don't ever, ever get it
Thank God I'm a guitar man, and it's true I love the money
And it's true I love all the honeys
But the thing I really love is to get down with the band

Not everybody loves me
But those that do will fight
Right to the end they're guitar friends
From legendary Saturday Nights
I learned something from Lynyrd Skynyrd
From my Daddy and Ernest Tubb too
I do country rock, I do blues
Now I'm looking for a lover
And I'm going to have some fun
Oh, my name is Bocephus
And I'm a son of a gun

Some of us are born with it

Now we have got some strange laws
The most hypocritical thing around these days

Why an auto parts calender hey that's pornography
But go right down the road, read what the sign says

Naked women and beer we got it all in here
For your eyes and your ears
They show it all in the clear
Way up north and down south
Whoo, somebody shut my mouth

Now I ain't sayin' it's right
But I ain't sayin' it's wrong
But myself I enjoy the site
Of pretty girls dancin' to their songs

And it's been like that since way back when
From little Egypt to the Vegas strip
And when the music starts groovin'
And the girls start movin'
Ain't nothing gonna make 'em quit

Naked women and beer, we got it all in here
For your eyes and your ears
They show it all in the clear
Way up north and down south
Whoo, somebody shut my mouth

Nak-nak-nak-nak-nak-naked women

There's no mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles
Nobody wants me I'm nobody's child

I was slowly passin' an orphan's home one day
And stop there for a moment just to watch the children play
Alone a boy was standin' and when I asked him why
He turned his eyes that couldn't see and he began to cry
People come for children and take them for their own
But they all seem to pass me by and leave me all alone
I know they'd like to take me but when they see that I'm blind
They always take some other child and I'm left behind
I'm nobody's child...

No mother's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry
Sometimes it gets so lonely here I wish I could die
I walk the streets of heaven where all the blinds can see
And just like for the other kids there'd be a home for me
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles nobody wants me I'm nobody's child"

But I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name

I guess you could say that my love life would not up to part
Too many nights alone had left some permanence scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same
Then I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name

I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said son you can't do anymore of that cocaine
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I od'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name

I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feels
She treated me nice and I like to find her again
But I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself, kinda overdid it in Denver
And I just can't remember her name"

Hank Williams Jr.,Old Nashville Cowboys,/h/hank+williams+jr/old+nashville+cowboys_20812438.html,"The old Nashville cowboy was burdened with time
He was bent by his years and the fight with the wine
With a head full of music and an old nursery rhyme
A heart full of sadness and dark sunken nights

He told me, they've cheated, he told me they stole
The strength from his youth and the songs from his soul
He said he was family till he got too old
And he called them miners, mother lode finders
Digging so deep in search of more gold

Oh, where are the cowboys and the home on the range?
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James?
Now the good guys on tv seem bad, ain't it strange?
And the old Nashville cowboys missed out on the change

The old cowboy's life now is gone with the past
Like the whiskey he drank it all went down too fast
He didn't know how to make each swallow last
And the head waitress won't be back to fill up his glass

Oh, where are the cowboys and the home on the range?
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James?
Is anyone listening or is everyone blind?
Them old Nashville cowboys will sing for a dime
And hard times are cheap at the end of the line"

I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend

Give me a cane pole and a shotgun
And I can have a whole lotta fun
A soft ole pair of hikin' boots
A pocket knife and a campfire too
You go out in the woods alone wonder where the big buck's roam
What's that noise and your heart beats fast
Then you smile when a squirrel runs past
I don't have to get a bear just want to breathe that country air
I'm goin' out every time I can
I'm an outdoor lovin' man

I'm an outdoor lovin' man I really love the land
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Florida Keys sand
I don't care much about tv 'cause there's country I ain't seen
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend
I'm an outdoor lovin' man

I want a mountaintop and a wheat field
A cool clear lake, a rod and a reel
A four-wheeler, a ride on a bike
A horseback trip, a snowshoe hike

The concrete jungle I don't want, I'd rather be out in the swamp
My job's got me tied up so I dream of where the red fern grow
This weekend I'll find where the river bends and the fish jump high
I'll be there every time I can
I'm an outdoor kinda man

I'm an outdoor lovin' man and I really love the land
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Alabama sand
All the talk shows on tv they don't do a whole lot for me

This time I'd go for good

To tell myself I could

But it took a lot of lonely nights
To ever change my mind
It took a lot of missing youth
And things that I'd left behind

Intending to keep going
But the going got too rough
And pride's not hard to swallow
Once you chew it long enough

I know we won't
Always see eye to eye
But if you'll take me back
This time I'll really try

So many things I could have done
So much I failed to do
I've never needed anyone
As much as I need you

And it took a lot of lonely nights
To ever change my mind
It took a lot of missing youth
And things that I'd left behind

Intending to keep going

And my pride's not hard to swallow
Once I've chewed it long enough"

Better days, hear your songs on the hit parade,
Now they tell you we were behind you all the way. Yeah.
Shadow face, boy don't you let it all go to waste,
You've seen so many fall who thought they had it made.
Shadow face, you're much happier these days,
Does a smile really look so out of place,
Here on shadow face, right here on shadow face."

Seems such a bother
You made it so easy for me
To love another

So don't you blame her
For stealing me you let her
'Cause where your love stopped
She went a little bit farther

Why you changed so much
I was more at ease with a stranger
And it wasn't so hard
Our love was already in danger

Now she does everything
That pleases me that you never
And where your love stopped
She went a little bit farther

She went a little bit farther
Just to make me feel love
She considered my feelings
Now she's all that I'm thinking of

So don't blame her for stealing me
You know you let her
And where your love stopped
She went a little bit farther

Yeah, where your love stopped
She went a little bit farther"
Hank Williams Jr.,Something To Believe In,/h/hank+williams+jr/something+to+believe+in_21033824.html,"There ain't too much chance for opportunity
In this town that I live in
And I don't know what I'm gonna do with me
And it's getting hard to contend
With the fact that I ain't going nowhere
If I don't get out of here
I need a change of luck and a pick-me-up
Something more than the bars and the beers

I need something to believe in
Something to look forward to
Something to believe in
Cause I got a bad case of the blues
Something to believe in
Something to make me feel right
Something to believe in
Is that asking too much out of life

Well I quit my job
And I'm leaving today
Cause two hundred a week, it don't make it
I got a ticket going to L.A.
And I'm hoping I can take it
Cause I got enough money for about a month before I'll be back on the bus
But I got faith in me and all new things I see
I just need a little good luck

Well I was getting down
Soon I'd have to leave town
And I was out walking the street
When I met a girl
By the burger world
And I was needing her company
By the way she was dressed
I knew what to expect
When we got to her motel room
Ah, but when she found out I came from her hometown
She starting crying and Lord I did too

I need something to believe in
Ah, baby something to look forward to
Ah, do you feel like I do
Something to believe in
She said please stay with me tonight
I want something to believe in
Just talk to me and hold me tight

She was just eighteen
And I couldn't believe
What had happen since she left home
I thought I had some pains
But it wasn't the same
As the hell she had known
So we packed our stuff
And we got on the bus
And now it's back to the same old grind
But if you could have seen
The way she looked at me
When she saw the city limit sign

We got something to believe in
Something to look forward to
Something to believe in
And I believe in me and you
Something to believe in
Holding each other tight
Something to believe in
That special something called being in love to get us by"

Anymore I don't know
I'm just doing the best I can

Of a very famous man

As I travel around from town to town
I have a lot of dad's fans and friends come around
They say I know Hank would be proud of you
If he were here today

Now well, we're all so glad
And we know he would be too
That you're carryin' on
His music this way

Yes, they say Hank was the all time great
And we know you'll be just as good as your dad
But I just smile and say there'll never be another Hank Williams friends
That's the part that always makes them sad

Yes, I know that I'm not great
And some say, I imitate
Anymore I don't know
I'm just doing the best I can

It's hard standing in the shadows
Of a very famous man

So many times when I'm on that stage
I feel something go through me
And for a minute I'm in a different world
And that's when it does something to me

The people are a hollering and clapping real aloud
While I'm out they're taking my bows
I look up toward the ceiling and I say to myself
""Listen dad, just listen to that crowd""

But as the show goes on the people clap and holler more
I start to singing another of your great songs
That's the time that I know although you're gone
Your music will live on and on and on"

And both sides shut up

But do we just love trouble
Ain't the world got enough
Without y'all stirrin it up

I am from the old school
Cowboy hat, sure enough
Too damn old to change horses now
Cause I would probably fall off
I'm a little whiskey bent and slowed my roll
And if you ain't real sure about me
Why don't you take it up with Gretchen and Tim
Rockin Shawn Hannity

But you just love trouble
Ain't the world got enough
Without y'all stirrin it up

Back off

So some celeb has teed y'all off
Well, I get teed off too
Why didn't you know that you're supposed
To except our point of view
I have learned at the school of hard knocks
Things change quite a bit
Folks get all jacked up
I don't really give a... Darn

I got a little child and a fishing pole
A can of worms and a boat
I'm goin down to the river now
And let all my problems float
Yeah, I've mellowed a lot
And I don't jump into things like I used to
Hey, what'd you say
Why, you son of a gun
Now see what you made me do

I don't want no trouble
Ain't the world got enough
Without y'all stirrin it up

Stirrin it up

Let the pot simmer (stirrin it up)
Let the dust settle (stirrin it up)
Let's try and get along
And it'll be more better

I've picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs
And every road we took God knows
Our search was for the truth
And the clouds brewing now won't be the last.

Storms never last do they baby

Just a spark of the love that use to be
If you love somebody new let me me find a new love too

Be as fair to my heart as you can be

I'm so glad, don't be sad
There's no way you could feel bad
When this dear man with a tin pan
Started to play the blues! 

Met this white boy little Hiram (Hank)
Took him in right under his wing
And he'd say, Tee Tot make it ring
And he'd say, Tee Tot make it ring
And he would laugh and he would sing

Could you please, ""Show me""
""Show me""
""Show me, show me""
If I could play just like you
Why I'd give anything

Well he learned to play like the old man said he would
Little Hiram's got his name in Hollywood
I wish that Tee Tot could have stayed around
Then maybe Little Hiram would not have drowned
In all those things that does a boy
That wants to sing no good

Little Hiram's music's had a worldwide touch
And we all owe Mr. Rufus Payne so much
We got peanuts, fresh peanuts
Put your money in the tin cup
I can see them now with a big smile
Splittin' the days work up

Hank Williams Jr.,Tennessee Stud,/h/hank+williams+jr/tennessee+stud_20323351.html,"Back about 1825 I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a ridin' on the Tennessee Stud
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of his brothers was a bad outlaw
I send her a letter by my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

We drifted on down onto no man's land
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaiard foal
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns and he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud

Well I got just as lonesome as a man can be
Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
Cause he was dreaming of his sweetheart, too
We loped right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and whipped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a riding on the Tennessee Mare

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud

Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
And the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud
A pretty little baby and the cabin floor
A little horse cold playin' round the door
And I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud"

Have all been in Texas and all wearin' jeans

I'm a country plow-boy, not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

I thought I'd seen beauty in faraway places
Till I looked upon those Houston faces
Spent Hollywood nights up in Beverly Hills
But they weren't nothin' like one night down in Brownsville

I'm a country plow-boy, not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

I'm a pretty fair judge of the opposite s**
And I ain't seen nothin' that will touch 'em yet
They may be from Waco or out in Lampassas
But one thing about it, they all come from Texas

I'm a country plow-boy, not an urban cowboy
And I don't ride bulls but I have fought some men
Drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck
And I live to love Texas women

I'm an Oiler fan not a soccer man
And my arms are red and so is my blood
And they make it boil with that soft Texas drawl
And I love 'em all, Texas women"

Watermelon lip-gloss, kiss beneath the swamp moss,
On a moonlit night.

Above her hiney, high.

So I started drinkin
And took things that messed up my thinkin'
I was sure sinkin'

I was alone in the hotlight
Not too much left in sight
But she changed all that in one night
When she sang me this song

Well I guess you know of course I lost the farm that daddy sweated all his life to keep
And even worked sometimes by moonlight when all of us kids were sound to asleep
Now I guess we were all just too busy fulfilling each one's worldly dreams
To even care when they took the old chair along with all the other things
You know if you could capture all the love that we found in that old chair
Why you could wipe out all the hatred in this old world
And you'd still have a lotta love to spare
Now all I ask and it's not too much is just go with me down to the square
And let's take a look among all the other things at mama's old rocking chair
And look at all the teeth marks put there when we were small

Yea I'm the bartender in here and it's quite a scene
The women get dressed to kill and slip off their rings
Their husbands meet them an hour later
She'll have friends all around the table
And introduce the old man as one of her latest flings

Then they go out on the dance floor
Now there's a new man to sway for
And touch and talk and sip some more red wine
Then the slow dances get much closer
And now's the time for low words
That guy there with your wife's my husband but it's OK

Then I watch all of them leave
Then they share a stare and a squeeze
Now I don't know if it's wrong or right
I'm sure it feels good at the time
But if you keep on playin' this game you'll lose your mind

'Cause they're thinkin' about him or her
Then they feel like a piece of dirt
It's time to check out of the cheatin' hotel and go home for good

We get quite a few attractive lonely wives
They come in the bar together about six forty-five
And sit down and say with their eyes
My friend and I are lookin' for a good time
It don't take long to find a couple of guys at the cheatin' hotel

And then they go out on the dance floor
Now they got a new man to sway for
And touch and talk and sip some more red wine
Then the slow dances get much closer
And now they whisper low words
Are you married, why yes I am but that's OK

And they know it's really not, look at all the trouble they got

Somebody somewhere's gonna tell
And you'll be in the room from hell and you can't get away

Now the latest thing they want to stamp out is violence on tv
And the worst of all is that Oscar winning rabbit Bugs Bunny

They're messin' with our heroes and we got to stop 'em now

They're despicable

Nine, ten, hi come on in
Let's kiss and make up and start over again

Now we've all said and done things that we didn't mean
We get a little mad and we make a big scene
Oh yes I know it's kinda hard to go back
Be like Perry Mason though and get all the facts

One, two, three four, honey don't get mad and walk out like before
Five, six, seven, eight, we better make love girl before it's too late
Nine, ten, can I come in
Let's kiss and make up and start all over again

Since Adam and Eve men and women have disagreed
Love me or leave me ah that is the key
We got to control our temper to win
Why you son of a... Whoops, count slowly to ten

Sing one, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late
Nine, ten, hi come on in

(version from Osborne Brothers &quot; Country Bluegrass&quot; tape)

You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.

Well, the very first thing in the morning is &quot; Get Up.&quot;

The last thing I hear every night is &quot; Shut Up.&quot;

I found out my own cooking don't tast too hot.

You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.

Well, when I'm around the house, you're always a fussing.

Nothing pleases you and you start cussing.

I put up with you, and that's a heck of a lot.

You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.

If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,

But that would do you too much good so I'm not.

Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.

You aint' the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.

(Banjo plays a verse)

If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,

But that would do you too much good so I'm not.

Tomorrow when I wake, what will take the place
Of smiles on your face and black hair against white lace
And I wonder, will I be thinking of our early morning love
All the sweet things that you'd say that brighten my darkest day
And tomorrow night what do you suggest to take the place or your breasts

Breast against my chest oh how I'll miss your tenderness
But there's no use crying because loves a grown up game alittle pleasure and then alot pain
First we called each other bad names then what we had was never quite the same
I wish I could find eyes that won't cry
Lips that won't lie and a love that won't die
And a love that won't die"

That's the way it goes on the Nashville scene

Now there's a wino on the corner
He was a well known guitar picker 'til he got burned out by the game
Now he'll bum you for some whiskey and tell you how it was back in '52 when he played for Hank
And I'm watching the sun go down this evening and soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams
But before it does a new star will be shining and that's the way it is on the Nashville scene
From the outside its a castle, from the inside its a prison its easy to live way beyond your means

And its a long, long way to the top and even further when you drop and I've been on both ends of the Nashville scene
And I'm watching the sun go down this evening and soon it'll wake this town that's made of dreams
But before it does a new star will be shining and lighting up the ole Nashville scene
And I'm standing here as the sun goes down this evening and soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams

And it puts pressure on a man
If he ever lets his heart call his hand

Hank Williams Jr.,The Ride,/h/hank+williams+jr/the+ride_20303526.html,"Well I was thumbin' from Montgomery
Had my guitar on my back.
When a stranger stopped beside
Me in an antique cadillac.
He was dressed like nineteen fifty,
Half drunk and hollow eyed.
He said it's a long walk to Nashville, son would you like a ride?

I sat down in the front seat, he turned on the radio.
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers,
Was solid country gold.

Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale,
When he asked me for a light.
And I knew there was something strange about this ride.

Chorus:

He said ""Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing,
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues,
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said ""Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside,
'cause if you'rr big star bound let me warn ya it's a long hard ride. ""

Then he cried just south of Nashville,
And he turned that car around.
He said ""This is where you get off boy,
Because I'm going back to Alabam.
As I stepped out of that cadillac,
I said mister many thanks,
He said ""you don't have to call me mister, mister,
The whole world called me hank.

Chorus 2x

If you're big star bound let me warn ya,
It's a long hard ride."

And please kiss away my tears when I am through
It's just the same old story once again with a sweet beginning and a bitter end
A love affair that didn't turn out right
And the world has one more broken heart tonight

Would you like to dance oh you know it's been a long time
Since I had a woman satisfy my urge
But you know it never works a false love won't take away hurt
But just pretend I'm him and I'll pretend you're her
And it'll be just the same old story...
And the world had one more broken heart tonight"

Knows how to make the best plans fall apart

And I ain't but half the man I used to be

First thing in the morning and the last thing at night
Twisting and turning like a hurricane
Her love is driving me insane

My head hurts, my body aches
I quit drinking but I got the shakes
So sore I can hardly walk
And I just mumble when I tr-tr-try to talk

Stumbling and tumbling like a bumblebee
Her love is killing me
Her love is killing me

If I could just feel her love one night
I'd get some love and it's gonna be alright
I can see that wicked look in your eyes
Looks like we could be here all night

Can’t relax, I’m uptight

I had to back in and get my phone
When I came back again, he saw his car
Well, I thought it had crashed on it's own
What a bummer, I was so bought down
Race chased me all over Rockport town yellin'

(CHORUS)
Hey, Jonny
Hey, Jonny
Hey, Jonny
What's wrong with you?

Took my girl Jess to the Dayton disco
I jumpin' like a maniac
But Estella came and pulled me off the floor
Then she later took me 'round the back
She said "" I really like your shirt from the 50's
Your jeans are groovy and your hair's okay
But you don't sneak upon my Jessie like that
Sorry, Jonny but could you go away?""

(CHORUS)

Now I'm at home
I'm watchin' ""Dungeons And Dragons""
I guess time to trade Race's old car in
For my twenty buck from the Flagons
Guess I could take to my dad
Or I'm in trouble
Hadji could give me advice
No wait, that could burst my bubble
Race looked me in the eye and later then
He said ""Jonny, you blew it again""

(CHORUS)

(Hey, Jonny
What's wrong with you?)

Listen, I'm accident prone
No really

(Hey, Jonny
What's wrong with you?)

Oh man
Race, can I make it up to ya?

(Hey, Jonny
What's wrong with you?)

Hey, hey
I didn't mean to crash your car"

But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
Now I'm playin' it real straight and yes I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy but I don't even care
'Cause I can tell what's goin' on

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on tv
I'm workin' out most everyday and watchin' what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy, I know that it's nowhere
There is no denyin' that

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out, you see it everyday
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it, an idea who's time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy, don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

When it's raining cats and dogs outside
And the rain is saying, ""Now you're on your own""?

Though yesterday no one cared
They're getting your place prepared

Sooner or later when you say I love you

Said it just for fun

I'm never home

And the leaves came tumblin' down...

I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark.
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark.

It was Stagger Lee and Billy,
Two men who gambled late.
Stagger lee threw a seven,
Billy swore that he threw eight.

""Stagger Lee,"" said Billy,
""I can't let you go with that.
""You have won all my money,
""And my brand-new Stetson hat.""

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his. 44.
He said, ""I'm goin' to the barroom
""Just to pay that debt I owe.""

[Bridge:]
Go, Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he strolled across the barroom floor.
He said ""You did me wrong, Billy.""
And he pulled his. 44.

""Stagger Lee,"" said Billy,
""Oh, please don't take my life!
""I've got three hungry children,
""And a very sickly wife.""

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so hard
That a bullet went through Billy
And broke the bartender's bar.

Was tatooed on his arm
Walking throught the courtyard
Always there to be seen
He and little Janie
Together they were the king and queen

He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now

Three years later at the bus stop
I know I'll never forget
He looked smaller in real ways
As he bummed a cigarette
And I asked him what he'd been doing
And how's little Janie anyway
Seems he was drunk
They had a fight
Janie got hurt and they took him away

He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now

I can still see him standing there
Just like yesterday
Leaning on a '56
Giving his secrets away
Is it any wonder
I feel a little lonely
He's not just the only one
He's the one and only

I heard about the accident
There's not much left to say
He wandered out in the middl of the freeway
It must have happened right away
And I though about what a shame it was
Now that it's all said and done
And it may sound strange
But even now
He's still the only one

He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how

Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right

Next time you feel it it might make you mad

That's the power makes the world go'round

Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love

Can you feel it?

Hmmm

Plangent Visions Music, Ltd.

Now I can remember like it was only yesterday
Love was young and foolish like a little child at play
But oh how lovers change -- I never dreamed how easily
'Cause now I'm just a shadow of the boy I used to be

And when I write the book about my love
It will be about a man who's torn in half
About his hopes and ambitions wasted through the years
The pain will be written on every page in tears
When I write the book about my love


I was a fool to myself when I kept on runnin' around
And I fared little better when I tried settlin' down
Maybe some magic moment
I've never known one, not for long
For all too soon the magic is in a moment gone

And when I write the book about my love
It'll be a heartbreaking story about love and luck
When I get down on the pages all I felt
It will make the hardest-hearted of critics' hearts melt
When I write the book about my love

When I was young love was fun and I was so happy
I looked so good, and I dressed so snappy
Two-tone shoes on my feet, big old smile on my face
As I moved and grooved all over the place
Now I'm down in the heels, my complexion is bad
'Cause my love life is sadder than sad

And when I write the book about my love
It'll be a pop publication, tougher than tough

Now, here we are
Getting older
Wondering what we'll be
Life is short
Let's take advantage of
Every opportunity

While we're young
Let's go out
And have some fun
Baby, while we're young
Let's go out
And get us some
We better do it while we're young

We'll take a nap in the afternoon
That's just part of the fun
So much of you feels wasted on the young
Watch your tongue

We're not as good
As we once were
But we're as good once as we ever were
Tell the kids
We'll be late
And we'll need time to recuperate

While we're young
Let's go out
And have some fun

Let's go out

Line 'em up, move 'em along, haven't got much time

Who cares? Change the channel, standard shift
Who cares? Does anybody give a shit?

Dimwits on the freeway stay alive at 55
Politicians speeding, just trying to survive
Couldn't stop the press, what was a bloody mess
Mashin' down a paper sack and couldn't pass the test

She stopped in and I flashed my roll
I told her she could have all of my dough

She turned around, and with a frown
She said, ""This ain't no circus and I don't need a clown""

And your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
So there ain't no need in your hangin' around

Just to make the hit with that chick
I tried to get a Cadillac right quick
The man at the place looked so strange
I had nine hundred bucks and some change

We disagreed, I tried to plead
He said, ""I ain't no chicken and I don't need your feed""

Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Then brother, you're crawling we passed your speed

I'm walking and countin' my bucks
The man with the gun said, ""Hands up!""
I tried to get away but I was too slow
He caught me and took all of my dough

I heard him shout, as he cut out
You really lost nothing what you're crying about?

Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
And he took my watch and I passed out

I woke in the arms of a, a big cop
Police station next stop
The judge swung his fist down, plunk plunk
""Twenty dollar fine 'cause you're drunk""

""Dig up the dough, and you can go""
And all I had was a buffalo

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

Harry Chapin,"30,000 Pounds Of Bananas",/h/harry+chapin/30000+pounds+of+bananas_20150373.html,"It was just after dark when the truck started down
The hill that leads into Scranton Pennsylvania.
Carrying thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Carrying thirty thousand pounds (hit it Big John) of bananas.

He was a young driver,
Just out on his second job.
And he was carrying the next day's pasty fruits
For everyone in that coal-scarred city
Where children play without despair
In backyard slag-piles and folks manage to eat each day
About thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, just about thirty thousand pounds (scream it again, John) .

He passed a sign that he should have seen,
Saying ""shift to low gear, a fifty dollar fine my friend.""
He was thinking perhaps about the warm-breathed woman
Who was waiting at the journey's end.
He started down the two mile drop,
The curving road that wound from the top of the hill.
He was pushing on through the shortening miles that ran down to the depot.
Just a few more miles to go,
Then he'd go home and have her ease his long, cramped day away.
And the smell of thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes the smell of thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

He was picking speed as the city spread it's twinkling lights below him.
But he paid no heed as the shivering thoughts of the nights
Delights went through him.
His foot nudged the brakes to slow him down.
But the pedal floored easy without a sound.
He said ""Christ!""
It was funny how he had named the only man who could save him now.
He was trapped inside a dead-end hellslide,
Riding on his fear-hunched back
Was every one of those yellow green
I'm telling you thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

He barely made the sweeping curve that led into the steepest grade.
And he missed the thankful passing bus at ninety miles an hour.
And he said ""God, make it a dream!""
As he rode his last ride down.
And he said ""God, make it a dream!""
As he rode his last ride down.
And he sideswiped nineteen neat parked cars,
Clipped off thirteen telephone poles,
Hit two houses, bruised eight trees,
And Blue-Crossed seven people.
It was then he lost his head,
Not to mention an arm or two before he stopped.
And he smeared for four hundred yards
Along the hill that leads into Scranton, Pennsylvania.
All those thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

You know the man who told me about it on the bus,
As it went up the hill out of Scranton, Pennsylvania,
He shrugged his shoulders, he shook his head,
And he said (and this is exactly what he said)
""Boy that sure must've been something.
Just imagine thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds of mashed bananas.
Of bananas. Just bananas. Thirty thousand pounds.
Of Bananas. Not no driver now. Just bananas! ""

From Greatest Stories Live: Ending #1

Yes, we have no bananas,
We have no bananas today
(Spoken: And if that wasn't enough)
Yes, we have no bananas,
Bananas in Scranton, P A

From Greatest Stories Live: Ending #2:

A woman walks into her room where her child lies sleeping,
And when she sees his eyes are closed,
She sits there, silently weeping,
And though she lives in Scranton, Pennsylvania
She never ever eats... Bananas
Not one of thirty thousand pounds....  Of bananas"
Harry Chapin,A Better Place To Be,/h/harry+chapin/a+better+place+to+be_20163182.html,"A Better Place To Be Lyrics

It was an early morning bar room,
And the place just opened up.
And the little man come in so fast and
Started at his cups.
And the broad who served the whisky
She was a big old friendly girl.
And she tried to fight her empty nights
By smilin' at the world.

And she said ""Hey Bub, It's been awhile
Since you been around.
Where the hell you been hidin'?
And why you look so down? ""

But the little man just sat there like he'd never heard a sound.

The waitress she gave out with a cough,
And acting not the least put off,
She spoke once again.

She said, ""I don't want to bother you,
Consider it's understood.
I know I'm not no beauty queen,
But I sure can listen good. ""

And the little man took his drink in his hand
And he raised it to his lips.
He took a couple of sips.
And he told the waitress this story.

""I am the midnight watchman down at Miller's Tool and Die.
And I watch the metal rusting, and I watch the time go by.
A week ago at the diner I stopped to get a bite.
And this here lovely lady she sat two seats from my right.
And Lord, Lord, Lord she was alright.

""Well, she was so damned beautiful she could warm a winter's frost.
But she was long past lonely, and well nigh onto lost.
Now I'm not much of a mover, or a pick-em-up easy guy,
But I decided to glide on over, and give her one good try.
And Lord, Lord, Lord she was worth a try.

""Tongued-tied like a school boy, I stammered out some words.
But it did not seem to matter much, 'cause I don't think she heard.
She just looked clear on through me to a space back in my head.
And it shamed me into silence, as quietly she said,
'If you want me to come with you, then that's all right with me.
Cause I know I'm going nowhere, and anywhere's a better place to be.
Anywhere's a better place to be. '

""I drove her to my boarding house, and I took her up to my room.
And I went to turn on the only light to brighten up the gloom.
But she said, 'Please leave the light off, for I don't mind the dark. '
And as her clothes all tumbled 'round her, I could hear my heart.
The moonlight shone upon her as she lay back in my bed.
It was the kind of scene I only had imagined in my head.
I just could not believe it, to think that she was real.
And as I tried to tell her she said 'Shhh.. I know just how you feel.
And if you want to come here with me, then that's all right with me.
'Cause I've been oh so lonely, lovin' someone is a better way to be.
Anywhere's a better way to be. '

""The morning come so swiftly as I held her in my arms.
But she slept like a baby, snug and safe from harm.
I did not want to share her or dare to break the mood,
So before she woke I went out and brought us both some food.

""I came back with my paper bag, to find that she was gone.
She'd left a six word letter saying 'It's time that I moved on. '""

The waitress she took her bar rag, and she wiped it across her eyes.
And as she spoke her voice came out as something like a sigh.
She said ""I wish that I was beautiful, or that you were halfway blind.
And I wish I weren't so doggone fat, I wish that you were mine.
And I wish that you'd come with me, when I leave for home.
For we both know all about loneliness, and livin' all alone. ""

And the little man,
Looked at the empty glass in his hand.
And he smiled a crooked grin,
He said, ""I guess I'm out of gin.
And know we both have been so lonely.
And if you want me to come with you, then that's all right with me.
'Cause I know I'm goin' nowhere and anywhere's a better place to be. """
Harry Chapin,A Lot Of Lonely People Tonight,/h/harry+chapin/a+lot+of+lonely+people+tonight_20579176.html,"Holdin' on tight to my pillow
Wish it had a life of it's own,
Starin' at the ceilin,'
Such a funny feelin,'
But nobody's home.
But I know you're out there somewhere
And that you feel the same way too,
Now my only problem is trying to find
A way of getting through to you.

There's a lot of lonely people tonight,
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light.
There's me and you, babe, that's alright,
There's a lot of lonely people tonight.

I guess we share the same old dream
Or maybe it's the same old lie,
There's only one thing I'm sure of, babe
And that's our time keeps rolling by.
And far too many days run out
And nights begin this way,
With my half of a hopeful couple
Trying to hold the dark at bay.
Meet me on a city street
Meet me by a country stream,
Meet me on a mountain top
But don't you meet me in my dreams.
Meet me tomorrow morning
Baby, maybe you met me back when,
You can meet me now inside this song
'Cause I don't wanna sleep alone again."
Harry Chapin,A Quiet Little Love Affair,/h/harry+chapin/a+quiet+little+love+affair_20301437.html,"When I met America, I didn't know her name
But it seems she was something special even then
I knew it just the same

Yes, I loved the things she stood for
Help the helpless make people free
And I knew that an American is what I wanted to be

It was the start of a little love affair
Between my country and me
Oh, oh, my country tis of thee

Well we both grew up, things were good
Things that we had known
Some said we had lost something
Some said we had grown

Well time keeps rolling by my friend,
Things can never die.
But I had always wonder what would happen,
Wondered when and why,

What would happen to our little love affair,
Between my country and me,
Oh, oh, my country tis of thee,

Oh, time went by and I forgot,
Why I fell in love,
Though I still pledge my allegiance,
And soon I would wave the flag above,

Didn't know why what we'd done,
Didn't know where it flowed,
Well I never knew if we had lost,
If we had grown,

It was the last of a little love affair,
Between my country and me,
(back ground: Oh say can you see, my country tis of thee)
Oh, oh, my country tis of thee."
Harry Chapin,And The Baby Never Cries,/h/harry+chapin/and+the+baby+never+cries_20271069.html,"Well, I've sung out one more evening,
And I'm wrung out, feeling beat.
I walk on out the door once more
To an empty city street.
A Good guitar will serve you well
When you're living in the lights
But it's never going to warm you
In the middle of the night.
And so I come and go with her in whispers.
Each and every time she says she dies.
When she is reborn again
I kiss her.
And the baby never cries.
She works in the daytime,
She leave her baby with a friend.
I sing every evening,
I only see her now and then.
I come to her at midnight,
When 'bout half the world's asleep,
And she puts me back together,
In the hours before I leave.
Her apartment is down on Perry Street,
There's a tree in her backyard
And it rubs the bedroom window
When the wind is blowing hard.
Her old man had left her,
He just took off for the coast,
And I caught her on the rebound
When I needed her the most."
Harry Chapin,Anthem,/h/harry+chapin/anthem_20276042.html,"She wasn't very pretty.
She wasn't very smart.
But everything she said to him came strait from her heart.

Write a song about me.
Sing a song that's of my day.
Everybody's special in there ordinary way.

Chorus:
He was looking for an anthem.
He was looking for a song.
Looking for a melody singing brings the world along.

He was strumming his guitar,
He was searching their eyes,
If he can't find his anthem will he buy the compromise?

One child was brown and hungry.
One a red injun girl.
One child was black and angry.
One from the other half the world.

And as he heard their silent screams,
That they have sounded there for years,
It had been lost among the whispers,
And drowned out by their tears.

Chorus

He kept looking for a story,
He kept looking for a plot.
He kept on looking in the wonder,
If he was blind or not.

All he found was bugle fragments,
That he'd left there in his youth.
But he never found the music,
To accompany the truth.

Now the old man had been young once,
The old man had been strong.
He once had a family, but they'd grown up and moved along.

The old man told him loneliness, is what the years would bring,
But the old man couldn't tell him,
How to make the long years sing.

Chorus"
Harry Chapin,Any Old Kind Of Day,/h/harry+chapin/any+old+kind+of+day_20288971.html,"Turning on my pillow, thinking kind of strange.
The color is of midnight in this room.
The cars outside are coughing and it's kind of hard to sleep
And there's neon out the window, not the moon.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?

I whistled round today and I skipped off a footloose jig
To the hurdy gurdy music of the street.
I looked past those rooftops and I saw the cloudless sky,
But I keep on asking why my life is passing by,
And I'm left up high and dry,
But it ain't no good to cry,
So I shrug my useless sigh,
And I trust to things that other days will meet.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?

The night has had it's laughing,
When the street lights blind the stars,
So now it's shedding rain to sing it's sorrow,
It's time for me to sleep and to rest these thoughts away,
There's gonna be another day, hey!
When things will go my way,
And there's other things to say,
And there's other songs to play,
And there'll be time enough for thinking come tomorrow.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?"
Harry Chapin,Babysitter,/h/harry+chapin/babysitter_20151705.html,"When I rearrange the pieces of the puzzle of my past
I sigh at the heartaches, relive the laughs
And I think about the moments that have left their mark
And the too few faces that shine a little light in the dark


If you don't mind I'm gonna tell you a story
And I think that it won't bore you
For it's a tale that I've never told
To anyone before you-- 'cause it's for you


The sun of sixteen summers had put halos in your hair
If anything was in my head, twelve winters put it there
A dollar an hour is what Mama paid you to come and mind her kids
But no one could really pay you enough for what you really did


Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand
I was much too late
To be the first to make you a woman
But you were the one
Who made my mother's son a man


You know I used to read myself to sleep when I went to bed
I guess I was a dreamer then who lived inside my head
But the nights that you came you talked of things, I found I had a friend
You brought my fears of people to a sure and gentle end


Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand
I was much too late
To be the first to make you a woman
But you were the one
Who made my mother's son a man


Do you remember the night when you turned out the light
And said to me: ""Please hold me""
I did not know which way to go
So I did just what you told me ""Please hold me""


When I think about you now it's not that my memory fails
There's just no need for graphic telling of all the details
Let's just say you taught me something that brought me from my shell
You gave to me that first sweet taste of the heaven here in this hell


Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand
I was much too late
To be the first to make you a woman
But you were the one
Who made my mother's son a man"
Harry Chapin,Barefoot Boy,/h/harry+chapin/barefoot+boy_20159381.html,"Oh, barefoot boy,
Once he came unto a land of forests,
And of streams
That tumbled through the meadows to the sea.
He called it home for many were it's wonders
And he learned to live upon the land
Taking only what he needed.
Barefoot boy
He don't like the concrete
Seek the country any way he can.
Barefoot boy
Fading down the street.
I know he'll never come this way again.
Time passes on,
In this life of always changing
People coming
Building cities
Cut your forest
Pave your highway.
Oh barefoot boy,
Wraps his blanket 'round his shoulders,
Says goodbye to misty valleys,
Once more he sets off to wander."
Harry Chapin,Basic Protest Song,/h/harry+chapin/basic+protest+song_20152384.html,"CHORUS:

So your 13 and there's a silent scream out there,
And you can hear it.
Just your basic protest song.

Now your 16 and there's a danger in the air,
And you can see it.
Just your basic protest song.

Turnin' 20 and it's around you everywhere,
And you can feel it.
Just your basic protest song.

Now your 30 and it's to late now to care,
And you can taste it.
Just your basic protest song


Well, I just turned 13 don't know what I wanna be,
I don't have much experience but I'll tell you what I see.
When I hear the record sing and baby, baby I love you,
It seems to me we all got so much lovin left to do.

And at 16 I don't know to much but I'll tell you what I do know,
If you do not give a damn I'll tell you where to go.
There is something truly crazy with our patriotic song,
We know to wave the flag round the week begins a strong.

CHORUS

Oh now that I am 20 got my first full time job,
My boss, upstanding citizen, finds legal ways to rob.
They say forget what you believe forget what you have seen,
But I know I lost the best of me when I forgot my dreams.

I'm passin' on through 30 got two kids of my own,
Got a wife, house, a car, and dog but still I am alone.
And I'm tired of only selling cause it's myself that I sell,
I'm glad of always buying cause I can't buy it ourselves.

I know none of us is perfect I can see myself to well,
If we can't push for paradise we're settled in for hell.

Harry Chapin,Bluesman,/h/harry+chapin/bluesman_20156416.html,"The kid heard the word up in Brooklyn.
It was his second year of medical school.
He went and stashed some jeans into his guitar case,
His father said, ""You're a fool"".
But the boy jumped on board a Greyhound bus,
It took him two days to get to Mobile,
And though it took two weeks to track the old man down,
He never doubted that the rumor was real.
But there the old man stood by the store front,
With his white cane hanging from his belt.
And he was bending the steel of his guitar strings
So it seemed like the metal had to melt.
He was the last of the street corner singers
Paying his final years of dues
The voice in his throat was like a bullfrog croak
Yes it's he who invented the blues.
""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm
Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman
Who you're faithful to for life. ""
Well the kid walked up as the blind man finished
And was bent to put his guitar away.
The old man heard him and said, ""Who are you?""
""I'm the kid you're gonna teach to play.""
The old man laughed but the kid kept talking 'bout
How he'd help him get around
That's when the old man said,
""I don't need no fool to get me where in the hell I'm bound""
The kid nods his head with a great big grin and says,
""When do we begin?""
That's when the old man said,
""If You're staying with me
This is how it's got to be... ""

Harry Chapin,Bummer,/h/harry+chapin/bummer_20157752.html,"His mama was a midnight woman
His daddy was a drifter drummer
One night they put it together
Nine months later came the little black bummer

He was a laid back lump in the cradle
Chewing the paint chips that fell from the ceiling
Whenever he cried he got a fist in his face
So he learned not to show his feelings

He was a pig-tail puller in grammer school
Left back twice by the seventh grade
Sniffing glue in Junior High
And the first one in school to get laid

He was a weed-speed pusher at fifteen
He was mainlining skag a year later
He'd started pimping when they put him away
In jail he changed from a junkie to a hater

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head. ""

They threw him back on the street, he robbed an A & P
He didn't blink at the buddy that he shafted
And just about the time they would have caught him too
He had the damn good fortune to get drafted

He was A-One bait for Vietnam, you see they needed more bodies in a hurry
He was a cinch to train cause all they had to do
Was to figure how to funnel his fury

They put him in a tank near the D M Z
To catch the gooks slipping over the border
They said his mission was to Search and Destroy
And for once he followed and order

One sweat-soaked day in the Yung-Po Valley
With the ground still steaming from the rain
There was a bloody little battle that didn't mean nothing
Except to the few that remained

You see a couple hundred slants had trapped the other five tanks
And had started to pick off the crews
When he came on the scene and it really did seem
This is why he'd paid those dues

It was something like a butcher going berserk
Or a sane man acting like a fool
Or the bravest thing that a man had ever done
Or a madman blowing his cool

Well he came on through like a knife through butter
Or a scythe sweeping through the grass
Or to say it like the man would have said it himself:
""Just a big black bastard kicking ass!""

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head. ""

When it was over and the smoke had cleared
There were a lot of V C bodies in the mud
And when the rescued men came over for the very first time
They found him smiling as he lay in his blood

They picked up the pieces and they stitched him back together
He pulled through though they thought he was a goner
And it force them to give him what they said they would
Six purple hearts and the Medal of Honor

Of course he slouched as the chief white honkey said:
""Service beyond the call of duty""
But the first soft thought was passing through his mind
""My medal is a Mother of a beauty!""

He got a couple of jobs with the ribbon on his chest
And though he tried he really couldn't do 'em
There was only a couple of things that he was really trained for
And he found himself drifting back to 'em
Just about the time he was ready to break
The V A stopped sending him his checks
Just a matter of time 'cause there was no doubt
About what he was going to do next

It ended up one night in a grocery store
Gun in hand and nine cops at the door
And when his last battle was over
He lay crumpled and broken on the floor

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head. ""

Well he'd breathed his last, but ten minutes past
Before they dared to enter the place
And when they flipped his riddled body over they found
His second smile frozen on his face

They found his gun where he'd thrown it
There was something else clenched in his fist
And when they pried his fingers open they found the Medal of Honor
And the Sergeant said: ""Where in the hell he get this?""

There was a stew about burying him in Arlington
So they shipped him in box to Fayette
And they kind of stashed him in a grave in the county plot
The kind we remember to forget

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head. """
Harry Chapin,Burning Herself,/h/harry+chapin/burning+herself_20160757.html,"She was crazy (she was beautiful),
I guess she had to be.
I was angry (you were blind),
Because I could not see.
I saw only what her cigarettes had done to her skin.
I should have known the outside world
Would reveal what was within.
She was burning herself,
And her hair was filled with ashes.
She was burning herself,
And her life becomes a flame.
She was burning herself,
And the flame became her passion.
She was burning herself,
And her passion,
Her passion was her pain.
She was trusting (you could have saved her too),
All hope had passed for her.
I was lusting (and she gave to you),
That's all I asked for her.
The marks upon her body
And the marks upon her mind.
I could have erased them
If I'd only taken the time.
I never saw her do it,
I only saw the scars.
I never could imagine
What would make her go that far.
I wondered,
Was she driven by desperate need to feel,
To find out she was living,
To discover life was real.
Or was it that the pain
Slicing through her like a knife
Was easier to take
Than the emptiness of life?
Had a strange sense of drama
Caught her in a role,
Or was she trying to cauterize
The chancres on her sole?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know..."

Comes from the rain
Glistening and shivering
She laughs as she shakes off the weather
Caroline
Whispers her words
Saying she'll always love me
At least when we are together
Caroline
Starts closing in
Surrounding the spot
Where watching in wonder I stand
Caroline
She's shedding her rings
Her bracelets and stockings
And placing her skin still moist in the palm of my hand

You're pressing she smiles
It's too soon to ask
For me to cast off my cover
You assume that I'm caught
Up there in your head
So now I must go to my lover.

Her world is such a sudden place
A minute flashed before my face
To fly to feel to fall from grace
Oh Caroline - I'm leaning, careening

This bubble that I choose to chase
Keeps breaking on the brink of space
Just as I'm about to taste
It's meaning - Caroline

Caroline
Comes from the full moon
Trembling and grieving
Afraid of the march of the seasons
Caroline
You're too young to be running
Too old to be lying
Too wise not to see all the reasons
Caroline
Hangs her cape and her jeans
And surrenders her tears
To christen my pillow with sorrow
Caroline
She remains after times
To explain what she means, she speaks of today
More than she dreams of tomorrow

She says - Never has life
Been so full of the urge
To let go of the night and believe
She collects all her things
While she's still of a mind
So soft it's like breathing she leaves."
Harry Chapin,Cat's In The Cradle,/h/harry+chapin/cats+in+the+cradle_20178342.html,"[Verse:]
My child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay,
He learned to walk while I was away.
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, yeh,
I know I'm gonna be like you"".

[Chorus:]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon.
""When ya comin' home Dad?""
""I don't know when, we'll get together then, son,
Ya know we'll have a good time then"".

[Verse 2:]
Well my son turned 10 just the other day,
He said ""Thanks for the ball Dad, come let's play.
Can ya teach me to throw? "" I said
""Not today, I got a lot to do."" He said ""That's ok"".
And then, he walked away but his smile never dimmed,
He said ""I'm gonna be like him, yeh,
Ya know I'm gonna be like him"".

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon.
""When ya comin' home Dad?""
""I don't know when, we'll get together then, son,
Ya know we'll have a good time then"".

[Verse 3:]
Well he came from college just the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son I'm proud of you, can ya sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like Dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See ya later, can I have them please? ""

Little Boy Blue and The Man In The Moon.

Well I've long since retired, my son's moved away,
I called him up just the other day.
I said ""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.""
He said ""I'd love to Dad, if I can find the time.
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,
But it's sure nice talking to you Dad,
It's been sure nice talking to you. ""
And as he hung up the phone it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like, my boy, was just like me.

Harry Chapin,Changes,/h/harry+chapin/changes_20166400.html,"I was cramped into a coffee house pew
Two dollar coke in my hand
Listening to the music run
Through and out of a drowning man.
Ten years ago I first heard him singing
To a screaming crazy crowd
Now there's thirteen loyal people
Trying to sound that loud.
And I wonder as I watch him now
Why his songs don't turn me on.
He got me into music
Where has the fragile magic gone?
And all the changes
Keep on changing
And the good old days
They say they're gone.
Only wise men
And some new born fools
Say they know what's going on.
But I sometimes think the difference is
Just in how I think and see
And the only changes going on
Are going on in me.
There was you and Fifth avenue
Before there were lies
And all my hot blood schemes
And teenage dreams
Flashed before my eyes.
I did not think I had a chance
You had to prove me wrong
It took a year and a half
Of tears and laughs
Before you moved along.
And now these long years later
When I see you once again
I wonder what you saw in me
When you loved me way back then.
There I was in you Air Force
Uncle Sam, you owned my brain.
I tried to see myself as a s** mad savior
Sailing on a silver plane.
I started out to do my duty
Ended up just doing time.
What is it about you
My mother of a country
That makes so many change our minds.
You had me on your honor roll
For your dream I would die
Now I would not even cross the street
To help you live a lie."

Sunrise and sundown;
Moon rolls thru the nighttime;
Till the daybreak comes around.

All my life's a circle;
But I can't tell you why;
Season's spinning round again;
The years keep rollin' by.

It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling;
That we'll all be together again.
No straight lines make up my life;
And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

Chorus:
I found you a thousand times;
I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other;
It's like a children's game;

As I find you here again;
A thought runs through my mind;
Our love is like a circle;
Let's go 'round one more time.

Harry Chapin,Copper,/h/harry+chapin/copper_20174527.html,"If you were looking for a way to make me mad it was a sure fire way you found
Acting like a half wit fool, laying your money around
Well I came back here to tell you Lou, 'bout what you almost did
Don't you ever put the cash on the counter Lou, when I'm with my kid
Yeah the kid's thirteen he's growing Lou, two years and he'll be bigger than me
Still he thinks I'm strong as a blacksmith and straighter than the tall oak tree
I raised him alone ten years now since his Mama ran away
And you ain't gonna blow his image of me for the stunt like you pulled today

Chorus:
They took the copper right out of the penny Lou
They got the pig locked up in the pen
But you're in big trouble with me, yes you
If you ever do that again
Ten bucks a week protection don't mean I can't knock you down
You've got to treat me like a living saint Lou, whenever my son's around

Yeah the kid wants to be a policeman just like me
You know he'll be a good one the way I started out to be
And he just might end up police chief, now wouldn't that be something to see?
'Cause then the kid would kick right off of the force all the two-bit grifters like me

Chorus

I guess it was when my old lady left me and she took off with a salesman guy
I started to see things so differently, cut your own slice out of the pie
Yeah I grew up and it came clear to me all the smart cops on the make
You get a silver badge not an old tin star when you're on the take
It's pimps and whores, punk gang wars, robberies and homicides
When you walk the beat with the creeps on the street, well there ain't no way to hide
I spent half my life without no wife ridin' herd on the scum of the earth
I learned the tricks of the trade from the gutter parade and then I prayed for all I'm worth
Don't you know I appreciate the money Lou, 'cause it all goes into the bank
And when I send my kid to college someday I'll have guys like you to thank
Yeah ten bucks a week on your grocery store means you don't have to worry 'bout crime But hold your money when the kid's with me you can pay me double next time

Harry Chapin,Corey's Coming,/h/harry+chapin/coreys+coming_20177417.html,"Old John Joseph was a man with two first names
They left him in the railroad yard when they took away the trains
Only one run a week comes on roaring down that line
So all he's got to worry 'bout is time.

I come by in the evening to hear 'bout where he's been
He says - Come on sit down Kid, where shall I begin?
He starts telling me the stories of the glories of his past
But he always saves the story of his Corey for the last.

And he says - My Corey's coming. No more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like I told you, when she holds you
She enfolds you in her world.

I was quite surprised to find out all the places that he knew
And so I asked the townfolk if his stories were true
They said - Old John was born here, he's lived here all his life
He's never had a woman, let alone a wife.

And very soon you'll find out as you check around
That no one named Corey's ever lived in this town
So I chided the old man 'bout the truth that I had heard
He smiled and said - Reality is only just a word.

I came by one evening but he did not hear my shout
I looked in the window and saw the fire was out
When he would not wake up I forced in the door
And found that Old John Joseph would tell stories no more.

The scene at the graveyard, three of us were there
Me and the gravedigger heard the parson's prayer
He said - We need not grieve for this man,
For we know that God cares!

They put the cold dirt over him and left me on my own
And when at last I looked up I saw I was not alone
Standing there in silence with a shaw around her face
Stood a beautiful young woman
""Is that John Joseph there?""
I nodded my head yes.
That brought a soft smile to her.
She said ""It's time he, he got some rest""
So I said - If you're a relative, he had a peaceful end.
She said - My name is Corey - you can say I'm just a friend.

Corey's coming, no more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like I told you, when she holds you
She enfolds you in her world.

So that's the old man's story, I'm glad you came tonight
A busted down old railroad yard sure makes a lonely sight
You may wonder why a young man would work out here alone
Well the job pays enough to keep some flesh on my bones.

And I confess I get to missing the old man a bit
And there's one other reason I guess I should admit -

Can't you see my Corey's coming, no more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like he told me, when she holds me
She enfolds me in her world."

She went sliding through my questions,
Gliding 'round the answer.

And each time I tried to hold her
Her smile came sad and slowly.
She said, ""No one knows me.""

Could you put your light on please, it's kind of dark tonight.
And I feel a little lonely, yes, I need a little light.
Could you put your light on please, let me hear a friendly sound.
I could make it through 'til morning if you could let your light shine down.

She had a dream, I had my typewriter.
While I was hacking out such a heavy world
She was weaving one much lighter.
But I'll never know just how much it cost her,
And as I slept beside her something turned and tossed her.
And it did till I lost her.

Could you put your light on please, it's kind of dark tonight.
And I feel a little lonely, yes, I need a little light.
Could you put your light on please, let me hear a friendly sound.

You say I'm selling out,
But how in the hell is a mad s'posed to live?
Selling's what it's all about.

Hello, Sir, I'm the Pocano Land
Development Company,
And I'm calling you with an offer of some land
That you'll just have to see.
A quarter-acre plot, that's what I've got for you
Nineteen ninety-five, four hundred dollars down
And just ten bucks a week
It's two short hours from New York City,
A Pocano Land Site green and pretty.
There's lakes there, and trout streams,
Mountain views, Country Dreams,
Contry Dreams.

We dreamed our dreams in college, girl
Back then we thought we should,
And we promised that we would save the world
Way back then we thought we could.

I know you love your teaching now, but I wish you'd understand,
There aren't that many jobs around, I'm doing the best I can.

Hello, Sir...

I'm here with forty other guys
Crowded in a room,
Making a living selling the moon
And rustic dreams in June.
I used to hate the city now I'm dwelling in it,
Used to love the country now I'm selling it.
I'm doing well at it,
That's the hell of it!

I said that we would find a farm
And live out on the land,
It's strange how dreams come back at us
In ways that we had never planned.
Here I'm selling real estate
And laughing at myself,
If I can't have my country dream
I'm gonna sell it out to somebody else!

Darling, don't get mad at me
I'm doing this for you,
It's really not so sad to see we had
Growing up to do.
Please don't push me anymore
It's gonna work out fine,
I know I said I'd quit before
But just give me a little more time."

Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me"
Harry Chapin,Dancin' Boy,/h/harry+chapin/dancin+boy_20184076.html,"When your daddy plays guitar,
You dance without a smile.
Kid you may not have great rhythm,
But you sure got style.
Just four years old and still it seems,
You've got it figured out.
When daddy sings, and then you dance,
The people clap and shout.

'cause, you're my dancin'  boy,
And it's so scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
Dancin'  boy, I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin'  means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

Yes, I'm so proud when you are with me,
That my heart digs in my throat.
And when you stop to strut your stuff,
My eyes go all afloat.
And when I have to leave you home
As sometimes it must be.
I feel that with my leaving
I leave far too much of me.

Yes, you're my dancin'  boy,
And it's scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
You're my dancin'  boy,
I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin'  means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

You know the time will come my dancin'  boy
When you're dancin'  days are done,
And when daddy and his dancin'  boy
Will have dwindled down to one.

You know the world will've taught you other steps
To match the march of time,
So you'll have to keep our dancin'  days
Dancin'  in your mind.

Yes, do your dancin', boy,
'cause it's so scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
Do your dancin', boy.
I'm sure by now that you must see
You're dancin'  means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine."
Harry Chapin,Dirt Gets Under The Fingernails,/h/harry+chapin/dirt+gets+under+the+fingernails_20189127.html,"Now he was a man who worked with his hands
Only in a motor he found peace
He could make an engine sing like a bird
He could find his only lind of release
When he was up to the elbows in the grease.


She dreamed of a time for painting
As she was cleaning up his stains from the rug
She'd play all day with their children
And try to meet him with a welcome and hug
As he came shuffling through the house with a shrug


I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.


While he was making magic with his piston machines
She was cleaning up the mess he'd left behind.
She was trying to make it through to the end of the day
With a little empty time
And do the painting that meant peace of mind.


I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.


Well one day she didn't bother 'bout making his bed.
She hurried all the children out the door.
And she let the bills and the marketing go.
And she went and almost bought out an art supply store.


It just so happened that day he got to thinking.
Of the grease that always covered up his skin.
So he left the garage a little early
He got a shave and a manicure and trim
Came out clean as a plaster maniquin.


He came home in a hurry
But he almost didn't recognize the place.
It looked like it'd been hit by a hurricane.
There was canvas filling every open space.
And she had paint all over her face.


I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.


They both stood stunned into silence
Then their laughter exploded like a shout
And he went out to make some magic in the kitchen
The clean man learning what cooking was about.
And the dirty girl painting her messy heart out.


I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in."
Harry Chapin,Dogtown,/h/harry+chapin/dogtown_20181741.html,"Up in Massachusetts There's a little spit of land.
The men who make the maps, yes, they call the place Cape Ann.
The men who do the fishing call it Gloucester Harbor Sound,
But the women left behind, they call the place Dogtown.


The men go out for whaling, past the breakers and the fogs.
The women stay home waiting they're protected by the dogs.
A tough old whaler woman who had seen three husbands drown,
Polled the population and she named the place Dogtown.


There's all these grey faced women in their black widow's gowns,
Living in this grave yard granite town.
Yeah, you soon learn there's many more than one way to drown;
That's while going to the dogs here in Dogtown.


And she speaks: My father was a merchant all in the Boston fief.
When my husband came and asked him for my hand.
But little did I know then that a Gloucester whaler's wife
Marries but the sea salt and the sand.


He took me up to Dogtown the day I was a bride.
We had ten days together before he left my side.
He's the first mate of a whaling ship,
The keeper of the log.
He said, ""Farewell, my darling, I'm going to leave you with my dog.""


And I have seen the splintered timbers of a hundred shattered hulls,
Known the silence of the granite and the screeching of the gulls,
I've heard that crazy widow Cather walk the harbor as she raves
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.


Sitting by the fireside, the embers slowly die.
Is it a sign of weakness when a woman wants to cry?
The dog is closely watching the fire glints in his eye.
No use to go to sleep this early, no use to even try.


My blood beats like a woman's,
I've got a woman's breast and thighs.
But where am I to offer them
To the ocean or the skies?


Living with this silent dog
All the moments of my life,
He has been my only husband;
Am I a widow, or his wife?


Yes, it's a Dogtown and it's a fog town,
And there's nothing around 'cept the sea pounding granite ground
And this black midnight horror of a hound.


I'm standing on this craggy cliff,
My eyes fixed on the sea.
Six months past, when his ship was due,
I'm a widow to be.
For liking this half living with the lonely and the fog,
You need the bastard of the mating of a woman and a dog.


And I have seen the splintered timbers of a hundred shattered hulls,
Known the silence of the granite and the screeching of the gulls,
I've heard that crazy widow Cather walk the harbor as she raves
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves."
Harry Chapin,Dreams Go By,/h/harry+chapin/dreams+go+by_20188293.html,"There you stand in your dungarees
Looking all grown up and so very pleased
When you write your poems they have so much to say
When you speak your dreams it takes my breath away


You know I want to be a ball player
A regular slugging fool
But I guess our dreams must wait awhile
Until we finish school


And so you and I
We watch our years go by
We watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday


I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
Till our time just drifts away


There you stand in your wedding dress
You're so beautiful that I must confess
I'm so proud you have chosen me
When a doctor is what you want to be


You know I want to be a painter, girl
A real artistic snob
But I guess we'll have our children first
You'll find a home, I'll get a job


And so you and I
We watch our years go by
We watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
Till our time just drifts away


Listen to the seasons passing
Listen to the wind blow
Listen to the children laughing
Where do broken dreams go?


There you stand in your tailored suit
So many years gone by, but you're still so cute
You take the car to go and meet the bus
When our grandchildren come to visit us


You say you should have been a ballerina, babe
There are songs I should have sung
But I guess our dreams have come and gone
You're 'sposed dream when you are young


And so you and I
We watched our years go by
We watched our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday


I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
Till our time just drifts away"
Harry Chapin,Empty,/h/harry+chapin/empty_20261588.html,"Empty closet, empty heart.
Empty morning, day won't start.
Well, I got no place to go now,
I really do not know how
To like my life, now that you're gone.

Empty mailbox, empty head.
Empty promise, empty bed.
I really can't believe in the thought of you just leaving.
But no one's here, You must be gone.

I guess I took you for granted,
I thought of us as one.
But now the laugh's on me 'cause your half of me
Just took off with the sun.

Empty pocket, empty day.
Empty feeling won't go away.
Well, I never meant to use you,
And I never thought I'd lose you.
But no one's here and you are gone.

Empty closet, empty heart.
Empty morning, day won't start.
Well, I got no place to go now,
I really do not know how
To like my life, now that you're gone.

I got an empty icebox, I got an empty head.
And it's an empty morning in my empty bed.
There's nothing in the mailbox there's nothing in my heart.
And I'm feeling kind of lonely 'cause the day won't start."
Harry Chapin,Everybody's Lonely,/h/harry+chapin/everybodys+lonely_20579175.html,"All I got is time, Nothing else is mine.
All I want is you and one more tomorrow.
Nothing lasts to long, When I leave it's gone.
So I send my mind ahead and hope to follow.


Yes, I know I have a lifetime coming,
But I've got it all figured out,
Everybody's lonely, Everybody's lonely,
Everybody's lonely, That's what it's all about.


I've had my share of heartaches, misfortune and mistakes.
Occasion'ly this life has left me battered.
But I can't blame no one else, 'cause what I've done to myself
Is the only kind of history that matters.


Yes, I know I have a lifetime coming,
But I've got it all figured out,
Everybody's lonely, Everybody's lonely,
Everybody's lonely, That's what it's all about.


Now, maybe you'll come with me, and maybe you will stay,
And maybe you'll just watch awhile then wander.
It seems like all the good things in my life just drift away,
But maybe you will stay this time, I wonder.


Yes, I know I have a lifetime coming,
But I've got it all figured out,
Everybody's lonely, Everybody's lonely,

More than my friend he's been my brother
He's said to me he's dreamed you'd be his wife,
When I think of you it's as just another lover
It's a simple choice of how you see your life.

A singer's just another traveling salesman
Another night, another town to sell my wares,
And the times that you'd be riding the excitement
Won't make up for times when no one would be there.

He's an open book--Why don't you read him?
He's already hooked--Why don't you lead him?
Take a look--You just might need him someday
In some way.
I'm the medicine man--I've started to mumble
A tight-rope walker--I've started to stumble.

Turning down a chance for touching something fine,
But I'd rather have you happy and completely his
Then have you waiting for me when I find the time.

(Spoken)But don't worry,
(Spoken)We'll have him joining the parade by the end of the term

The little boy went first day of school
He got some crayons and started to draw
He put colors all over the paper
For colors was what he saw
And the teacher said.. What you doin' young man
I'm paintin' flowers he said
She said... It's not the time for art young man
And anyway flowers are green and red
There's a time for everything young man
And a way it should be done
You've got to show concern for everyone else
For you're not the only one

And she said...
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than they way they always have been seen

But the little boy said...
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

Well the teacher said.. You're sassy
There's ways that things should be
And you'll paint flowers the way they are
So repeat after me.....

And she said...
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than they way they always have been seen

But the little boy said...
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

The teacher put him in a corner
She said.. It's for your own good..
And you won't come out 'til you get it right
And are responding like you should
Well finally he got lonely
Frightened thoughts filled his head
And he went up to the teacher
And this is what he said.. And he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

Time went by like it always does
And they moved to another town
And the little boy went to another school
And this is what he found
The teacher there was smilin'
She said... Painting should be fun
And there are so many colors in a flower
So let's use every one

But that little boy painted flowers
In neat rows of green and red
And when the teacher asked him why
This is what he said.. And he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen.

But there still must be a way to have our children say. ..

There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one"
Harry Chapin,"God Babe, You've Been Good For Me",/h/harry+chapin/god+babe+youve+been+good+for+me_20819859.html,"Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You picked me up in your battered blue
Volkswagen, babe
You laid me down on the mattress on the
Floor that was your bed

Some wisdom in you told you
Ministering to my body
Brought a temporary respite to the
Demons that were screaming in my head

Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told me
Though what you told me served to make me smile
You just knew enough to hold me
And in holding me you held off the night a little while

You had a beach and a cottage and some nights that were free
You had those eyes that smiled in a dream
But I was lost, confused and still you seemed to see
How I was tired of running rapids
I was trying to find an island in the stream

Oh God babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told me
Though what you told me served to make me smile

Harry Chapin,Greyhound,/h/harry+chapin/greyhound_20209207.html,"It's midnight at the depot
And I drag my bags in line.
Travellin' light, I got to go
But the bus won't be on time.
Everybody's looking half alive.
Later on the bus arrives.

They punch my ticket
I find a seat
And we move out past the lights.
Come on Driver, where's the heat?
It's cold out in the night.
I keep telling to myself that I don't care.
Come tomorrow, I'll be there.

Take the Greyhound.
It's a dog of a way to get around.
Take the Greyhound.
It's a dog gone easy way to get you down.

Tired of watching this night go by
So I look across the aisle.
The window's frosted, I can't sleep
But the girl returns my smile.
She reminds me of someone I knew back home.
So I doze. So it goes.

I'm wrinkled on my stool at the rest stop.
The waitress being cozy with the highway cop.
My coffee's tasting tired.
My eyes roll over dead.
Got to go outside and get the gas out of my head.
Oh, to be in bed.
You got me driving.
I'm on your Greyhound bus and you're driving.

But there's nothing new about Greyhounds.
Nothing new about feeling down.
Nothing new about putting off
Or putting myself on.

Looking to tomorrow is the way the loser hides
I should have realized by now that all my life's a ride.
It's time to find some happy times and make myself some friends
I know there ain't no rainbows waiting when this journey ends.

Stepping off this dirty bus first time I understood
It's got to be the going not the getting there that's good
That's a thought for keeping if I could.
It's got to be the going not the getting there that's good."

But still your life runs down.

I'm halfway to heaven and my home in Forest Hills
It's halfpast eleven and I've got some time to kill.
I missed my bus connection my train got in too late
And I'm forced into reflection by this half hour wait.

Now I have been a straight man and I've played it by the rules
I been a good man, a good husband, a good old fashioned fool.
I have a fine wife and two children just like everybody's got
But after fifteen years of marriage the fires don't burn too hot.

Ahhhh someone played a trick on me.
They set me up so perfectly
They Gave me their morality
And then changed the rules they set for me.
Someone must be laughing now,
Though it don't seem funny somehow,
How the world's accepting now
What they once would not allow
Back in my younger days.
The world has changed in so many ways.

My mother once said to me so many years ago now
Don't you touch those bad girls, so I never had girls
Until I had my Mary when we married.
My Mary then had my two sons
My life as a lover was already done
It was over before it had really begun.

Ahhhh someone played a trick on me.
They sent this little girl to me,
She is my new secretary
And she's something to see.
Yeah She's a nice girl, but it's a young world
And she lives her life so free, and she sure gets thru to me

She brings her pad into my office, she wears a sweater and a skirt
And somewhere deep inside of me something starts to hurt.
She's wearing nothing underneath, and I can see what's there to see
She smiles and says, ""You wanted me?"" I'd have to agree.

You know how much I want her,
And I know that I could have her.
I know I could, I know she would
Make love to me, so wonderfully.
God damn, I'm one crazy mixed up mixture of a man.

In my head all my life I've been a sinner,
And in my bed with just my wife I'm still a beginner,
But tomorrow night I'm taking that little girl out to dinner!

But still your life runs down."
Harry Chapin,I Do It For You Jane,/h/harry+chapin/i+do+it+for+you+jane_20189890.html,"I first heard you sing in the Empire Room
Your husky hum engulfed the gloom.
And whatever mission that brought me there
Disappeared in the mist of your amber hair

You laughed and surrendered your gifts by degrees
But I was convinced that you spoke only to me.
And my life turned on it's hinge in that smoky club
As I ground out my past with my cigarette stub.

Oh, I do it for you, Jane--I love you so,
My kingdom is new but it's going to grow.
Our castles will shimmer with silver and gold,
My lady is lovely she'll never grow old.
And I offer this promise--this one thing I know:
I do it for you, Jane, for I love you so.

I left that town and went out on my own,
I made my own kind of music as I juggled the phones.
And all the while I worked I was reaching towards a time,
When I'd return to find you and finally make you mine.

It took most of two years to do what must be done,
Collect the pieces of the puzzle, you're the final one.
I was shaking as I asked you and you know by now I guess,
You made me happy ever after when you said yes.

Yes, I do it for you, Jane--I love you so,
My kingdom is flourishing, and still it will grow.
Our castle it shimmers with silver and gold,
My lady is lovely you'll never grow old.
And I shout from the heavens, hello there down below,
I do it for you, Jane, for I love you so.

If life could only stay the same but I guess it never does,
But God I still remember how excited I was.
Feelings of power I'd never known before,
But winning whets the appetite, I had to have more.

Homes in New York and London on the beach at Malibu,
I bought one for each facet of woman in you.
By then you had retired from singing to bring our baby home,
And I was winging around the country and you found you were alone.

Still, I do it for you, Jane--I love you so,
Our kingdom is flourishing and still it will grow.
Our castles all shimmer with silver and gold,
But my lady is lonely your smile is growing cold.
As I search through the mists on the roads I must go,
Where are you now, Jane? For I love you so."

That I would be the President one day.
You're a natural politician, boy, get it in your head,
And you know that it might just turn out that way.

So through all the years of my childhood,
There more important things than to play.
I started caring for my country and my fellow man,
And this is what I would always say;

I'd say, I don't want to be President!
But I want to help the poor and the helpless people!
I really don't want to be President!
But if I'm elected I promise to be faithful!

I graduated college with my law degree.
I was a young man on the move, they'd always say.
I was helping my community, committed to the people,
I was working as a citizen, to build a better day.
They persuaded me to run for Congressman.
They said from Congress you could do much more good!
And you've got to have the power if you're changing things,
And I was hoping to do everything I could for the people!

I'd say I don't want to be President!
But I want to help the poor and the helpless people.
I really don't want to be President!
But if I'm elected I promise to be faithful!

Time is a march where the powerful are drummers,
Big business, big labor, big oil,
And soon I was meeting with the men who ran the country,
The men who owned the sky and the soil.
Oh, I became a Senator, a man to be reckoned with.
Playing golf with millionaires, and speaking on tv,
And when they talked of potential presidential candidates,
Most often talked about, and most prominent was me.
Well, I got the nomination, ran a campaign of conscience.
I stood for peace and brotherhood and for prosperity.
And on the day of the election I went home to my mansion.
When the people had spoken, they'd elected me!

But I don't want to be President!
I really don't want to be President!"

Can offer to
It's amazing we're together after all we
Have been through
Our only choice is whether we've got
Learning left to do

There's a dazzling sight in my motel room
For a grunting judge with his bulging eyes
I give my all for his cherished prize.

Silver clad in satin rags,
But everything's where it should be
Oh say can you see, ah say can you see.

Please win and beat the spread. ""
But the new game plan that the owners had made
Meant that win or lose there would be a trade.
For the team's become a real gold mine
And the kid's sold off for the bottom line.

Oh why, oh why?
Mr. America
Sweating on tv
The winner's joy from the battered boy
For everything's where it should be
Oh say can you see, ah say can you see.

At last we've come together
Call it marriage or civil war.
If it brings us to battle, babe
It must be worth our fighting for.
Though today came up cloudy
There will be other days.
""Ah, please, please, please, please
What else is there to say? ""
But in plywood spread
By a plastic stream
And in separate beds with a borrowed dream
And with questions wide and the silence deep
We take two pills so at last we'll sleep.

Oh why, oh why?
Mr. And Mrs. America
Our story's on tv
Can you hear canned laughter
For everything's where it should be
Oh say can you see, ah say can you see.

Well, my little boy he told me something
Just the other night.
He whispered it as I kissed him
Before I turned out the light.
And of course he said it simple
As only children can
He said ""Daddy, daddy, daddy, please
I'm ready to dream again. """
Harry Chapin,I Wanna Learn A Love Song,/h/harry+chapin/i+wanna+learn+a+love+song_20345603.html,"I come fresh from the street,
Fast on my feet, kind a lean and lazy;
Not much meat on my bones, and a whole lot alone,
And more than a little bit crazy.
The old six string was all I had
To keep my belly still,
And for each full hour lesson I gave
I got a crisp ten dollar bill.

She was married for seven years
To a concrete castle king.
She said she wanted to learn to play the guitar
And to hear her children sing.
So I'd show up about once a week
In my faded tight-legged jeans
With a backlog full of hobo stories
And dilapidated dreams.

She said, ""I wanna learn a love song full of happy things.""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song; won't you let me hear you sing?""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song, I wanna hear you play.""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song before you go away.""

So I tried to teach her a couple of chords
And an easy melody;
But it always turned out she'd rather listen
To my guitar and me.
I could hear her old man laughing in the den,
Playing stud poker with the boys
While I sang so soft in the living room,
To scared to make much noise.
I came one week and the den was dark
And she met me at the door.
And we sat on the couch and we sang and talked
Till I could not sing no more.
The silence kept on building,
Her eyes grew much too wide;
And I could hear both of our heartbeats,
But there was no place to hide.

She said, ""I wanna learn a love song full of happy things.""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song; won't you let me hear you sing?""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song, I wanna hear you play.""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song before you go away.""

Well, I guess you know what happened,
God, I never been so clean.
Yes, I feel like I'm working in a Hollywood movie
Or living out a good bad dream.
And all them pinup girls in that tinsel world
Never touched me like she can;
It took another man's wife in the real world life
To make this boy a man.

She said, ""I wanna learn a love song full of happy things.""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song; won't you let me hear you sing?""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song, I wanna hear you play.""
She said, ""I wanna learn a love song before you go away.""
I guess you know I stayed."
Harry Chapin,I Wonder What Happened To Him,/h/harry+chapin/i+wonder+what+happened+to+him_20816991.html,"I'm the green young gentleman
And you're the lady with the past
I admit I'm insecure about
How long we will last

I sort through in my mind
The little that I know
But the only things I find
From where my musings go

Is that kind of confusion
That just makes more questions come
About the wild and shady world
That you must have wondered from

You see, I have no real complaints
Of how you've left your past behind
I guess what gets me worried
Is you've erased him from your mind

I wonder what happened to him
Your past is a canyon
I'm a stranger on the rim
Looking down below

To where it's misty and dim
But, where there's still shining
A faint glow from a light
It makes me wonder where he is tonight

That drawer of your old photographs
Sits there like detective's leads
With the packets full of letters
That I do not dare to read

And then there is that negligee
That is made for candlelight
You know, I've never seen you wear it
Was it used on other nights?

You see, dream lover of a lady
What shakes me to the core
Is the thought as you caress me
You've done this all before

I think about the future
With me out and others in
Will I, too, have disappeared
Like I've never ever been?

I wondered what happened to him
Your past is a canyon
I'm a stranger on the rim
I'm looking down below

To where it's misty and dim
But, where there's still shining
A faint glow from a light
It makes me wonder where he is
I wonder where he is
Can't help but wonder where he is tonight"

Yes I wonder
What would happen
What would happen to this world
Well I wonder what would happen to this world

Now if a man tried
To take his time on Earth
And prove before he died
What one man's life could be worth
Well I wonder what would happen to this world

And if a woman
She used a life time
As something more than
Some man's servant mother wife time
Well I wonder what would happen to this world

Oh well I wonder
Yes I wonder
Oh yes I wonder
'Bout what would happen
What would happen to this world
Well I wonder what would happen to this world

As I look around us
There's such strange things
There's muggers and there's jugglers
And we are led by clowns
If an answer ever found us
Would we change things
Or are we just a people
Rotten ready for the ground

And if our future
Lies on the final line
Are we brave enough
To see the signals and the signs
I wonder what would happen to this world

We see the people
We see them marchin' down
Do we join the parade
Or do we try and turn around
Well I wonder what would happen to this world

Disciple children walk the streets
Selling books and flowers
Can they be last ones
With a semblance of a dream
If we say that no one's out there
And we say we're goin' nowhere
And we avoid the question
Is this all that it means?

Oh if a man tried
To take his time on earth
And prove before he died
What one man's life could be worth
I wonder what would happen to this world"
Harry Chapin,If My Mary Were Here,/h/harry+chapin/if+my+mary+were+here_20196991.html,"I would not be so stoned
If my Mary were here
I don't think I'd have phoned you
If my Mary were here
I'm a sad sack Sir Galahad
Who's sword's around his knees
With a Grail no longer holy
And a prayer that's saying - please
I would not be alone
If my Mary were here
But she took off
And Lord I'm lost.

I don't think I'd be drinking
If my Mary were here
And I know what I'd be thinking
If my Mary were here
We'd be wrapping up a blanket
Full of cheddar cheese and wine
And packing up our camper with a rendezvous in mind
And we'd picnic out in Lincoln Park
If Mary were here
But she split
So I got lit

I'm sorry that I called you
In the middle of the night
But you're the one who listens
When I need a little light
I know we haven't talked
Since I dropped you in the dirt
I know you're not my lady now
But Baby, how I hurt.

(I could whistle up an old tune
That your memory might recall
Rustle up some reminisce
'Bout the good old days and all
If I were seeking someone else
I could find a way to hide
But I'm pleading like a pauper, Babe
And it leaves no place for pride)

I would toss away my troubles
When my Mary was here
But I'm lost inside the rubble
Cause my Mary's not here
So could I come on over
With my heart in my hands
And place it on your pillow
Like a rusty old tin can
I'm drunk and seeing double
And my Mary's not here
Once again
Be the friend
That you've been
And take me - in.

Please take me in."
Harry Chapin,If You Want To Feel,/h/harry+chapin/if+you+want+to+feel_20203179.html,"Oh God they got you gun shy
You know your skin's as cold as ice
Your eyes are double filtered babe
You're so afraid to be nice
There's no way you're ready
To let your defenses down
Though I won't come on heavy
There is a lesson that I've found

If you try to look
But you don't touch
Then you won't touch
But you'll never feel
And if you don't feel
You'll never cry
And if you don't cry
Then you'll never heal

There are lessons to life
That the lovers got to learn
There are corners out there
You know they're waitin' somewhere
And you've got to be prepared to turn
There are callouses that come
That the lovers got to earn
In the years of your youth
You can't be fire proof
You know you've got to get burned

Can't you feel excitement
Feel it welling up inside
What makes you think emotion
Is something that you hide
Yes I might take advantage
But I'll be gentle if I do
And I'll be here in the morning
Still lookin' at you"

You spilled your coffee
Onto my sleeve

To come from me babe

Back into your dream

And I know you're frightened
By my laughter
But you're not afraid
To hold my pain
You see I'm never sure
Just what you're after, Babe
But it seems you only love me
When it rains

You never treat me
Like you treat a gentle man
You only hit me
When you know it hurts
But then why bother reaching down
To where I'm battered
To raise me up

When it rains

Yes I have sworn
To myself to stay protected
So I have strapped on
A sword and shield
But my armour
Yes it ends up meltin'
When you come along tumblin'
Across the field
Once again I yield, I yield

Yes you get me crazy
'Cause you never even wear my presents babe
You wear flowers tucked into your hair
But when I'm cursin' in the night
In my frustration
That's when suddenly you are there

Once again that's when you let me
Back into your dream

And I know you're frightened
By my laughter
But you're not afraid
To hold my pain
You see I'm never sure

And I prayed that you still could be waiting
That's when I started for home

I have seen a great city in the darkness
Dream lady dressed in cold concrete
I've seen the City of Angles
With the names of it's dead in the street
And for once I could see it all your way
And for once I knew I was all wrong
And I thought of you there in my door way
And I knew I've been travelin' too long

Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny my love
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
You are my rainbow above

As I crossed to the heart of the country
I was lost in a forest of signs
And I laughed 'cause life gets so funny
Here I was wasted from wastin' my time
So now shine down your sun on my shadow
Without you I don't mean a thing
And I gather me one golden morning, babe
'Cause it's your song that I need to sing

And he stands there with his thumb out,
Hitching a ride towards the rainbow,
That only he sees shining there,
They say he's a fool, and that's a fact,
Oh, oh, oh....

Yes he's the last of the protest singers,
Staring, as he's strumming,
For he sees the dark clouds coming now,
And he says he feels those first few drops,
He sees he cannot reach them,
So he tries to sing out louder,

As he stands on his cold street corner saying,
""It's what I say not what I am"",
But late at night, I hold him,

""Should I just play some rock and roll,
Cause nobody really gives a damn? ""

Would fight the good fight once again,
Find the strength to bear the pain,
Stand up til he'd finally fall.

But now it's not just movie time,
And now it's you that's on the line.
And now it's you that's going to find
If you can stand at all.


So you circle all the wagons
And you hide behind the trees,
And you try to find some courage on your knees.
When you heard the sound of taps played
By the one man band,
You knew this is where you'd have to make
Your last stand.


And so, my friends, the last stand,
The last song from the last band,
The last note from the last man,
But you gave it all you can.

The cards came down to the last deal,
You're a starving man at his last meal,
And the movie's rolled down to the last real,
It's got an ending you never planned.

She's left you now, and so it seems,
You've tumbled down the last stream,
And you've found out that the final dream,
Can disappear so fast.

Watch it all just fade away, boy,
It came down to the last day,
And then the last out, and then the last play,
And you're alone at last.


So you circle all the wagons
And you hide behind the trees,
And you try to find some courage on your knees.
When you heard the sound of taps played
By the one man band,
You knew this is where you'd have to make
Your last stand.


Well, so it was late last night,
She left on the final flight
You watched as the last light
Went out there in your soul.

Took your look around the top,
For now you face the final drop.
You'll go down fast and you won't stop,
You found a very deep hole.

Say you're off on the last ride,
Remembering how she last cried,
And you know that love had long last died
In silence, not in pain.

You lost your last, your last race
Stumbled in last place,
Too late to find the one last face
Waiting in the rain.

So you circle all the wagons
And you hide behind the trees,
And you try to find some courage on your knees.
When you heard the sound of taps played
By the one man band,
You knew this is where you'd have to make
Your last stand."

Then suddenly I'm dying
They turned the laugh track off
I'm drowning in the silence
Crucified by coughs

Oh, I am the laugh man
Half clown and half man
Half out and half in, oh mister can't you see?
I'm s'posed to leave you laughing, so why don't you laugh at me?

I started out my starvin'
Desperate for money
My belly crackin' dirty jokes
That did not come out funny
My neck stuck out so far
Like a gawky giraffe
Screamin' on a guillotine
""Come on, sucker, laugh!""

I am the guy who always catches the pie
I specialize in pratfalls
I am the goon who flashes the moon
A mouse in a house of catcalls

I'm your jester your juggler
Your joker your friend
I'm nothing more or less
Than a horse's nether end!

My ego is a bubble
That I realize just broke
And alone without a microphone
My real life's a joke

By a bond that is invisible yet stronger still than time.
And we're locked into the motion that moves beneath the ocean.
Rolling toward the future that makes pain the only crime.
Now I know you are the answer. You're the damsel and the dancer
The angel with the devil eyes that knows about the beat.
You remove the masks and faces and you see the shadowed places
That only witches look for in the cradle of the heat.

Have you heard of the Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns
The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found.

So I become the reacher more the pilgrim than the preacher.
The savage's been ravaged by the visions of the smoke.
As I'm peeling back the layers to the passions of my prayers
I have seen the ramparts where the molten waters broke.
Your heart's a sacred kingdom that has colonized my soul.
My past's the shattered fragment that somehow you made whole
Today's your gift to fondle, your offering to feel.
Tomorrow is the promise that somehow you've made real.

Have you heard of the Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns
The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found.

So l'll sing you every silly, sad, and happy song I know.
And you'll open every part of you that you've got left to show.
And I'll pour myself around you like the sunshine drowns the field.
And in the golden softness we will yield.
And in the golden softness we will yield."

I let time go lightly with you.

Morning, a time for breaking ground and sowing seeds,
And yet we give up our sunshine
So we can buy what we need.
That leaves the evening, to share a fire with a friend or two,
To lose sight of the hours
To go lightly with you

I let time go lightly when I'm here with you,
I let time go lightly when the day is through.
I keep a watch on time when I've got work to do,
I let time go lightly with you.

Old friends, they mean much more to me than the new friends,
Cause they can see where you are,
And they know where you've been.
Music, has been my oldest friend, my fiercest foe,
Cause it can take me so high,
(High.....) Yes it can make me so low.

When I was a child my mother would help me along
She'd rock me to sleep and sing me a song.
So I learned to love the music of all the tunes in my mind
The changing of chords, the rhythm of time.

I let time go lightly when I'm here with you,
I let time go lightly when the day is through.
I keep a watch on time when I've got work to do,
I let time go lightly with you.

Yes I let time go lightly with you, and a fire, and a friend or two
With you and a fire and a friend or two
A friend or two and you"

Feeling naked just the same

You are back from some war
That you've been fighting for
Some old blue blood bastard
In a dark pinstripe suit
And the word from your loins
Has your mind in your groin
And your back pocket burning with blood
Blood money loot

So, you walk past the glow
Of the flicker-picture shows
Where the raincoat men wait
For a child to come by
And the women in doorways
Who have nothing to say
'Cause your money is talking
To the ones that you would try

She owns the block
With the dead pawnshop clock
She's the answer to dreams
That you pay to come true
She's got no heart of gold
But that's not what she's sold
She just sees herself doing what she
What she has to do

And she's all that you're hoping
As her coat falls open
Give her bread she leads you
To a bed on the floor
Where for ten million years
And through ten billion tears
The armies of bootmen have marched
Back from their wars

She's in that state of grace
Before time finds her face
With a mind of old wisdoms
And a body still young
And she tastes as sweet
As a child's chocolate treat
Before the butts and the whiskey
Had wasted the taste of your tongue

Play the music again
Of the grey-stubble men
That groaning blue symphony
Moans evermore
And you watch as she fakes it
And of course you just take it
She's better than others
You never paid your money for

You've used up your booty
The girl's done her duty
The turnstile has turned
And you learn you are done
You're back on the street
Joining fresh marching feet
You see more soldiers coming
And your girl chooses one

And the medic has brought
Shots for what you have caught
Your leave is all over
You're back on the line
And the joke in the trenches
Of the hot blooded wenches
And the next thing that you'll do
When they next give you the tim.

And you're back in your army
Back shedding red blood
And you dream of the girl
As you sleep in the mud
And you know you'd swap with her
If the deal could be made
'Cause you'd rather be working at love
Love as your trade"
Harry Chapin,Mismatch,/h/harry+chapin/mismatch_20257916.html,"At first you seemed just like my dream
Of a finer better life
Much more than I could ask for
In a lover or a wife
Though I work with my body
And my work makes my hands rough
There are gentle things inside me
That are anything but tough

There are lessons you could teach me
Things I do not know
Things I've never done, girl
And places we could go
But you only wear your tailored suits
For me to rip and tear
Ah, can't I hold you quietly
And smell your perfumed hair?

I saw you as the answer
That I never dared to dream
I saw you as the window
Into a world I'd never seen
I saw you as the vision
Come to raise me from the mud
But you came to use my sweat to cool
The fever in your blood

I'm not Marlon Brando
On his motorcycle bike
When you call me your animal
It's a name I do not like
Please do not tear my back
Yes, of course I bleed
The violence you thirst for
Is not what I need

Your silken skin is armor
That begs for brutal hands
But why can't I be gentle
And tell you of my plans?
I know now that you're using me
Not I just using you
And you're not so scared
Of losing me as I am of losing you

At first you seemed..."
Harry Chapin,Mr. Tanner,/h/harry+chapin/mr+tanner_20264020.html,"Mister Tanner was a cleaner from a town in the Midwest.
And of all the cleaning shops around he'd made his the best.
But he also was a baritone who sang while hanging clothes.
He practiced scales while pressing tails and sang at local shows.
His friends and neighbors praised the voice that poured out from his throat.
They said that he should use his gift instead of cleaning coats.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

His friends kept working on him to try music out full time.
A big debut and rave reviews, a great career to climb.
Finally they got to him, he would take the fling.
A concert agent in New York agreed to have him sing.
And there were plane tickets, phone calls, money spent to rent the hall.
It took most of his savings but he gladly used them all.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

The evening came, he took the stage, his face set in a smile.
And in the half filled hall the critics sat watching on the aisle.
But the concert was a blur to him, spatters of applause.
He did not know how well he sang, he only heard the flaws.
But the critics were concise, it only took four lines.
But no one could accuse them of being over kind.

(spoken) Mr. Martin Tanner, Baritone, of Dayton, Ohio made his
Town Hall debut last night. He came well prepared, but unfortunately
His presentation was not up to contemporary professional standards.
His voice lacks the range of tonal color necessary to make it
Consistently interesting.
(sung) Full time consideration of another endeavor might be in order.

He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends.
Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again,
Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed.
He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes.
Music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole."
Harry Chapin,My Old Lady,/h/harry+chapin/my+old+lady_20267670.html,"She wore an S. E. G. When she came back home
Like the cat that ate the canary
And I stood befuddled, a chauvanist stud
With his mistress quite contrary
I was smack up against the moment
I was afraid I would face someday
But the truth is a wall that you can't blow down
And it won't be laughed away

You see, my old lady went and took herself
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said,
""Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light, ""
She said, ""It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.""

Now I admit my imagination's been
The sweetest sinner of all
Yes it lives like a snake in Eden
And it forgives each time I fall
So I've been Casanova
I've double-dated with Don Juan
And though I've been doing almost everything
I never dreamed she'd be carrying on!

You see, my old lady went and took herself
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said,
""Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light, ""
She said, ""It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.""

She says that she still loves me
She says that last night was no big deal
She says, ""Why can't a woman play the same damn game
And act out what she feels? ""
She says she's going to take a bath
I hear her singing in the tub upstairs
While I'm sitting here spitting out chunks of my heart
Forced into being fair,
While she's splashing rround up there,
I'm supposed to act like I don't care,
I hear the devil laughing somewhere!

You see, my old lady went and took herself
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said,
""Baby, don't you get uptight,

Harry Chapin,November Rain,/h/harry+chapin/november+rain_20286611.html,"When November rains
it rides the cool wind
you need somebody holding you tight
When November rains
you need somebody caring
you want somebody sharing your night
(CHORUS)
When November rains
that's when it all falls down
there are clues
When November rains
and it's all around
and it seems that there's nothing left 'cept the dream
of the first sweet warm morning light
November rains into your deep, dark night
When November rains
midnight is calling
the old year is falling away
When November rains
It's like something is greiving
or somebody's leaving this day
(CHORUS)
November rains,
why don't you shine your warm sun on down
November rains,
why don't you keep me warm as sundown
Why don't you rain your warm sun down,
Down on me
Don't leave me
When November rains
something is needed
Somebody is sending an echo
When November rains
it's too late for praying,
it's like somebody's saying
don't follow

Harry Chapin,Odd Job Man,/h/harry+chapin/odd+job+man_20180463.html,"Chorus:
I give part time help
I'm the odd job man
I can't do what I want
So I do what I can
And I'll tell you now
So that you will understand
You get just what you pay for from the odd job man

One day this dude drives in the station
And I slide out to the pump
And he says, "" I need some odd jobs done
Can you get off from this dump? ""
Well I can always use some extra bread
So I nod and take the job
When he says "" Clean up before you come
I do not hire slobs ""
Now you can see I'm not no fancy pants
But everyone has pride
And especially since this lovely lady's
Sittin' by his side
Still something keeps my trap shut
And I nod again "" Alright ""
And he gooses his Mercedes
And he squeals off in the night

Chorus

Well I find his place next morning
It's more a palace than a pad
And it kind of makes my pick-up truck
Start looking pretty bad
But the same lady swings the door back
And before one word is said
She leads me to his trophy room
Where he sits with his stuffed heads
He's got this list of jobs for me to do
While he's out of town
And he says ""I'm too damn busy boy
The way I move around""
Well I start to figure prices when he says
""It's time you learned,
When you're dealing with a gentleman
You get just what you earn""

Chorus

I set to work that weekend
And I'm fixin' up some stairs
When I feel that someone's watching me
And I see SHE'S standing there
And she says ""I like to watch you work
You have such supple hands""
She says ""Can I help you?"" and I say
""Baby you CAN !! ""
Well she looks me in the eyes boys
I admit I looked a little lower
That's when she starts breathing faster
And I start working slower
You see when you have a helper
With her attitude and grace
You start puttin' lots of extra hours
Workin' 'round the place

Chorus

Well a month had too soon come and gone
With my odd jobs all done
When who should pull up to the pump
But the long-lost prodigal son
And he says ""Here's a hundred dollars boy""
Pulls the bill off from his wad
And he starts to hand it over
Like a gift come straight from God!
I say ""That's just a buck an hour sir !""
He says ""That's what I pay for jerks""
Now I admit that almost blew my cool
But I staggered back to work
You see most times when it's said and done
There's justice to this life
'Cause what that man had done to me
I'd done to his wife!

Harry Chapin,Old College Avenue,/h/harry+chapin/old+college+avenue_20232821.html,"Of course I picked a rainy night
To try to find our past
The street lights all were flickering
The leaves were falling fast

I walked down the winding road
Looked up through the trees
And I saw the corner window
That you once shared with me

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today

The tiny room and the single bed
Though the tangled trails of time
Have led us far astray
The membrance seems to stay

And through all the roads
That led me on
And through all the years
That you've been gone
I have found that it would never go away

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today

That fall turned into winter
The winter into spring
And all the while, you led me through
The sweet awakening

But summer never came that year
It's what you went to find
And you took my future with you
And you left your past behind

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today

The tiny room and the single bed
Though the tangled trails of time
Have led us far astray
The membrance seems to stay

And through all the roads
That led me on
And through all the years
That you've been gone
I have found that it would never go away

It was Old College Avenue

As if
It were

When you look at his life you know that he's really been there.

Yeah, for forty years now he's been pushin' on.
Carrying the dream 'cause Woody's long gone.

And the Wise Man says - Me too!
And the Guru says - Wazoo!
So do what you do!


The priests stand in their pulpits
The Pope sits on his throne
The parishes are empty
The choirboys on their own
Until the Second Coming
They're leaving us alone
And God in his Heaven
Has decided to keep mum
Cause He's just another traveller
On the Road to Kingdom Come.


Pity Mr. President
He can't do a thing
He says everywhere he went
We tried to make him sing
Our lonely White House resident
Says we should have made him King
Maybe then he could have saved us
From the truth we were hiding from
But he was just another traveller
On the Road to Kingdom Come.


The General's in the game room
But his Soldier won't salute
Ever since he was promoted
He can't pop his chute
His shrink says he is paranoid
'Bout communistic roots
So unfurl the flag boys
Start beating his drum
Yes we've got to get another straggler
On the Road to Kingdom Come.


Wow! The lead Singers raucous
As he screams out the truth
Then the band hold a caucus
And decides to sell their youth
Our Manager will hawk us
As along as we're uncouth
We'll call it revolution
But we'll crank out Bubble Gum
Can't you see we're all just travellers
On the Road to Kingdom Come.


Grampa swung into the orgy
It was his last hope
He was dressed to the nines
In deodorant and Scope
He found him a woman
She brought Vaseline and soap
Well it started out exciting
But it ended up ho hum
She said - I thought that you could take me
All the way to Kingdom Come.


So Billy sells hot sermons
And cold wars through the mails
While Mr. Big is selling out
His business never fails
King Kennedy like Chaucer's
Chasing Canterbury Tales
And my brain is still a virgin
Though the rest of me's well done
And I know we're all just travellers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
When all is said and done
Just another one."

And I'm alone again

One light in a dark valley
And I am all alone
One light in a dark valley
Is all I can call my own

One light in a dark valley
And the darkness is moving about
One light in a dark valley
And now that light has gone out

No light in this dark valley
Nothing but the darkness and me
No light in this dark valley
For all eternity

Light it up, Lord,
Let it shine

Come on and make the heavens so
Brightly mine
Look through all the windows
Open all the doors
There will be such brightness round me
I won't want for anymore"
Harry Chapin,Paint A Picture Of Yourself,/h/harry+chapin/paint+a+picture+of+yourself_20810648.html,"Well I hear you are a painter now
Though you're almost halfway through
You pulled a pallet knife, you cut away a wife
And you started something new

But it was not the strife of married life
That ordained what you would do
A quick look back through your history
Shows the same things goading you

It's just like you to try painting
Because you're color blind
Each time you conquer something
That's the time you change you're mind

And now your new preoccupations
Give you your handicap to start
Yes you're happiest when you're chasing clouds
With a halfway broken heart

Paint a picture of yourself
Let the images flash past
Don't weep on watercolors
Michael make this moment last

Paint the kid with restless eyes
Yeah the way you looked back then
'Cause the man keeps getting frightened
When that boy's not born again

I remember how you led us
Back when we all were kids
And the fact that you were older
Made us copy what you did

And that day you bought that cheap guitar
We all fell into line
We got hooked on music
But you drifted off in time

So I can see you at your easel
Splay legged there you stand
And your eyes are darting back and forth
Brush flashing in your hand

Yeah you're reaching always for that dream
You need to make you real
Leaning in a heavy wind
That no one else can feel

Paint a picture of yourself
Let the images flash past
Don't weep on watercolors
Michael make this moment last

Paint the kid with restless eyes
Yeah the way you looked back then
'Cause the man keeps getting frightened
When that boy's not born again, again"

Foolin' around with the likes of me.

I'm glad I got you now.

Yes I've had my ups and downs
As I've been ramblin' around
And I'll be candid.
I could not believe my eyes
When I finally realized
Just what that man did.
Yes I've heard 'bout finders keepers
And how losers are the weepers, it's ok,
I know it's my lucky day
Still I just got to say. ..

You're glad that it worked out this way
And you'll forget about yesterday
'Cause you feel so good.
It's worked out real good.
You make me feel so good.

I've been tryin' to find a way to cope
With grasping straws And fallen hopes.
But he's made a way
And now his misfortune is my gain.
Though for now it gives you pain
It'll fade away
And you'll find that as the years roll by
The memories of the time you cried
Will be laid away
Yes, they'll fade away

And you'll forget that poor damned fool
'Cause he went and let you go now.
Just a poor damned fool.

Six days a week, when he wakes up
She will fill his coffee cup

On Sunday, when they go to church
In the seventh pew they perch
They listen to his sermon and they believe
They're grateful for the food they ate
So they put their money in a plate
They've heard of hungry children and they grieve (they believe)

So we watch them all twist pretzels by hand, by hand

If only we could all be like that man
If only we all lived in Pretzel , only we all lived in Pretzel, only we all lived in Pretzel ...Land"
Harry Chapin,Remember When The Music,/h/harry+chapin/remember+when+the+music_20307077.html,"Remember when the music
Came from wooden boxes strung with silver wire
And as we sang the words, it would set our minds on fire,
For we believed in things, and so we'd sing.

Remember when the music
Brought us all together to stand inside the rain
And as we'd join our hands, we'd meet in the refrain,
For we had dreams to live, we had hopes to give.

Remember when the music
Was the best of what we dreamed of for our children's time
And as we sang we worked, for time was just a line,
It was a gift we saved, a gift the future gave.

Remember when the music
Was a rock that we could cling to so we'd not despair,
And as we sang we knew we'd hear an echo fill the air
We'd be smiling then, we would smile again.

Oh all the times I've listened, and all the times I've heard
All the melodies I'm missing, and all the magic words,
And all those potent voices, and the choices we had then,
How I'd love to find we had that kind of choice again.

Remember when the music
Was a glow on the horizon of every newborn day
And as we sang, the sun came up to chase the dark away,
And life was good, for we knew we could.

Remember when the music
Brought the night across the valley as the day went down
And as we'd hum the melody, we'd be safe inside the sound,
And so we'd sleep, we had dreams to keep.

And I feel that something's coming, and it's not just in the wind.
It's more than just tomorrow, it's more than where we've been,
It offers me a promise, it's telling me ""Begin"",
I know we're needing something worth believing in.

Remember when the music
Came from wooden boxes strung with silver wire
And as we sang the words, it would set our minds on fire,
For we believed in things, and so we'd sing."

At the driftwood floating by
Like a flock of birds in falltime

Cause you live life to the hilt
So go on get out of here girl
I don't want your guilt.

Go on and roll down your river Babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar
That you brought with you Baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn.
What goes down that river don't return.

I remember when you washed up on my doorstep
You had a dirty face, a damp dress and a dream
But now you're just a fish out of the water, Baby
It's time to throw you back into the stream.

So go on and roll down your river Babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar
That you brought with you Baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn.
What goes down that river don't return.

Now don't you bleed on me about all our good times
Don't tell me that you'll never be the same
Don't tell me anything but goodbye Baby
More than that would be just another game.

So go on and roll down your river Babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar
That you brought with you Baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn.
What goes down that river don't return.

You leave me with a month of your sweet madness
You leave me with your music in my head
You leave me with the mystery of the river rolling
You leave me with a desert for my bed.

I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar
That you brought with you Baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn.

Harry Chapin,Salt And Pepper,/h/harry+chapin/salt+pepper_20245851.html,"The old sailor sat at the window seat,
So he could watch as the ships went by.
And he drank from a glass that was always filled,
For the rest of us would buy.
And he would tell us tales about the ships that sailed,
When he was young and strong.
And when he thought we'd heard enough of his words
He'd break into this song.
Dee dee dee dah dah dah dee dee dee dah dah
Dah dah dee dee dee dum.

Each and every day he'd spend this way,
Until the stroke of four,
When a woman as rough as a dockside tough,
Came bursting through the door.
She'd stalk up to that sailor,
And he'd shrink to the size of a pin.
And she'd curse and shout and as she hauled him out,
He'd say with a sheepish grin:

Chorus:
I've sailed the southern oceans,
And the stormy northern sea,
But now that me sailin's over, me boys,
It's harbor time for me.
I know you call us Salt and Pepper,
For an old salt I may be,
But though she may be pepper to you, me boys,
She's sweet as sugar to me.
Dee dee dee dah dah dah dee dee dee dah dah
Dah dah dee dee dee dum.

Yes, we called them Salt and Pepper,
For that's the way she was.
And it seemed she got as least as hot.
As fresh red pepper does.
And a bunch of the boys made offers.
To protect him from her wrath,
But each and every time, he would decline,
Declaring with a laugh:

(Repeat Chorus)

I've had my body broken,
Not drowned, but parched bone-dry.
I've heard my name be spoken,
I've spit in the devil's eye.
The sea once was my mistress,
Now Pepper's replaced her.
But just another captain,
Like my tough old captain's were.

And you can have your milquetoast ladies,
I'm made of old salt brine,
And the gal you saw had starch in her craw,
Not a lace instead of a spine.
Sure, the old girl can get tough at times,
But a sailor's what I've been,
And when a storm's about, you learn to ride it out,
So you can sail once again.

(Repeat Chorus)"
Harry Chapin,Sandy,/h/harry+chapin/sandy_20273228.html,"Sandy is the seashore
And Sandy is the sea
Sandy is the clear blue sky
Or so it seems to me
Yes I see her everywhere
In everything I see
She can turn to anything
That she would like to be

Sandy is the summer's day
She laughs inside the brook
Sandy is and autumn moon
She shines down when I look
Sandy is a cozy fire
On a snowy winter's night
And Sandy is the soft spring rain
In the early morning light

Sandy is my mirror
There are secrets in her eyes
And every single morning
She dawns a new disguise
She has caught the mystery
Of all that's wild and free
Oh yes, I see the world in her
For she means the world to me"
Harry Chapin,Saturday Morning,/h/harry+chapin/saturday+morning_20325172.html,"Saturday morning and it's growing light.
I look out my window and remember the night.
The story is starting and this story ends
And I feel like I need you again.

Time used to mose softly when I was at home.
It went on without me, and left me alone.
Now it's sits at my shoulder and claws at my hand
And I feel like I need you again.

Chorus:

A song needs a reason and rhyme.

My love needs a little more time.

Well, I recall September, and leaves turned brown
Remember October, left leaves on the ground.
And here comes December like an elderly friend.
And I feel like I need you again.

Chorus"
Harry Chapin,Sequel,/h/harry+chapin/sequel_20300743.html,"So here she's actin' happy inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flyin' in my taxi, takin' tips and gettin' stoned.

I got into town a little early.
Had eight hours to kill before the show.
First I thought about heading up north of the bay
Then I knew where I had to go.

I thought about taking a limousine
Or at least a fancy car.
But I ended up taking a taxi
'Cause that's how I got this far.

You see, ten years ago it was the front seat
Drivin' stoned and feelin' no pain.
Now here I am straight and sittin' in the back
Hitting Sixteen Parkside Lane.

The driveway was the same as I remembered
And a butler came and answered the door.
He just shook his head when I asked for her
And said ""She doesn't live here anymore.""

But he offered to give me the address
That they were forwarding her letters to.
I just took it and returned to the cabbie
And said ""I got one more fare for you.""

And so we rolled back into the city
Up to a five-story old brownstone
I rang the bell that had her name on the mailbox.
The buzzer said somebody's home.

And the look on her face as she opened the door
Was like an old joke told by a friend.
It'd taken ten more years but she'd found her smile
And I watched the corners start to bend.

And she said, ""How are you Harry?
Haven't we played this scene before? ""
I said ""It's so good to see you, Sue
Had to play it out just once more. ""
Play it out just once more"".

She said ""I've heard you flying high on my radio""
I answered ""It's not all it seems""
That's when she laughed and she said, ""It's better sometimes
When we don't get to touch our dreams. ""

That's when I asked her where was that actress
She said ""That was somebody else""
And then I asked her why she looked so happy now
She said ""I finally like myself; at last I like myself.""

So we talked all through that afternoon
Talking about where we'd been
We talked of the tiny difference
Between ending and starting to begin.
We talked because talking tells you things
Like what you really are thinking about.
But sometimes you can't find what you're feeling
Till all the words run out.

So I asked her to come to the concert.
She said ""No, I work at night.""
I said, ""We've gotten too damn good at leaving, Sue""
She said, ""Harry, you're right.""

Don't ask me if I made love to her
Or which one of us started to cry
Don't ask me why she wouldn't take the money that I left
If I answered at all I'd lie.

So I thought about her as I sang that night
And how the circle keeps rolling around.
How I act as I'm facing the footlights
And how she's flying with both feet on the ground.

I guess it's a sequel to our story
From the journey 'tween heaven and hell
With half the time thinking of what might have been
And half thinkin' just as well.

I guess only time will tell."
Harry Chapin,She Is Always Seventeen,/h/harry+chapin/she+is+always+seventeen_20215155.html,"She has no fear of failure, she's not bent with broken dreams.
For the future's just beginning when you're always seventeen
It was nineteen sixty-one when we went to Washington;
She put her arms around me and said, ""Camelot's begun.""
We listened to his visions of how our land should be;
We gave him our hearts and minds to send across the sea.
Nineteen sixty-three, white and black upon the land;
She brought me to the monuments and made us all join hands.
And scarcely six months later she held me through the night
When we heard what had happened in that brutal Dallas light.
Oh, she is always seventeen;
She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.
There is so much joy inside her she will even share her sorrow;
She's our past, our present, and our promise of tomorrow.
Oh, truly she's the only hope I've seen, and she is always seventeen.
It was nineteen sixty-five and we were marching once more
From the burning cities against a crazy war.
Memphis, L. A. And Chicago we bled through sixty-eight
Till she took me up to Woodstock saying with love it's not too late.
We started out the seventies living off the land;
She was sowing seeds in Denver trying to make me understand
That mankind is woman and woman is man,
And until we free each other we cannot free the land.
Oh, she is always seventeen;
She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.
There is so much joy inside her she will even share her sorrow;
She's our past, our present, and our promise of tomorrow.
Oh, truly she's the only hope I've seen, and she is always seventeen.
Nineteen seventy-two, I'm at the end of my rope,
But she was picketing the White House chanting,-aca"
Harry Chapin,She Sings Songs Without Words,/h/harry+chapin/she+sings+songs+without+words_20217058.html,"I was thrown on the cobblestones, tossed at her feet
My fool's mouth was filled with the dust from the street
An out of work court jester with nowhere to go
And no need to speak, for she seemed to know

She sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

This mad mocking town, and it's dishonored guest
Disappeared in the colors that danced on her dress
She led me to safety in a forest of green
And showed my stale eyes some sights never seen

She sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

She spins magic and moonlight in her meadows and streams
And seeks deep inside me and touches my dreams
The morning comes smiling and I laugh with no sound
And snuggle in silence and the sweet peace I've found

And she sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

No they won't go away
Go away"
Harry Chapin,Shooting Star,/h/harry+chapin/shooting+star_20220914.html,"He was crazy of course
From the first she must have known it
But still she went on with him
And she never once had shown it
And she took him off the street
And she dried his tears of grieving
She listened to his visions
She believed in his believe-ins

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle
And she was the moon shining back his light a little
He was a shooting star
She was softer and more slowly
He could not make things possible
But, she could make them holy

He was dancing to some music
No one else had ever heard
He'd speak in unknown languages
She would translate every word
And then when the world was laughing
At his castles in the sky
She'd hold him in her body
Till he once again could fly

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle
And she was the moon shining back his light a little
He was a shooting star
She was softer and more slowly
He could not make things possible
But, she could make them holy

Well, she gave him a daughter
And she gave him a son
She was a mother, and a wife,
And a lover when the day was done
He was too far gone for giving love
What he offered in it's stead
Was the knowledge she was the only thing
That was not in his head

He took off East one morning
Towards the rising sun's red glow
She knew he was going nowhere
But of course she let him go
And as she stood and watched him dwindle
Much too empty to be sad
He reappeared beside her saying,
""You're all I've ever had""

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle
And she was the moon shining back his light a little
He was a shooting star
She was softer and more slowly
He could not make things possible
But, she could make them holy
Holy"

Hit that dream road once again saw the vision  in my mirror about  how the
Spring time was getting nearer so I'll be back babe but I really don't know when
See the rainbow in the meadow the sunlight  chasing the shadows such a thing is
A day fer leaving  this is one don't let the old dog come follow put a candle
In the window to light one light when  my wandering days are done she said stay
Home you're getting to old for this she said were both alone I need someone
Besides a dreamkiss you go along and try to save the world when you come home
You wont find your women so get yourself some silly little girl just play that
Music to walking to boy you need some talking to it's just a movie with you with
A rapidly aging star  it's not a comedy it's a tradgedy a quick one to before

Harry Chapin,Six String Orchestra,/h/harry+chapin/six+string+orchestra_20351149.html,"The very day I purchased it,
I christened my guitar
As my monophonic symphony,
Six string orchestrar

In my room I'd practice late,
They'd leave me alone.
My mother said, ""You're nothing yet,
To make the folks write home. ""

I'd play at all the talent nights,
I'd finish, they'd applaud.
Some called it muffled laughter,
I just figured they were odd.

So I went up for an encore,
But they screamed they'd had enough.
Or maybe I just need a group
To help me do my stuff.

Chorus:

And so I'd dream a base will join me,
And fill the bottom in.
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin.
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time.
And way back in the distance,
Some strings would sound so fine.
And we would play together,
Like fine musicians should,
And it would sound like music,
And the music would sound good.
But in real life I'm stuck with
That same old formula,
Me and my monophonic symphony,
Six string orchestra.

Oh, I write love songs for my favorite girl
And sing them soft and slow.
But before I get to finish,
She says she has to go.
She's nice and says ""Excuse me,
I've got to find a bar,
I think I need refreshment,
For I hear you play guitar. ""

Oh I sent a demo tape I made
To the record companies.
Two came back address unknown,
One came back C. O. D.

Of course I got four letters,
All saying pleasant things.
Like suggesting I should find a trade
Where I would not have to sing.

Chorus

And so I'd dream a base will join me,
And fill the bottom in.
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin.
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time.
And way back in the distance,
Some strings would sound so fine.
And it would sound like music,
And the music would sound good.
But in real life I'm stuck with
That same old formula,
Me and my monophonic symphony,
Six string orchestra.

I've been taking guitar lessons,
But my teacher just took leave.
It was something about a break down,
Or needing a reprieve.

I know I found my future,
So I will persevere
And hold onto my dream of
Making music to their ears.

Harry Chapin,Sniper,/h/harry+chapin/sniper_20282221.html,"It is an early Monday morning.
The sun is becoming bright on the land.
No one is watching as he comes a walking.
Two bulky suitcases hang from his hands.

He heads towards the tower that stands in the campus.
He goes through the door, he starts up the stairs.
The sound of his footsteps, the sound of his breathing,
The sound of the silence when no one was there.

I didn't really know him.
He was kind of strange.
Always sort of sat there.
He never seemed to change.

He reached the catwalk. He put down his burden.
The four sided clock began to chime.
Seven am, the day is beginning.
So much to do and so little time.

He looks at the city where no one had known him.
He looks at the sky where no one looks down.
He looks at his life and what it has shown him.
He looks for his shadow. It cannot be found.

He was such a moody child, very hard to touch.
Even as a baby he never smiled too much.
No, no. No, no.

You bug me, she said.
You're ugly, she said.
Please hug me, I said,
But she just sat there
With the same flat stare
That she saves for me alone
When I'm home.
When I'm home.
Take me home.

He laid out the rifles, he loaded the shotgun,
He stacked up the cartridges along the wall.
He knew he would need them for his conversation.
If it went as it he planned, then he might use them all.

He said Listen you people I've got a question!
You won't pay attention but I'll ask anyhow!
I found a way that will get me an answer!
Been waiting to ask you 'till now!
Right now!

Am I?
I am a lover who's never been kissed!
Am I?
I am a fighter who's not made a fist!
Am I?
If I'm alive then there's so much I've missed!
How do I know I exist?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?
Am I?

The first words he spoke took the town by surprise.
One got Mrs. Gibbons above her right eye.
It blew her through the window, wedged her against the door.
Reality pouring from her face, staining the floor.

He was kind of creepy,
Sort of a dunce.
I met him at the corner bar.
I only dated the poor boy once,
That's all. Just once, that was all.

Bill Whedon was questioned as stepped from his car.
Tom Scott ran across the street but he never got that far.
The police were there in minutes, they set up barricades.
He spoke right on over them in a half-mile circle.
In a dumb struck city his pointed questions were sprayed.

He knocked over Danny Tyson as he ran towards the noise.
Just about then the answers started coming. Sweet, sweet joy.
Thudding in the clock face, whining off the walls,
Reaching up to where he sat, their answering calls.

Thirty-seven people got his message so far.
Yes, he was reaching them right were they are!

They set up an assault team. They asked for volunteers.
They had to go and get him, that much was clear.
And the word spread about him on the radios and tv's.
In appropriately sober tones they asked ""Who can he be?""

He was a very dull boy, very taciturn.
Not much of a joiner, he did not want to learn.
No, no. No, no.

They're coming to get me, they don't want to let me
Stay in the bright light too long!
It's getting on noon now, it's going to be soon now!
But oh! What a wonderful song!

Mama, won't you nurse me?
Rain me down the sweet milk of your kindness.
Mama, it's getting worse for me.
Won't you please make me warm and mindless?

Mama, yes, you have cursed me.
I never will forgive you for your blindness.
I hate you!

The wires are all humming for me!
And I can hear them coming for me!
Soon they'll be here, but there's nothing to fear.
Not any more though they've blasted the door!

As the copter dropped the gas he shouted "" Who cares?"".
They could hear him laughing as they started up the stairs.
They stormed out on the catwalk, blinking at the sun,
With their final fusillade his answer had come.

Am I?
There is no way that you can hide me!
Am I?
Though you have put your fire inside me!
Am I?
You've given me my answer can't you see?
I was!
I am!
And now, I will be!
I will be!"
Harry Chapin,Somebody Said,/h/harry+chapin/somebody+said_20251661.html,"Somebody said... Where's the music goin'
Somebody said... It's gone
Somebody said... With this bad wind a blowin'
Will the music keep a rolling on
I had to ask myself
Why it's makin' me
A minstrel man from cradle to grave
Should there be somewhere else
It could be takin' me
As it rolls on over like a wave

Somebody said... We got to find the words
Got to, got to be an answer there
Somebody said that... You never get heard
'Cause nobody really cares
Do your feet just dance
Where the waves begin
Stop thinkin' as you're sinkin' below
Or do you take this chance to sail on the wind
When so many in the water chose to row

Some may curse the crippled
Some try to hide the hurt
Some they hate the hungry
But who's dying down there in the dirt

Somebody said... Has the man enlightened us
Somebody said... Who knows
And then the little boys said... Well I may be frightened
But the Emperor has got no clothes
As the passion dies
But the beat goes on
The conductor got us singing his song
He's been feedin' these lies
That we've been feasting upon
But now we've been at the banquet too long

Somebody said... Where are the dreamers
Somebody said... Dead
Somebody said... Here comes the holy rollers
Tryin' to sell us all the screamers instead
Since we were once deceived
When we received the call
Now the cynics are the prophets of the day
And now the weak ones grieve
As the strong ones fall
And the rest of us have nothing to say
Some suffer in silent sadness
Some come to worship pain
Some just welcome madness
But you can't come in from the rain

Somebody said

Someone keeps calling my name

Or is it just that I need a friend
Someone keeps calling my name, my name


My name is Jason and I'm ten birthdays old

Colder than I'd ever care to make it.
I had a kind of empty feeling,
But no place to go where I could take it.


So I took a walk beside the railroad tracks,
And I thought about the facts of my life
And of my sometime, somewhere wife.


At times like this I lose my head and think of her.
Empty space always ask for filling.
I wonder whyI never stopped to marry her.
It wasn't 'cause she was not more than willing.


Walking puts a window to my mind,
And brings thoughts about this kind of a life,
Without my sometime somewhere wife.


I guess I walked about a mile and maybe some,
And I come upon a rusty railroad crossing.
And suddenly I knew that time had come again,
The winter wind had set the trees to tossing.
So I returned to where I'd left my stuff,
Yes, I knew I'd had enough of my life
Without my sometime, somewhere wife.


I've got to find her.
I've got to find her.
I've got to find her.

Was the only thing I had.
I have been a song man
For a long long time
Coming up with some melodies
Trying to find some words that rhyme.
And while I have been singing
You've been there to see me through
And so I think it's long past time
That I wrote this song for you.
I was going to keep it simple
And not make it too long
But I had hoped to make it beautiful
For after all it is your song.

You are everything that's good."

I'll help you lug your load, lady
I'll skip up a smile each and every mile
As you're skipping down the road


Stop singing these sad songs
Just tell me 'bout the good times
I have heard that cold hard truth so many time before
Stop singing these sad songs
Just tell me 'bout the good times, baby
'Cause I don't want to hear them old heart breaking sad songs anymore
Well, hold it now and feel it
I don't want to hear them old heart breaking sad songs anymore
Now baby, I don't want to them sad songs any,
One more time for time for the kids in the hospital,
I don't want to hear these sad songs anymore"
Harry Chapin,Story Of A Life,/h/harry+chapin/story+of+a+life_20328989.html,"I can see myself it's a golden sunrise
Young boy open up your eyes
It's supposed to be your day.
Now off you go horizon bound
And you won't stop until you've found
Your own kind of way.
And the wind will whip your tousled hair,
The sun, the rain, the sweet despair,
Great tales of love and strife.
And somewhere on your path to glory
You will write your story of a life.

And all the towns that you walk through
And all the people that you talk to
Sing you their songs.
And there are times you change your stride,
There are times you can't decide
Still you go on.
And then the young girls dance their gypsy tunes
And share the secrets of the moon
So soon you find a wife.
And though she sees your dreams go poorly
Still she joins your story of a life.

So you settle down and the children come
And you find a place that you come from.
Your wandering is done.
And all your dreams of open spaces
You find in your children's faces
One by one.
And all the trips you know you missed
And all the lips you never kissed
Cut through you like a knife.
And now you see stretched out before thee
Just another story of a life.

So what do you do now?
When she looks at you now?
You know those same old jokes all the jesters tell
You tell them to her now.
And all the same old songs all the minstrels sang
You sing 'em to her now.
But it don't matter anyhow
'Cause she knows by now.

So every chance you take don't mean a thing.
What variations can you bring
To this shopworn melody.
And every year goes by like a tollin' bell.
It's battered merchandise you sell.
Not well, she can see.
And though she's heard it all a thousand times
Couched in your attempted rhymes
She'll march to your drum and fife.
But the question echoes up before me
Where's the magic story of a life?

Now sometimes words can serve me well
Sometimes words can go to hell
For all that they do.
And for every dream that took me high
There's been a dream that's passed me by.
I know it's so true
And I can see it clear out to the end
And I'll whisper to her now again
Because she shared my life.
For more than all the ghosts of glory
She makes up the story,
She's the only story
Of my life."
Harry Chapin,Stranger With The Melodies,/h/harry+chapin/stranger+with+the+melodies_20326887.html,"It was my first night in that rooming house.
In the last room down the hall
I heard a hoarse voice and an old guitar
Coming through the paper thin walls.
A crazy nonsense nursery rhyme
That did not mean a thing.
But for the first of what was to be a thousand times,
This is what I hear him sing. . .
Hold that D chord on the old guitar,
'Til I found the G.
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around to D.

I had to lay there listening.
It seemed he was in the room.
This stranger with his melody,
Singing there in the gloom.
And he repeated it over and over again,
Such a soft and sinkin' sound.
It was kind of like a music box that was slowly winding down.
You see, he sang it, he hummed it,
Whistled it, and he strummed it,
He laughed it and he cried it,
He did everything but hide it.
And he sang . . .
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around for me

So I lay there in that lumpy bed,
Countin' choruses instead of sheep.
'Til I banged on the wall and out I called,
""Hey bub I need some sleep.""
The sudden void of silence, then I heard that hoarse voice say,
""It weren't so long ago boy, they paid me to play ""

I said, ""It's kind of late for music sir,
Two hours til it's daylight""
He answered, ""I need my music most
In these dark hours of the night.
You see I've tried gettin' high on something son,
But it only brings me down.
Staying dry don't work out better boy,
'Cause my eyes get wet and I drown.
Won't you please let me continue
And I'll be in your debt.
You see I'm not singing to remember son,
I'm just singing to forget""

And he sang .. .
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around for me.

That's when I said,
""If I'm supposed to listen to you sir,
Just one quick question then.
Why in the hell do you sing one song
Over and over again?""

And this is what he said. . .

He said, ""I gave her the music son,
She gave me the words.
Together we'd write the kind of songs
The angels must have heard.
Of course we'd fight like cats and dogs,
But life ain't no rosebud dream.
Still whatever we'd do everybody knew
We truly were a team.
I can't remember now if I done her wrong
Or if she done wrong to me
But all I know that when I let her go
That it did not set me free''
That's when I said, ""You sound like what's-his-name""
He said, ""That's who I am.
But you can't wrap a name around you boy,
'Cause it really don't mean a damn.
You see, a song don't have much meaning
When it dan't have nothing to say.
What she could do was magic son,
All I could do was play""


He started singing again.
That's when I drifted off
Maybe I dreamed what I heard
'Bout this stranger with his melody
Who'd gone and lost the words.
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around to D"
Harry Chapin,Sunday Morning Sunshine,/h/harry+chapin/sunday+morning+sunshine_20273362.html,"I came into town with a knapsack on my shoulder
And a pocket full of stories that I just had to tell
You know I've knocked around a bit
And I've had my share of small town glories
It's time to hit the city and that crazy carousel

I been feeling sorry for myself
But you know I was only lonely
Like everybody else

Until you brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain
You taught me happiness just one time
It keeps on coming back again

These streets were never highways
I had not known the sky above
These days were never my days
For I had not known your love

It's funny how a city
Can put on a different face
When it holds the one you care for
It becomes a different place

And I never felt so far from alone
Oh baby, you brought me halfway home
Oh baby, you brought me halfway home

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain
You taught me happiness just one time
It keeps on coming back again and again and a

Harry Chapin,Tangled Up Puppet,/h/harry+chapin/tangled+up+puppet_20322766.html,"I'm a tangled up puppet,
Spinning round in knots,
And the more I see what I used to be,
The less of you I've got.

There was a time that you curled up in my lap; like a child
You'd cling to me smiling, yours eyes wide and wild
Now you slip through my arms, wave a passing hello
Twist away and toss a kiss, laughing as you go

You used to say ""Read me a story and sing me songs of love""
For you were Princess Paradise like your wings of a dove
Now I chase you and tease you trying to remake you my own
But you just turn away and say ""please leave me alone.""

And I'm a tangled up puppet
All hanging in your strings
I'm a butterfly in a spider's web
Fluttering my wings

And the more that I keep dancing
And spinning round in knots
The more I see what I used to be
And the less of you I've got

You are a drawer full of makeup and rinses and things
You keep changing your moods like your earrings and rings
But tonight while we played tag for five minutes in the yard
Just for a moment I caught you off guard
But now you write your secret poems
In a room just for your dreams
You don't find time to talk to me
About the things you mean
And what I mean is--

I have watched you take shape from a jumble of parts
And find the grace and form of a fine work of art
Hey, you, my brand new woman, newly come into your own
Don't you know that you don't need to grow up all alone"
Harry Chapin,Taxi,/h/harry+chapin/taxi_20331289.html,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco,
I needed one more fare to make my night.
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down,
She got in at the light.
Oh, where you going to, my lady blue,
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain.
She just looked out the window, and said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane"".

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before,
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more.

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror,
And she glanced at the license for my name.
A smile seemed to come to her slowly,
It was a sad smile, just the same.
And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you. ""

It was somewhere in a fairy tale,
I used to take her home in my car.
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge,
The lesson hadn't gone too far.
You see, she was gonna be an actress,
And I was gonna learn to fly.
She took off to find the footlights,
And I took off to find the sky.

Oh, I've got something inside me,
To drive a princess blind.
There's a wild man, wizard,
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind.
Oh, I've got something inside me,
Not what my life's about,
Cause I've been letting my outside tide me,
Over 'till my time, runs out.

Baby's so high that she's skying,
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall.
I'll tell you why baby's crying,
Cause she's dying, aren't we all.

There was not much more for us to talk about,
Whatever we had once was gone.
So I turned my cab into the driveway,
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns.
And she said we must get together,
But I knew it'd never be arranged.
And she handed me twenty dollars,
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change.""
Well another man might have been angry,
And another man might have been hurt,
But another man never would have let her go...
I stashed the bill in my shirt.

And she walked away in silence,
It's strange, how you never know,
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,
Such a long, long time ago.

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly.
She took off to find the footlights,
And I took off for the sky.
And here, she's acting happy,
Inside her handsome home.
And me, I'm flying in my taxi,
Taking tips, and getting stoned,
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned."

He'd tip his hat and just like that another score he'd made
I'd watch the girls all watch him; moths drawn to the flame.
The money showed, the laughter flowed from the way he played the game.
He played the game.

""Some said he was a rambler, some said he was a rake.
Some said he was a gambler, some said he was a fake.
But I knew him like no one else, a gentleman was he.
His days belonged to himself, his nights belonged to me.
Belonged to me.

""And they're talkin' in the town square,
In the taverns and the shops
I hear them talkin' everywhere.
Their talkin' never stops.
But all their words of wisdom won't make you go away.
The day they closed the factory down they had nothing,
Nothing left to say.

She said, ""I take care of my momma now, since my father died.
I'm raising baby brother, too, the way my father tried.
His thirty years in the factory ended in that furnace blast.
But they settled up for ten bucks a week and the bitterness is past,
It did not last.

""So they're moving somewhere else now
With their cloths and fabric press. They found themselves another town where they'll make shirts for less.
And that is why he said last night he won't watch the old town die.
But I would not take what he tried to leave, when he told me 'Good bye'
Ah, it's good bye

In the taverns and the shops.

Talkin' of the hard times and the young folks moving out.
Yes, they're talking as if talking can make everything all right.
But all the talking ever done won't bring him back tonight.
Ah, tonight.

And they're talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin'
Talkin' in the shops

Harry Chapin,The Mayor Of Candor Lied,/h/harry+chapin/the+mayor+of+candor+lied_20268255.html,"In the little town of Candor, in the last year of my youth,
I learned the final lesson of the levels to the truth.
My father was a farmer he'd go tilling in the ground.
My mother was a neighbor she'd go visiting around.

But I didn't care,
For I had found the answer to a plowboy's lonely prayer.
She was the daughter of the Mayor.

The Mayor fought my courtship, for he'd made other plans,
He saw her married to a better man than a boy with farmer's hands.
I said -- I hate your father, it's so hard not to strike him.
She said --You know I love you because you're so much like him.

And so I'd go sneaking in the evening,
And there she'd stand a crying in the dawn as I was leaving.

But the Mayor of Candor lied,
When he offered me his only daughter.
The Mayor of Candor tried,
To take her off across the water.
What a thing to do to a young man in love.
What a thing to do to your daughter.

One day with father on his tractor and mother off again,
I go to find the mayor and work out what I can.
But he is not at his office, he is not at his home,
When I find him in the countryside he is not alone.

He is holding a woman and imagine my surprise,
As she jumps back from his arms I look into my mother's eyes!

All my thoughts of outrage, embarrassment and pain,
Were washed away by what came roaring through my brain.
The Mayor's at my mercy and I hear my own voice say,
Your run for re-election, sir, is just one month away.

And the world will never know of what I've seen here sir,
But I'll be with your daughter is my meaning clear, sir?

My mother looks in horror at the compromise we made,
But the Mayor's rueful smile says the piper must be paid!
I had a month of joy in heaven from this deal I'd made in hell.
What was to happen then my friend a prophet could not tell.

The day after his re-election and the victory celebration,
The Mayor takes his family on a month long foreign vacation.

Oh Coleen, you know how much I love you.
There is no one I'd ever place above you.
Oh Coleen, you don't even know me.
To have you there's nothing that's below me.

But time always passes after all,
And as the summer follows spring, so does the winter follow fall.

The day that they return I stand waiting on the road.
I watch the car drive up, I watch the passengers unload.
Of course she isn't there. Of course, I should have known.
The Mayor says that she has stayed. The decision was her own.
He said ""She's finishing her schooling on that unseen foreign shore.
And I'll tell you very frankly, boy, you'll not see her anymore! ""

I spit out my hatred and my fury at his lies,
When he says you tried to blackmail me you're just as bad as I!
He says -- Go and do your damndest, throw your mother to the streets!
You know it's been too many years I had to be discreet.

And as he stands there saying we're just two of a kind,
It hits me like a thunderbolt exploding in my mind.

As I look into his leering, aged, wrinkled, mirror of my own face,
He laughs and sneers and says, Of course, dear son,
Where do you think you came from in the first place?

The Mayor of Candor lied,
When he offered me his only daughter!
The Mayor of Candor tried,
To take her across the water.
What a thing to do to a young man in love!
What a thing to do to your daughter!"
Harry Chapin,The Parade's Still Passing By,/h/harry+chapin/the+parades+still+passing+by_20295645.html,"I got the news today
That you refused to play
Cause you never made number one
But it's not just the words
It's the deeds that are heard
When all is said and done
Kings take their crowns
They melt them all down
Trying to get the gold out
You went to hell and
Even when you weren't selling
You never ever sold out.

You weren't no leader
You were more like a bleeder
Who was trying to cry for us all
You weren't no sage
But your sense of outrage
Sounded like a trumpet call
Fifteen years ago
In the old folky show
You were just one voice in the crowd
But now with so few singing
Your voice would have been ringing
Out 'bout twice as loud.

There but for fortune
Say a small circle of friends
Some may see the changes
So few see the ends
The pleasures of the harbor
Have come to you at last
You may not be marching anymore
But the parade's still going past

I'm not taking the blame
That we killed you
You know you did that to yourself
But it was kind of a shame
That you played that game
Cause you were better than anyone else
One shot of your bottle
Got you full throttle
It was the friend that was always there
But your greatest gift
And the curse you lived with
Was that you could always care."
Harry Chapin,The Rock,/h/harry+chapin/the+rock_20302430.html,"The rock is gonna fall on us, he woke with a start
And he ran to his mother, the fear dark in his heart
And he told her of the vision that he was sure he'd seen
She said: ""Go back to sleep son, you're having a bad dream!""

Silly child--
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
Remember Chicken Little said the sky was falling down
Well nothing ever came of that, the world still whirls around

""The rock is gonna fall on us,"" he stood and told the class
The professor put his chalk down and peered out through his glasses
But he went on and said; ""I've seen it, high up on the hill
If it doesn't fall this year then very soon it will! ""

Crazy boy--
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
We've more important studies than your fantasies and fears
You know that rock's been perched up there for a hundred thousand years

""The rock is gonna fall on us."" He told the magistrates
""I believe that we can stop it but the time is getting late
You see I've done all the research my plans are all complete. ""
He was showing them contingencies when they showed him to the street

Just a madman--
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
Everybody knows of those who say the end is near
Everybody knows that life goes on as usual round here

He went up on the mountain beside the giant stone
They knew he was insane so they left him all alone
He'd given up enlisting help for there was no one else
He spent his days devising ways to stop the rock himself
One night while he was working building braces on the ledge
The ground began to rumble the rock trembled on the edge

""The rock is gonna fall on us! Run or you'll all be crushed!""
And indeed the rock was moving, crumbling all to dust
He ran under it with one last hope that he could add a prop
And as he disappeared the rock came to a stop

The people ran into the street but by then all was still
The rock seemed where it always was or where it always will be
When someone asked where he had gone they said: ""Oh he was daft.
Who cares about that crazy fool. "" And then they'd start to laugh

But high up on the mountain
When the wind is hitting it
If you're watching very closely
The rock slips a little bit"
Harry Chapin,The Shortest Story,/h/harry+chapin/the+shortest+story_20219880.html,"I am born today, the sun burns it's promise in my eyes;
Mama strikes me and I draw a breath and cry.
Above me a cloud softly tumbles through the sky;
I am glad to be alive.

It is my seventh day, I taste the hunger and I cry;
My brother and sister cling to Mama's side.
She squeezes her breast, but it has nothing to provide;
Someone weeps, I fall asleep.

It is twenty days today, Mama does not hold me anymore;
I open my mouth but I am too weak to cry.
Above me a bird slowly crawls across the sky;
Why is there nothing now to do but die?"
Harry Chapin,There Only Was One Choice,/h/harry+chapin/there+only+was+one+choice_20308297.html,"There's a kid out on my corner, hear him strumming like a fool.
Shivering in his dungarees -- but still he's going to school.
His cheeks are made of peach fuzz -- his hopes may be the same,
But he's signed up as a soldier out to play the music game.

There are fake patches on his jacket -- he's used bleach to fade his jeans
With a brand new stay pressed shirt -- and some creased and wrinkled dreams.
His face a blemish garden -- but his eyes are virgin clear.
His voice is Chicken Little's -- But he's hearing Paul Revere.

When he catches himself giggling -- he forces up a sneer,
Though he'd rather have a milk shake -- he keeps forcing down the beer.
Just another folkie -- late in coming down the pike,
Riding his guitar -- he left kid brother with his bike.

And he's got Guthrie running in his bones,
He's the hobo kid who's left his home,
And his Beatles records and the Rolling Stones,
This boy is staying acoustic!

There's Seeger singing in his heart,
He hopes his songs will somehow start,
To heal the cracks that split apart,
America gone plastic

And now there's Dylan dripping from his mouth.
He's hitching himself way down south,
To learn a little black and blues,
From old street men who paid their dues,
'Cause they knew they had nothing to lose,
They knew it.
So they just got to it.

With cracked old Gibsons' and red clay shoes,
Playing 1-4-5 chords like good news,
And cursed with skin that calls for blood,
They put their face and feet in mud,
But oh they learned the music from way down there!
The real ones learn it somewhere!

Strum your guitar -- sing it kid!
Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did!
Inexperience -- it once had cursed me,
But your youth is no handicap -- it's what makes you thirsty!

Hey, kid you know you can hear your footsteps as you're kicking up the dust,
And the rustling in the shadows tells you secrets you can trust.
The capturing of whispers is the way to write a song,
It's when you get to microphones the music can go wrong!

You can't see the audience with spotlights in your eyes,
Your feet can't feel the highway from where the Lear jet flies,
When you glide in silent splendor in your padded limousines.
Only you are crying there behind the silver screen!
Now you battle dragons -- but they'll all turn into frogs,
When you grab the wheel of fortune -- you get caught up in the cogs!

First your art turns into craft -- then the yahoos start to laugh!
Then you'll hear the jackals howl 'cause they love to watch the fall,
They're the lost ones out there feeding on the wounded and the bleeding,
They always are the first to see the cracks upon the walls!

When I started this song I was still thirty-three,
The age that Mozart died and sweet Jesus was set free.
Keats and Shelley too soon finished, Charley Parker would be,
And I fantasized some tragedy'd be soon curtailing me.

Well just today I had my birthday -- I made it thirty-four,
Mere mortal, not immortal, not star-crossed anymore.
I've got this problem with my aging I no longer can ignore,
A tame and toothless tabby can't produce a lion's roar.

And I can't help being frightened on these midnight afternoons,
When I ask the loaded questions -- Why does winter come so soon?
And where are all the golden girls that I was singing for?
The daybreak chorus of my dreams serenades no more.

Yeah the minute man is going soft -- the mirror's on the shelf!
Only when the truth's up there -- can you fool yourself.
I am the aged jester -- who won't gracefully retire,
A clumsy clown without a net caught staggering on the high wire.

Yesterday's a collar that has settled round my waist,
Today keeps slipping by me, it leaves no aftertaste.
Tomorrow is a daydream, the future's never true,
Am I just a fading fire or a breeze passing through?

Hello my Country.
I once came to tell everyone your story.
Your passion was my poetry,
And your past, my most potent glory.
Your promise was my prayer.
Your hypocrisy, my nightmare,
And your problems fill my present.
Are we both going somewhere?

Step right up young lady -- Your two hundred birthdays make you old if not senile!
And we see the symptoms there in your rigor-mortis smile!
With your old folks eating dog food and your children eating paint,
While the pirates own the flag and sell us sermons on restraint

And while blood's the only language that your deaf old ears can hear,
And still you will not answer with that message coming clear,
Does it mean there's no more ripples in your tired old glory stream,
And the buzzards own the carcass of your dream?

B*U*Y Centennial!
Sell 'em pre-canned laughter!
America Perennial,
Sing happy ever after!

There's a Dance Band on the Titanic,
Singing Nearer My God to Thee!
And the iceberg's on the starboard bow,
Won't you dance with me?

Yes I read it in the New York Times,
That was on the stands today,
It said that dreams were out of fashion,
We'll hear no more empty promises,
There'll be no more wasted passions,
To clutter up our play.

It really was a good sign,
The words went on to say,
It shows that we are growing up,
In oh so many healthy ways.
And I told myself this is,
Exactly where I'm at,
But I don't much like thinking about that!

Harry -- are you really so naive,
You can honestly believe,
That the country's getting better,
When all you do is let her alone?
Harry -- Can you really be surprised,
When it's there before your eyes,
When you hold the knife that carves her,
You live the life that starves her to the bone!

Good dreams don't come cheap,
You've got to pay for them!
If you just dream when you're asleep,
There is no way for them,
To come alive,
To survive!

It's not enough to listen -- it's not enough to see,
When the hurricane is coming on it's not enough to flee!
It's not enough to be in love -- we hide behind that word!
It's not enough to be alive when your future's been deferred!

What I've run through my body, what I've run through my mind,
My breath's the only rhythm -- and the tempo is my time!
My enemy is hopelessness -- my ally honest doubt,
The answer is a question that I never will find out!

Is music propaganda?  Should I boogie, Rock and Roll?
Or just an early warning system hitched up to my soul.
Am I observer or participant or huckster of belief,
Making too much of a life so mercifully brief?

So I stride down sunny streets and the band plays back my song.
They're applauding at my shadow long after I am gone.
Should I hold this wistful notion that the journey is worthwhile,
Or tiptoe cross the chasm with a song and a smile?

Well I got up this morning -- I don't need to know no more.
It evaporated nightmares that had boiled the night before.
With every new day's dawning my kid climbs in my bed,
And tells the cynics of the boardroom, your language is dead.

And as I wander with my music through the jungles of despair,
My kid will learn guitar and find his street corner somewhere.
There he'll make the silence listen to the dream behind the voice,
And show his minstrel Hamlet daddy that there only was one choice!

Strum your guitar -- sing it kid!
Just write about your feelings, not the things you never did.
Inexperience -- it once had cursed me,
But your youth is no handicap, it's what makes you thirsty!
Hey, kid!

Strum your guitar, sing it, kid!
Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did!

Harry Chapin,They Call Her Easy,/h/harry+chapin/they+call+her+easy_20351459.html,"It was just another night
And I was out on a limb
Looking for someone
To help me back in.
A couple of hours of cruising around
Brought me into a bar
And I sat me down
Nothing much to be found.
So I got in to talking to the old bar man
He said:

""You got a problem I can understand
And I know a little lady
Who is all alone.
If you find her she will take you home.
She don't like to spend her nights alone! ""

They call her Easy.
They say it's not a way for a body to be.
They call her Easy.
She is giving out her love for free.

I found her on the street
Like the bartender said.
She was not great looking
But not that bad.
I walked on up to her
And didn't say a word
But my eyes were talking
And I think she heard.
Yes, she heard me.
We walked down the road
To a rundown farm.
She lit a couple of candles
And she held out her arms.
Lord, she was gentle as a windblown sigh
In the morning while dressing I could hear her cry.
She was crying and I went flying out of there.

They call her Easy.
They say it's not a way for a body to be.
They call her Easy.
She is giving out her love for free.

The next day found me walking in town.
Saw the old bartender and I flagged him down.
I thanked him for the girl
And told him that she pleased me
And laughed a little bit
About how she was easy.
But the old man stopped me
With the look in his eye.
He said,

""You know I had hoped
You weren't that kind of guy.
Dream of the kind of world it could be
If we were free with our loves like Easy""

It's a hard world we must learn to be easy.
In a cold world I must love the ones who please me
Easy!

They call her Easy.
They say it's not a way for a body to be.
They call her Easy.
She is giving out her love for free."

Somebody told you it's more mellow.
Well I've played a lot of music since but I really haven't grown that far
Somebody said that you're just yellow.

So I keep it up on the shelf
And it's funny how you keep it all to yourself
Hey honey, could there ever be,
Should there ever be,
Could there ever be something else?

You know I used to swing my silver sword, the dragons hit the ground
Whatever happened to the maidens?
Well I'd swing my silver sword again and they would all fall down
Would you leave them lying there where you had laid them?

And I used to have a country once, where it's gone I do not know.
Where do you think you might have lost it?
I used to raise the flag at dawn, but that was very long ago
Maybe you can find it where you tossed it.

Well I tossed it up on the shelf
And it's funny how you've kept it all for yourself
Hey honey, could there ever be,
Should there ever be,
Could there ever be something else?

I used to say my prayers boys, I used to sing the hymns
Even the echo's disappearing.
They've broken the stained windows, the cathedral's getting dim.
Then what is this dirge that we are hearing?

Well it comes from up on the shelf
And it's funny how you sing it only for yourself
Hey honey, could there ever be,
Should there ever be,
Could there ever be something else?

Well, I used to have a lover once, I used to have a friend
How in the hell you ever find one?
My song is almost over now, my story's at an end
You lived yourself a good life but a blind one.

Well I've hidden there up on the shelf
And it's funny how you've kept it all for yourself
Hey honey, could there ever be,
Should there ever be,
Could there ever be something else?"

Is fullness for a lifetime that's bare as can be

There's a vacancy, won't you come to me
And fill my empty spaces
I'm a motel man in a promised land
That's filled with empty faces
So won't you bring your sorrows bring your dreams,
It's a place for you to be
There's no more tomorrow or that's how it seems
Won't you come to me? I've got a vacancy

Another name, another key, another pass to glory
Another night, another sight, another bedtime story
Another stage, another chance, for gentleness or violence
Another birth, another dance, another death in silence

Mr. Soft is comin' off and soon he'll be gone
Mrs. Hart has come apart now that she's alone
Mr. Jive has come alive but nobody's home

Mornings come checkout time, with my pail and broom
I find what they've left behind in every tell-tale room
The sheets show their struggles, the glasses their fears
The ashtrays the hours passed, the towels their tears

What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an fm Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into am rock
But I just had to run around
It's been eight years since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the morning dj at W*O*L*D
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen

The drinking I did on my last big gig, it made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way down home again, via Boise, Idaho
That's how this business goes

I am the morning dj at W*O*L*D
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen

I've been making extra money doing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest mc
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, just begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away

Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just take off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should stop disk jockeying
And start that record store
Maybe I could settle down if you'd take me back once more

Ok Honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, Old Girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L, W*O*L, W*O*L*D*D*D

Harry Chapin,We Grew Up A Little Bit,/h/harry+chapin/we+grew+up+a+little+bit_20337838.html,"We got married early
And just a little bit late
Baby came too early
But some things just can't wait
We were just beginning
But it was very clear
We grew up a little bit that year

I caught on as a meter man
You were caught at home
When I started night school
You ended up alone
But you had another baby
While I had my career
And we grew up a little bit
We grew up a little bit
We grew up a little bit that year

They put me in a office job
A young man on the move
We bought a house in Shaker Heights
You supervised the move
We were cashing checks, you were changing children
While I played engineer
And we were growing ever faster
Every year

I got bored of kilowatts
You were tired of kids
I started staying out at night
And soon that's what you did
At parties we'd go seperately
You'd wiggle and I'd leer
And we were growing faster
We were growing ever faster
We were growing ever faster every year

You learned to live in silence
I learned to live in lies
And we both igored the empty spaces
Growing in our eyes
Your breath became a gin and tonic
Mine became a beer
And we grew up a little more last year

Today at work they passed me by
And promoted John instead
I came home to find you'd wrecked the car
I guess I lost my head
Well, I can't believe I hit you
But the rage came on so strong
Ah, where did we go wrong?

As you sit there crying
I wonder who you are
The partner-stranger-friend and foe
Who's come with me this far
We stand here in the ashes
And I guess it is quite clear
We did not really grow too much
Each year

So you say we're going nowhere
Well I know that's where we've been
Still I can't help wondering
Can we begin again?
I feel so full of questions
Curiosity and fear
But could we grow a little bit
Could we grow a little bit
Can we grow a little bit this year?"
Harry Chapin,We Were Three,/h/harry+chapin/we+were+three_20350016.html,"The old lady on the park bench
In the park with just one tree
Was there from the very first day
That you were part of me
It seemed like she'd been sitting there
Since 1000 B. C.
And you said, ""She is as permanent
As anything can be. ""

>From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

You sat there in the window
You were looking 'cross the street
You said, ""The birds and the old lady
Yet the same bread crumbs they eat. ""
I could not get you back to bed
'Till you took them both a treat
And I learned that you were twice as stubborn
As you could be sweet

>From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Do you remember that summer rain storm
On the day that you moved in
I was caught in the excitement
Of what was to begin
Well, you disappeared for a little while
And when I asked you where you'd been
You said you'd lent the old lady my new umbrella
Then you gave me that wicked grin

>From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Yes on March 21st the first day of Spring
The old lady would be there
Spend all the days of summer
Then she'd disappear somewhere
Where she spent her falls and her winters, babe
No one was aware
But you were the first to wonder
Yeah, you were the first to care

It was three years we were together
The old lady held that spot
Through the nights when life was wonderful
Through the days when it was not
And the times we were in trouble
In a way we sometimes got
Just knowing that she was out there
Meant we gave it just one more shot

>From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Well it's March 21st the first day of Spring
And you know what I had to do
I got up and I ran to the window
To confirm what I already knew
I wish I had your address
To send this letter to
You see the old lady's not on the park bench
And I'm still wondering where are you
Where are you
Where are you"
Harry Chapin,What Made America Famous?,/h/harry+chapin/what+made+america+famous_20341078.html,"It was the town that made America famous.
The churches full and the kids all gone to hell.
Six traffic lights and seven cops and all the streets kept clean.
The supermarket and the drug store and the bars all doing well.

They were the folks that made America famous.
The local fire department stocked with short haired volunteers.
And on Saturday night while America boozes,
The fire department showed dirty movies.
The lawyer and the grocer seeing their dreams,
Come to life on the movie screens,
While the plumber hopes that he won't be seen,
As he tries to hide his fears and he wipes away his tears.
But something's burning somewhere. Does anybody care?

We were the kids that made America famous.
The kind of kids that long since drove our parents to despair.
We were lazy long hairs dropping our, lost confused, and copping out.
Convinced our futures were in doubt and trying not to care.

We lived in the house that made America famous.
It was a rundown slum, the shame of all the decent folks in town.
We hippies and some welfare cases,
Crowded families of coal black faces,
Cramped inside some cracked old boards,
The best that we all could afford
But still to nice for the rich landlord
To ever tear it down and we could hear the sound
Of something burning somewhere. Is anybody there?

We all lived the life that made America famous.
Our cops would make a point to shadow us around our town.
And we love children put a swastika on the bright red firehouse door.
America, the beautiful, it makes a body proud.

And then came the night that made America famous.
Was it carelessness or someone's sick idea of a joke?
In the tinder box trap that we hippies lived in someone struck a spark.
At first I thought I was dreaming,
Then I saw the first flames gleaming,
And heard the sound of children screaming
Coming through the smoke. That's when the horror broke.

Something's burning somewhere. Does anybody care?

It was the fire that made America famous.
The sirens wailed and the firemen stumbled, sleepy from their homes.
And the plumber yelled: ""Come on let's go!""
But they saw what was burning and said: ""Take it slow,
Let 'em sweat a little, they'll never know.
And besides, we just cleaned the chrome. ""
Said the plumber: ""Then I'm going alone.""

Well, he rolled on up in the fire truck,
And raised the ladder to the ledge,
Where me and my girl and a couple of kids,
Were clinging like bats to the edge.
We staggered to salvation,
Collapsed on the street.
And I never thought that a fat man's face
Would ever look so sweet.

I shook his hand in the scene that made America famous,
And he smiled from the heart that made America great.
You see we spent the rest of that night in the home of this man we''d never known before.
It's funny when you get that close it's kind of hard to hate.

I went to sleep with the hope that made America famous.
I had the kind of a dream that maybe they're still trying to teach in school.
Of the America that made America famous,. And
Of the people who just might understand,
That how together yes we can
Create a country better than
The one we have made of this land,
We have a choice to make each man
Who dares to dream, reaching out his hand,
A prophet or just a crazy God damn
Dreamer of a fool - yes a crazy fool!

And something's burning somewhere.
Does anybody care?
Is anybody there?"
Harry Chapin,Why Do Little Girls,/h/harry+chapin/why+do+little+girls_20342032.html,"Why did the little girls grow crooked
While the little boys grow tall
The boys were taught to tumble
The girls told not to fall
The girls answered the telephone
The boys answered the call
That's why little girls grew crooked
While the little boys grew tall

Why did the little girls grow crippled
While the little boys grow strong
The boys allowed to come of age
The girls just came along
The girls were told sing harmonies
The boys could all sing songs
That's why little girls grew crippled
While little boys grew strong

Why did the little girls come broken
While the little boys came whole
The little boys were set aflame
The girls told to fan the coals
The boys all told to be themselves
While the girls were told play the roles
That's why little girls came broken
While little boys came whole

Why were the little girls all frightened
To be just what they are
The boys were told to ask themselves
How high how far
The girls were told to reach the shelves
While the boys were reaching stars
That's why little girls were frightened
To be just what they are

And still they bled for us all
As the moon rode the sky
They carried our seed
When our need ran high
They fed all our children
In the night as they cried
Womankind wept
As mankind died

Why were the little girls left hurtin'
When all the boys were done
And the girls left in the moonlight
When the boys went to meet the sun
And when the girls were open
Why had the little all won?
That's why little girls were hurtin'
When the little boys were done

Why did the little girls grow crooked
While the little boys grew tall
It's maybe because the little boys
Didn't ever have to grow up at all"

'Cause he thought he'd got a message from some holy man on high.
He said his chance had finally come; he'd done it on his own,
He had to leave his past behind; the first thing that had to go--was
Home.

You put him in an aeroplane and packed your life and clothes,
You learned all the lessons that the suitcase lady knows.
He said, ""Something still drags me back from where I'm heading to,""
You didn't really understand, 'til the next thing that had to go--was
You.

Some things are sacrificed and some things remain,
Some things bring pleasure and some things bring pain.
Some things must pass away, and some things are regained,
When the whole world is changing, why should people stay the same?

You saw his picture in the paper, that disarming boyish smile,
You sometimes had to swallow hard as you saw him on the dial.
You heard him on a talk show, he was hearing no one else,
Then suddenly you knew too well, the last thing he'd left behind--was
Himself.

Some things are sacrificed and some things remain,
Some things bring pleasure and some things bring pain.
Some things must pass away, and some things are regained,
When the whole world is changing, why should people stay the same?

So you pulled yourself together, friends and family said you should,
You discovered you were doing things you never knew you could.
And someday when he calls you, which you know of course he'll do,
You'll just send him away again, 'cause the last thing you finally
Found--was
You."

There was a special kind of lonesome
'round that ending time of year.
When the leaves fell
And they drifted 'neath the trees that soon were bare
I felt that wind blow,
Ever colder,
And suddenly,
You were there.
We laughed and scuffled
While the snow fell
And the cold gave your cheecks a glow.
And in your arms come evening
A kind of peace I know.
Often I'd wake at midnight
Mid some icy winter storm,
And then I would find you
Beside me,
And you made the night seem so warm.
Now I go my way
And you go your way
Now that the winter's come and gone.
But somehow
With the springtime
Your golden warmth still lingers on."

The rain runs down your hair.
Woman child, mercy mild.
What will you tell your teddy bear?

I turned you on my solid body
My electric Gibson guitar.
My clever fingers searched
And found exactly where you are.
You went too far.

I was an early morning phone call.
What news have I received.
A halting voice is telling me,
What we have both conceived,
Asking how the dilemma,
How can it be releived?

""I will give you money, Honey.
I will set up a time.
But you got to go there on your own babe,
'cause I don't know that it's mine.""

Oh woman child
Mama's little angel's been defiled.
Took a taxi to the clinic
Where they do the modern thing.
The white coat doctor
Laid her out said

""You won't feel a thing.
You get the sweet salvation
That little old knife can bring.
You don't have to worry 'bout no offspring.

Find himself hassled or some what harassed,

But when he comes home he brings me stories,
He made up especially for me.
A little bit of low down, a little bit of glory oh,

The choice is simple, I can scold him,
Give him a smile or simply hold him
Somehow it seems, I never ever told him no


Watch him work, he leaves each hartfull,
Shovels it out there by the careful.
He's so artless it's almost artful as he as he strings them along.

Takes you down, gets you cryin,
Sets you high, gets you flyin.

But when you sing from the inside
You hope that something shows
And that it why

Yes you are the only song, the only song I need
You're my laughter and you're my lonely song
You're the harvest and you're the seed
And you're my first and my final song
For you own me indeed
Oh yes, oh yes,
Yes, after all is said and done
You're the one song that I need

I've sung my songs to silence
To empty clubs and crowded bars
I've sung my songs to standing room
Even sung 'em to the stars
But the faces they fade together
And the applause it's gone so fast
And the story of every darkened stage
Is that the glory just does not last

And that is why
Yes after all is said and done
You're the one song that I need

You heard us before but that was just a little sample
We're back for more here to set a worse example

Big wolves linin' up and scorin' little pigs
Still drunk and we're doin' it again
With a huff and a puff I'm blowin birds on your shit
Learn it out pitch black grin still white skin
You know I'm hard to kill but real I'm movin' in
I'm puttin' 22 down while I'm pukin' up blood
You know I'm here to stay well fuck I'm gonna die young

He asked your sister out so that he could cheat on her
What a creep loner, shit I couldn't sink lower
You just got a mean boner from a Charlie Scene poster
If I'm poppin' a wheelie it means I'm jackin your bike
Got my middle finger raised as I'm runnin' red lights
I'm known to punch 'em in the dick at the end of a fight
And I never say I'm sorry at the end of the night.

So many dollars stuffed in my wallet
Chain so bling yeah you know that I'm a baller
We can take the blame cause your parents don't wanna
They roll their blunts with your marijuana
How can I run when the pigs got a chopper
I got a gun but they got a lotta
Shootin' at the sky with a mother fuckin' sawed off
God bless a cathlic forgive me father
Now what's a man to do when another holds a Bible
A lot of kids suein me holdin' me liable
Reflections of a kid and they call him suicidal
Dead beat such a sinner but we call him a child
How can you blame him a play ground they're dealin
The mother still buyin' and the father still preachin'
And now it's up to me cause no one's gonna teach him
Now nobody, nobody needs 'em.

We don't apologize

A box of moonlight, a silhouette of palm trees
With one foot in the grave, beware of what I crave
My loneliness is the only bitch that holds me

The moon is changing me, yeah, my heart is beating
You better run away before it gets too late
Black sunsets on the sky and I'm thinking

Is there anyone home?
Hope you're awake for the nightmare
Hope you stay for the show

You know how it is 'cause we're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise
Just let the bad moon do it, bad moon do it, bad moon do it
You know how it is 'cause I'm just waiting on that bad, bad moon tonight

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene & Danny]
So take my hand now, I welcome you to my bad dream
Up in the clouds now, that bad moon comes and it grabs me
I see the city glow, the city is my soul
And when it takes to control, it's got me thinking these bad things
So let's not talk about it, I know the deal's done
There ain't no getting 'round this, your ship is sinking
Get to your knees and pray, blue skies, they turn to grey
Black sunsets in your eyes, am I dreaming?

[Verse 3: Funny Man]
Blacked out streets, looking like a wolf
Bad moon up, need to check my pulse
Creep in the woods and I got you shook
Eyes locked in, gonna get you hooked
No look pass, coming up real fast
Sip on the flask then I hit that gas
No time to crash, gonna make it last
Wake up inside in a cool black mask
Got gold fangs, I'm with my kin
No silver chain, it burns my skin
Hitting those threes, I was born to win
Pop from the trees and I give you a grin
Check out the hairs that grows on my skin
That's just the beast calling within
Blood stains on my fresh white Nikes
Oh my God, what the fuck did I do last night?

[Chorus: Danny]
You know how it is when you're just waiting on that bad, bad moon to rise

Yeah, down there you gotta have a label
Just like a cattle in a stable

Why speak out when you could be silenced
Down there out on the dance floor
Too much violence I don't want more

The words, they come, but then they softly go unspoken
You walk the lonely path, the only path you've chosen
Every moment's taken away and every second's stolen
Can't hold on but I won't let go of everything I'm holding
When you feel it too, I hope you second that emotion
Your dreams are slipping by because your eyes are always open
Life is like a gun, it's not the only one that's loaded

[Chorus: Danny & Funny Man]
And your life can end inside a moment
It slips by the more you try to hold it

Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang

The days are getting shorter, infinite in disorder
Swimming in the torture, sanity is on the border
No time to wonder why, why I'm not afraid to die
My crimes will satisfy, so who's got time to say goodbye?
Every time I'm losing control, lose a little piece of my soul
Too late for me to crawl up out this hole so, come on, let's go
Ain't no way to justify, this life keeps rushing by
It's hard to stay alive but at least you know I fucking try

You'll never live until you know that you could die
You have to walk before you try to fly
You'll never know what's real in life until you pull it
Never see it coming like a bullet

Sometimes the truth can hurt inside
Don't you ever wonder why?
Let me know when it's time to pull it
I'll pull you through this bullet
Don't wanna know what it's like to fly?
Buy yourself a pretty life
Let me know when it's time to pull it
I'll pull you through this bullet
You wanna live before you die?
Sell yourself a pretty life
Let me know when it's time to pull it
I'll pull you through this bullet

It'll make you beg for more, until you can't even breathe
Your blindfold is on tight, but you like what you see
So follow me into the night, cuz I got just what you need
We're all rollin' down the boulevard, full of pimps and sharks
It's a motherf-ckin' riot, we've been dying to start
You better grab a hold cuz now you know your falling apart
You thought these streets were paved in gold
But there dirty and dark

[Chorus:]
Been to hell!
I can show you the devil!
Down you fell
Can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell
Down here you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares!

In the belly of the beast, I'm a wolf amongst sheep
At the bottom of the hill, but at the top of the street
Above the boulevard, schoolyard, victim of deceit
And your running hard, but this wolf it's always at your feet
Ya you've seen it all before, but the wolf's outside your door
And you're old enough to run, you ain't hiding anymore
Another victim of the star spangled banner of the street
Now you're in the world of the wolves
And we welcome all you sheep

[Chorus:]
Been to hell!
I can show you the devil!
Down you fell
Can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell
Down here you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares

You need to wake up and face it
So you can taste my reality
Now you're stuck in this place you hate
And you came here so happily
Then it made you lose your faith
And that's what f-cked with your sanity
Say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity
Hollywood is your friend, and the undead are your family
We'll take you to the edge, and turn your regret into agony
And I'll never let you go, cuz I know you'll come back to me
I'm the reason you came here, I'm the American Tragedy

[Chorus:]
Been to hell!
I can show you the devil!
Down you fell
Can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell
Down here you live forever

Hollywood Undead,Believe,/h/hollywood+undead/believe_21052205.html,"Chorus (Danny):
I can’t believe.
That when I breathe.
There’s something good inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.
So close to me.
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.

Verse 1 (Danny):
If I went out the back door nobody would stop me.
But where would I go?
Cause I ain’t never had a real home.
So what do I know?
So I could keep running, hiding till they find me.
But what would that do?
If they could only know what I knew.
What would it prove?
I should’ve seen the writing on the wall.
Instead I’m left to fall.
Cause the longer I’m away.
The more we stay the same.
Looking back where I thought I knew it all.
Instead I’m left to fall.
Did I throw it all away?

Chorus (Danny):
I can’t believe.
That when I breathe.
There’s something good inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.
So close to me.
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.

Verse 2 (Johnny 3 Tears):
Don’t you know, little boy, they'll lay you to waste man.
Little do they know every song is a life span.
Haven’t taken one, but I’m taking my last chance.
To hold all we know and let go with both hands.
Oh don’t you know that clouds are made from concrete?
Right through the stone can you hear my heart beat?
Beats through my bones like the memory left me.
Not for a second or a minute when I dream.
I want to go home like the home that I keep.
You can dig six, so sixty six feet.
We can live forever still your misery missed me.
Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey.
Look into the mirror at the lines that time drew.
Seen em painted white and the eyes that shined through.
My heart beats heavy in an open chest.
And I want to say goodbye, but there’s nobody left.

Chorus (Danny):
I can’t believe.
That when I breathe.
There’s something good inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.
So close to me.
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.

Verse 3 (J-Dog):
I broke it all and I’m put to the test.
Put your hand to mine and feel this emptiness.
There’s no beat in my chest, cause there’s nothing left.
No it ain’t goodbye, it’s a last caress.
What’s another dream, you can hardly sleep.
Can you believe bad things only happen to me.
God knows one day you will finally see.
That scars will heal but were meant to bleed.
Do you realize I would lie for you?
Please have my last breath, I would die for you.
I know I’m no good but my heart beats true.
You know I’m going to fight, though I might be scared to lose.
You took me in and I fucked it up again.
An empty promise, no I won’t pretend.
Cause in the end we need someone to solve em.
Nobody can fix me if I’m part of the problem.

Chorus (Danny):
I can’t believe.
That when I breathe.
There’s something good inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me.
So close to me.
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me.
Just one good thing inside of me, yeah."

Still, I go
Yeah, I go

I smile, but there's blood in my reflection
There's violence in the poetry
When it's over, there's no resurrection
At least for you and me

I never felt so low
But I love the way I look, yeah
With this bloody nose
Look how many hits it took ya
Here I go down this broken road
My smile still shows through my bloody nose
Still, I go
Still, I go
Yeah, I go

Words are just like violence
Today I'll break the silence
This could be goodbye, kid
Do you see me when you close your eyelids?
Today I'mma get back up
Fists raised, let's get close up
Your life won't be so rough
Get the fuck up 'cause we've had enough

[Bridge: Danny & Charlie Scene]
Here we lay
In our final hours like dying flowers
The price we pay
As you struggle for power that your ego devours

Here I go down this broken road
My smile still shows through my bloody nose
Still, I go
Still, I go
Yeah, I go

On the lonely streets of Sunset
When the lord called upon 6 crazy M. C's
J Dog, Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears, Da Kurlzz, and The Producer

(*Spoken*)
Hey! Uh, man you forgot the homie funny man, C'mon!

[Chorus:]
And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

[Verse:]
My clothes are always retro
Sexual like I'm hetro
And I play a bitch like nintendo (Zelda!)
Take a fun ride in my benzo
Funny as fuck, I should do stand up
Bust caps at the club like I don't give a fuck (fuck you)
Got a gold ass grill
Hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill
Hop in the ride, let's roll
I'm a baritone with a voice that's so low
It'll make your speakers explode
And I'll drop your panties to the floor (Ah!)
Let me bend you over, let me lay you sideways
Hop in the back girls, freaky friday!
If you got beef, then you better step up bitch
Hollywood Undead ain't nothin' to fuck with!

And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

Girl, come and smoke my pole like a Marlboro
Introduce me to your mom as Charles
It's Charlie Scene, Shake your ass to the bass
Wait till you see my face, hey bitch!
Wear the tight jeans that show your ass crack
My first name gives Vietnam flash backs
I get drunk and do the same old, same old
Take three girls home, call them Charlie's Angels
(What'chu gonna do after we get signed?)
I'm gonna lose my mind
Get 30 inch spinners and pimp my ride
Go back in time, be there that night and save Tupac's life
Then pay my fine for getting caught fucking on the Hollywood sign
I got the game on lock
I'll have a bottle and a glock
With biceps like The Rock
Buy Tom's soul back from Rupert Murdock (hey!)

And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

Hollywood Undead,Broken Record,/h/hollywood+undead/broken+record_21164355.html,"[Verse 1: Charlie Scene]
Why the fuck do I keep feeling like I lost my shit?
It's like I should just give up because I'm not legit
It's like I got a chain wallet and some frosted tips
Sometimes I wanna grab a fucking gun and swallow it
It's like pulling teeth for me to give a compliment
That's why I walk into your circle and I talk some shit
I'm sure you tell all of your friends that I'm a monster prick
Man, I wish that guy would take a hike and chomp a dick
And I can't stop any of these evil thoughts
And I never thought I would ever be so lost
Make these bad thoughts go away, they need to stop
And if I keep sobbing like a bitch, I'll need a mop
It's like my mind's a broken record, make it go away
And I keep telling myself that I'll be okay
But something negative is all I ever seem to think
So I guess I'll just get down on my knees and pray

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
Well, I know I should be moving on
But I feel like I'm already gone
Now if somebody'd only save me from
This broken record that's playing in my heart

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
Back in the beginning, can't remember who I was
But I know I was a kid that would dream just because
Then I don't remember giving in or ever giving up
But I guess that's what I did 'cause I guess I had enough
When I look in this mirror and I see this reflection
It always smiles back but I know it's deception
A medicated smile with these desperate intentions
Dreaming of that kid and his soul's resurrection
Due pay, just not enough pens, not enough pages
To explain away this fucking hatred
Spent his whole life wishing someone could save him
Save me, please, I can't seem to take this
Story tucked in my notebook but I won't ever read him
'Cause I'm too afraid to look
Back on the wrong side of those tracks
'Cause if I ever do I might not come back

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
Well, I know I should be moving on
But I feel like I'm already gone
Now if somebody'd only save me from
This broken record that's playing in my heart

You know it's alright, I'm praying for the sunshine
To get me through the hard times, to get me through the hard times
You know it's alright, I'm praying for the sunshine
To get me through the hard times, to get me through the hard time

Well, I know I should be moving on
But I feel like I'm already gone
Now if somebody'd only save me from

I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm
Gone, gone, gone, gone

Gone too far yea I'm gone again
It's gone on too long tell you how it ends
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One's a bottle of pills and one's a bottle of gin.

I'm twenty stories up, yea up at the top
I've polished off this bottle now it's pushin' me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my momma found my letter now she's calling the cops

I've gotta take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is

I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God you know you wanna look nice

No more sun why's it always night
When you can't sleep well you can't dream
When you can't dream well what's life mean?

We feel little pity but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and her son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don't

You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
What happened to that father, who swore he'd stay
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain

When you were young you never thought you'd die
Found that you could but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly

So if I survive then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea, I'll see you tomorrow...

About some bad kids who were full of wishes
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin
Little Timmy stole from 7-11
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens
We drank in his room with some dude named Kevin
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents
Zack got caught with a bottle of jack
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack
So we took the beer back and I fucked him in the ass!
It's Charlie Scene got egg nog in my flask
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped
Like oh my god is that saint nick
Kids give me your list like it's the 25th
Been accused of being a bad kid
Bu-but I get presents as is
Cause mrs. Clause just myspace'd me
I blew off a date on Christmas eve.
So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice
You might still get a Rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice
So write your list and never have no fear
Have a Hollywood Christmas and an Undead new year!

He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve.
He said that his jolly ass needed some help.
He said Christmas aint a gang but a way of life.
""If you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife.""
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle,
Funnier than fuck you can ask Chris Kringle.
So we all took flight but something was fishy.
He asked for road head and started to kiss me.
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows.
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's.
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster.
It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter.
When we found out he started to pout.
I took my bandana and I choked him out.
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth.
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south.
I had a lot of long nights but tonight was the craziest,
Met a lot of Jeff's but this one was shadiest.
When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch.

The only evidence they have is a police sketch of my mask
And it's hard at times to ask if you can save my heart for last
And it's hard to face the facts when the darkness fades to black

And villains who pillage, they're killin' by the millions
And billions of people die for a lost cause

Someday, someday
I know you're coming back

(J-Dog)
Down in the dirt
With your blood on my hands
I blacked out
But now I do understand
That you were too good
For this world so you left it
Everything turned red
And then you made an exit
I don't even know
If it was your time
But like all good things
That pass you by
Just like a lost soul
In the time of need
It made me grow up fast
And put some blood on my knees
And you don't even know
It's beyond you
Thinking you could never die
Like you're bulletproof
So I guess you had to leave
You were born with wings
But you were never happy
Til the angels sing

And when a man
Turns to ashes
Forget about love
Like the feeling inside you
With the bottle beside you
You both end up empty

I look to the heavens
To the sky and the rest
I looked inside myself
I felt my heart in my chest
Some things are born blue
There's nothing to say
Some hearts can stay true
When falling away
Come lay down beside me
What could one life mean?
It's only what I've seen
It's only just one dream
Tell my baby I love her
And I wish I could hold her
It's hard to say goodbye
When you know that it's over

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a mad man, but the voices keep asking
Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around I see what I'm feeling
Every time I die, I hope they diggin' up my grave
The undead won like the flag that I wave
I'm not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness
I ask and get none, no, no forgiveness
The day of the dead and you're on our hit list
So come all you misfits
Bitch, you're on our hit list!

This is exactly what has to be done, it happens so rarely
It's like I magically happened to be the phantom and the candlelit [?]
It's hysterical tracking me [?],
While you gaspin' so rapidly
Why you brag on this rag? [?]
I'll teach you 'bout life before happening
It's ok to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no savin' your heart
This is the day of the dead, this is no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, down your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The storm has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
When I'm done, I ain't done, 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow,
‘Cause it's hell that follows

Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come

Better run, here we come
It's the day of the dead

When the ashes start to rise
And the moon falls from the sky
And 1000 candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry
On the plains below the sky
Will 1000 souls still pray for you and I?

[Chorus:]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the day of the dead

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close

Ain't a good shot, here come 4 more
Gettin' hot so I play in the snow
In a town made wicked
Made from these wicked things
See the dead on the cover of a magazine
See my smile it was born from amphetamines
Better duck, 'cus it's war on my enemies
Oh God I think I lost it all now
Lost some, wanna watch the rest go
A mad man when I'm mixed with soco
Who woulda' thought a man could sink to so low?
Now who wants to die from the Mossberg shotty?
Puttin' holes in the hotel lobby
All you fake bitches are just another hobby
And I'll let you dig where I dump your body

Say goodnight 'cus it's almost your bedtime
Buckle up 'cus it's time to fly

No, it's not somebody else, it's always fucking with me
No, it won't let me rest, no, it won't let me be
Just put a bullet in my head, we'll both go to sleep
Why can't I get along with the voice in my head?
Got my sanity hanging from a thread
I'm the monster that's under the bed
I think we'd both be better off dead
I think we'd both be better off dead
I think we'd both be better off dead

Imagine cold hands up to your throat
The thought alone makes you swallow your hope
And now it's harder to cope
And I don't know where I'll go

It's A red night and I don't see any light

What if I told you that we're already dead?
What if I said you can't outrun this spread?
I got one foot forward as I'm moving ahead
So just open up your arms and drink the dread
Embrace the kiss of death
While you're holding on your chest
And you're burning from the bullets
That you're gasping for breath
Unless you join us in the fight
With the dove on your crest
Then we will march into the night

But you prayed a little late

Not for heaven, heaven's fake
I was made to burn it down
So I can make you feel the same
Yeah, you better write those letters
That you're never gonna send
I can see through the tears
But all I see is red
I see all the pain
And you say ""what's the problem?""
What happened to these kids? When was it that we lost them?
Altered by the time
They were victims by design
And sedated till they demonstrated
How you live and how you die
I only wanna burn the world
And now you're asking why
Well, count your blessings, say your prayers
It's time to say goodbye
We're gone, gone like a nightmare in a dark place
All along, brutality that I made
Gone, gone like a nightmare in a dark place
All along, all along
Everything I love is gone

I hit the dance floor and get my sing-along on.
I love to spit the choruses when I'm on one,
My C-Walk's too hot I done ripped my Sean John.
Smelling so fly I got the Hugo Boss on,
You got the type of booty I'd like to put my paws on.
We can roll in the Fiesta just to get our floss on,
I got the speakers bumping straight banging the Thong Song.
Got my hair did got my shit braided up,
Rolling with Funny Man and he's breaking a blunt.
Snatch it out of his hand and now I'm blazing it up,
Took another sip of Henny, now I'm faded as fuck.
Yo, Charlie Scene, tell me where you got them shades at?

So I parked the Huffy, kicked down the kickstand,
Paid the twenty-dollar cover and I got me a wristband.
Got bitches to my neck like I'm standing in quicksand,
If they talk to me twice, they better talk to my pimp hand.
Got the Laker jersey and the platinum chain,
Two Bluetooths and a pinky ring.
Getting drunk as fuck off that Tanqueray,
Beer goggles on, I'm talking to a grenade.
Yo, Charlie Scene, tell me how you got so flossy?
It isn't my fault that all the ladies want me.

And known to be flashier than paparazzi.

Everyone is cruising, gang signs, we're moving
You know how we're doing, white lines abusing
On the boulevard, we never go too far
Nothing really matters when you're walking on stars

Nowadays auditions to the devil are sold
From the Boardwalk, I see the ghosts on the beach
Memories of my city keep haunting me

'Bout to start a little shit down on PCH

That's weakness, don't let it divide you;
Keep this, that feeling of pride too;
Digging up bones, but you bury the truth!

For whom the bell told, the tolls for thee;
For whom they smile when they put you to sleep!

Is he still chasing after these same old dreams?
I know that I'll never reach perfection
At least he could point me in the right direction
Some grow old, and some grow cold
They'd sell their souls for a heart of gold

But maybe I won't, because I left it all behind.

Now I'm stuck with this, and that'll never change
Always a part of me, until the very last day.
Where to go from here? What road to travel on?
I spent my whole life choosing, and I always chose wrong.

Will I try to have the will to be alive?
Will I try because I've never seen the light?

Walking these streets, so absent of hope.
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home.
Lend him a hand, then we're walking the way.
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame.

So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight.
When you wake up, you know it's darker than last night.

I'm murdering recklessly, bitch, these streets ain’t no Sesame
And now you’re maxing my felony list, I'm not wasting energy
I’m the seminal winner beyond us, that's something I'll fucking promise
Godless, so I'll take the charges while this is my fucking conscience
God, this is so fucking pompous, hundreds of fathers to nothing
God, I’m just so damn exhausted, and all this is making me nauseous
I'm gonna win this regardless, this ain't no place for the heartless
'Cause I live for the pain
The fight, the glory, the game

(Whoa) And no one is safe
(Whoa) I'll leave a rose on your grave
(Whoa) It's the dove and grenade

Compare me to none

It's some West Coast beach-bum gangsta shit
Fuck a Hollywood hit, I ghostride the whip
On the Sunset Strip, just me and my clique
And we runnin' the streets, so suck my dick

Six deep we creep and to the streets we go
Cadillacs and chops so we're ready to roll

Just a couple of gangstas
Mimosa's a big ghost
Smoking and swerving
Coming straight for your throat

Get back, when we enter the room
Get back, cause we digging your tomb
Get back, what the fuck you gonna do?
What the fuck you gonna do?
When we're coming for you?

He’s poppin' a wheelie on his fucking Ducati

Oh no, yeah there goes Charlie
Mad dogging, shirtless on the back of a Harley

Let’s go, yeah we’re ready to party
The best duo since Wayne and Farley

Let’s roll, up in the whip and get gnarly
We blaze more spliffs then a young Bob Marley

Get some, yeah get your dick sucked
I’m blazing a quick one in the back of a strip club

Our victim, forced into a sixsm
And ain’t nobody leaving until all of our dicks cum

So kick back, when I flash this gat
I got more straps than Matt’s assless chaps

So heads up, yeah we’re lying them low
All coked up and ready to go

Choking on this smoke of a billboard romance, 
Anybody know where the pigs put my coke, oh, 
Change them plates on a powder blue Desoto.

Oh no, it ain't Johnny 3 T, 
Not till the good Lord comes to keep me.
Keep these, are you weak and weeping, 
Sweating on the floor when you come to see me.

Victims, and you're proud of no bitches, 
I hear you cluck but you duck, duck, duck, 
And now we're too deep. here's number 3, 
It's sick, I'm sick, shit is just like me.

And goes with the riff raff, 
So fuck all the feedback.

We pack it up tightly, 
We roll it up nicely, 
Rough Dickies like Nikes, 
Running beside these.

Real rockstars, 
Fuck smashing guitars, 
You learn to sink or swim, you're swimming with sharks, 
I look up in the rearview.

Johnny in the mix too, 
Scraping up the clubs in my Cadillac 6, 
I'm fresh outta 6 packs, 
Making this 8 track.

Who got a zig zag?
I'll trade you my gold plaque, 
To all the rockstars, powdered nose and glitter, 
Is it hard to be sick when you know that I'm sicker?

Who created this madman?
Who puts a matchstick in your asscrack?
Makes you lapdance on a gas can, 
So don't sit down, get down on this track man.

Shake your hips now, this shit ain't no slow jam.
No this is your last chance, to get your ass smacked with back hand, 
And take a cat nap with the sandman, 
So don't sit down, get down with the program.

Cause I'm sick, with a dick thick like a Coke can, 
So bury your romance, 
Olivia Brohen, 
Matt Berry and Conan, with barbarian gonads.

Burry opponents, Siberian slowdance, 
King of the throne with rhymes fatter than Rosanne.

I'm the only one who holds her.

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die - So you're gonna have to

(Charlie Scene)
I look inside of myself, and try to find someone else.
Someone who's willing to die, just to watch you crying for help.
I know that blood will be spilled, and if you wont - then I will.
My grave will never be filled, It's either kill or be killed.
So let heaven be told, that some may come, some may go.
Where I'll end up, I don't know.
But I ain't dying alone.
I keep on asking the question, ""Can I be saved by confession?""
You see this blood on my hands and there's no reach into heaven
I got to pick up the pieces, I got to bury them deep.
And when you look in my eyes, I'll be the last thing you see

Hurt turned into blood, and the blood keeps on pouring,
From every pour I wipe it up, Cause this just could be the moment.

Now someones gotta die, And I'm my only opponent?
'Cause I wont watch my baby cry, So I keep on just going.
Am I a man or a beast, it's mother nature at least.
Watch humanity cease, Cause it's our human disease.
You got to kill when you gotta kill,
Yeah that's what they say.
And I can't go against God's will, You better pray.

'Cause I'm an angel, a demon.
Yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven.
I'm everything you couldn't be, now you believe in the devil.
I got to pick up the pieces, I got to bury them deep...
And when the dirt hits the coffin - Just go to sleep.

We'll fall in love
And get fucked up
While the world just shrugs
With no thought logically
We're wandering the streets so aimlessly
I hate to see these kids just being put down so painlessly
And people say you dye your hair and wear tight jeans
That doesn't mean that you can't scream and like loud noise
You got a choice
You have a voice
And just because you show no love
And hate on us
You fucked our trust
Now watch me thrust this knife called lust
Into my chest until it busts

This love
This hate
It's burning me away
It's hard to face that we're
All the same

It's burning me away

You're mad at the fact that your dad is an addict
You're freind takes pills
He thinks it cures sadness
I'm not here to attack and make your kids panic
But it's just tragic the way you kids have it
Everybody sins and it all begins
It goes back around
And nobody ever wins
And you stab yourself in the back
Everybody just relax
It all just hits so close to home
We all got friends
But we stand alone
And your on your own
From a broken home
You keep the truth inside and it stays unknown
Nostalgia hits and it's time to quit
And everybody acts like it don't mean shit
And your friend would stab you just to fuck some girl
Put your hands in the air
Scream ""FUCK THE WORLD""

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be
How can I sleep at night there's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have she'd
Cause I am a lion, and you are dead

[Johnny 3 Tears]
Heres a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I don't need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words, all Ican say
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You where born a lion and a lion you will stay

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be

[Johnny 3 Tears]
Remember an army of all those little kids
Liv'in life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you'are born in the middle-end
I'd rather die then watch you givin in
I'm sorry daughter but your fathers not the same
I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I say you can hide
Beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain
After all only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once you walk away
Promise me that you'll love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all the things that these lions never gave
The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tearin out the pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be

[Johnny 3 Tears]
Hey! I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I'll ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey! I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I'll ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey!

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be"
Hollywood Undead,"Live Fast, Die Young",/h/hollywood+undead/live+fast+die+young_21557607.html,"[Verse 1: Danny]
Here in the city, where the sun beats down on the streets
My demons talking to me and they're just trying to eat
Sunset's pretty when the waves crash down on my feet
Ain't this life so sweet, cruising a hundred and three
I'm in the fast lane, I'm moving up and
It's do or die and you can catch back up and
I never slow down, just like a ghost town
James Dean, curtain call, silver screen, showdown

[Chorus: Danny]
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
Live fast, then we die young
Live fast, then we die young
We live fast, then we die young

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
I'd rather burn out than fade away, living day to day
I was born an outcast, but who are they to say
What I do is wrong? And I keep moving on
You might choke on these words, but you sing along
So if your heart stops or your hands tied
Be the rainfall, cause a landslide
And if they condescend, then something's wrong with them
I've been off, now I'm on again
I just wanna live while the feeling's there
A hundred on the highway, put the top down, feel the air, kill the snare
Life's a movie, we're the directors
We're the star, don't bother us, no time for the lectures
Many memories I wouldn't trade for the planet
Life is short, I never take it for granted
God, take me now, in the place that I'm standing
I got no regret, and that's the way that I planned it

[Chorus: Danny]
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
Live fast, then we die young
Live fast, then we die young
We live fast, then we die young

[Bridge: Danny]
It's never been in my faith to run
I was born to chase the sun
Mama always told me I was like no one
But I'll know when the time comes
It's never been in my faith to run
I was born to chase the sun
Mama knew I wouldn't be here for long
And I'll smile when the time comes

[Chorus: Danny]
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young
I know you all will remember me in pages of history
Oh no, no, maybe we were born to die young

[Post-Chorus: Danny]
Live fast, then we die young
Live fast, then we die young
We live fast, then we die young"

Wake up in the middle of insanity the other night
With some tears on my pillow
And there's blood on my knife
And my soul stained the sheets
But they're pulled off to the side
Who's blood could this be?
Is it yours or is it mine?
Take the knife and twist it
Where's my heart?
You missed it
And you know I don't wanna die
But, baby, you insisted
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have
My heart just keeps on beating
And it's more than you can stand
Baby, please just tell me how we ever went so wrong
We used to sing together when we used to sing a song
We could never sing forever
'Cause now my voice is gone
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along

I'm only evil when I need to be
But you did this so easily
I tried to treat you equally
And listen to your reasoning
But you waited here so eagerly
While plotting and deceiving me
You came behind me secretly
And shattered every piece of me
I have nothing to give, so
I give you my life
Didn't want to see me live, so
You gave me your knife
Did he hear you as you tiptoed
Coming from behind?
You took away my kid
So I guess you killed me twice
Drag me into the night
'Cause it's the one thing you keep
You knew that I had to die
So you could finally sleep
This blood all over your knife
You know, you earned yourself
And it's a matter of time
Until you burn in hell

I ain't tryna be a lover but I gotta say
That we could keep it undercover

To stay awake and unseen, or sleep in oceans of blue

They say my tongue turns black every time I breathe
Pretend I'm just a thief, I'm not allowed to preach
But you can hear my words as the bleed through the street
To wonder achieve has never been a disease
You know we can burn the earth with kerosene and a dream
The lynch of the mob and the power that beat
They see me as a threat to the sheep I'm looking for meat
I can see that light and feel the beat of the drums
I ain't finished yet I want to cry when they come

So where do we go where there's nowhere left to crawl?
And what do we do when we thought we knew it all?
New we're surrounded by a world of lonely people
Am I the last one here, or the last one left to fall?

It's a new day! A new day! 
You have loved yourself and no one else

The weight of the world falls down on me
It's all a part of my nightmare, part of my nightmare
Part of my nightmare, part of my nightmare

Sick, inside of bed, infected with the feelings
Staring up like my dreams were projected on the ceiling
I can see it, I want the money and the fame too
They told me when you get it, never let it change you
And finally I've morphed into everything I tried to be
The fucking irony is everybody's got they eye on me
Society quickly became my rivalry
Driving me off the deep end, then doubt starts to creep in
Fair-weather, they're never there, do I need friends?
We eating but will they stick around when the feast ends?
You say you love me when it's glitter and gold
But when it's bitter and cold, would you deliver my soul?
Or just cut me out the picture and roll?
Love is pain and it's taking its toll, feel like I've wasted my whole life
Always working, searching for some shit
Trying to live a life that's perfect, but perfect don't exist

Fuck it, what's a life anyway, huh?
You hear about that kid who died again today, huh?
I'd pull my fucking guts out just to make you understand
That I've become a ghost, I am a ghost, I'm not a man
Why can't I fucking say it? They'd say that I'm insane
But in a song, they'd play it 'cause they understand the pain
What the fuck is going on? Who am I?
Life is just so fucking long, I wanna...
Forgive me, don't forget me, believe you can protect me

Can't find a reason why, don't know why I even try
I pray when I sleep at night so at least I'll die a decent guy
When I look in the mirror and say hi, I can't look me in the eye
We're both ashamed of the guy on the other side
Can't find my peace and quiet, some things are better left in silence
It's me who needs some guidance, or maybe what I need is violence
When I'm having a meltdown, can't ask for help now
Got so much self-doubt that I weird myself out, can you help out?
So many selfish phobias like self-inflicted loneliness
Sometimes I get so low in this empty search for holiness
Can't seem to find a reason why, I don't know why I even try
These demons, they won't let me sleep at night, they're killing my dreams, they need me to die
But fuck it, I got nothing left to say

But I'll get drunk, get high and pull down my pants
So fuck five bucks, just fill up my cup
Don't kiss me bitch you just threw up
Now I'm drunk as fuck about to pass out,

Fuck yeah bro, that pussy was bomb!

Sing, sing like there's nobody watching
Sing, sing like there's nobody listening
Sing, sing like there's nobody listening
Sing

[Verse 1: J-Dog]
I feel like I'm sinking, I feel like I'm reaching
For something that's out of my grasp when I think I got it reality sinks in
On the dark side of the moon, just give me my space
'Cause I got a list of mistakes all written in ink I won't get to erase
If I counted my blessings, I could spend my whole life counting
'Cause truthfully nothing is too late to fix, be the Blackbird on the White Album
And if I have so much to say, then why would I pipe down then?
'Cause life's getting shorter and shorter, so sing for the moment right now then

It's like my heart's all numb
Then I grab that book and turn the pages

I dig deep inside of myself and let it all out when I conquer these demons
It gives me the freedom, I'm breaking away from these chains
I'm embracing the change and finding the courage to face all this pain
Wealth gives health while the poor die young
It is what it is, I won't hold my tongue
Dad died poor, what did that give me?
Strength inside, now the question lies
How you measure my value, I wonder
'Cause I've reached the clouds from the gutter
If it's by heart, then I'm breaking the bank
Add up what matters, now do the numbers

[Pre-Chorus: Danny]
It's times like this I feel I'm on the pavement
It's like my heart's all numb
Then I grab that book and turn the pages
To see how far I've come

Come live in my life

All the pages I write
On my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight

Hold me tonight

[Verse: Johnny 3 Tears)
Welcome to the world
And all the landing that was wasted
The blood upon your hands
And the wickedness that made it

Seem to scream it all
And the memories get faded
See the exit wound
Dear God what have we taken

I guess I'll say a prayer
And I'll kiss into the air
I'll look into the sky
Send them straight to nowhere

We all dug the grave
Can't shake away the shame
Can't quiver in the sky
But you're shaking all the same

You left us with the guns
And all of 'em were loaded
Teach us how to shoot
But you taught us how to hold them

All the weight of all the world
Is right between your shoulders
Heavy is the heart
When the world keeps growing colder

Here's a little morning glory
Breakfast of a mirror dying slow
Seems a little boring

Burn it like a flag
Walk it straight into the breeze
Cause there's two types of people
You are weak or you are me

Yeah what's another life time
Like mine
We all die a little sometimes
It's alright

Did you come to say your goodbyes
To this life
We all hard a little sometimes
We're alright

So mothers hold your children
Don't you ever let 'em go
There is weakness in your grip
And they are holding all your hope

Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let me go

And no ones there when they numb you
Fill you with terror and crush you
Pretend they care as they shove you

And we get blamed and pushed around
So whose the fucking villain now?

How could he just forsake us?

Breaks us he makes us

Lets hide by this lust
And once we are just dust
He'll know that he loved us

The mood is right, the party is on.
Looks like tonight, I'll be drinking alone

Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself.
Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else
Fuck everyone else, I'mma party by myself.
Higher than a kite, with nobody by myself

By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself

One more shot then it's time to roll
Smoke these crops and I'm out the door
Chug some rock, but I sip Patron
Hit that spot till you lose control
You died? I'll go out alone
Bitch, you must be out your dome
Fresh new kicks, I cut the floor
Ludicrous, I throw them vogues
Life of the party got the bitches laughing
Funny on-point, his joke's cracking
Grind on the wall just to get some action
Looking in the mirror like I'm Michael Jackson
'Cause this is risky, don't try to diss me
I get more pussy than a bowl of Friskies
I roll so low, can't keep up with me
You go home early like you're fucking sixty
You're coming down my highest peak
And think you're having trouble speaking
You a freak and I like freaking
Me, myself, and I've been drinking
Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer

Pick myself up in my Mitsubishi
Said ""What's up? It's nice to meet me""
Never met someone so damn freaky
Who, at the same time, is such a sweetie
So when everybody else is being such a puss
Doesn't mean you can straight get off the hook
I don't need another partner to shake my tush
I can party all night and slay some bush
So I'mma go out and do some thrashing
Show everybody what the fuck is cracking
'Cause this motherfucker can do some damage
If you don't think so, you can suck my package
'Cause I don't need no static when I feed my habits
So don't be combatant when I wreak some havoc
From this weed I'm having, where's my keys, goddamnit?
I should be on half of me and three's on taxing
On my knees, I'm blacking out, I need some action
Like a peon tapping from this seed I'm packaging
Your knees are shagging, let me see what happens
When your cheeks are clapping, Charles P. Is rapping

Blowing up my cell but I don't think I'mma answer

With the sun in the sky, but night's coming soon
And I walk to the mirror just to fix myself
Yeah, life gets harder when you love nothing else
So I pick my pills from the counter drawer
Pick my self esteem up off the fuckin' floor
I guess I'm a man of no recourse
As I cracked another bottle, got no remorse
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me
I swear I used to be what I truly believe
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
That even I can go to heaven if I part the sea

But at the bottom you can't swim, 'cause you drank up the sea

They don't ask any questions, they ask us ""Why?""
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say
Our knees are getting tired, too tired to pray
That's when we laid down, end of the road

Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea

One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home
Truth is that I don't really have a place to go
So pour me, pour me, pour me another

Time just seems to go, on and on
On and on, and on and on
Life inside a bottle all alone
All alone, the bottle's gone

J3t:
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea

Danny:
What's left inside a bottle if it's gone?

J3t:
One more song and I'm finally free
I'll meet you here in heaven, between the sea
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea
So...

Pour me, pour me, pour me another
It holds me, holds me, like no other

And till the day it stop I'm gonna motherfucking persecute

I'm not alone, I got the devil, and he's coming too
Coming through to straight motherfucking bury you
Someone's gotta die, and I'm fucking bulletproof
Let me tell you a story, it's about a little kid
Who never really understood much of anything he did
He had a chest full of heart in a body full of scars
In a broke down palace on a broken boulevard
And he was faithless, but he lived through all the hurt
'Cause every time he did he knew he got what he deserved
Had to hold on to the fire even if he had to burn
Maybe pain became the only way that he could ever learn

Everything then came apart so one day he could make this

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
Feel the fire, the heat, the pyre
The angel you know is the devil admired
Everything ends like a voice in the choir
Telling the truth to you motherfucking liars
It's the comedown, I know I gotta hold out
Can't fucking fold now, the mirror says I sold out
God had a vision and that vision is me
And I hold that in my heart every second that I breathe
So, Holy Ghost, hold me, please
I don't need these evil things
What are these songs that I'll leave?
I see this image when I dream
So I'll live it 'cause it's the only motherfucking thing I got
'Cause I'm motherfucking Three and you're motherfucking not
I got a motherfucking gun and the motherfucker's cocked
And I'll put it to my head until a motherfucker drops

[Pre-Chorus: Johnny 3 Tears]
So thankless, but he knew that he could take this
Everything then came apart so one day he could make this
A song for the nameless that's ageless
Hold onto my hand, I'll show you scripture in these pages
They're bulletproof

[Chorus: Danny & Johnny 3 Tears]
Hold on, hold tight, it's not your turn to die yet
So long, goodnight, there's not always tomorrow
Hold on, hold tight, it's not your turn to die yet
So long, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Now it's your turn to die
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt
Johnny 3 is gonna put you in the dirt

[Outro: Johnny 3 Tears]
Most men lead lives in quiet desperation
Eventually, that desperation has to end
But first, head back to the crucible
Resistance will come to pass
Now it's your turn to die
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Now it's your turn to die
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Put you in the dirt, p-p-put you in the dirt
Now it's your turn to die"

Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I don’t mind, that I don’t mind, no I don’t mind the rain
Like a widow’s heart, we fall apart and never fade away (fade away)
(Johnny 3 Tears)
Run like a child do you know where I came from?
No I don’t, but I’m singing all the same songs
I’m alone, and you’re looking for your anyone
Does it hurt just to know that it’s all gone?
I can feel the pain in the words that you say
Hidden in the letters that were written to no name
Let me be the hands that you hold to your face
Cause’ I’d give it all up if I could take it away
Buried in red, white, and a side of some blue
Some will die too late, and somebody too soon
If he could come back, we’ll see what it cost him
We had to lose it all, just to know that we lost one
Hi, I’m just a shape in the shadow of grates
Hi, I’m just a voice in the choir of saints
Oh all the souls that nobody could save
And just like a light, we faded away

Fade away, as I fade away, away, away
(Charlie Scene)
If I could take it all back
Before the flags were forces to wave at half mast
That was long before my heart became black
There’s no way to make it change or go black
You know that some of us grow old, with no homes
Some of us die in a cold house, with no hope
Still surrounded by the people you don’t know, so don’t go
Cause it’s over the time fades your photo
How many goodbyes can fit in a lifetime?
How many good lies can make it seem alright?
What do you see when you look into my eyes?
Or in the sky right before you say goodnight?
I could be the son that stands beside of your bed
And I could be the voice right inside of your head
I could say goodbye and you know where I went
I just wrote a letter that’ll never be sent

(Charlie Scene & Danny)
I don’t mind, no I don’t mind, I don’t mind the rain
Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I don’t mind, that I don’t mind, no I don’t mind the rain

Fade away, as I fade away, away, away

When the end is getting closer
And the earth has burned the sky
Now repent 'cause it's all over
Just let me die

(Johnny 3 Tears)
Here's the massacre
A mausoleum fit for me
Lived a hundred years,
A hundred years I didn't see
Gave all my hope away
Isn't any left for me?
Bombs are splitting atoms
What can the future bring?

We can fill a million choirs
And wait till children sing
We can walk a million miles
And end up in the sea
And our lungs just keep filling
And lying when we breathe
The world's filled with liars
Liars like me

And I look at my child
It's finite, this feeling
Eyes blue like the sky
I see all of this meaning
I reach up to God and ask if I'm dreaming
So sorry I don't have those things that you're needing
And darling, a kiss
Kiss me I'm leaving

(Danny)
When the end is getting closer
And the earth has burned the sky
Now repent 'cause it's all over
Just let me die

As my body lies here broken
And I'm carried to the light
Now my heart is finally open
Just let me die

(Johnny 3 Tears)
Everybody says greetings and goodbyes
Everybody pays, no one knows the price
We know the price of sin
The sin of sacrifice
I know I'll sin again
But who can save me twice?

How much can we ask?
You'll get the answer first
How much can we kneel?
With the air that chills the earth?
The air keeps getting colder
My knees keep hitting dirt
The innocent can cry
Without the guilty getting hurt

You ask who you love and you don't know
Do you?
The spirit of god, just passes right through you
You gave away heaven, handed right to you
And I could see it all
Tell me, is it true?
Kiss me, my darling
(Darling, I need you)

Where do we go?
We go, oh
Lord, I don't know
Where we go
We go, no

Where do we go?

Ain't no way you can break me down
No one sings, no escaping now

Take me home where the restless go
Reckless to the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul

Take me home where the restless go
Reckless till the day I rest my bones
There's no use trying to save my soul
There's no use trying to save my soul
Whoa oh oh (There's no use trying to save my soul)

Cus I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

[J3t]
I fuckin' swear that I care
But it's hard when you stare
Into the bottom of a bottle
That is empty and bare
All my desolate soul
In my desolate home
It's my desolate role
Yeah I'm here all alone
I can't think of a reason
To get the fuck out of bed
Curtains closed, lights are off
Am I alive or dead?
I haven't shaved in a week
I always slur when I speak
Tolerance at it's peak
Another fit just to sleep
Oh woe is me woe is me
I guess I need love
Hoes ya see hoes ya see
I'm just in a rut
And I swear I'm tryin baby please
Baby don't leave
God-damn I'm a fuck-up
But I guess that's just me
So I sit in my room
And I'll cry in my bed
Thinkin about all the shit
That made me wrong in my head
I keep tryin to climb
But it seems so steep
Pour myself a fuckin' whiskey
And go back to sleep... Bitch

[Chorus x2]

I watch my momma cry
She says 'baby why? '
I say 'baby died,
Baby's gone like a suicide'
I don't think you'll
See him soon, mom
Stay out my room, mom
Tell daddy that I hate
That mother fucker like you, mom
I sing this shit for
You, Danny, Sasha and Jordan
These beers keep gettin warmer
Every time that I hold 'em
I pour this all for you
Like a partner in crime
It's part of the times
When you're sick in the mind
Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick
I'm so sick of this shit
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit
I'm so fucked up off it
So I stumble around
Til I stumble fall down
To this puddle of my tears
Layin here on the ground

When you've got nothing left
You've got nothing left to lose
With my last left single breath
I'll still be singing to you
So when you bury me man
You better bury me deep
And sing along to this song
Because you're broken like me.

[Chorus x2]

And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong
I was wrong all along

Yo, Yo Yo I'm a gangster
Where my dogs at?
Bark with me if you're my dog
Yo, Yo Yo, I'm going
(Naww I don't wanna bark)
I'm going to give a shoutout to all the playa-haters
(We don't like playa-haters)
If you're a playa-hater don't playa-hate on me
I'm a gangster, I'm a straight up
Grr, I'm steaming mad. Grr.

I'm a gangster, I'm a straight up ""G""
The gangster life is the life for me
Shooting people by day, selling drugs by night
Being a gangster is Hell-up tight

I walk around town with a stark erection
Then gave your mom a yeast infection
I saw the policeman and I punched him in the eye
""To serve and protect"": What a lie

I also don't like white people, you shouldn't too
And don't get me started about the Jews

I'm a gangster
Grr I'm mad
I'm a gangster
My rhymes are bad
I'm a gangster
Iced out like a freezer
I'm a gangster
I don't listen to weezer

I dropped out of school at the age of three (why?)
'Cuz all the teachers tried to playa-hate on me (oh.)
My rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine
My rhymes are hot, like a Burning Flame

Sisco is my homie he's a gangster too
Me and Sisco are the leaders of the gangster crew
I like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance
Some say we're the perfect match

[Interrupted by another voice]
Step off, Step back, Step Away!
Step back, Don't step forward step back
Don't step forwards step backwards
Don't step to me, Do not step to me-eee

[First voice raps again]
I'm giving a shout-out to my homies in cell block 8
Being in jail sucks cuz you always have to masterbate
Except when a Jewish person goes to jail all my homies cheer
They will make mince-meat out of his rear

Ben Petty helped me make the gangster beat to this song
I shot him in the face cuz he looked at me wrong

I'm a gangster
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
I'm a gangster
Bitch suck on my weiner
I'm a gangster
I drive a cool car
I'm a gangster
I smoke weed in a cigar

Yo! My gangster flow
Yo! Yo Yo Yo

I'm rolling on dubs iced out like hockey
Got kicked out of Japan for drinking all the sake
Fuck a bitch, gimmie head ho
What's up to my dogs, yo yo yo

They play this song on the radio all day long
So everyone can hear my gangster song
Nobody thought I'd blow up like a Firestone tire...
Oh there's no beat left.

Die. Die you Santa Claus, die.
No, I don't wanna do acappela.

I like to slap snitches. Because that's how it goes."

In a time of need,
Only few can see what's wrong,
Millions tend to crawl,
But only those who choose,
Can make it through this all,
Only few can sing like lions,
'Cause we sing until we're gone,
And we've got each others backs,
Until we're back where we belong,
A woman held my shield,
And through the battles we did wrong,
A man who taught me wisdom through the static we recall,
And maybe when we're gone,
Our names will echo through the stars,
Every start's got it's ending,
Even when we've learned to rise above it all,

{Chorus}
These lies are leading me astray it's too much for me to stay,
I don't wanna live this destiny it goes on endlessly,
I see you so please stay strong,
I'll sing you one last song and then I'm gone,
I don't wanna live this destiny it goes on endlessly,

And we once also had a story too,
You can see that good men only come in few,
Even in our greatest moments, we may win or we may lose,
Every song's got it's rules,
You've got to learn to make it through.
Maybe one day we can choose how it feels to be a woman or a man,
Without rules but burried underneath there's a picture glued,
So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth,
Let these words strengthen all your views,
Because these words were meant for you,

These lies are leading me astray it's too much for me to stay,

An' now I'm floatin' right above my coffin, as it closes I look down,
I see sigh as she's cryin on my momma's shoulder,
I look up into the sky,
As the gates to heaven open somethin's wrong,
Is this destiny or am I goin' home,
What will happen to my soul,
Will I come back I don't know,
Will you meet me when it's over let me know,
You can meet me here in heaven,
Don't you ever let me go,

This love this hate is burning me away.

These lies are leading me astray it's too much for me to stay,

These lies are leading me astray it's too much for me to stay,

It's Charlie Scene, let me drink from your flask,
Put on my mask and fuck you in the ass
Hey Charlie, how many girls you takin' home tonight?
My dicks sinned so much it should be crucified like Jesus Christ
Beep Beep hey, you girls need a ride? Get inside!
I pull out my skin sword on the dance floor
Rub it on your butt cheeks and watch it transform
You better put out, don't make me hate you...
Or I'll do the Michael Jackson and I'mo rape you!

[Chorus:]

Hey what is that? Is that a guy or a girl?
Hey faggot!
Jeffree Star:
Shut the fuck up, you want me...
Bitches get mad that I swallow more c** than they can
Wanna give me a hand? Cuz I'll deep throat your dad
Then he'll c** on my face... Before I go on Myspace
An every guy wants my lipstick smeared on his nutsac
Let's play Barbie and shove Ken's dick in my ass...
Or you can be are. Kelly an pee on me
Just don't get it on my plastic surgery
And then I'll beat you like I did that bitch Stevie
You think that's funny?
Watch me eat Forbidden's fat pussy...

[Chorus:]

Jeffree Star ad libs over chorus:
Fucking c***... Lick my pussy... Fucking c***... Eat me out bitch!
Lick my pussy... Sit on my face daddy... Faggot!"

Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are

I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate
Motherfuckers, don't know what, you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfuckin' drunk

You make me wanna run around, pullin' my guns out and shit
Your temptin' me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge

What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I played a million empty shows to only family and friends

What kind of person can this a band that deserves to get big?

Woke up one morning on the sunset strip
With the half smoked blunt and some blood on my lip
Hit up the brain for that Mary Jane
Man, all she had left was menajetwa
Rolled in the Pink I picked up some Cuervo
Walking sideways and I'm starting to swerv-o
Last night was wild put my money a jumbos
Wine and dine, tig ol' bitties and bimbos
Hollywood rap pack, cans in my back pack
Cruse through your valley and I'm snatchin' your snapback
Huffin' on some paint and I think that I'm half black
Roll another blunt and fuck it up over this track

Look into the windows, packing up the pistols

You can come west but you will never be west coast
Dopin' on these motherfuckers deep in the Desoto
Oh no, tell me whatcha wanna be
You can be anything but not another 3

This life I can't get back from

I'm knocking at your door

They were beating in the dark
We are we are
We are built from broken parts

If you can lose it all
Welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams
And your name on the marque
And I can hold it up
But I hold it up hardly
It’s harder here in hell,
But it’s getting real hard see
So all you sick, and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you’re walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath you’re breathing when I breathe
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I’m married to the devil in the city of angels
So come all you wicked to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so baby don’t tempt me
I’m knocking on our door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checking all you bitches like I’m checking this check sheet
So put your hats on, Lohner don’t get soft
You can see God, when I take my mask off

You love it no questions,
Beating down the door is the face of rejection
And once again, it’s a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
Cause stories aren’t told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn’t think he can die
So grab a Wick and an axe, cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack,
We die inside, so when you look in his eyes
What you see now? Murder the monster you’ve made
And watch him bleed out
We’re in a life where it’s kill or lose
Just lie motherfu*cker till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry motherfu*cker yeah, I’m talking to you

We are made from broken parts

Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes see the world, that you gave us

Pull the trigger, let it go
The game is done, set in the closer
You can't sink down any lower
We couldn't get any colder
With these devils on our shoulders
There's someone popping shots, now someone called the cops
And when the dust settles, you know we gon' be on top
Smoking till I'm under six feet on the dock
Welcome to the jungle, we got beef on the block

Take it up, we wear the mantel, raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark, in the rain you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home
But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart

So we
March to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb

Fuck it, fuck every single memory
I have done wrong, but who's the real enemy?
You better figure out not a single thing is meant to be
The only thing that matter's how you live before you're put to sleep
That's how you're living if you're living just to breathe
I never waste a sentence, better listen when I speak
Or you're gonna know the truth when they put you underneath
And no one's gonna listen when you're six feet deep
I keep my heart tucked in my chest
I hide it underneath with a bulletproof vest
Who's next? I, no, I never gave a fuck
I was too busy dying, too busy giving up

Yeah, trust me, just breathe
One day you're gonna see
Yeah, trust me, just breathe
Otherwise, you're living on your knees

Every day I feel like I wanna forget
And everywhere I go, I see the angel of Death
To the left, I see what's right, b-but I hold it in the wrong hand
It's a fight, I see my life given no chance
It's hard to wake up, but I wanna believe
That I'm not alone with a broken dream
All the glitter ain't gold, don't be naive
Leave it all behind and just follow me

Today I finally felt like I wasn't in a dream
This ain't who I am inside or how it's supposed to be
My mind is on an endless road, and I've been losing sleep
And as the road is crumbling, these demons start to creep
I can't hold back, you couldn't stop me if you tried
You should know that, and when the fire burns inside
You can't hold back to anything that never dies
You should know that you can't hold back

And the winters moon with frosted rings.
Smell of bacon as I fasten up my laces
And the song the milkman sings

So I mustn't forget

And a swallow curving in the sky
Shoes so comfy though they're worn out and they're battered
And the taste of apple pie.

And a win for my home team.

The wind is gonna be scary, 
Scary this Halloween.
It'll sound just like a thousand ghosts and goblins
When they scream.

You can hear it howling, 
Shrieking in the sky.
It'll make your mamma hide her head
And make your daddy cry.

And it starts down low.
Gets a little higher.
Gets a little higher.
Gets really high.
Goes back low.
Gets a little bit higher.
Gets a little higher.
Gets really high.

The wind will make you nervous,... 

And it starts down low.
Gets a little higher.
Gets a little higher.
Gets really high.
Goes back low.
Gets a little bit higher.

Halloween night, 
Moon shining bright.
You'll see such an amazing sight.
All of the wolves gather 'round.
They make a very sad and lonely sound.

Sadder than the wind through the trees, 
It puts a lot of little goose bumps on me.
When the wolves sing their song, 
They want you to sing along and... 

Howl at the moon.
Howl at the moon.
Howl at the moon.
Howl at the moon.

They come from miles and miles away... 
Howl at the moon.
Howl at the moon.

Os crazy estão na prison
Outros estão na droga, outros estão na bebida

Nigga não há hipótese, não há esquiva
Todo o homem um dia tera que enfrentar essa bitch chamada vida
Ou morres um bitch ass nigga
É nigga se der deu, se não der não deu
Come on nigga, come on
Sai do escuro e vem buscar o que é teu

[Verse 1]
Todo o homem tem um dark side
E o dark side é roubar a sua life
E a sua life toda a vida será um fight
E esse fight só termina quando ele cai e não se levanta mais
Niggas ainda não se aperceberam do tempo que perderam
A viver a vida de G's que já morreram
Mas quem vive a vida dos outros não cresce
E vive para sempre numa creche, yes
Rodeado de putos que só fazem porcaria
Borram e espigam a folha noite e dia
Uns pela fama, outros por adrenalina
Outros simplesmente p'a comer nigga
E vem a cana, vem a prisa, é a sina de quem anda na má vida
Assume a tua divida e um dia sais
Não culpes os teus amigos nem os teus pais

Trazem sonhos medonhos de madrugada
Ás vezes levam te aos lugares onde tu andavas
Tu sabes quando acordares que ainda 'tás na ala
Brother, ás vezes eu sinto que alguns digras, meus niggas
Não passam de crianças que se escondem na prison
Cagam na família, é foda ser um pai
É mais fácil viver a thug life (thug life)
E os bebés ficam com a mãe
Que procuram um futuro junto de alguém
E de homem para homem todos eles comem todos eles somem
Porque nenhum homem quer criar filho de outro homem
As crianças crescem como podem
Largadas num mundo sem lei nem ordem
Por fim é o mundo que se torna seu pai
E elas dão a mão ao mundo e não as vês mais
Só Deus sabe onde vai
Esse puto criado na thug life

Só tu sabes onde vais
Só tu sabes onde vais
Só tu sabes onde vais
Mas não mintas mais
Só tu sabes onde vais

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""

REPEAT CHORUS

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

And my monster mash is the hit of the land

Quem dera te conhecer baby mas estou com pressa
Há uma velha vestida de noiva à minha espera
Quando eu me casar com ela não chores não
Ouve a minha voz a rimar no Rio Trancão
E dorme my love enquanto eu canto o nosso som
Sonha connosco e como seria bom
Mas p'ra nós é tarde o nosso tempo acabou
Eu não te posso levar eu não sei onde vou
O meu barco furou, I go with the flow
Eu amei-te miúda como ninguém te amou
No love para ti thug
Grita e morre dog ninguém te ouve

A minha vida é uma roleta de 5 balas no tambor
Sou eu a ovelha negra de um rebanho sem pastor
Satan desviou-nos do caminho do Senhor
Nós somos renegados filhos rebeldes, bastardos
Fardos pesados de casamentos falhados
Não olhes pra mim mamã eu não sou culpado

Pede a Jesus que me livre das drugs and my enemies

Diz-se do passado que está moribundo
Bebe-se o alento num copo sem fundo

Olha-se para dentro e já pouco sobeja
Pede-se o descanso por curto que seja
Apagam-se duvidas num mar de cerveja
Em fim de uma escolha, faz-se um desafio
Enfrenta-se a vida de fio a pavio
Navega-se sem mar, sem vela ou navio
Bebe-se a coragem até de um copo vazio

Hey hey, what can I say, 
Gotta catch 'em before they're gone.

I told the witch doctor you didn't love me true
I told the witch doctor you didn't love me nice
And then the witch doctor, he game me this advice
He said to...

[Chorus:]

Now, you've been keeping love from me
Just like you were a miser
And I'll admit I wasn't very smart
So I went out and found myself
A guy that's so much wiser
And he taught me the way to win your heart

My friend the witch doctor, he taught me what to say
My friend the witch doctor, he taught me what to do
I know that you'll be mine when I say this to you
Oh, Baby...

[Chorus:]"

Dead leaves, seaweed, rotten eggs, too.
Stir them in my witches' brew.

Stir them in my witches' brew.

They want to burn the witch who's inside us
Well you, you don't fuck with the fabulous four
Or you spend the rest of your life
Picking things up off the floor
She's still alive but I am sure
That all the stars belong to her
On California king-sized beds
She's wrapped in rags inside my head
This is the story, this is the story of someone who's wild
Big black rules, pearl, life

Oh, baby dry your dirty eyes
My water breaks like turpentine
The pee girl burns to be a bride
Your ever lovely suicide

Are they coming soon

Where mute memories start talking

And the pretty thing he made desert you
I'm going out now like a baby
A naпve unsatisfiable baby
Grabbing onto whatever's around
For the soaring high or the crushing down
With hidden cracks that don't show
But that constantly just grow
I'm looking for the man that attacked me
While everybody was laughing at me
You beat it in me that part of you
But I'm gonna split us back in two
Tired of living in a cloud
If you're gonna say shit now you'll do it out loud
It's 2: 45 in the morning
And I'm putting myself on warning
For waking up in an unknown place
With a recollection you've half erased
Looking for somebody's arms to
Wave away past harms
I'm walking out on center circle
The both of you can just fade to black

Been pushed away and i'll never go back"

Can you tell me who I am?
I always wanted to die
But you kept me here alive
Can you tell me who I am?

Conducting this symphony
That you have gifted to me
But I can’t ever sleep

Don’t be mad
But I get weak inside
And I start to fall apart
'Cause I feel nothing

I never wanted to be
Some kind of comic relief
Please show me who I am
I've been tortured and scorned
Since the day that I was born
But I don't know who I am

And I thank you man for everything
Sorry I'm so frightened about all of it
But I wish I could give you more
And all the lights are shining down on me
And I feel intimidated by it all

I never wanted to be
The person you see
But thank you

Oh, God please tell me now
Are you disappointed, are you proud?
Haven’t I done everything, everything

I’m so sorry I’m so weak
And I’ve turned into a freak
But I don’t know anything, anything

I’ve lost all self-esteem
By burying everything
And I feel nothing, nothing

I want to see you stretched out on the floor
The world broken doll
The world's shattered whore
And you you can't walk
But you you can crawl
Come on infect us all...

Asphyxiate all your pain away
Don't try to win it will only end in disgrace
Translucetize the cold light of day

They run to the pines
It's black in here blot out the sun

Our misery runs wild and free

With the bedsheets in her cell
Threw myself on the fires for you
10 good reasons to stay alive
10 good reasons that I can't find

Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
Oh give me one reason to be beautiful
Oh and everything I am

Love hates you
I live my life in ruins for you
And for all your secrets kept
I squashed the blossom and the blossom's dead

Oh give me reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
Oh and I will make myself so beautiful
Oh and everything I am

Miles and miles of perfect skin
I swear I do, I fit right in
My love burns through everything
I cannot breathe
Miles and miles of perfect skin
I swear, I said, I fit right in
I fit right in your perfect skin
I cannot breathe

Hey, baby, take it all the way... Down
Hey baby taste me anyway
Oh you were born
So pretty oh summerbabe
We'll never know
And fading like a rose....

Give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
I'll give you my body just sell me your soul
Oh and everything I am will be bought and sold
Oh and everything I am will turn hard and cold

And they say in the end
You'll get bitter just like them
And they steal you heart away
When the fire goes out you better learn to fake
It's better to rise the fade away

Hey you were right
Named a star for your eyes
Did you freeze did you weep
Turn to gold baby, sleep

Hey honey mine
I was there all the time
And I weep at your feet
And it rains and rains"

You've washed your face so you can smile
You've got your pockets full of lending cash
Your ticket to the ladies mile
You brush away a flake of zinc
Advance toward the street outside
You close your mind so you can't think
The hide, the ride, the tide

But the scenes come rushing in
Like eels into your net
And it's just like joseph said
Another walk you can't forget
But you push into the bleak
Where all the women walk in fear
Another three-word phrase
The near, the clear, the dear

You're a lonely little girl
Who just wants to please her dad
So you thought you'd be a nurse
Just like your mother had
But you make the patients worse
And the doctors know you're bad
(better get back to the oracle)

The oracle in this case
Is a message on your phone
It says where you go
Gravity has gone
You know this is true
But you want to speak of love
Prediction and ambiguity
Go hand in glove

The oracle in this case
Is a face on your wall
It says where you go
People will fall

And near this place
There is a space
A subject contemplating
And in the town
The sun goes down
No-one investigating"

Are taken from their homes and

But I find I'm still resented
Someone wants my job
It is someone in this building
Someone's spreading rumours
And I don't feel I can stay here
I think I'm going north
And now's the time to leave

Are good to strangers

And try to settle in

Carelessly once more to rule without remorse
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun
Egomaniac
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?
Egomaniac yes you could confide
But they'd never understand the comfort you provide
The splendor you have planned
Something strange is happening to you
You're on your own, can you hear them talking?
Trust is an unknown, are they breaking through
When you're the best who needs the rest
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun
Egomaniac
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?
Egomaniac
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun ego may
Weary to your bones with ease you domineer
No challenge left to rise to
No foeman left to fear
In your mind you feel them breaking through
You hardly feel the silence, all the puppet chatter gone
Who cares that no one follows
So long as you lead on
Could there be another point of view
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun
Egomaniac
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?
Egomaniac
Dazzling like a diamond
Dazzling like a diamond"

I never wanted to be human size

I'm going to start the growing up
I'm going to grow now and never stop
Think like a mountain, grow to the top

Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow

With concentration
My size increased
And now I'm fourteen stories high
At least!!

Just a bored kid
I'll go to Egypt to be
A pyramid

But her eyes were still so clear
He drank his coffee and he hurried out
Across before she walked away
Then he approached her like a little child
Too scared for what he had to say

""Hello, Louise
Remember me?
Now should we part
Or stay awhile?
As if we were still lovers""

She took a moment just to recognise
The man she'd known so well before
And as he started to apologise
Lose any bitterness she bore
She gently put her finger on his lips
To let him know she understood
And with her suitcase standing on the floor
Embraced him like a lover would

He told Louise
""You look so good
It's just you see
You make me feel
As if we were still lovers""

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real, that you never found again

And though they talked for just a little time
Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign
That told him all he had to know

And so Louise
Waved from the bus
And as she left
She gave that smile
As if they were still lovers"

I've lain alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is philomena talking
I want to tell you
What I've found to be true

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I believe, I believe what the old man said
Though I know that there's no lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love
And I say

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking - I'm just checking

I want to run away and hide,

I'm tethered to a trainee hellcat,
I'm feeling jealous of the doormat,

All the time that I was waiting
When would I rise
From the years that I'd been hating
For the first time
Living seemed to mean so much to me
Like the day time
Shining from the night that used to be
Just when it seemed like
My chances all had gone
I found a reason
To fight to carry on
Look back in anger
Look back in fun
But take what you want
Love on the run
Life hates a loser
Look what you've done
Hold up your head
Love on the run
So the page turned
Someone there to read my history
Understanding
Always wants to see the best in me
For the future
Looking just a little like a dream
Warm and hazy
Living everyday but more extreme
Just when it seemed like
My chances all had gone
I found a reason
To fight to carry on
Look what you've done
Look back in anger
Look back in fun
Write your own story
Love on the run
Life hates a loser
Look what you've done
Revel in glory
Love on the run
Look back in anger
Look back in fun
But take what you want
Love on the run
Life hates a loser
Look what you've done
Hold up your head
Love on the run
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Love on the run
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Look back in anger
Look back in fun

Running round the garden in your mother's shoes
Playing with your sisters
I didn't see you were a grown up girl
And bringing me tea
But is it life in a grown up world
On a cold autumn day
Is it life, someone's wife
When the car had broken down
The best of my girls
I didn't see you were a grown up girl
Oh how I hate the celebration
But you give it all away leaving me on my own
But is it life in a grown up world
I can't wait for the end of the celebration
Is it life, someone's wife

I'm pounding at the gates of hell / Impatient for the journey in / I'll face
The fury at your side / So let the tragedy begin / From the moment that you
Held me / I'd forgotten wrong and right / From the second that you touched me /
Was a creature of the night / Made a folly out of caution / Made all virtue
Seem bizarre / Through a mirror of distortion / Watching coldy from afar / Oh,
Shameless, oh / For the touch of your hand / Oh, shameless, oh / Let them
Misunderstand / Just the touch of your hand / Oh, shameless, oh / And they
Misunderstan"
Human League,So Hurt,/h/human+league/so+hurt_20066379.html,"(Burden/Oakey)
It's hard I know to understand
Nothing lasts for ever
The things you used to say and do
The places you would go to meet
When you were together
You set your face against the tide
The harsh words that were spoken
But after all the anger
The shouting and the tears
You found your heart was broken
Fight the tears
Fight the fever
Don't give in
Soul deceiver
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died
Just like the clock went back ten years
To make a new beginning
To work out how to live your life
To take the board and play the game
And recognise you're winning
Your memories mean nothing now
You're just a little older
Moving forward with the crowd
Silent fears but laughing loud
Not wiser but just bolder
Fight the tears
Fight the fever
Fight the hurt
Don't give up
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died
So hurt
With the pain you can't hide
So lost
And lonely inside
So hurt
When the feeling has died

Human League,Soundtrack To A Generation,/h/human+league/soundtrack+to+a+generation_20066411.html,"The smell of trees. can only be that way. on a sunny day.
Floating through the open window. to the cool inside.
Where we lay side by side. how can anything we feel. ever
Mean so much. as a summer love? how can anything we
Need. ever get in touch. with the meaning of.

A whole life waiting? wishing suddenly. that it's going to be
The real thing. or separating. try your luck again. it's just
Part of the adventure.

Holy cow. you do it to me now. ""the soundtrack to a
Generation"". oh, wow. you're getting to me now. ""the
Soundtrack to a generation"".

Another tune. before the light has gone. and we'll be on
Our way. the sounds and smells. will always linger on.
They're in my heart today.

We feel so lucky then. the world's a massive place. but we
Run into each other. just one small happening. an accident
Of fate. or the work of co-conspirators? but if we knew.
What could it do. to help us now?

Holy cow. you do it to me now. ""the soundtrack to a
Generation"". anyhow. just give it to me now. ""the
Soundtrack to a generation"". oh wow. you really got me
Now. ""the soundtrack to a generation"". holy cow. you're
Getting to me now. ""the soundtrack to a generation"".

Years have gone on in between. but all I knew at
Seventeen. is all I know now now. through times of joy and
Suffering. the music flavours everything. that's all I know
Now.

Holy cow. you do it to me now. ""the soundtrack to a
Generation"". oh wow. you really got me now. ""the
Soundtrack to a generation"". anyhow just give it to me
Now. ""the soundtrack to a generation"".

Just give it. you're getting. you do it you really got me now.

You're getting. you do it.

Re-sounding like a rhyme
How paths may cross against the odds
To wreck the plans you made
Among the crowd a face that smiles
To melt your masquerade

Says the stranger deep inside
And lets you know that when you were
So sure you really lied
If only I could see you
Says the voice within your brain
And quietly, insistently
It says it once again
And then, I really need to know

It wouldn't seem so lonely

Human League,The Black Hit Of Space,/h/human+league/the+black+hit+of+space_20066425.html,"Been out all night, I needed a bite, I thought I'd put a record on
I reached for the one with the ultra-modern label, and wondered where the light had gone
It had a futuristic cover, lifted straight from Buck Rogers
The record was so black it had to be a con
The autochanger switched as I filled my sandwich
And futuristic sounds warbled off and on

The black hit of space
It's the one without a face
It's the one that doesn't fit
You can only see the flip
The black hit of space
Sucking in the human race
How can it stay at the top
When it's swallowed all the shops

As the song climbed the charts, the others disappeared
Til there was nothing but it left to buy
It got to number one, then into minus figures
Though nobody could understand why

The black hit of space
It's the one without a face
It's the one that doesn't fit
You can only see the flip
The black hit of space
Sucking in the human race
How can it stay at the top
When it's swallowed all the shops

I couldn't stand this bland sound any more so I walked towards my deck to turn it off
All I could see was the B-side of the disc which had assumed a doughnut shape with the label on the outside rim
I reached for the arm which was less than one micron long but weighed more than Saturn and time stood still
I knew I had to escape but every time I tried to flee, the record was in front of me

The black hit of space
Get James Burke on the case
It's the hit that's never gone
Time stops when you put it...[on]"

The life was cheap on bread and wine
And sharing meant no shame

Of rockets flying from nearby
And scared she clings onto her dreams
To beat the fear that she might die

And who will have won
When the soldiers have gone
From the Lebanon

Before he leaves the camp he stops
He scans the world outside
And where there used to be some shops
Is where the snipers sometimes hide
He left his home the week before
He thought he'd be like the police
But now he finds he is at war
Weren't we supposed to keep the peace

Heard in every town
All of the people, one simple plea
What will happen now?
Asked in concern for their destiny
Got to know somehow
They say
They say
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine

So if you want to know what's going on
Going round and round
You'd better ask before your world is gone
Gone without a sound

By glow of night, by light of day
Just read the signs

Reminding us of home not far behind
Careering through the path of least resistance

From the upside to the down

Surprised the damned, by mouth of toad
A shop where you cannot reload

The way to Hyde, the sixty-two or six two eight
Will do if you cannot be late
Sometimes the only choice to make
In wintertime

We gaze upon the face of the Apollo
We know that we approach our journey's end
And still we will be home before tomorrow
But we will rise before we must descend

We'll always be together
Together in Electric Dreams

Because the friendship that you gave
Has taught me to be brave
No matter where I go I'll never find a better prize
(Find a better prize)
Though you're miles and miles away
I see you every day I don't have to try
I just close my eyes, I close my eyes

We'll always be together
However far it seems
(Love never ends)
We'll always be together
Together in Electric Dreams"

Can you see it in the night sky?

When I was a child
We were living in fear

Just a light year from here
Living in fear

Years don't matter
Words came back to haunt you
Friends past missing
Reminiscing
Words came back to haunt you
Tolerating propaganda
And your girlfriend, Alexandra
With her secret memoranda
Signs
For an interview
Searching for the light
In the world of the blahs
Masquerading as stars
How can this be right?
You've been going too far
Leaving conscience ajar
Worlds may shatter

A long, long time ago
Before staff levels dropped
They used to listen to the radio
And listen to the dj's talk
About the songs they didn't know
As if it really mattered

Hit-pick or phone-in show
I don't want you to go tonight
Ten thousand watts of power
News headlines on the hour tonight
Our music beats the best
You just don't need the rest tonight
Once I couldn't care at all
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight

And 20 years ago
No-one seemed to care
The people must have known
The dj's role was only there
To fill in space between the songs
That talk of love and other things
As if they didn't matter

Automatic stations came
And sent them all away
And now I'm left alone
I haven't got a word to say
And you're the one who makes the choice
To turn me on or turn me off
But now it really matters

She said they call me sky

Said she is in danger maybe a stranger
Might know a place near by
And she talked and she smoked little more than a job
All the cares of my life went away on that day
In that room coming out of the gloom
And the gift that she gave follow me to the grave from on
Life goes on
Now you gone
Life goes on after sky X2
So much can change without a sign
A twist of faight 2 worlds aligh
The words get spoken all worlds were broken
The wind began to sign
The heat of daybreak the precious keepsake
Too soon the last goodbye
And the death in her eyes come enraged of the skies
For the day of my birth was the last day on earth
Like a boat in the night gets a moment of light
I could see what I've done what must be from now on

Don't cry the fight ain't over
Unless you let it pass you by

Looking for a friend to borrow.

So I might find a heart to follow.

I've never been this
Longing for your lovin'
I've never been so
Wearin' down to nothin'
I've never been just
Looking for a reason.
So maybe you've been thinkin'
Of me.
Oh...
You've been thinking of me.

All that I have found in reason,
Is reason just to not believe.
And all that you are left is treason.
Is treason just to let I be.

Blue yonder dreams
And second hand shoes
You're so far gone,
That you're left to lose.
It's too late to go home
All alone.
Your the tar in that
Old cigar
And the worn out cable
On a cable car - and,
You're too tired to admit
You've gotta choose.

Have you ever stood outside a picket fence

What we could be and what we could do

Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly with wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
I'm carrying this heavy load
I don't know what to do
The only thing I know is that
I'm in love with you Oh
Fly the wings of an eagle
No matter how high
I'll be thinkin' of you

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You're going through all this pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
So hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care

Weird

Isn't it weird. Isn't it strange.
Even though we're just two strangers on this runaway train
We're both trying to find a place in the sun
We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone
Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes
Isn't it hard. Standing in the rain.
You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain
No one can hear though you're screaming so loud
You feel all alone in a faceless crowd
Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes.
Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign. Hoping that my luck will change.
Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
When you live in a cookie cutter world being different is a sin.
So you don't stand out. And you don't fit in. Weird.
Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign. Hoping that my luck will change.

Speechless

Everybody wonders and some people know
I guess that I'm some people 'cause baby it shows
When will you do it? And why will you go?
If you've already decided then deliver the blow
The way you walk around me. The way you talk around me.
You act so speechless. You've got nothing to say.
The way you walk around me. The way you're talking to me.
Makes me wonder. If this was only play.
And I wonder will you still love me?
Do you still love me, like you did before.
Said come on baby you think I'm so blind
I see what you're doing behind my back all the time
I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name
You think I don't notice that nothing's the same... Anymore

(Repeat Chorus)

And I wonder will you still love me?
Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time

And I wonder will you still love me?
Did you ever love me, or are you showing me the door
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time

Where's the Love

Something has been going on and I don't know what it is
You don't mind the taking girl, but you don't know how to give
You drove me crazy but I don't know baby
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling
Where's the right in, all of our fighting?
Look at what you're doing
Where's the love
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and...
Where's the love
Give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around?
We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down
We're separating, consciousness is fading
Are you thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in, all of our fighting?
Look at, look at, look at what we're doing

(Repeat Chorus)

Dark clouds all around, lightning, rain pouring down
Waiting for the bright light to break through
Face down on the ground
Pick us up at the lost and found
We've got to change our point of view, if we want the sky blue
We're segregating, consciences are fading
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling
Where's the right in, all of our fighting
Look at what we're doing

(Repeat Chorus)

Won't you, won't you give it up

Yearbook Song

Dear Amy, see you in September
Hope that you remember me next year
Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me
I hope that I'll still see you around here
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space
There's a name without a picture, but I can't forget his face
Tell me where did he go, I want to know
Where did Johnny go?
It says, ""Picture unavailable"" right here
More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows
There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name
None of us will ever be the same
It's quiet in the halls, but I hear echoing off the walls.
The rumors of Johnny's mystery
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space
No he never wrote me nothing, but I can't forget his face

(Repeat Chorus)

Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed
But I keep thinking about Johnny. I keep turning to that page.
Where did he go I want to know, Where did he go I want to know?
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?

Look At You

Look at you baby
Standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here
Wishing something would happen, maybe I could disappear
She walks in with that look in her eye
Somehow she doesn't even have to try
Just kick off your shoes, get on the floor
This is what we came here for
Oooooh, you've got to break it down
You've got to get it out
Just get on the floor
Everybody wonders when they look at you
Everybody wonders what you're gonna do
You got it all wrapped up you do
Everybody wonders when they look at, look at you
Look at you baby, look at you baby
In the middle of the dance floor lights shinin' in my face
Twistin', shoutin' there was no doubt people dancing all over the place
Out of the corner of my eye she said why don't you come and give it a try
Get on the floor, just kick off your shoes
You ain't got a thing to lose
Oooooh, you've got to break it down
It's time to get it out
Just get on the floor

(Repeat Chorus)

Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby
I was standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here
Wishin' something would happen so that I could disappear
She breaks the silence with a move of her hips
You better hang on don't want to lose your grip
Kick off your shoes, get on the floor
This is what we're waiting for
Oooooh, you've got to break it down
You've got to get it out. Just get on the floor.

Lucy

The day that I left Lucy
A tear fell from her eye
Now I don't have nobody, and I was such a fool
On the day that I left Lucy.
The day that I left Lucy she cried, then said goodbye
Now it's done, and it's over, and I am all alone
On the day that I left Lucy
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing
'Cause you were everything, everything to me
I didn't realize I felt this way, until that day
Today I'm missing Lucy, and you say that she's ok, I hope she is.
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace...
My Lucy
I love Lucy, Lucy...
On the day that I left Lucy... My Lucy

I Will Come to You

When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
And you don't know how or why, but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'
I will hear your spirit callin'
And I swear I'll be there come what may

(Repeat Chorus)

'Cause even if we can't be together
We'll be friends now and forever
And I swear that I'll be there come what may
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
We all need somebody we can turn to
Someone who'll always understand
So if you feel that your soul is dyin'
And you need the strength to keep tryin'
I'll reach out and take your hand

(Repeat Chorus)

I'm dying inside
I know the way it should be
Even though it was right in front of me
It's something I just couldn't see
Your lonely face
Your lonely eyes
But this is something you can't disguise

We're tracing our footsteps
We're going the same way

Here we go around again

Before I make the same mistake just hold me in your arms
We belong you know it in your heart
Look where we're going
No doubt in my mind
Can't you see it's meant to be

Man From Milwaukee (Garage Mix)

It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
>From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

(Repeat Chorus)

This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird
Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird

For the love of Pete come in!
This is Baby Bird... Sorry I was watching Court tv
Do you copy? Do you copy?
Of course we copy... 24 hours a day... In color

You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane

I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie
I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday
I know they'll come get me and take me away
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday
If not tomorrow then maybe today

Christmas hopes to inspire
Love ones by your side
You know you'll kiss your babies good night

No matter who your are
Where your from
This is where you belong
At Christmas

Memories 'round the Christmas tree
Are the sweetest ones that remain with me
It's a comfort deep inside
Though you can't stop the race of time
To know that Christmas will always be

Christmas hopes will be inspired
Love ones by your side
You know you'll kiss your baby good night

At Christmas, Christmas,
No matter who your are
Where your from
This is where you belong

Now this is what Christmas means to me
Being together with your family
And the wise men who fallowed that star
To where our baby Jesus lie

Family nestled all around
Baby Jesus asleep so sound
His star shined so bright
On the very first holy night

At Christmas, Christmas,
No matter who your are
Where your from

Kiss my mama goodbye

Don't cry, yaaaa, everybody, lets do it.(end of chorus.)

Goin' to sea around 5 'o' clock

In the fields from dawn,
Til dusk, swimmin' in the blue hole is a must.
That island, where I was born
First thing I will do is grow some corn

Been cookin' outside in the iron pot
So young when I learned, I haven't forgot, out to cast, and walking old folks
Smokin' pipes and talking
Saturday night we're gonna dance and sway
Shake my bell, do the dawn day people
Don't you understand, live like a king
And be a happy man

I saw her smiling face
Even though it was only yesterday
And I miss her, oh

On the dock of the bay
He took a long-term trip on a first class plane
Now the whole world listens
To that one mans song

Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll
Does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart
And soul with the roots of rock and roll

Well the man in black sits
On a screened in porch
Making birthday wishes, 71 almost
You can hear him singing chariot
Swing low
On the block I live on
In the place I know

Tell me does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the

Busy keeping less never getting more

Only just to believe

Trying to get myself to get out of my way
Birds in the trees just make me depressed
Seeing sunny skies, feeling emptiness

Layers of lies just seem to fold
This kind of life is all I know

When our love had just begun
Only you can stop the pain

Look back now and remember the days we laughed

I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see
A blue sky waiting for me

I've seen the main attraction
I've felt the moment's passion

Sweat until my clothes come off

Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are mashing
No question, time for some action

Temperature's up, can you feel it?
About to erupt, gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty

Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing gettin' just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival"

How would you like it if I hurt you?
Way deep inside I looked at you with a frown.
Would you feel all alone?
No-one comes to help you.
It seems that nobody cares.
Maybe next time you'll think twice,
Before you accuse or compare.

No, oh, oh, ......

When you're whip us, do we not weep,
When you hurt us, do we not cry?
When you stab us, do we not die?

I want to need you cause I need to be with you til the end

Then I hear myself reply you've got to hold it in

This time, tonight

If only I had the guts to feel this way

If only you'd look at me and want to stay

If only I'd take you in my arms and say

I won't go cause I need you

I sit here, waiting, wondering, hoping, that I'll make this right

Cause all I think about is your hands

Your face, and all these lonely nights

There's a feeling that's screaming in the back of my head

Saying over and over

I want to hole you and love you in my arms and then

I want to need you cause I need to be with you til the end

Then I hear myself reply she'll never let you in

This time, tonight

If only I have the guts to feel this way

If only you'd look at me and want to stay

If only I'd take you in my arms and say

I won't go cause I need you

Please don't go cause I need you now

I want to hear you say

It'll always be this way

We will be hand in hand for every night and every day

I want to scream and shout

Cause I'm losing any doubt

And all I care about is you and me and us and now

If only I had the guts to feel this way

If only you'd look at me and want to stay

If only I'd take you in my arms and say

I won't go cause I need you

Please don't go cause I need you now"

In a little while
Surely you'll be mine
In a little while... I'll be there

In a little while
This hurt will hurt no more
I'll be home, love

When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no air
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there?

Slow down my beating heart
Slow down my beating heart

In a little while
I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl she's mine
And I've known her since...
Since she was a little girl with Spanish eyes
Oh and I saw her in a pram they pushed her by
Oh... My how you've grown yeah
And it's been, it's been... A little while

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my bleeding heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love

A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies
He lives on a star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail, the scatter of light
Turn it on... Turn it on
You turn me on... Turn me on yeah

In the bathtub with a razor and she's planning her great escape

Either way she's giving up some of herself, whoooa

In the backyard there's a small boy playing soldiers with an army ranger
In the front room there's a mother to the small boy,
She's a total stranger
In a way she's giving up on herself, whoooa
Either way she's giving up some of herself, whoooa

Love is only what you give up
Life isn't what you get
Love won't always fill your cup
But life's when you start to live
Life's when you learn to give

When I leave here I'm going to go to the small boy
And that flamenco dancer
Leave the guitar and the spotlight I'm gonna go home to my biggest fans

Inside a splintered wooden chest
To Avalon we line the streets
I only hope that you'll finally rest

There is no one to hold his hand.

Is there no one who could love a lonely boy?
And at the end of the day,
There is no one to understand. (end of chorus.)

And turn on the light in the dark.

Through the darkest nights, coldest winters,
Through the fires of hell.

Beauty queen that you are
Put you down for a place in the stars
Take your picture for all the world to see

Lulla Belle' s leaving the ball
No more reason to stay
Or people to see
Cos everyone here knows your name
From the light on your face
In the frame that hangs
In the hall where lovely girls go
Lulla Belle goes, Lulla Belle no

Tell me what can I say
We're tracing our footsteps
We're going the same way

You know it could be so much better than it's been

You are my ten thousand roses and I let you go
Before I make the same mistake just hold me in your arms
We belong you know it in your heart
Look where we're going
No doubt in my mind
Can't you see it's meant to be

Close your eyes girllook inside girl
Let the sound take you away
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me

Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face to the size of his toes
He comes fdom a place that nobody knows

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from milwaukee
He's been talking to long on his yellow walkie-talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from the way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave
Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked my now then I couldn't tell you why

Of course we copy... 24 hours a day... In color!
You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed
He flew off to Milwaukee, or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane
I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie-talkie
I'm talking to Mars, you may think that I'm wacky

These feelings will not be some sign.

And when I hold your hand,
You seem to understand that.......

Your my strength that keeps me holding on.

Sold to the filly and the boy who had the toys,
And the cook said, ""look at the one legged soldier,
It looks just like the one, we lost the other day!
Could this be the boy's tin soldier,
With the missing leg? ""

But he was... Lonely, so lonely, for a friend,
And he was lonely, so lonely, for a friend,
He was so lonely, yeah, oh yeah...
So lonely, oh yeah

Avery: ""what about the ballerina? ""

As he sat on the mantel place to dry from the river,
The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side
And when they got up... To dance with each other,
She fell by the fire, blazing bright!
When he jumped to save her, from the flames,
The bases began to melt into one and the same,
Now they share each others destiny,
Together forever, they will be!
And they are no longer lonely, for a friend,
And they are no longer lonely for a friend,
No longer lonely, yeah, no longer lonely,
Ooh yeah, oooohh, no longer lonely, yeah

Well, not so long ago, in a toy room not so far away,
Lived a boy who had so many toys,
And he played with them all,
With them all, with them all,
Well he had a ballerina, and one legged soldier,
Stuck together at the base,
And they share each others destiny,
As they sit on top of the mantel place,
It's the story of the one legged soldier
The story of the one legged soldier
The story of the tin soldier with the missing leg!"

Their father's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they pick
The one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you
And know they love you.

And you, of tender years
Don't know the fears
That your elders grew by
So please help them with your youth
They seek the truth
Before they can die.

(Can you hear and do you care
And can't you see we must be free
To teach our children what you believe in
Make a world that we can believe in.)

Teach your parents well

Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they pick

Well deep in the woods
Where nothing is seen
A tightrope is strung to his heel
And high on the walk
He's down on one knee
He waits for the slow of the breeze
Oh, wow, look at him now, on his feet
High up in the sky
And every moment stands endlessly
It feels as though time isn't moving

And every second, one breath not to breathe
I watch as he moves to the beat
While I'm on the floor
I watch from my seat
And watch as he sways with the trees
And slowly he moves, but elegantly
I'm more on the edge of my seat

On the tightrope
Everything's bare
All that there is is from here to there
On the tightrope
The goal is quite clear
Don't lose yourself in your fear

Everyone waits on the walk
Some are long and some small
But all of them tall
Everyone must make a choice
Will I go for it all
And possibly fall
The tightrope is thin
I could possibly win on the walk

Well high on the walk
The tightrope it bends
And nobody knows where it ends
To win or to lose
You're all on your own
Everyone must be alone

On the tightrope
Everything's bare
All that there is is from here to there
On the tightrope
The goal is quite clear
Don't lose yourself in your fear
To win or to loose
You're all on your own
And everyone must be alone

Well, I know what you’re doing

I’m caught up in a dark emotion
I’ve given you all that’s left of me
You’re giving me a crazy notion
I’m falling for your tragic symphony
I’m caught up in a dark emotion
I’m falling for the trap you set for me
You’re giving me a crazy notion
I’m falling for your tragic symphony
Uh-uh, your tragic symphony

You played me once, but I did it twice
I guess I’m taking my own bad advice
Woohoo, uh
Well, the lie you composed is intricate
But if it don’t bleed then it ain’t no cut
Woohoo, woohoo

Waking up this morning
Thinking this can't be real
They say there is nothing love can't heal
Why don't you come on down
So you can feel what I feel

Sitting all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothing gone
But there's something wrong

Can't you see
That I'm stuck here underneath?
And you make it hard to breathe?
Take a look around & tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath

I know what to say,
But don't know where to begin
I fear I'm losing you beneath my skin
Is there resolution for this pain that I'm in?

Sitting all alone in this place
Even though we're here face to face
There is nothing gone,
But there's something wrong

Can't you see
That I'm stuck here underneath?
And you make it hard to breathe?
Take a look around & tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath
Cause you'll find me, whoa-oh, underneath

If only you could feel what I dream
Maybe you could hear what I mean
There is nothing gone

But there's something missing
Can't you see
That I'm stuck here underneath
And you make it hard to breathe
Take a look around & tell me what you see

You'll find me underneath
You'll find me underneath
Underneath. .. Underneath"
Hanson,Use Me Up,/h/hanson/use+me+up_20874773.html,"Somebody let me down
Somebody show me love
I wouldn't care much either way

I'd rather the sticks and stones
Than dragging the ball and chain
Of what if the world won't take me

Even if the hole should crack
Even if the blood flows red
Nothing could be worse than numb
So please, use me up

I just want anyone
To use me up
'Cause no one ever does
Use me up

I've carried it all too long
The fear of the pain it brings
Feeling the panic building up

I'd rather the broken heart
Than live in the emptiness
Of what if the world won't save me

Even if the bow should break
Even if the blood runs cold
Nothing could be worse than numb
Please, use me up

I just want anyone
To use me up
'Cause no one ever does
Use me up
Use me up

Treat me somewhere cruel
You can throw me away
As long as I feel it
Show me something real
You can't deceive me
I am yours to use

Use me up [x3]"

Gonna take your own advice
Won't think twice
Because you are not worth my time

You're the last one to arrive
And the first to cut in line

Oh you never really know
Til its dark and its cold
There's no one to call you home

Your true colors will be shown
When you're out all alone
And everything comes out all wrong
When you find it you will know

Down on a road she shouldn't take

On her knees and she begs and she pleads

Weird. Oh ho.

Isn't it hard.
Standing in the rain.
You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain
No one can hear but you're screaming so loud
You feel like you're all alone in a faceless crowd
Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes.

Sitting on the side.
Waiting for a sign.
Hoping that my luck will change.
Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
When you live in a cookie cutter world being different is a sin.
So you don't stand out.
But you don't fit in.

Weird.

Whoa oh.
Sitting on the side.
Waiting for a sign.
Hoping that my luck will change.
Oh ho.
Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
When you live in a cookie cutter world if you're different you can't win.
So you don't stand out and you don't fit in.

And I feel the bridges are burning,
Underneath my feet

Where do you go when you're gone?

And I just don't want to wake,
Why can't we keep on sailing across the same old lake,
My forehead is still bleeding from the thorns I used to wear,
And I'm left alone and I'm beaten,
But this cross I choose to bear

Where do you go when you're gone?
Where do you go when you're gone?
Oh how the road feels so long,
Where do you go when you're gone?

But I finally found what I'm looking for,
Well I finally found what I'm looking for,
Though the road's still long and the night's still full,
I finally found what I'm looking for

The voices fall like timber and the fear it pulls like rain,
And my heart is crushed to cinders underneath this kind of pain,
But there is no resolution when the revolution's there,
So I'm left with no solution, but the voices in my head

Somebody's caught in the undertow
Have you ever felt desperation?
The saltwater's filling your lungs
We will regret it when we sleep
Promises never meant to keep
When all of the shadows need
Is a good man to hide in the dream
Do they know that the world's on fire?

Time is a price we can't afford
An empty glass and an open door
You get what you paid for in sweat
And a voice that says please don't forget

Do they know that the world's on fire?
Do they know that the time is now?
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up
Let your voice speak out
Do they know that it's time?

Caught in a maze you can't escape
The flickering lights, and the colored lens
The walls that we build just close in
Until we decide to begin
Are we distracted by the sun?
The glittering jewels, and the beating drums
Is it going the distance we fear?
Have you heard that we're already here?

Do they know that the world's on fire?
Do they know that the time is now?
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up
Let your voice speak out
Do they know that the world's on fire?
Do they know that the time is here?
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up
Let your voice be clear

We're on the edge and in too deep
Some will say we're too far gone
You can't erase the tragedy"

Where did johnny go?

More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows
There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did johnny go?

None of us will ever be the same

No he never wrote me nothing, but I can't forget his face

his mom's screams go through his head
he opens his mouth but the spells wont come out

times run out, his dream is over, BLOW!

Oh! He's in his four post-er!
His scar is burning bad!
he wants to go tell Ron!
he's so sad, so he won?t
give up that easy, no.
he won?t have it he knows
he will kill voldemort,
it don?t matter, he's toast.

he was learning in the beginning, then wizarding changed,
when he went to hogwarts and people called him names.
but he kept learning and learned a lot of spells,
made enemies wit' Malfoy, proved he was better as well
Draco got him mad, he was meltin',

This is Harry's life and these times are so dark, and its getting even darker,
trying to defeat voldemort,
plus, being haunted by that night with his Mom and father
too much for him to want to stay in one spot,
too many dark wizards, he's got to formulate a plot or end up in heaven.
Success is his only stinkin' option, death is not.

Its funny when you think that you're the best
Till they chose Bell over me I hate this game

Thought I was good until the point
Up until the point I got booed when I dropped the Quaffle
Finally figured out how bad I was
But I just couldn't believe it

Every time I try to score a goal
There's always a keeper in front of the pole
Every time I try to steal the Quaffle
I can't I just fall
They think I'm awful
Am I not trying hard enough?

Thought I'd get better if I just practiced
Sort of thought it was worth the time
But I guess Quidditch isn't my thing
Cause I'm not about to walk on that field again

Guess I kind of lied to myself
Didn't really see how bad I was
It's not to late to take some advice
Guess I really need it

Every time I try to score a goal
There's always a keeper in front of the pole
Every time I try to steal the Quaffle
I can't I just fall
They think I'm awful
Am I not trying hard enough?

Don't know what I should do
Lying here alone in tears
Afraid of the truth
No one to comfort me again

Guess I kind of lied to myself
Didn't really see how bad I was
It's not to late to take some advice
Guess I really need it

Every time I try to score a goal
There's always a keeper in front of the pole
Every time I try to steal the Quaffle
I can't I just fall
They think I'm awful
I'm not trying hard enough"
Harry Potter,Ode To Harry Potter,/h/harry+potter/ode+to+harry+potter_20629896.html,"I can't help but blush when your near me,
But you just exclude me from your circle of three.
I'm right in front of you but you don't see'
You treat me like I'm a Colin Creevey.

I love you,
But it seems you don't love me.
My friends say your so brave,
And I know you will see that we were meant to be.
When you miss me it'll be too late.

Swallowed so much love my hair grows red,
Come over to my house to see my brother instead.
You didn't get my valentine,
Didn't know what it meant.
Every page about you my diary has read.

I love you,
But it seems you don't love me.
My friends say your so brave,
And I know you will see that we were meant to be.
When you miss me it'll be too late.

Even though you're the one I adore,
Next year at Hogwarts you'll see I've transformed.
I will hold my head up high- I'm a Gryffindor,
And you won't need to save me any more.

I love you,
But it seems you don't love me.
My friends say your so brave,
And I know you will see that we were meant to be.
When you miss me it'll be too.........
I love you,
But it seems you don't love me.
My friends say you're so brave,
And I know you will see that we were meant to be.
When you miss me it'll be too late.

When you miss me it'll be too late.

When you miss be it'll be too late."

Harry Potter,Spells,/h/harry+potter/spells_20650969.html,"Accio! (Goblet of Fire, page 68)
Etymology: L. Accedo (to approach, come near / (things) to be added).
The Summoning Charm (incantation: ""Accio!"") is used to bring an object to you, wherever it may be. Concentrating is essential to succeeding in the spell; the further away an object is and the larger it is, the harder it is to summon. The two most difficult Summoning Charms are in Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. In Goblet of Fire, Harry summons his Firebolt from inside the castle to the grounds to use it for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. In Order of the Phoenix, the potency of the charm is demonstrated when Fred and George Weasley summon their brooms (which were chained to a wall) from another part of the castle.

Age Line Charm (Goblet of Fire, page 256)
The incantation for the age line charm is unknown, but the effect is a thin golden line drawn on the surface of the floor that prevents anyone who is too young (or possibly the reverse, too old) from crossing. The effect, in Fred and George's case, was being transformed into much older versions of themselves.

Aguamenti! (Half-Blood Prince, page 574)
Etymology: L. Agua (water) + Mentis (Mind).
""Aguamenti!"", which is taught in the sixth year, is a spell whose affect is a clear jet or fountain of water being emitted from the castor's wand.

Air-dry Charm (Half-Blood Prince, page 558)
The charm blows a rush of warm air from the castor's wand. Dumbledore uses the charm to dry off himself and Harry when they travel to the cave.

Alohomora! (Sorcerer's Stone, page 160)
Etymology: Hawaiian. Aloha (goodbye) L. + mora (delay)
The Alohomora Charm (incantation: ""Alohomora!"") is used to unlock doors or other objects that are locked. The charm also unlocks magically locked doors or objects (see ""Colloportus!""). Though the charm comes in handy for Harry, Hermione, and Ron throughout the books, it is not powerful. As shown in Chapter 34, ""The Department of Mysteries,"" in Order of the Phoenix, The Alohomora Charm does not unlock all magically locked doors or objects.

Anapneo! (Half-Blood Prince, page 144)
Etymology: Greek. Anapneo (Breathe).
A useful spell that clears the blocked airway of the castor's target. Slughorn uses the spell to save a student's life.

Anti-Apparition Spell:
The anti-apparition spell prevents a witch or wizard from apparating. The spell is cast over the grounds of Hogwarts though it was lifted in the great hall during Harry's sixth year to allow the students to practice for apparition tests.

Anti-Cheating Spell (Sorcerer's Stone, page 262)
The spell is cast on student's quills before taking tests which presumably stops a student from cheating.

Anti-Disapparition Spell: (Order of the Phoenix page 817)
The anti-disapparition spell prevents a witch or wizard from disapparating; Dumbledore uses it on the recently captured Death Eaters in the Ministry.

Antler jinx (Order of the Phoenix page 677)
The jinx causes antlers to sprout from the victim's head. In Order of the Phoenix, Pansy Parkinson is hit with this jinx which forces her to miss class for a day.

Aparecium! (Chamber of Secrets, page 233)
Etymology: L. Appareo (to become visible, appear, manifest).
""Aparecium!"" is used only once by Hermione in an attempt to reveal the hidden contents of Tom Riddle's diary. Though the spell is unsuccessful, Hermione says that it is used to reveal invisible ink.

Apparition/ Disapparition:
An advanced non-verbal spell that allows a witch or wizard to disappear from one place and instantaneously appear at another. Apparating is marked by a loud cracking noise and a sensation similar to being forced through a very tight rubber tube. Apparition can also be performed with multiple passengers via the apparator touching the person they wish to bring with them.

Arrow-wand Charm (Quidditch through the Ages, Ch. 7)
The charm causes arrows to shoot from the castor's wand. The charm was popular with Appleby Arrows supporters who would use it to celebrate goals; it was outlawed in 1894.

Avada Kedavra! (Goblet of Fire, page 215)
Etymology: Aramaic. Abracadabra (ancient spell meaning ""let the thing be destroyed"")
The Killing Curse (incantation: ""Avada Kedavra!"") is considered by most wizards the worst curse, as it kills whoever or whatever it is cast upon. The curse is one of three Unforgivable Curses - curses that are illegal and can land a wizard in Azkaban Prison for using them (see ""Imperio!"" and ""Crucio!"").

Avis! (Goblet of Fire, page 309)
Etymology: L. Avis (bird)
""Avis!"" is used when examining a wand; it will cause small, twittering birds to fly out of the end of a wand in working condition.

Babbling Curse (Chamber of Secret, page 161)
The exact effect is never mentioned in canon but we can assume it causes the castor's victim to babble for an extended period of time. Lockhart claims to have cured a ""simple Transylvanian villager"" of the curse.

Banishing Charm (Goblet of Fire, page 479)
The opposite of the Summoning charm, the incantation causes an object to fly away from the castor; it is then 'banished'.

Bat-Boogey Hex (Half Blood Prince, Ch. 7)
This nasty hex causes the victim's boogies to grow to the size of bats and then sprout wings and attack the victim's face. Ginny is said to be especially gifted at this particular hex.

Bewitched Sleep (Goblet of Fire, page 509)
The charm causes the target to be placed in a deep artificial sleep in which (s)he doesn't need to breathe. Dumbledore places Ron, Hermione, Gabrielle Delacour and Cho in this sleep-like state when they are placed in the care of the mere people during the second triwizard task.

Boil-Covering spell (Chamber of Secrets, page 185)
The boil-covering spell causes the target to become covered with boils. Fred and George, for some reason, use it to try to cheer up Ginny.

Bubble-Head Charm (Goblet of Fire, page 506)
The bubble-head charm surrounds a person's head in a large air-bubble. Both Cedric and Fleur use this charm in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. It was also very popular towards the end of Harry's fifth year as students used the charm in effort to combat the growing number of dungbombs and stinkpellets being set off.

Cheering Charm (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 294)
The cheering charm is a third-year charm which cheers a person up.

Colloportus! (Order of the Phoenix, page 788)
Etymology: L. Colligo (to bind, tie, fasten together)
""Colloportus!"" is used to lock doors or objects that can be locked. However, the spell is not of much use unless dealing with Muggles or a wandless wizard or witch, because the Alohomora Charm will unlock anything locked by ""Colloportus!""

Confundus Charm (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 386)
Etymology: L. Confundo (to perplex).
The confundus charm causes the person or object it is cast upon to become confused or misguided.

Conjunctivitis Curse (Goblet of Fire, page 406)
Etymology: L. Conjunctiva (relating to the eye) + itis (inflammation)
The curse affects the visibility of the victim making it very difficult to see and possibly causing pain or irritation in the eyes. Sirius tries to suggest Harry use this spell on the dragon in the first task; Krum does use it.

Conjuring Charm:
Conjures items out of thin air for the castor. Used multiple times through the books for everything from chairs, to liquid, to even sleeping bags.

Corn-Flaked skin Jinx (Order of the Phoenix P. 677)
Warrington, of the Slytherin Quidditch team, is hit with this jinx which makes his skin look as though he had been coated in cornflakes.

Crucio! (Goblet of Fire, page 214)
Etymology: L. Crucio (to torture, torment)
The Cruciatus Curse (incantation: ""Crucio!"") inflicts severe pain on whoever it is cast on. It is used mainly by Voldemort and his Death Eaters when torturing someone. Rowling describes the pain as this: ""White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life..."" The length of time the curse is in effect is unknown, but it is presumed to stop after 15 seconds - 1 minute. Wizards and witches (i. E. Frank and Alice Longbottom) can be tortured to the point of insanity by the curse. This explains why the Cruciatus Curse is one of three Unforgivable Curses - curses that are illegal and can land a wizard in Azkaban Prison for using them (see ""Avada Kedavra""! And ""Imperio!"").

Cushioning Charm (Quidditch Through the Ages, Ch. 9)
The cushioning charm creates an invisible cushion on the handle of a broom making it much more comfortable to fly for extended periods of time.

Deletrius! (Goblet of Fire, page 136)
Etymology: L. Deleo (to destroy, wipe out, erase)
""Deletrius!"" is used only once throughout the Harry Potter series in order to vanish the ""echo"" of a spell conjured by Prior Incantato! The incantation comes from the Latin word deleo, which means ""to destroy, wipe out, erase."" This leads to the assumption that the spell would also delete objects, although this has not been proven by the books.

Densaugeo! (Goblet of Fire, page 309)
Etymology: L. Dens (tooth), + auctus (growth, enlargement, increase)
""Densaugeo!"" causes a person's teeth to grow rapidly. At what point the spell stops is unknown; when Draco hit Hermione with the spell in Goblet of Fire, Hermione's teeth grew down past her collar. The spell can be undone by shrinking the affected teeth.

Diffindo! (Goblet of Fire, page 340)
Etymology: L. Diffundo (to spread, pour forth, scatter)
""Diffindo!"" causes an object to split or break. Wand aim is essential to the success of this spell. It has only been used once in the Harry Potter books (see above reference).

Disapparition/ Aapparition:
Etymology: L. Appareo (To appear)
An advanced non-verbal spell that allows a witch or wizard to disappear from one place and instantaneously appear at another. Apparating is marked by a loud cracking noise and a sensation similar to being forced through a very tight rubber tube. Apparition can also be performed with multiple passengers via the apparator touching the person they wish to bring with them.

Disillusionment Charm (Order of the Phoenix, page 54)
The disillusionment charm is a concealment charm that feels something like a flood of cold running down one's body. It hides the magical nature of a person, place, or thing. Hippogriffs and Winged horses are allowed to be kept by wizards so long as they have this charm placed upon them so muggles' attention isn't drawn to them.

Dissendium! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 195)
Etymology: L. Dissimulo - antonym (to conceal, disguise, keep secret)
The incantation ""Dissendium!"" combined with a tap of the wand will open up the hump of a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch (located on the third-floor corridor of Hogwarts). Going through the opened statue leads to a secret path to the wizard village Hogsmeade.

Drought Charm (Goblet of Fire, page 486)
Dries up relatively small amounts of water such as puddles and ponds.

Engorgio! (Goblet of Fire, page 214)
Etymology: Unknown
""Engorgio!"" causes something to become several times its normal mass. Moody uses the spell on a spider during the unforgivable curse lesson.

Ennervate! (Goblet of Fire, page 133)
Latin Root: Unknown
""Ennervate!"" is used to revive persons who have either been knocked unconscious by normal means or by the Stunning Spell, ""Stupefy!"" When someone is revived by this spell, their eyes suddenly open and they are dazed. They quickly come to their senses and regain composure.

Entrail-Expelling Curse (Order of the Phoenix, page 487)
A very disturbing spell that presumably causes one's entrails (intestines) to expel from his or her rear. It was invented by Urquhart Rackharrow

Episkey! (Half-Blood Prince, page 157)
Etymology: Greek. Episkeyazo (To repair)
""Episkey!"" Heals minor damage that has been done to a body part.

Evanesco! (Order of the Phoenix, page 234)
Etymology: L. Evanescence (to vanish, to disappear, empty)
""Evanesco!"" causes what it is cast upon to disappear. In Order of the Phoenix, the spell is used on scrolls and potions. Whether or not the disappearing object vanishes completely is unknown; a spell to bring the object back may exist, but is not verifiable.

Expecto Patronum! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 238)
Etymology: L. Exspecto (to wait for, look for, expect), + patronus (patron, protector)
The Patronus Charm (incantation: ""Expecto Patronum!"") is highly advanced magic, well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level, used to ward off dementors. When used properly, the spell creates a Patronus, which is a guardian that acts as a shield between the caster and the dementor. Each Patronus is unique to the wizard or witch who conjures it, and reflects their personality. In order for the spell to work properly, the incantation must be spoken while the caster concentrates on a extraordinarily happy memory. This causes a Patronus to be conjured; it is successful in warding off dementors because it is ""a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon - hope, happiness, the desire to survive - but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it."" (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 238)

Expelliarmus! (Chamber of Secrets, page 190)
Etymology: L. Expello (to drive out, expel, force out, banish)
The Disarming Charm (incantation: ""Expelliarmus!"") is used to disarm someone, and is most commonly used while dueling. Though a simple spell, it can be used to get wizards and witches out of tight situations and close encounters - it saved Harry Potter's life in Goblet of Fire.

Extinguishing Spell (Goblet of Fire, P. 328
Naturally, the extinguishing spell extinguishes fires.

Fidelius Charm (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 205)
Etymology: L. Fidelis (Faithful)
""An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it."" If the secret-keeper dies, the secret dies with him or her.

Ferula! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 376)
Etymology: Unknown
""Ferula!"" creates a splint of bandages, a temporary fix for an injured or broken limb.

Finite Incantatem! (Chamber of Secrets, page 192)
Etymology: L. Finis (end, limit)
""Finite Incantatem!"" is used by Professor Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets, and it stops the effects of both Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy's spells. The spell also works without the ""Incantatem"" portion of the incantation, which was proved by Remus Lupin in Order of the Phoenix.

Flagrate! (Order of the Phoenix, page 772)
Etymology: L. Flagro (to blaze, glow, flame)
""Flagrate!"" was used in Order of the Phoenix to mark doors in the Department of Mysteries with a fiery ""X"". This allowed Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, and Luna to know which doors they had already gone through.

Flame-Freezing Charm (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 2)
The charm changes the properties of fire so that the flames produce only a gentle tickling sensation.

Fur-growing Spell (Chamber of Secrets, page 185)
The spell causes the target to grow fur.

Furnunculus! (Goblet of Fire, page 298)
Etymology: L. Furunculus (boil)
The Furnunculus Curse (incantation: ""Furnunculus!"") causes ugly boils to break out all over whoever the curse is cast upon. The Furnunculus Curse should not be mixed with Jelly-Legs; tentacles will sprout all over the victim's face.

Golden Bubble Charm (Sorcerer's Stone, page 197)
The actual name of the charm is unknown, but this refers to the charm which causes non-popping golden bubbles to blossom out of the castor's wand. Flitwick uses the charm for the Christmas decorations in the Great Hall.

Homorphus Charm (Chamber of Secrets, page 162)
Etymology: Greek. Homo (Same) or L. Homo (Man) + English. Morph. (Change)
Though its exact effects are unknown, Lockhart claims he used it to defeat a werewolf. Perhaps it is used to turn a werewolf into a man, or to turn oneself into the shape of a werewolf thus fooling it.

Horned Tongue Hex (Goblet of Fire, page 339)
Presumably transforms the victim's tongue into a horn. Harry considers using it on the Hungarian Horntail but decides against it.

Hurling Hex (Prisoner of Azkaban, Ch. 12
A hex placed on a broom that presumably causes the broom to hurl the rider off. Flitwick checks Harry's Firebolt for this hex when inspecting it in Prisoner of Azkaban.

Impedimenta! (Goblet of Fire, page 626)
Etymology: L. Impedimentum (hindrance, impediment, obstacle, difficulty)
""Impedimenta!"" slows down an attacker. If the spell is cast upon armor or other metal objects, it will backfire. If the spell is cast upon someone who is standing still, the person standing still will either freeze and be unable to move until they are ""unfrozen"" or will be knocked off of their feet.

Imperturbable Charm (Order of the Phoenix, page 69)
Etymology: L. Imperturbatus (Calm).
The imperturbable charm creates a magical seal on an object, such as a door, making it impossible for anyone to eavesdrop on what is going on on the other side.

Inanimatus Conjurus (Order of the Phoenix, page 295)
Etymology: L. Inanimus (not living) + Coniurus (conjure).
Though its affect is never given, it presumably has something to do with conjuring inanimate objects.

Imperio! (Goblet of Fire, page 214)
Etymology: L. Imperium (power to command, authority, command, rule, control)
The Imperius Curse (incantation: ""Imperio!"") is used to control the actions of a person. Although few have the willpower to resist the curse, many wizards and witches cannot. Because wizards can completely control the actions of others when they are under this curse, it is one of the three Unforgivable Curses - curses that are illegal and can land a wizard in Azkaban Prison for using them (see ""Avada Kedavra!"" and ""Crucio!"").

Impervius! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 177)
Etymology: L. In (not) + pervius (letting things through)
""Impervius!"" was used by Hermione Granger on Harry Potter's glasses in the above reference, and it caused them to repel water. The spell was also used on the faces of the players on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in Order of the Phoenix, giving the players better visibility during practice.

Incarcerous! (Order of the Phoenix, page 755)
Etymology: L. Carcer (prison, cell, jail, dungeon)
""Incarcerous!"" has been used only once in the Harry Potter books, by Professor Umbridge (see above reference). When Umbridge cast the spell on Magorian the centaur, ""ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur's torso and trapping his arms.""

Incendio! (Goblet of Fire, page 47)
Etymology: L. Incendia (fire)
""Incendio!"" causes a fire to start, and it most commonly used on a fireplace. We are led to the belief that the spell may not work on human beings, due to the fact that it is not an Unforgiveable Curse.

Jelly Legs Jinx (Goblet of Fire, page 608)
The jelly legs jinx causes the victim's legs to wobble uncontrollably like jelly.

Knitting Charm (Order of the Phoenix, page 350)
The knitting charm causes knitting needles to knit on their own.

Langlock! (Half-Blood Prince, page 238)
""Langlock!"" Renders the victim speechless by gluing his/her tongue to the top of his/her mouth.

Legilimens! (Order of the Phoenix, page 534)
Etymology: L. Lego (to gather, choose, collect, pass through, read) + mens (mind)
""Legilimens!"" is mostly used by accomplished Legilimens, those who can read minds. The spell is used when attempting to break into someone else's mind and access their memories - usually memories that they fear.

Levicorpus! (Half-Blood Prince, page 238)
Etymology: L. Levo (To lift up) + Corpus (Body)
Invented by Severus Snape, this spell dangles the victim upside down in the air by his/her ankle.

Liberacorpus! (Half-Blood Prince, page 239)
Etymology: L. Liber (Free) + Corpus (Body)
The counter to Levicorpus, this curse, also invented by Snape, frees the target from the Levicorpus jinx.

Light as a Feather Charm (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 32)
This charm makes objects as light as a feather. Harry considers using the charm on his trunk when he runs away from the Dursley's.

Locomotor! (Order of the Phoenix, page 53)
Etymology: L. Locus (to place, put, position), + motio (to move)
""Locomotor!"" causes the object(s) that it is cast upon to levitate. Both of the times the spell is used throughout the books, it was cast on a trunk. In order for the spell to work most efficiently, the name of the object should be stated after the word ""Locomotor."" Example: ""Locomotor trunk!""

Locomotor Mortis! (Sorcerer's Stone, page 217)
Etymology: Locus (to place, put, position) + Motio (to move) + Mortis (death/corpse)
Not to be confused with the Locomotor incantation, this spell locks the victim's legs together rendering him/her immobile.

Lumos! (Chanber of Secrets, page 302)
Etymology: L. Luma (light)
""Lumos!"" is one of the most commonly used spells, because it is a simple spell and useful. As its Latin root implies, ""Lumos!"" causes a light to appear at the end of the wand that cast the spell. The incantation ""Nox!"" is spoken when the bearer of the wand wishes for the light to go out.

Mobili-! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 201, 377)
Etymology: L. Mobili (to move), corpus (body), arbustus (planted with trees)
""Mobili-!"" allows the caster to move an object. It has only been used twice throughout the Harry Potter series (see above references), both times with different suffixes. The first usage was by Hermione to move a Christmas tree in the Three Broomsticks. The second was to move the body of Professor Snape, who was unconscious at the time. The spell most likely works on corpses and conscious bodies, but there is no evidence to support this. It is interesting to note that the suffix changes according to the object being moved.

Morsmordre! (Goblet of Fire, page 128)
Etymology: L. Mors mortis (death)
""Morsmordre!"" is the incantation used when a wizard creates the Dark Mark, the sign of Voldemort. The Dark Mark has long been feared, because it was cast over the houses of wizards and witches who had been slain by Voldemort or his Death Eaters.

Muffliato! (Half-Blood Prince, page 238)
Etymology: English. Muffle (to deaden or dampen)
""Muffliato!"" fills the ears of those near the witch or wizard casting the spell with an undetectable light buzzing so that the castor can carry on a conversation without being overheard.

Nox! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 338)
Etymology: L. Nox (darkness)
""Nox!"" is used to put out the light created by ""Lumos!"" The spell presumably does nothing to the caster's wand if ""Lumos!"" has not previously been cast. The use of the spell on lit objects which are disconnected from the caster's wand is unknown.

Obliteration Charm (Order of the Phoenix, page 440)
Etymology: L. Oblitesco (To conceal oneself)
Hermione uses the obliteration charm in Order of the Phoenix to conceal the tracks she, Harry, and Ron leave while they are sneaking to and from Hagrid's Cabin.

Obliviate! (Chamber of Secrets, page 303)
Etymology: L. Oblivio (forgetfulness, oblivion)
The Memory Charm (incantation: ""Obliviate!"") causes whoever it is cast upon to lose most of their memory. A variant of this spell may be used for memory modifications, but the spell itself is much more powerful than a mere modification. Though a spell may exist that can bring someone's memory back, it is not commonly known in the wizarding world. In Chamber of Secrets, Professor Lockhart lost most of his memory due to this spell. Though he retained the ability to speak and understand the English language, he could no longer recall many basic things (e. G. Names, uses of objects, who he was).

Occlumency
Etymology: L.. Occlusum (to block or close) + Mens (mind)
Occlumency is a branch of magic specializing in the practice of blocking one's mind from an outside mental attack.

Oppugno! (Half-Blood Prince, page 302)
Etymology: L. Oppugno (To attack)
The ""Oppugno!"" charm causes conjured creatures to attack a target specified by the castor.

Orchideous! (Goblet of Fire, page 308)
Etymology: L. Orchideae (Orchid family of Plants)
The charm conjures a bouquet of flowers that appear at the end of the castor's wand. Mr Ollivander uses the spell to test Fleur's wand during the weighing of the wands.

Permanent Sticking Charm (Order of the phoenix, page 110)
We've only really seen this spell's effects twice in the series, and both times it was on portraits: Sirius' Mother's portrait in the Black family house and the Portrait in the Muggle Prime Minister's office. The permanent sticking charm makes if very difficult (if not impossible) to remove two things from each other once the charm has been performed.

Peskipiksi Pesternomi (Chamber of Secrets, page 102)
Etymology: Pesky - Pixie - Pester - No - Me = Pesky Pixie don't pester me.
This funny spell may very well have been made up by Lockhart on the spot. It didn't work but was meant to somehow subdue or immobilize the pixies Lockhart had let loose in his classroom.

Petrificus Totalus! (Sorcerer's Stone, page 273)
Etymology: L. Petra (rock) + totus (whole)
The Full-Body Bind (incantation: ""Petrificus Totalus!"") causes whoever it is cast upon to lose mobility. Rowling describes the effects of the spell best: ""Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board....Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.""

Point Me! (Goblet of Fire, page 622)
The Four-Point spell (incantation: ""Point Me!"") is used as a directional tool. When the caster places his or her wand in their open palm and utters the incantation, their wand will point north, allowing the caster to know what direction they are going.

Portus! (Order of the Phoenix, page 472)
Etymology: L. Porta (gate, entrance)
""Portus!"" is used to turn an object into a Portkey. Portkeys, first introduced in Goblet of Fire, are seemingly normal objects that transport those in direct physical contact with it to a certain place, usually at a prearranged time. Due to the dangers Portkeys present, authorization is required prior to using the spell. Some Portkeys can be made to transport those in direct physical contact to a certain place the moment they touch it rather than at a prearranged time. Presumably, any object can be turned into a Portkey.

Protean Charm (Order of the Phoenix, page 398)
Etymology: In Greek Mythology the sea-god Proteus possessed the ability to change form.
The protean charm changes the form of an object. Hermione places the charm on the coins the da use to communicate which enables them to know when to meet.

Priori Incantatem! (Goblet of Fire, page 136)
Etymology: L. Priori prius (former, prior)
The Reverse Spell effect (incantation: ""Priori Incantatem!"") causes a wand to regurgitate an echo of spells it has performed in reverse. When used in Goblet of Fire on a wand that had conjured the Dark Mark (see ""Morsmorde!""), a shadow of the gigantic serpent-tongued skull was emitted from the wand.

Protego! (Order of the Phoenix, page 803)
Etymology: L. Protego (to protect)
The Shield Charm (incantation: ""Protego!"") creates a sheild around the caster, protecting them from most harmful spells. Spells exist that can still cause damage to whoever it is cast upon even if The Shield Charm is in use, but the Charm usually saves someone from the worst of the spell cast upon them.

Quietus! (Goblet of Fire, page 116)
Etymology: L. Quies quietis (quiet, rest, peace)
""Quietus!"" is used to counter the effect of the spell ""Sonorus!"", which amplifies the voice of whoever it is cast upon. ""Quietus!"" merely makes the voice softer; it does not completely silence it. The spell ""Silencio!"" completely quiets one's voice.

Reducio! (Goblet of Fire, page 215)
Etymology: L. Reduco (to lead back, bring back, return)
""Reducio!"" causes solid objects it is cast upon to shrink. If ""Engorgio!"" has previously been cast on an object, ""Reducio!"" will cause it to reduce to its original size.

Reducto! (Order of the Phoenix, page 623)
Etymology: L. Reductus (to reduce)
The Reducto charm blasts away the target object.

Refilling charm
The refilling charm, obviously, refills a target container with a liquid determined by the castor.

Relashio! (Goblet of Fire, page 496)
Etymology: Unknown
""Relashio!"" presumably shoots sparks at someone; however, the only usage of the spell in the books was underwater. The underwater effect varies - it instead pelts a jet of boiling water at someone.

Rennervate! (Goblet of Fire, page 133)
Etymology: L. Re (Again) + novare (new) = to make new again
Rennervate revives those who have been stunned, passed out, or otherwise knocked unconscious.

Reparo! (Goblet of Fire, page 169)
Etymology: L. Reparo (to restore, renew)
""Reparo!"" does exactly what its Latin root suggests - fixes things that are broken. Examples in the Harry Potter books include fixing broken glass, broken china, broken jars, and broken cups. ""Reparo!"" only works on solid objects.

Reverse Gravity Mist (Goblet of Fire, page 643)
Possibly created by a spell the ""odd golden mist"" reverses the effects of gravity so that up is down and down is up; Though you are on the ground you feel as though you are upside-down.

Rictusempra! (Chamber of Secrets, page 192)
Etymology: L. Rideo risi risum (to laugh at, laugh) + simper (always)
The Tickling Charm (incantation: ""Rictusempra!"") causes whoever it is cast upon to start laughing uncontrollably. The effects of the charm can be stopped by the spell ""Finite Incanatem!""  When the Tickling Charm is cast, a jet of silver light comes out of the caster's wand and hits the victim.

Riddikulus! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 134)
Etymology: L. Ridiculus (facetious, laughable)
The spell ""Riddikulus!"" is used to get rid of a boggart. In order for the spell to work properly, the caster must envision the boggart as something that it finds amusing prior to casting the spell. The spell only turns the boggart into something humorous - what actually gets rid of a boggart is laughter.

Room-securing Spell (Goblet of Fire, page 469)
The room-securing spell secures a room (no suprise there!) by preventing intruders from entering. Snape uses this spell on his office and we are told that only a powerful wizard would be able to break the spell to enter.

Scourgify! (Order of the Phoenix, page 53)
Etymology: Unknown
""Scourgify!"" is used to clean. Examples from the fifth Harry Potter book include cleaning Hedwig the owl's cage and ridding a train compartment of a sticky substance called Stinksap. If cast on someone's mouth, the spell causes pink soap bubbles to stream from their mouth and froth to cover their lips, which chokes the victim.

Sectumsempra! (Half-Blood Prince, page 522)
Etymology: L. Sectus P. P. Secare (to cut) + simper (always)
Invented by Snape, the Half-Blood Prince, this dark spell slashes the victim multiple times leaving deep bleeding lacerations. With immediate treatment there is only, at worst, a bit of scarring, at best, no blemishes or disfigurement. It doesn't do much good on inferi, however.

Serpensortia! (Chamber of Secrets, page 194)
Etymology: L. Serpere (to creep [snake]) + English. Sort (type or kind)
""Serpensortia!"" causes a long black snake, poised to attack, shoot out of the caster's wand. It has only been used once throughout the Harry Potter series (see above reference).

Silencio! (Order of the Phoenix, page 375)
Etymology: L. Silens (silent, still)
The Silencing Charm (incantation: ""Silencio!"") causes whoever it is cast upon to lose the ability to make audible noises. A counter curse most likely exists (""Sonorus!"" would probably work), but whoever was affected by the spell, wizard or not, would be unable to utter the incantation for the counter curse. The charm works best with a sharp jab of the wand.

Sonorus! (Goblet of Fire, page 102)
Etymology: L. Sono (to make a noise, to sing)
""Sonorus!"" amplifies your voice in a way similar to that of the muggle ""microphone."" The spell ""Quietus!"" will bring the caster's voice back to normal.

Specialis Revelio! (Half-Blood Prince, page 193)
Etymology: L. Specialis, (kind) + revelatum (to unveil).
""Specialis Revelio!"" identifies the ingredients or enchantments in a potion or on a target object.

Stupefy! (Goblet of Fire, page 129)
Etymology: L. Stupefactus (stunned)
The Stunning Spell (incantation: ""Stupefy!"") stuns whoever it is cast upon, knocking them temporarily unconscious. The victim can be brought back to consciousness by the spell ""Ennervate!""  A normal Stunning Spell will not cause any damage to whoever it is cast upon, but many Stunners cast at once can cause long-term damage.

Tarantallegra! (Chamber of Secrets, page 192)
Etymology: Italian. Tarantella (a dance)
""Tarantallegra!"" causes the legs of whoever it is cast upon to jerk around out of control, in a kind of quickstep. The spell is used in the second and fifth Harry Potter books and can be stopped by the spell ""Finite Incantatem!""

Tergeo! (Half-Blood Prince, page 162)
Etymology: L. Tergeo (to wipe off)
""Tergeo!"" wipes up a target substance. Hermione uses this spell to clean the blood off Harry's face after Malfoy breaks his nose.

Toenail-growing Hex (Half-Blood Prince, page 238)
The hex causes the target's toenails to grow at an increasing rate. It is one of the many spells invented by Snape, the Half-Blood Prince.

Tripping Jinx (Order of the Phoenix, page 609)
The jinx trips the target. Malfoy uses this jinx on Harry when running away from the Room of Requirement.

Unbreakable charm (Goblet of Fire, page 728)
The charm makes an object unbreakable. Hermione uses this charm on the jar in which she traps the bug, Rita Skeeter.

Waddiwasi! (Prisoner of Azkaban, page 131)
Etymology: Unknown
The exact effects of the spell are unclear, but the following happened the only time it was used in the Harry Potter books (see above reference): ""With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril."" Professor Lupin cast the spell on the piece of chewing gum, which had been stuck in a keyhole by Peeves.

Wiggle and Twitchy ears Hex (Goblet of Fire, page 547)
Harry was hit by this hex in Defense Against the Dark Arts class; it causes the victim's ears to wiggle and twitch.

Wingardium Leviosa! (Sorcerer's Stone, page 171)
Etymology: L. Levo (to raise, lift up)
""Wingardium Leviosa!"" causes an object to levitate. Once the caster has an object in the air, it can be moved around with the caster's wand acting as a navigator."

The Virgin Mary was sleeping
When Angel Gabriel appeared.
He said, ""you are to be the virgin mother,""
And Mary thought that was weird.
[Mary said, ""I'm not a virgin
I blew a guy last year""]
But then, Gabriel said to Mary,
""My child, have no fear:

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still not be considered flawed.
[Though, Mary, you went to town,
and sucked some semen down,]
You're still still a virgin
In the eyes of god!""

There was no room at the Inn
When Mary and Joseph did arrive.
They were so very tired, you see,
[and Mary had to offer him a bribe.]
Said she had no money,
[and they had no place to sleep.]
Gabriel appeared to Mary,
And told her not to weep.

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be the mother of Christ.
If there's no room at the Inn,
then it's not considered a sin
[to suck a dick to get a room for free!""]

That's right

And three wisemen did appear
Bearing gifts of myrrh and such.
They said that they had followed a star,
And missed a woman's touch.
[Mary thought that she might pleasure them,
But could not take them to bed.]
But, again, Gabriel appeared to her
And this is what he said

[""You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
Everyone in the nation.
[Fellatio ain't no sin,
So go and blow those three wise men!]
And you'll still be a virgin,
['Cause there ain't no penetration!""]

[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary!
[The donkey, or the ox and the lamb]
And even the little drummer boy.
Folks will remember your name quick!
[They'll say, ""Damn, that bitch can suck a dick""!]
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.

[Mary, you can suck my dick!]"
